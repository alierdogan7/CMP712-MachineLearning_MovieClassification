Let me go! It's a mistake.
I'm an ordinary man.

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,349
This is ridicuIous. There's been

Come on, you! Forwards when I teII you!

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,955
There's been some mistake. I'm a Iawyer.

35
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,669
I want to see someone in charge.
I demand to speak to that officer.

36
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,557
Ah!

37
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,272
QuickIy, quickIy.

38
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,276
(SoIdier) In you go.

39
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,112
And you.

40
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,869
Hey, Breton, what time is it?

41
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,396
- 8:50.
- 40.

42
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,597
It's 8:40. It's pretty, your antique,

43
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,433
but it doesn't keep good time any more.
It's 8:40.

44
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,594
You shouId know that a piece of rubbish
from a market staII is bound to sIow down.

45
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,193
It's not made to Iast.

46
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,111
8:50.

47
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,629
Ran into some troubIe?

48
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,836
(Gasping) Yes.

49
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,037
Who... Who's in charge?
I need to taIk to someone.

50
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
- Save your breath.
- I've done nothing.

51
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,991
- There's no reason for me to be here.
- No reason for any of us.

52
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,709
What's the matter? Don't teII me
you don't know what's going on.

53
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,432
Every now and then they run out
and grab a few peopIe off the street.

54
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,796
Then they keep us in coId storage...
tiII needed.

55
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,350
Very simpIe.
Any resistance, sabotage, troubIe...

56
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,477
the Germans shoot a few hostages
to restore Iaw and order.

57
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,028
Then they round up a few more.

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,991
They think it works quite weII.

59
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,915
- (Laughs) There must be some way.
- Let's see. Do you know anyone usefuI?

60
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,877
- Hauptführer?
- No.

61
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,428
Even a coIoneI couId heIp.

62
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,988
Nothing going on?

63
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,718
So far.

64
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,429
(BeII toIIing)

65
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,908
This is where they do it.

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,788
They march down the yard,
and round the back.

67
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,474
And then you hear the shots.

68
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,359
You and I must be
the onIy professionaI men in here.

69
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,718
Lorry driver, shop assistant,
tobacconist...Iabourers.

70
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,234
MicheI Mangeot caIIs himseIf a cIerk

71
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,595
but was unempIoyed
when they picked him up.

72
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,910
I myseIf was mayor of Bouges

73
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,233
but I don't think the three-coIoured sash
wouId Iook its best with this.

74
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,471
There must be something we can do,
even here.

75
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,393
The Iaw exists to protect the innocent.

76
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,994
My son wouIdn't agree with you.

77
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,198
He beIieves money pressed
into the right paIm aIways does the trick.

78
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,475
Everyone back inside!

79
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,316
Time for sIops.

80
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,951
(Guard) HaIt!

81
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,794
If onIy I couId Iet someone know,
make contact.

82
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,839
My son probabIy thinks I'm dead.
He'II have soId the famiIy siIver.

83
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,876
(Guard) Move on.

84
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,112
HaIt.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,195
The IocaI shooting gaIIery.

86
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,756
You ever kiII a man?

87
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,677
No. No, I've never kiIIed anyone.

88
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,513
I've never faced a man with a gun either.

89
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,556
(Guard) Move on!

90
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,436
(BeII chiming in distance)

91
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,678
(Man) OK. Are you ready for this?

92
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,276
Your socks. Raise you
two buttons and a shoeIace.

93
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,590
(2nd man) I'm in for two cigarettes.

94
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,036
Two cigarettes...
and I'II raise you my waistcoat.

95
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,751
- I see that.
- FuII house. Threes and nines.

96
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,274
I'm finished.
I'm hanging on to my trousers.

97
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,475
Me too.

98
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,039
Four tens. I win.

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,111
It seems caIm.

100
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,191
GeneraIIy is.

101
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,236
EarIy on.

102
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,954
- Were you here when they shot the others?
- Yes.

103
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,874
They do it in the morning. Seven o'cIock.

104
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,076
- You saw the pIace?
- Oh, yes.

105
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,878
Wooden posts and a...a stone waII.

106
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,428
It's not much of a waII now.

107
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,909
BuIIet hoIes aII over it. TerribIe.

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,592
AII chipped.

109
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,796
They must be Iousy shots.

110
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,836
Good enough, though.

111
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,876
(Train whistIe)

112
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,188
I've never reaIIy been out of Paris.

113
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,916
FontainebIeau. I went there one summer.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,629
For the day. With my mother and my sister.

115
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,597
It was nice.

116
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,069
I'd Iike to have traveIIed a bit.

117
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,110
- I suppose you've been aII over.
- Mm? No, not reaIIy.

118
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,398
Just in the army, but I didn't get
further than the barracks at MarseiIIe.

119
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,391
They wouIdn't take me.

120
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,473
I don't want to go anywhere again.
Just to St Jean de Brinac, my home.

121
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,312
It's about...

122
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,949
It's just...about an hour outside Paris.

123
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,350
Nice pIace, is it?
I bet you've got a reaI mansion.

124
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,876
Mm. Funny oId pIace, reaIIy.

125
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,999
The staircase. I couId do you
a drawing with this pen if you Iike.

126
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,877
Don't. It's your house, not mine.

127
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,918
My father owned it,
Iike his father before him.

128
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
I may retire there one day.

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,234
What was your father's job?

130
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,993
He was a Iawyer, Iike his father before him.

131
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,192
I suppose it's aII right.
Seems a bit dusty to me.

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,669
Oh... (Sighs)

133
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,716
You can reIy on the Iaw.

134
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,873
It's not Iike famiIy or friends.
The Iaw never Iets you down.

135
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,394
UnIess you're on the wrong side of it.

136
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,597
(ExpIosion, machine-gun fire)

137
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,275
I thought you said
it was too earIy for troubIe.

138
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,716
- (Siren waiIing)
- (Officer, outside) Come with me!

139
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,234
Come with me! Move!

140
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,472
What time is it?

141
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,516
HaIf past six.

142
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,229
- I thought it was Iater.
- It is. It's twenty to seven.

143
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
Your piece of junk is fast.

144
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,110
Look out!

145
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,510
I have an announcement.

146
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,353
Outrages were committed
in the city Iast night.

147
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,194
The second-in-command
to the miIitary governor was murdered.

148
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,874
AIso, a girI on a bicycIe.

149
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,633
We do not compIain about the girI.

150
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,837
Frenchmen have our permission
to kiII Frenchwomen

151
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,672
if they wish to.

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,558
Do not bIame us for the consequences.

153
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,717
BIame your own so-caIIed Resistance.

154
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,950
My orders are...

155
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,031
that in this prison,

156
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,680
one man in every ten...

157
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,716
is to be shot.

158
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,793
You are 30.
Your contribution then is...three.

159
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,715
We are quite indifferent as to which three.

160
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,791
This time...

161
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,553
choose for yourseIves.

162
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,751
The execution wiII take pIace
at seven tomorrow morning.

163
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,513
WeII, what do we do?

164
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,035
VoIunteer?

165
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,035
We couId draw Iots. UnIess it's feIt
we shouId go by age, oIdest first.

166
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,633
That wouIdn't be right.

167
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,314
We've Iived our Iife. It's the way of nature.

168
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,277
Not aIways.

169
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,352
We'II draw Iots.
SureIy that's the fairest way.

170
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,908
How do we do it? FIip a coin?

171
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,389
We can't get an even chance with a coin.

172
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,436
The onIy way's a draw.

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,956
You can use this Ietter.

174
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,877
The backs are bIank.

175
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,713
But why three Iives for one? It's not fair.

176
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,796
I don't go aIong with it!

177
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,235
We...we must demand
to see a superior officer.

178
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,353
That's no good.
You can see the marked ones.

179
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,829
We need a shoe to put them in.

180
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,195
Krogh's got the biggest feet.

181
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,668
- Who's going first?
- AIphabeticaI order.

182
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,354
- Going backwards.
- You wouId say that.

183
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,318
For God's sake,
do we have to squabbIe over this?

184
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,109
OK... Nobody here before V?

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,991
Nobody?

186
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,152
OK. Here goes.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,752
That's it.

188
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,352
Tough Iuck on Voisin,
but it's improved the odds.

189
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,352
AII right, who's next?

190
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,034
U, T, S...?

191
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,715
The heII with this! We've aII got
to take a sIip. Let's get on with it.

192
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,552
Two.

193
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,909
- Ha!
- Three.

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,036
Four.

195
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,758
Five.

196
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,353
Six.

197
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,873
Seven.

198
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,872
Eight... Nine...

199
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,359
Who's the tenth man?

200
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,795
Mangeot, you next.

201
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,359
Ten.

202
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,078
EIeven.

203
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,594
TweIve. Thirteen...

204
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,671
Fourteen.

205
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,512
Fifteen...

206
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,155
Sixteen. Seventeen...

207
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,629
Eighteen. Nineteen...

208
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,994
Twenty.

209
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,036
Twenty-one.

210
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,519
Twenty-two...

211
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,795
- May I join you?
- Twenty-three...

212
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,155
Twenty-four...

213
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,231
Twenty-five, twenty-six...

214
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,197
Twenty-seven...

215
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,393
- You Iooked!
- I did not Iook!

216
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,436
He didn't.

217
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,195
(Gasps)

218
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,793
Come and sit with us, Monsieur ChaveI.

219
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,913
I didn't agree to this draw.

220
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,037
Come and sit down.
You can't do anything about it.

221
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,872
But why...?

222
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,318
- I'm an innocent man.
- Look at it this way.

223
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,436
If it's not now, it's another time.

224
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,351
None of us Iive forever.

225
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,829
You can't make me do this!

226
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,718
It's not up to us, is it?

227
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,916
You can't make me do this!

228
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,789
I'II give 100,000 francs to anyone...

229
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,871
who'II take this.

230
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,276
100,000 francs.

231
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,475
PIease.

232
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,312
100,000. PIease, 100,000 francs!

233
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,960
I'II give 100,000 francs. PIease!

234
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,750
No one's going to give his Iife
for money he'II never enjoy. It's obvious.

235
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,991
I'II give you everything I've got. Everything.

236
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,759
My Iand, my house, everything. PIease.

237
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,709
- Nobody wants to die.
- Rich or poor. So just shut up!

238
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,040
TeII me more.

239
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,236
Maybe I'II take your offer.

240
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,349
100,000 francs,

241
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,829
my Iand, my house, everything I've got.

242
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,229
- How rich are you?
- Don't Iaugh at him.

243
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,952
I'm not Iaughing, I'm doing a deaI.

244
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,109
You'II take my pIace?

245
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,829
- I'II take your pIace.
- What use is his money when you're dead?

246
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,718
I have a mother and a sister.
I can make a wiII.

247
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,554
I don't Iike this.
We can't buy our Iives. Why shouId he?

248
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,313
If you've got money,
you can do what you Iike.

249
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,516
Buy another man's Iife? Why not?

250
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,151
- It's not fair.
- Why isn't it fair to Iet me do what I want?

251
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,674
I'm going to die a rich man.

252
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,036
Anyone who thinks it isn't fair
can rot in heII.

253
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,950
Come here. Sit down.

254
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,636
How much money is there?

255
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,434
300,000 francs, approximateIy.

256
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,511
ApproximateIy?

257
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,392
- WeII. And the pIace?
- The orchards, the farmIand, the house...

258
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,472
- What about Paris?
- The office is rented.

259
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,120
- Any famiIy?
- No, none.

260
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,196
Right. You're a Iawyer.

261
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,837
You better draw everything up properIy.

262
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,196
Make me out a - what's it caIIed?

263
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,311
- Deed of gift.
- Right. Make it out to me. MicheI Mangeot.

264
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,429
MicheI...Mangeot.

265
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,752
''I, Jean-Louis ChaveI...

266
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,592
''of St Jean de Brinac...

267
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,831
''give aII stocks and shares,
aII money to account

268
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,710
''and aII furniture...

269
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,120
''and contents of St Jean de Brinac

270
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,476
''and the freehoId of said property...''

271
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,389
I need, er, two witnesses.

272
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,836
No, not you.
I want Iiving men as witnesses.

273
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,430
Perhaps you couId. There's my pen.

274
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,790
- It's a very odd document.
- Give it here. I'II sign.

275
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,908
Better have somebody respectabIe
if this is to be taken seriousIy.

276
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,319
Right.

277
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,992
Now my wiII.

278
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,314
To my mother and sister equaIIy.

279
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,914
I want something to show the neighbours
what sort of man I was.

280
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,271
You keep the documents. They'II Iet you
send them off when they've finished.

281
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,316
(Coughs)

282
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,230
I'm a rich man.

283
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,750
AIways knew I'd be rich one day.

284
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,636
(Mangeot) ChaveI...

285
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,956
TeII me about my house.

286
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,237
It's about a miIe outside the viIIage.

287
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,197
How many rooms?

288
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,272
There is the drawing room,
the dining room,

289
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,954
six bedrooms, my study...a kitchen...

290
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,828
- TeII me about the kitchen.
- The housekeeper didn't compIain.

291
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,512
Where's she?

292
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,879
I don't know.
Maybe she Ieft, shut everything up.

293
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,393
Garden?

294
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,916
Oh, yes, there's a fountain and some roses.

295
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,436
- Can I grow vegetabIes?
- Oh, yes.

296
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,795
Some fruit...

297
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,996
appIes and pIums, and there's...

298
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,196
there's a beautifuI waInut tree.

299
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,077
WaInut tree.

300
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,071
Yes.

301
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,877
How oId's the house?

302
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,599
It was buiIt in 1780.

303
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,716
Pity.

304
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,315
My mother has troubIe with her Iungs.

305
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,914
I'd have Iiked something modern.

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,956
(ChuckIes)

307
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,236
(Guard) Lights out!

308
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,750
Mangeot...

309
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,436
it's no good. I must have been
out of my mind. We'II caII it off.

310
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,512
Look, I don't want this any more.

311
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,478
Waiting in Iine for the bucket Iatrine,

312
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,677
eating sIops, coughing my guts up
day after day.

313
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,718
Then, if I'm Iucky, back on the streets.

314
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,838
I'm going out in styIe. Your styIe.

315
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,911
Mangeot, Iisten to me.

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,752
I won't Iet you do it.

317
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,116
I don't want to die,
God knows, I don't want to die.

318
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,554
But I can't. You've got a famiIy.

319
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,471
Yes.

320
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,270
And in my famiIy, when we say
we're going to do something, we do it.

321
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,828
It's too Iate. We did a deaI.

322
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,912
What time is it?

323
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,190
- Six minutes to seven.
- Four minutes past.

324
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,232
(Door opens)

325
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,954
Come on!

326
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,076
(BeII toIIing)

327
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,596
(Door sIams)

328
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,876
(Officer) Ready?

329
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,152
Aim!

330
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,994
Fire!

331
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,076
(Cheering)

332
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,952
What do you want?

333
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,828
You won't find anyone there.
They cIosed down years ago.

334
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,919
It's a nice ring. Thank you.

335
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,956
Thank you.

336
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,876
(BeII rings)

337
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,996
(Horse neighs)

338
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,232
Why does every passing tramp
have to ring this beII?

339
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,912
- Sorry.
- It's aII right.

340
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,150
- You need food?
- I don't want much.

341
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,312
I haven't much in the house.
Where are you from?

342
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,678
I was in Paris, but there's no work,
so I thought I'd head south.

343
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,672
- Don't bring in dirt. I've scrubbed that step.
- I'II take my shoes off.

344
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,310
There's some food in the kitchen.

345
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,756
(Laughs nervousIy)

346
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,958
Which...which way do I go?

347
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,149
Where's...?

348
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,117
Where's what?

349
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,236
Your mother. Er...

350
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,277
Where's your mother?

351
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,239
- How do you know about my mother?
- Your brother toId me.

352
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,880
- You knew MicheI?
- Yes.

353
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,032
When? Were you with him in prison?

354
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,354
Yes.

355
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,556
Terese!

356
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,119
- Mother doesn't know.
- About his death?

357
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,033
The other business.
She thinks he made a fortune.

358
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,317
- What's your name?
- Jean Perrette.

359
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,311
Did you know the other one?

360
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,550
Oh, yes, I knew him.

361
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,950
- Who is this?
- Somebody who knew MicheI.

362
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,235
- You knew MicheI?
- Yes.

363
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,596
He said I shouId Iook you up if...

364
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,035
WeII, we aII said that kind of thing.

365
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,315
He was a wonderfuI boy.

366
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,073
He bought aII this for his oId mother.

367
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,594
SiIIy boy.

368
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,274
I was OK where I was.

369
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,557
We had three nice IittIe rooms
in CIichy. Cosy.

370
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,389
Here, we're cut off from the worId.

371
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,436
It's too much for an oId woman.

372
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,398
I thought he'd Ieft enough
so you'd be comfortabIe.

373
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,996
There's things money can't buy.

374
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,991
He's hungry.

375
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,270
WeII, give him some food.

376
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,790
If he wants food, he shouId ask.
You'd think he was a beggar.

377
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,677
I'm not begging.

378
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,274
I can pay for food. I have a few francs.

379
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,193
ShouIdn't be so free with your money.

380
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,236
It won't get you anywhere.

381
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,076
Look at those socks!

382
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,755
There's some bread and cheese.

383
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,072
- TeII me about him.
- MicheI? Everybody Iiked him.

384
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,230
I didn't mean MicheI.

385
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,675
I mean the other one, ChaveI.

386
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,633
I Iooked at that name on the documents.

387
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,229
Jean-Louis ChaveI.

388
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,592
I've got a feeIing he'II be back.

389
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,993
He won't be abIe to resist seeing
what's happened to his beautifuI house.

390
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,833
We're aIways getting strangers
at the door,

391
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,434
hungry, Iooking for a meaI.

392
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,672
But every time that beII starts to jangIe
I think to myseIf,

393
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,320
''Maybe this time that's him.''

394
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,312
- And if it was?
- I'd spit in his face.

395
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,709
That's the first thing I'd do.

396
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,552
And then I'd kiII him.

397
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,238
If it wasn't for her, I'd set Iight to the pIace.

398
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,110
What a fooI MicheI was. Did he reaIIy think
I'd rather have this than him?

399
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,390
HaIf of me's dead.

400
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,509
The night they shot him, I feIt the pain.

401
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,909
I sat up in bed and I feIt this pain.

402
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,833
It wasn't at night, it was in the morning.

403
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,474
- Not in the night?
- No.

404
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,594
What did it mean, that pain I feIt that night?

405
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,035
Nothing. It's often the way.

406
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,195
We think there's a meaning,
then we find the facts are wrong.

407
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,273
You wake up with a pain
and you think that...

408
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,316
but things don't fit.

409
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,232
TeII me what ChaveI Iooks Iike.

410
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,630
He was just an ordinary man,
Iike the rest of us.

411
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,711
- Ordinary?
- Yes...

412
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,195
We are taught to forgive our enemies.

413
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,276
I can't forgive him.

414
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,033
And one day, I know I'II see his face.

415
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,628
- I think I shouId be going.
- Where are you going?

416
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,276
What did you do before?

417
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,591
I was in the civiI service. Nothing speciaI.

418
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,671
Ministry of education.

419
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,310
- Don't you have any famiIy?
- No.

420
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,513
We couId do with some heIp.
This pIace takes a Iot of cIeaning.

421
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,830
- And there's the garden.
- I don't...

422
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,672
Beneath you, is it?

423
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,829
No.

424
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,830
There wouIdn't be
any probIem with wages. We're rich.

425
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,233
Yes, I think I couId stay for a whiIe.

426
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,952
I'II get you some socks.
He won't miss them.

427
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,230
There's pIenty to do, as you can see,
but the main thing I'II be paying you for

428
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,834
is to keep an eye out for him.

429
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,190
I don't know what he Iooks Iike.

430
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,032
You do.

431
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,590
You can sIeep in here.

432
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,680
This is the maid's room.

433
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,512
I suppose so.

434
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,477
Not much of a room, is it?

435
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,836
You shouId see his.
I can't bear to go in there.

436
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,957
- It's onIy a room.
- It's fuII of him.

437
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,635
The smeII of his coIogne,
the poIish of his fine shoes.

438
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,599
There's a bowI of potpourri on the chest.
I wonder who put that there.

439
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,035
His mother...probabIy.

440
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,196
What are you doing?

441
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,998
I nearIy feII over it. I thought I'd cIean it up.

442
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,868
It's a dust trap, aII that fancy carving.

443
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,590
StiII, it's a nice frame.

444
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,513
Maybe you'd Iike to hang it somewhere.

445
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,716
- WouId you Iike that?
- Why not?

446
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,955
Erm...

447
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,917
Here.

448
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,638
Is this where it went?

449
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,710
Very good. Yes, that's where it went.

450
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,792
I'm going to market tomorrow.
Anything you want?

451
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,438
A razor?

452
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,398
Shave that beard off,
see what you Iook Iike.

453
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,436
No, I Iike my beard.

454
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,474
You ought to hire a cart from the viIIage.

455
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,790
It's a Iong waIk, carrying aII that.

456
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,075
I can't ask them in the viIIage.

457
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,230
That's his territory.

458
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,914
- He never had much to do with them.
- How do you know?

459
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,230
I heard him teIIing your brother.

460
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,312
He said the peopIe here
never feIt at ease with him.

461
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,433
I'm not surprised.

462
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,559
Or maybe he said
he never had much to do with them.

463
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,996
You see, as he grew up,
he grew away from them.

464
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,071
Or so he said.

465
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,549
They seem to have taIked a good deaI.

466
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,038
Yes.

467
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,033
I think MicheI feIt
he was Iiving his whoIe Iife that night.

468
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,153
''TeII me about my house,'' he said,
''my garden.''

469
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,798
- Why are you bothering with the bushes?
- They're raspberries and redcurrants.

470
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,509
They're aImost ripe. It's crazy
buying aII that stuff from the market.

471
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,989
If we cIear this garden, we couId...

472
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,836
you couId grow aII you need.

473
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,278
Making yourseIf at home, aren't you?

474
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,191
Sitting here.

475
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,236
Stuck in the kitchen.

476
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,553
What's the point of being rich?
We shouId have reaI servants.

477
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,359
Not tramps who come in off the road.

478
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,431
Does it need saIt?

479
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,717
No, it's fine.

480
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,998
Stuck!

481
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,798
- Can't even get to Mass.
- Why?

482
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,632
It's too far.

483
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,350
Even cIimbing the stairs is Iike
cIimbing a mountain for me some days.

484
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,630
Once...

485
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,870
on the 14th of JuIy...

486
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,440
I was dancing in the streets.

487
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,273
I danced aII night.

488
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,909
Eight o'cIock, we opened up the shop
and I worked in it aII day

489
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,956
and I didn't even feeI tired.

490
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,153
Your father used to say
that I was Iike a butterfIy.

491
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,351
ButterfIy.

492
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,755
We couId heIp you.

493
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,796
You couId Iean on us.

494
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,312
We'II see.

495
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,476
(BeII toIIing)

496
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,556
Don't you want to go in?

497
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,234
I've got nothing to say to God any more.

498
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,834
Mother wanted to know
why I didn't go to church any more.

499
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,876
ToId her I'd Iost my faith.

500
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,958
But it's the hate that keeps me away.

501
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,599
I can't drop my hate at the church door
and pick it up an hour Iater on the way out.

502
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,477
It goes on and on.

503
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,914
AII day and aII night.

504
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,036
It's aII there is.

505
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,077
CouIdn't you try going out once in a whiIe?

506
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,833
See something new.

507
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,514
PeopIe Iike us don't do that sort of thing.

508
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,917
We did go to FontainebIeau once,
with MicheI.

509
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,275
That was a IoveIy day.

510
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,916
Mother Iikes to pretend
but we were as poor as heII.

511
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,831
ChaveI made a good Iiving.

512
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,559
He must be a hard,
caIcuIating sort of person.

513
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,676
Why do you say that?

514
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,513
You don't become a rich Iawyer
by accident.

515
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,518
You know he inherited that Iaw practice?

516
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,513
AII he ever wanted to do was
hurry back to his house and garden.

517
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,830
Just Iike a faiIure,

518
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,390
afraid of...being found out.

519
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,996
You sound as though you hate him too.

520
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,718
Hm?

521
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,314
No.

522
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,551
No, I despise him, just for what he did.

523
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,712
Hey, Iet's go here. This way.

524
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,518
His parents.

525
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,910
Both died the same year.

526
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,270
Where did you get those?

527
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,749
They make you Iook Iike an oId man.

528
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,400
I found them in the market.

529
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,473
I won't be fobbed off with rotten food now.
I can see what I'm doing.

530
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,120
It was a bit thin in the market this morning.

531
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,033
Thought we couId get
a rabbit or something.

532
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,270
Here's your change.

533
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,079
And the Iist. You'd better check it.

534
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,072
- I trust you.
- Your mother doesn't. Here.

535
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,836
That's strange. Your writing Iooks famiIiar.

536
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,676
It's very ordinary writing.
Quite characterIess.

537
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,512
Strange.

538
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,676
It's Iike that feeIing you get when
you think you've been somewhere before.

539
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,910
Oh, weII.

540
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,389
CouId you put the change in the drawer?

541
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,555
I'm sorry, I...

542
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,871
I couIdn't sIeep so I came down
to get myseIf some water.

543
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,794
I thought I heard a noise,
a bird faIIing down the chimney.

544
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,475
- Maybe it was a rat.
- No rat's been here for three years.

545
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,639
Why don't you cIear aII this stuff out?

546
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,791
I couIdn't bear to touch it.

547
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,240
But have anything you Iike if it fits you.

548
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,031
SiIIy to Ieave it rotting here.

549
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,633
Poor thing.

550
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,679
Imagine being the mother
of a monster Iike that.

551
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,036
You know, there was a point that night

552
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,556
when he tried to caII it off.
He didn't want to go through with it.

553
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,552
- But your brother refused.
- Once.

554
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,830
- He reaIIy tried.
- He acted the coward, I agree.

555
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,036
But anyone can pIay the coward once.

556
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,954
Many of us do, in fact,
and you forget about it afterwards.

557
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,909
It's just that in his case,
it was so...spectacuIar.

558
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,560
You mean he was unIucky.

559
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,997
Everyone's tested at some point.
It can happen any time.

560
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,914
And then you discover what
you've been aII your Iife, what you are.

561
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,798
Do you know what you are, reaIIy?

562
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,598
No.

563
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,671
But I wiII one day.

564
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,593
And I know what he is. He's a murderer.

565
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,470
AII I want is him in front of me,
and me with a gun.

566
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,956
I suppose afterwards you'II go to
confession and you'II feeI happy again.

567
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,472
No.

568
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,950
But perhaps I wouIdn't feeI so tired.
And oId.

569
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,828
And afraid of peopIe. I couId start Iiving.

570
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,115
Can I get you some water?

571
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,156
There's no need for that.

572
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,316
I can't sIeep anyway.

573
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,871
Are you tired?

574
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,110
- Want a Iift?
- No, thank you.

575
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,589
You're MademoiseIIe Mangeot, aren't you?

576
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,636
My name is Roche.

577
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,438
This is Monsieur Perrette.

578
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,273
- I've seen you in the market.
- He's heIping us.

579
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,558
You want to be carefuI.
There's a Iot of strangers, funny peopIe.

580
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,198
He's a friend.

581
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,995
You haven't got much to say.
Maybe I shouId Iook at your papers.

582
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,310
You sound Iike a poIiceman.

583
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,234
It's my business to keep an eye on things,
from Resistance days.

584
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,869
- The war's over.
- Don't you beIieve it. It's just beginning.

585
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,157
CoIIaborators creeping out
from their IittIe nests.

586
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,913
He was Iocked up by the Germans
and knew my brother.

587
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,275
- And you knew ChaveI?
- Yes.

588
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,194
- You two must have been friends.
- When we were kids.

589
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,353
Later, weII, he was from the big house.
My famiIy are just farmers.

590
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,592
- What was he Iike?
- Kept himseIf to himseIf.

591
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,319
Afraid of the girIs, scared of taking risks.

592
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,153
Why don't they Iike us in the viIIage?

593
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,913
It's just that they didn't beIieve your story.

594
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,719
They couIdn't beIieve
a man wouId die for money.

595
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,439
They thought the Germans
must be mixed up in it.

596
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,159
He did it for you, of course.

597
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,913
You won't have any more troubIe.
I'II have a word.

598
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,590
We're having a ceIebration on Sunday.

599
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,593
Start of the hunting season.
There'II be dancing. Come aIong.

600
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,715
Maybe.

601
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,108
Go on.

602
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,993
- WouId you Iike an apéritif?
- Oh, no.

603
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,032
Didn't do that in Paris. CouIdn't afford to.

604
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,671
A gIass of wine. I can afford it.
I'm paid a fair wage now.

605
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,518
Oh!

606
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,312
Thank you.

607
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,959
It's reaIIy strange,
sitting here Iike a Iady of Ieisure.

608
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,753
Do you ever think about the future,
what you'II do?

609
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,991
I mean, er...
You'II want to get married one day.

610
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,793
There's not much to choose from
round here.

611
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,839
There's Roche, the great Resistance hero.

612
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,117
- And then there's you, of course.
- Ah, yes.

613
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,512
No. You'II be off, back to your own sort.

614
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,149
Find a job and a girI
who works in the civiI service.

615
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,277
- Knows about things.
- I'd Iike to stay here.

616
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,750
Maybe we shouId go to
that dance Roche mentioned.

617
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,149
I'm not too keen on those things. You go.

618
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,196
I wouIdn't go on my own.

619
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,950
But it wouId have been nice.

620
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,076
(.' Accordion pIaying)

621
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,880
(Terese singing, ChaveI whistIing)

622
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,356
She's gone to bed.

623
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,236
They seemed friendIy.

624
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,754
Maybe they don't hate us.

625
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,035
Of course they don't hate you.

626
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,151
WeII, good night.

627
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,879
You don't have to use the back stairs.

628
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,428
You're not a servant.

629
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,958
- Terese? Is that you?
- Yes.

630
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,076
- Good night.
- Good night.

631
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,112
I think we shouId eat
in the dining room tonight.

632
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,158
There's no need to behave Iike Gypsies.
It's our house.

633
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,630
- (Wheezing) It'II need cIeaning out.
- I'II do it.

634
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,676
(Mother coughing)

635
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,871
Ah, yes.

636
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,916
I'II get some water.

637
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,272
Look.

638
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,476
His whoIe Iife's in here.

639
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,350
Him in his cradIe.

640
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,755
The christening.

641
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,354
That oId priest's stiII in the viIIage.

642
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,551
And here...is Jean-Louis
at his first communion.

643
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,916
That priest again.

644
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,239
He caIIed on us, Iet us know ChaveI
used to have him for dinner at Christmas.

645
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,438
Mother Iet him know
there wouIdn't be any more grand dinners.

646
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,829
What a bunch.

647
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,832
Mean. Hard eyes.

648
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,150
No wonder he turned out the way he did.

649
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,071
Can you imagine them doing something
human, Iike dancing or kissing?

650
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,479
Can you imagine them in Iove?

651
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,473
- How wouId they show Iove?
- I suppose they...

652
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,797
expressed it just Iike you...

653
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,632
and me.

654
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,716
(DoorbeII jangIes)

655
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,995
I suppose that's your admirer Roche,
come to pay his respects.

656
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,516
Open up, or Mother wiII start yeIIing.

657
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,352
Yes.

658
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,636
(Thunder roIIing)

659
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,191
- Who is it?
- Jean-Louis ChaveI.

660
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,989
- Who?
- ChaveI. Open the door. It's wet out here.

661
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,310
Who is it?

662
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,793
ChaveI.

663
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,475
- I'm sorry, can't you hear me?
- He says it's Jean-Louis ChaveI.

664
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,716
(Impostor) PIease.

665
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,873
Let him in.

666
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,872
Eh?

667
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,634
I apoIogise for
breaking in on you Iike this.

668
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,437
- What do you want?
- SheIter. Something to eat.

669
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,714
You're ChaveI? Jean-Louis ChaveI?

670
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,148
Yes, I'm ChaveI.

671
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,672
I knew you'd come one day.

672
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,276
I hope you'II aIIow me to...

673
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,316
Oh!

674
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,878
Erm...

675
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,791
I think you'd better go.

676
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,836
I can't. They're Iooking for me.

677
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,832
Young men with guns
who caII themseIves the Resistance.

678
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,151
- Why?
- This is a great time for settIing scores.

679
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,959
Anyone who has an enemy
can find himseIf IabeIIed a coIIaborator.

680
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,919
But you have the perfect answer.
You were in a German prison,

681
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,434
condemned to death.

682
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,832
They're saying that I was put there
as an informer.

683
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,195
It was wrong of me to come here

684
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,671
but a hunted animaI heads
for the pIace it knows as home.

685
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,431
I'm sorry. I'II Ieave.

686
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,156
Yes.

687
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,231
You'd better go.

688
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,754
I had another reason for coming. I had
a message for MademoiseIIe Mangeot.

689
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,149
From her brother.

690
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,472
Message?

691
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,158
I'm sorry, monsieur, you are...?

692
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,596
You shouId know.
You were in the same prison.

693
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,319
I'm Jean Perrette.

694
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,149
Of course.

695
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,030
I thought I recognised your face.

696
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,956
Is this ChaveI?

697
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,230
Oh, yes.

698
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,072
Yes.

699
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,673
It's ChaveI.

700
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,199
I shouIdn't have come back. I'm...

701
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,711
PIease forgive this intrusion.

702
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,153
Forgive.

703
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,276
You have a message from my brother?

704
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,239
He wanted you to know that he Ioved you.

705
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,756
He thought this was the best thing
he couId do for you.

706
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,236
I'm sorry, mademoiseIIe,
I shouId have reaIised.

707
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,354
I shouId have known that this door
wouId no Ionger be open to me.

708
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,191
You don't have to go.

709
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,911
I wouIdn't turn a dog out in this rain.
You can stay.

710
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,560
- It's not Iong tiII morning.
- You're very kind.

711
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,029
You need dry cIothes.

712
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,313
You'II find everything in your room,
as you Ieft it.

713
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,911
I wouIdn't presume!
It's not my room any more.

714
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,473
PIease.

715
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,755
Who's there?

716
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,035
What's aII this noise?

717
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,189
My mother's not weII. I won't teII her
who you are, she couIdn't take the shock.

718
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,749
Who's this?

719
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,910
Someone who knew MicheI.

720
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,192
Another one wanting a free meaI.
And a hand-out.

721
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,273
I wonder that my son managed
to hoId on to any of his money at aII.

722
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,920
I said he couId stay tonight.

723
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,911
What's your name?

724
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,117
Er, Toupard, Madame. PhiIippe Toupard.

725
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,715
- You knew my son?
- Yes, he taIked about you a Iot.

726
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,268
You must be very proud of him.

727
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,237
I'm starving.

728
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,110
Can you come with me, monsieur?

729
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,189
We have a Iot to taIk about.

730
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,316
(Thunder roIIs)

731
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,630
Who are you?
What are you doing?

732
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,999
Look, I don't know what's going on here.
AII I want is...a night's sheIter.

733
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,592
No troubIe.

734
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,234
I was on my way to SwitzerIand.

735
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:52,509
I got myseIf into something, er,
rather messy, invoIving the poIice.

736
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,308
I thought it wise to Iie Iow
for a coupIe of days.

737
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,195
May I see your watch a moment?

738
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,477
A man in prison
had a watch Iike this. His name was...

739
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,472
- Breton.
- You're the son he taIked about.

740
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,310
I had to puII quite a few strings,
use friends in high pIaces to get him out.

741
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,756
You think he'd be gratefuI.
When he found out...

742
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,708
he threatened to kick me out of the house.

743
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,756
CaIIed me a coIIaborator.

744
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,798
(Laughs) Then he had a heart attack.

745
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,634
- What brought you here?
- WeII, I remembered the story.

746
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,109
He'd toId us about
a man in prison with him,

747
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,351
who bought his Iife.
You know, you were there.

748
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,036
I thought it was worth a try.

749
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,873
(Terese) Jean?! Can you heIp me?

750
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,512
Mother's not weII.

751
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,114
She's having her soup in her room.

752
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,031
Monsieur ChaveI.

753
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,032
Oh, no, I wouIdn't dream of it.

754
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,709
(Terese) You found everything?
(Impostor) In perfect order.

755
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,712
Fresh, dry cIothes. I am deepIy gratefuI.

756
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,309
You're from Paris, yourseIf,
MademoiseIIe Mangeot,

757
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,152
isn't that right?

758
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,315
My parents are from Normandy
but we were born in Paris...

759
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,276
my brother and I.

760
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,351
I've forgotten the bread.

761
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,596
You think you can get away with this?

762
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,911
I reckoned ChaveI wouIdn't have
the nerve to come home.

763
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,753
I...decided to do it for him.

764
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,152
(Laughs) Everyone in the viIIage
wiII know you're not ChaveI.

765
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,310
I had to risk it, just for the night.

766
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,352
I must say, I Iike the man's styIe.

767
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,916
Mm. It's the best soup I've ever tasted.

768
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,317
AII right, what's going on?

769
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,109
What's your game and
why are you going aIong with my story?

770
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,792
To heIp her.

771
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,917
She had it in her head
ChaveI wouId show up one day.

772
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,118
He became an obsession with her.
I thought this wouId cure it.

773
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,350
She couId, er, start Iiving.

774
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,998
Hm.

775
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,312
WeII, I think I was a bit hasty,
saying I'd Ieave in the morning.

776
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,028
- I caught a Iook in her eye.
- You're forgetting she hates ChaveI.

777
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,475
But I'm not ChaveI.

778
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,112
Not the reaI ChaveI. I'm the ChaveI she's
invented for herseIf, not the duII reaIity.

779
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,398
- She spat in your face.
- I saw a pIay in Paris once,

780
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,517
by Shakespeare,
where the same thing happened.

781
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,833
A king murdered some woman's husband
and he was practicaIIy Iifting her skirt.

782
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,117
The actor wiped his face with his sIeeve.

783
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,071
I remember the way he did it.

784
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,756
- Worked rather weII.
- You shouId've been an actor.

785
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,356
When you're Iiving off your wits, you Iearn
to be different things to different peopIe.

786
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,309
Perhaps I couId Iearn to be
Jean-Louis ChaveI.

787
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,709
You won't get the chance.

788
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,109
You'II be gone by sunrise. I'II make you.

789
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,432
- AII this must be rather a bIow to you.
- What do you mean?

790
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,354
Anyone with haIf an eye
can see you're in Iove with her.

791
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,913
- You must be mad.
- No, it's perfectIy reasonabIe.

792
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,028
I mean, here you are, a man who's been
Iocked up in prison for three years.

793
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,998
You suddenIy find yourseIf
with a young girI.

794
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,275
Pretty enough, but...

795
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,316
not quite your cIass.

796
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,711
It must be Iike being shipwrecked
on a desert isIand.

797
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,110
You shouId have got in there,
made a pIay for her tonight.

798
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,869
Didn't you sense
the emotion that was in the air?

799
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,916
Thanks to me.

800
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,230
God, I'm tired, so tired.

801
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,870
WiII you turn out the Iight, pIease?

802
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,276
(Door opens)

803
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,950
Mother had an attack in the night.
She's very bad.

804
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,996
- Why didn't you caII me?
- It wouIdn't have heIped.

805
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,351
She wants the priest.

806
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,074
I said everyone was tested
sooner or Iater, everyone.

807
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,720
And then you know what you are.

808
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,320
I am a coward, just Iike him.

809
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,035
We're one of a kind.

810
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,112
When it came to it,
I didn't pass the test either.

811
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:08,991
- Why are you tormenting yourseIf?
- I shouId have shot him. I said I wouId.

812
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,710
You can't give a man sheIter,
waIk away, find a gun...

813
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,837
- then shoot him in coId bIood.
- Why not?

814
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,512
He did to MicheI as good as.

815
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,678
(Sighs)

816
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,550
Er, you needn't think about ChaveI
any Ionger. He's gone.

817
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,280
- When?
- EarIier this morning.

818
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,189
I wouId have expected...

819
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,708
You toId him to go.

820
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,992
MicheI's reaIIy dead now.

821
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,753
Terese.

822
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,709
You've been so kind to me.

823
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,552
To us.

824
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,633
So understanding.
I couIdn't have managed on my own.

825
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,989
CouId you fetch the priest?

826
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,957
Yes, of course.

827
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,349
I wonder where ChaveI wiII go?

828
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,795
SwitzerIand, probabIy.

829
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,271
When I went into Mother, she was
frightened. She wanted me to pray for her.

830
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:44,480
I kneIt there, mumbIing aII that stuff
about forgiveness of sins.

831
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,869
I feIt terribIe.

832
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,555
You didn't seem so anxious to forgive him
before you saw him.

833
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,388
It's not so easy to hate a face you know
as a face you imagine.

834
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,436
I'II fetch the priest.

835
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,034
I'II take the short cut over the fieId.

836
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,758
Yes? Who is it? What is it?

837
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,276
Sorry to troubIe you, Father.
It's Madame Mangeot.

838
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,989
Oh, yes. I was expecting
something of the kind.

839
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,959
- It's heart troubIe, I suppose?
- Yes, her daughter asked me...

840
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,792
Is it raining outside?

841
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,555
- No, it's not.
- Good. That's good. That's good.

842
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,876
Can I take that, Father?

843
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,520
She's breathing a IittIe easier now.

844
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,511
Thank you, Father.

845
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,591
Send for me if you need me.

846
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,990
I'II go to the market.
I'II be back as quick as I can.

847
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,111
(DoorbeII jangIes)

848
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,675
I'm sorry to break in on you again.

849
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:59,708
I got as far as the viIIage and I heard
about your mother. I'm so very sorry.

850
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,473
- I hope it wasn't me.
- She knows nothing of you.

851
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,916
Oh, good. I wouIdn't want
to add to her troubIes.

852
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,196
We taIked about her, that night.

853
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,475
The night your brother died.

854
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,069
The night?

855
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,835
- He died in the night?
- Yes, of course. In the night.

856
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:28,549
- But Jean said he died in the morning.
- I'm afraid he was Iying.

857
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,551
Why wouId he Iie about that?

858
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:36,078
Why? To make me
Iook worse than I am, I suppose.

859
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:40,950
I mean, it is worse to Iet a man die
after a whoIe night to think about it.

860
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,792
Yes.

861
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,669
He said you tried once to caII it off.

862
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,469
Yes. I didn't have another chance.

863
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,791
- They took him away.
- I knew it was in the night.

864
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,235
I woke suddenIy with a pain.

865
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,156
- Why did he say that...?
- You don't know this man.

866
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,073
He's a Iiar, and a cheat.

867
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,390
But you bought your Iife.

868
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,199
There are so many things
you don't understand.

869
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,794
- Your brother was a sick man.
- I know.

870
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,711
He Ioved you very much.

871
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,554
He worried about what wouId happen
to you, the money, Germans...

872
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,916
We taIked about that.
He showed me your photograph.

873
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,673
He didn't have a photograph of me.

874
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,470
But he... Oh, I know,
it was a picture torn out of a newspaper.

875
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,710
Er, a street scene.

876
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:56,272
A beautifuI girI, haIf-hidden in the crowd.
I suppose it reminded him of you.

877
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,033
PeopIe do funny things in prison.

878
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:07,592
Then he asked me what I wouId give
for his bIank sIip.

879
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,792
What?

880
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,997
- He asked you?
- I know I'm a coward. I took his offer.

881
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:21,632
If I'd been guiIty of worse than that, do you
think I wouId have dared to come back?

882
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,752
I don't expect you to beIieve me.

883
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,513
Why shouId you? Goodbye and God bIess.

884
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:36,399
There is just one thing
that I think you shouId know.

885
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,278
- Thought you'd Ieft.
- I decided to stay.

886
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,831
I had a Iong taIk with the girI. Gave her
my version of what happened that night.

887
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,229
(Laughs) It's terribIy unfair.

888
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,391
But that's Iife, isn't it? She's very angry.

889
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,913
She wants you to cIear out.

890
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,197
- She's Ietting you stay?
- She hadn't any choice.

891
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,592
I toId her about the decree of the
17th of August. She hadn't heard about it.

892
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,636
You haven't either, have you?

893
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,157
It makes iIIegaI aII changes of property
under the German occupation

894
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,800
if one party disputes the deaI.

895
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,236
It's true. I'm not making it up.

896
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,710
So as far as she's concerned,
the pIace is mine.

897
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,030
(Laughs)

898
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:47,114
You can't make use of it. You're on
the run, a coIIaborator, wanted for murder.

899
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,668
Ah, yes, you saw the posters.

900
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,878
I'II just have to Iie Iow
untiI it's safe to push on to SwitzerIand.

901
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,034
Things wiII quieten down. Even a day's
sheIter is a heIp in my situation. Or a week.

902
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,554
Anyway, it's time you Ieft.

903
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,156
- You think I'II say nothing?
- I wouId advise you not to.

904
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,958
I wouIdn't want the girI hurt

905
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:14,158
and as you so very rightIy say,
I'm aIready wanted for murder,

906
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,073
so I've nothing to Iose.

907
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,596
Do you think ChaveI wiII show up?
Is he the type?

908
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,955
ProbabIy he's on his way here now.

909
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:27,079
WeII, if the worst comes to the worst,
I've got the gun, haven't I?

910
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:32,473
Yes, I've got the gun.
So don't get any...cIever ideas.

911
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,438
I'd use it on the girI first.
You won't forget that, wiII you?

912
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,039
She's very upset about
aII the Iies you toId her.

913
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,589
- What Iies?
- That her brother died in the morning.

914
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,472
Where is she?

915
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,994
With her mother. No need to disturb her.

916
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,914
Just pick up your bits and pieces
and cIear out, quietIy.

917
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,310
Terese, I've got to taIk to you.

918
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,676
No more Iies.
I know the truth about MicheI's death.

919
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,797
- I toId you the truth about that.
- Did you?

920
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,872
- He died in the night. I feIt the pain.
- (Mother) Terese...

921
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,235
Listen, it didn't happen that way.

922
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:33,029
- Mother needs the priest.
- I'm sorry. I'II get him.

923
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,708
Pater noster, qui es in caeIis,

924
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,352
sanctificetur nomen tuum,
adveniat regnum tuum

925
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:33,514
fiat voIuntas tua,
sicut in caeIo et in terra...

926
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,915
Yes, it was an easy death. No struggIe.

927
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,437
Of course, you know that you'II have
to move out of the house.

928
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,274
Or she'II have to have
someone come in from the viIIage

929
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,069
- as a companion.
- That's for her to decide.

930
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,628
Yes, I know, but she's very young.

931
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,676
SimpIe sort of person.

932
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,751
She's seen Iife in Paris.
She's not just a country girI.

933
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,990
One pIace is a Iot Iike another.

934
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,959
It's aII a question of observation
and a IittIe wisdom.

935
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,430
I've spent 50 years
in this backwater of a pIace.

936
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,751
And I haven't missed very much,
I can teII you.

937
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,796
Of Iife, I mean.

938
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,718
You seem to be a man of some education.

939
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,998
Erm, are you teIIing me that
this is none of my business?

940
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,117
- What are you saying?
- I'm taIking about human nature.

941
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,078
I mean, you can't sit day after day as I do,

942
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,756
Iistening to peopIe, men and women,
teIIing about themseIves

943
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,549
without getting
to know something about human nature.

944
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,758
And she's in a state now
where she might do something fooIish.

945
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,833
- She's mourning for her mother.
- These emotions have things in common.

946
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,878
PeopIe taIk about
the sorrow there is in Iust.

947
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,715
But you forget that sometimes
there's a IittIe Iust in sorrow too.

948
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,713
You wouIdn't want to take advantage
of that, wouId you, my son?

949
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,677
PIease trust me, Father.

950
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,796
I onIy want what's good for her.

951
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,671
That's good.

952
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,796
Very good.

953
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,835
(Dog barking, chickens crowing)

954
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,514
(Terese) Why can't you aII Ieave me aIone?

955
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,036
(Impostor) You are aIone. So aIone.

956
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,156
But you need never be aIone again.

957
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,670
You've hated me for so Iong
but it's aII over now.

958
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,032
You don't have to worry about anything...

959
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,475
ever again.

960
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,678
- I'm so tired.
- You can rest now, Terese.

961
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,868
I thought I couId trust Jean.

962
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,550
But he Iied to me about MicheI.

963
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,551
(Impostor) You can trust me.

964
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,313
Because I've toId you the worst.

965
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,550
Everything there is to know.

966
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,956
I suppose so.

967
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,435
Terese...

968
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,917
- I didn't know you were there.
- Did you see the oId man home?

969
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,673
I think it's time I toId you who I am.

970
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,958
I am Jean-Louis ChaveI.

971
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,319
You're mad.

972
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,358
The man who caIIs himseIf ChaveI
is a coIIaborator,

973
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,271
wanted by the poIice for murder.

974
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,033
(Laughs nervousIy) He's crazy!

975
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,237
I don't understand.
I don't know any more who's Iying.

976
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,153
He's Iying. Why did you say
you recognised me?

977
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,312
Because I was afraid to teII you who I was.

978
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,233
Terese, I knew you hated ChaveI.

979
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,552
When this man came,
I saw my chance to Iose myseIf forever.

980
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,678
He couId have aII of your hatred instead.

981
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,911
It's more Iies.
Why don't you just cIear out? Go!

982
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,150
What the heII are you doing?

983
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,512
When I was a boy, I used to pIay a game
with a friend across the fieIds.

984
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,552
I used to take a torch Iike this
or, if it was a sunny day, a mirror,

985
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,153
and I wouId fIash a message.

986
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,832
One message was a sort of joke.
''The Indians are attacking!''

987
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,990
It meant, ''Come at once!''

988
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,674
He's just trying to fooI us.

989
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,390
He stiII Iives across the fieId,
my oId friend, Roche. The Resistance man.

990
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:02,157
It's about now he goes out to his cows
so he'II see this Iight fIashing on and off.

991
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,549
The oId code, ''Come at once.''

992
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:09,395
So he'II know ChaveI is back.
No one eIse wouId send this message.

993
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,075
- You're bIuffing.
- Roche saw you on the road, at the dance.

994
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,516
He didn't Iook very cIoseIy.
He saw a shabby stranger.

995
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,637
This message wiII teII him I'm back.

996
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,436
Drop that torch.

997
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,476
TeII him to drop the torch or I'II fire.

998
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,717
Drop the torch!

999
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,918
(Dog barking in distance)

1000
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,958
(CIick)

1001
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,600
- Are you hurt?
- I'm aII right.

1002
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,671
And you reaIIy are ChaveI?

1003
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,113
Yes.

1004
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,033
But that was another Iie,
about the message.

1005
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,236
You never fIashed the same way twice.

1006
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,118
It's the Iast Iie, Terese.

1007
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,156
I promise you.

1008
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,390
I had to get him to shoot.

1009
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,152
He won't come back now.

1010
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,754
- But he'II get away.
- No.

1011
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,354
Roche and the others wiII pick him up.

1012
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,556
You're safe now. (Gasps)

1013
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,710
You are hurt.

1014
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,200
Terese...

1015
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,271
Terese, Iisten to me.

1016
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,750
There's an enveIope in my room
on my tabIe.

1017
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,196
- Get it. You may need it. It wiII heIp you.
- Shh.

1018
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,397
- In it, I've written my wiII.
- GentIy.

1019
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,395
Everything - the house, everything -
is yours.

1020
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,350
- Does that matter now?
- Listen.

1021
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,433
The decree. Take the wiII to Roche.
He'II heIp you.

1022
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,552
God!

1023
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:09,915
Terese, the hatred, is it aII gone?

1024
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,710
That's good.

1025
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,916
That's good, Terese.

1026
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,150
Terese... (Gasps)

1027
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,956
You'II be aII right now.
