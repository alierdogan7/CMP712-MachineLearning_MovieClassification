181
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,324
I really need to get in.

182
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,473
NADYA: Where is General Below?

183
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:22,097
Please, I must see
General Below right away.

184
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,689
You know what, girly?
If you behave violently again,

185
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,355
we'll have to sedate you.

186
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,783
I can't let you see General Below
because no such person exists.

187
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,241
He is a product of your imagination,
a side effect of the contusion.

188
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,252
Oh, contusion?
I see, but then...

189
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,127

Let me out now!

these loonies here?

192

You don't know who I am?

196
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,927
I'm your commander,
General Below.

197
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:44,721
We have been searching for you all over.
What happened to you?

198
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,934
Sorry, but I don't remember.

199
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,481
Right, I talked to the doctors.

200
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,147
A blow to your head
has damaged your memory.

201
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,608
Do you remember
anything at all?

202
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,827
Circus, friends,

203
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,659
summer, the boarding school.

204
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,166
Then the war began.
My friends were killed.

205
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,828
Mmm. That was more
than half a year ago.

206
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,996
Many things happened since.

207
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,915
We don't have much time.

208
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,011
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

209
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:24,602
World War II is underway.

210
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,224
Nazi Germany has
attacked our country.

211
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,020
Parallel to regular
military operations

212
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,315
two occult secret services are
engaged in a covert struggle:

213
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,527
The German Ahnenerbe
within the SS,

214
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,824
and the 6th Division of the Soviet
Military Intelligence. That's us.

215
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,877
We're not your regular
intelligence corps though.

216
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,538
We use tools of
occultism and magic:

217
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,959
Astrology,
clairvoyance and hypnosis.

218
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,468
I'm the head of the 6th Division.
And you, you are my best agent.

219
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,473
Since the beginning of the war,

220
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,351
you have completed numerous
important missions.

221
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,480
A week ago we sent you, as a
member of a propaganda team,

222
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,686
to the frontline
on an assignment,

223
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,023
where you completely vanished.

224
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,365
Your parents both had
extrasensory abilities.

225
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,991
Ever since they died,

226
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,878
the 6th Division
has been your family.

227
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,129
Died? Why? When?

228
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,004
Before the war,
in the line of duty.

229
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:44,057
BELOW: We have an enormous workload right
now, and I need you like never before!

230
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:51,560
So much depends on the current
counter-operation we are planning.

The astro-radar shows enormous

233

We have intelligence that the Ahnenerbe
have obtained a strong ally.

234
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,667
If it's Baron Von Wolff
and his knights,

235
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,544
we have a real problem!

236
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,204
Does this look familiar?

237
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,923
I saw him in my dreams.
He will come.

238
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,420
Yes, very soon.
The old prophecy is coming true.

240
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,799
That means that within hours

241
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,889
the spirits of Von Wolff
and his warriors

242
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,853
will fall upon our positions.

243
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:36,188
Obviously, ghosts and demons
are not afraid of our weapons.

244
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,320
The living
cannot even see them.

245
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,355
But how can I help?

246
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,401
You are the only one who can.
I'll explain.

247
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,456
For years, the 6th Division

248
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,711
has been developing a special task
force of teen agents: First Squad.

249
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,839
At the beginning of the war, it
was terminated by Ahnenerbe.

250
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,125

Valya.

254
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,304
They were all killed.

255
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:11,594
You're the only survivor
of the First Squad.

256
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,264
Training at our school
was aimed at building

257
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,100
a mental link
between the Squad members.

258
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,947
That's why only you can call upon
the spirits of your fallen friends,

259
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,949
and with them,
stop Von Wolff's assault.

260
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,454
The time has come
for you to meet them again!

261
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,368
But how? You said
the Pioneers were killed.

262
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,622
Exactly. I want you to go
to the other side.

263
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:44,177
The 6th Division has designed a
special machine for this purpose,

264
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,846

This is our last chance.

265

Most importantly, don't
miss the red return signal!

00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:52,469
The Moment of Truth!
That's what Von Wolff said to his knights.

What does it mean?

408
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,596
Moments of Truth are the most
critical and decisive of moments,

409
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,638
when the actions of one man

410

determine the outcome
of a battle or an entire war.

411
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,656
Moments of Truth are instants,
imperceptible to mortals,

412

from the other world

413

may enter our world and interfere
with the natural course of history.

existed and will always exist,

can foresee and endure them.

00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,987

Here is what we know: a large
number of troops on both sides

428
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,150
are concentrated
along the lake shore.

429
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:39,569
Both sides have been trying to attack,
but every attempt has failed.

It's around here that the
Moment of Truth will occur.

431
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,743
The Commander in your dream
is the only one

432
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,913
who will dare to rise
from the trench, under fire,

433
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,002
and lead soldiers
in the attack.

434
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,543
At the Moment of Truth, Von
Wolff will try to behead him.

435
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,379
Should our attack
not take place,

436
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,426
the Germans will launch a
counter-offensive and break the front.
