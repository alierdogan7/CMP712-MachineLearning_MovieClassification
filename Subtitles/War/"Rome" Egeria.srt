- SHE NEEDS ME.
- SHE NEEDS YOU.

13
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,230
EVANDER'S BEEN MISSING FOR TWO MONTHS.

14
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,760
- SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,080
MY DEAR OLD FRIEND.

46
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HEALTHY HEALTHY,I THANK YOU.

47
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,480
FORGIVE ME,HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

48
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,170
HAVE WE NOT?

49
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,820
NO IDEA.

50
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,580
I ALWAYS PRETEND SO WITH CIVILIANS.

51
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,880
IT'S MORE POLITIC,NAY?

52
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,850
AND THIS MUST BE YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE,

53
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,050
WHOSE NAME ESCAPES ME.

54
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,280
POPPAEA.

55
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,180
A FLOWER.

56
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,010
YOU'LL EXCUSE ALL THE BUSTLE.

57
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,880
I FOUND POMPEY'S TASTE IN DECOR RATHER DULL.

58
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,680
I LIKE A LITTLE MORE COLOR.

59
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,320
- AS YOU. SAY
- YOU SHALL MAKE IT LOVELY,WE ARE SURE.

60
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,880
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I TALK BUSINESS WITH YOUR HUSBAND?

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,590
OF COURSE.

62
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,260
- PRETEND I AM NOT HERE.
- IMPOSSIBLE,

63
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,530
BUT I SHALL TRY.NOW THEN...

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,960
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT CAESAR HAS
LEFT ME IN CHARGE WHILST HE IS IN GREECE

65
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,810
YES. OFF HAVING FUN CHASTISING POMPEY ET AL.

66
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,520
LEFT ME HERE TO SCRIBBLE AND QUIBBLE LIKE A DAMNED CIVILIAN.

67
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,980
HOWEVER, I'M DETERMINED TO MAKE MOST OF IT
I SHALL BE A GOOD POLITICIAN,EVEN IF IT KILLS ME

68
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,740
OR IF IT KILLS ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.

69
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,650
SO YOU ARE,IT SEEMS,

70
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,270
THE MOST SENIOR SENATOR LEFT IN ROME.

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
I HAVE THAT HONOR

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
AND A TURNABOUT POMPEIAN TO BOOT

73
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,130
WHICH IS WHY I THOUGHT IT COULD BE AMUSING

74
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
IF WE MADE YOU CONSUL FOR THIS YEAR.

75
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,420
CONSUL?

76
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,600
- THAT'S MOST KIND--
- ALLOW ME TO FINISH SPEAKING.

77
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,400
WHEN THE SENATE NEXT MEETS,

78
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,350
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LEGISLATIVE
ITEMS I WISH TO SEE ENACTED IMMEDIATELY

79
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,780
I AM SURE YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO ASSIST.

80
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,100
- I-- I--
- ITEM ONE:

81
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,480
THE SENATE WILL RATIFY CAESAR'S ELECTION
AS YOUR CO-CONSUL FOR THE COMING YEAR.

82
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,230
BUT HE IS DICTATOR IN ANY CASE.

83
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,660
IT SOUNDS SO MUCH BETTER IF HE IS A CONSUL
IT'S MORE AMICALBE. YOU GOT THAT?

84
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,590
- I-- I HAVE.
- ITEM TWO: YOU WILL PROPOSE

85
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,070
THE FOLLOWING LAW:

86
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,980
FORTHWITH,IN EVERY PROVINCE OF ITALY,

87
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,820
ONE THIRD OF ALL THOSE EMPLOYED

88
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,040
AT LABORING WITH CATTLE OR IN AGRICULTURE

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,790
MUST BE FREEDMEN OR CITIZENS.

90
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,190
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

91
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,320
TOO MANY SLAVES,YOU SEE? THEY'VE TAKEN ALL THE WORK,

92
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,810
WHICH CAUSES UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST THE FREE POPULACE.

93
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,960
NOW,WE NEED TO CREATE MORE JOBS FOR OUR CITIZENS.

94
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,880
BUT IT WILL BE HUGELY EXPENVE!SI

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,060
IT WILL.

96
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,250
BUT ONLY TO THOSE FEW RICH MEN WHO OWN ALL THE LAND

97
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,990
AND THEY SHALL HAVE THE CONSOLATION

98
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,980
OF HAVING DONE SOMETHING EMINENTLY PATRIOTIC.

99
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,780
IT SEEMS RATHER...

100
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,970
EXTREME TO SAY THE LEAST.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,610
RUINOUS EVEN.

102
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,110
YOU MAY WELL BE RIGHT.

103
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,770
BUT FRANKLY,I DO NOT CARE WHETHER IT IS THE RICH,POOR

104
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,770
OR,INDEED BOTH THAT SUFFER.

105
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,390
CAESAR WISHES THIS LAW TO BE MADE.

106
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,510
HE IS MY FRIEND,I WILL HAVE IT MADE.

107
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,860
IF YOU PREFER,I COULD ALWAYS BYPASS THE SENATE

108
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,930
CALL AN ASSEMBLY THE OF PEOPLE AND
YOU CAN PUT YOUR ARGUMENTS TO THEM.

109
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,240
A FINE ORATOR LIKE YOURSELF MIGHT JUST PERSUADE THEM

110
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,690
THAT CAESAR IS WRONG.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,420
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
- GOOD.

112
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,960
GOOD.

113
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,440
THAT'S IT THEN.

114
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
- SAY NOTHING THEN.

115
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,370
IT'S OFTEN BEST.

116
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,590
YOU KNOW POSCA OF COURSE,CAESAR'S CREATURE?

117
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,060
HE'LL TAKE ALL THE DETAILS.

118
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,970
POPPAEA...

119
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,650
MY DOVE,IF YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD DIE...

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,180
COME TO ME,WE WILL MARRY,NEH?

121
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,310
SO,KEEPING THEIR PROMISES,ISN'T HE?

122
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,620
WHAT?

123
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,060
CAESAR AND MARK ANTONY,DOING RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE.

124
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,990
THAT WAS YOUR WORRY,WASN'T IT?

125
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,290
THAT CAESAR'D TURN OUT TO BE JUST ANOTHER TYRANT SORT?

126
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,180
BUT HERE'S HIM AND MARK ANTONY

127
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,140
GETTING JOBS FOR THE UNEMPLOYED.

128
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,600
YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT NOW,CAN YOU?

129
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,120
HE NEGOTIATES WITH A WHORE AND A DWARF AT HIS SIDE.

130
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,440
THINK YOU CINCINNATUS OR MARIUS OR EVEN THE GRACHII

131
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,850
- WOULD DEMEAN THEMSELVES SO?
- WHO?

132
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,000
MARK ANTONY HAS HIS ODD WAYS,THERE'S NO DENYING THAT.

133
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,830
I'M NOT GOING HOME. I NEED A DRINK.

134
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,220
- DRINK? YOU?
- I. DRINK. WHAT OF IT?

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,890
I'LL NOT ARGUE.

136
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,690
- OUCH!
- SORRY.

137
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,780
- YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
- HOW CAN I BE CALM? TWO MONTHS OF THIS.

138
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,500
- AREN'T YOU DONE YET?
- WILL YOU SIT STILL?

139
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,640
WON'T CATCH A PRETTY NEW HUSBAND WITH A SOUR FACE LIKE THAT.

140
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,620
I DON'T WANT A NEW HUSBAND. I WANT CRITO.

141
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,300
YOU CAN'T STAY MARRIED TO A DROVER,

142
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,370
NOT NOW THAT YOUR FATHER'S A PREFECT.

143
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,960
- IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.
- I TOLD HER.

144
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,200
FAR TOO LOW. FORTUNE BLESSED YOU,YOU HAVEN'T PAID OUT DOWRY.

145
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,580
DON'T WORRY,WE'LL FIND YOU SOMEONE NICE,

146
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,130
- AND PROPER STATUS.
- I DON'T WANT ANYONE!

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,890
YOU CAN'T BE UNMARRIED. IT WOULDN'T BE DECENT AT YOUR AGE.

148
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,210
- DECENT SHE SAYS.
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

149
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,510
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

150
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,090
- YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE.
- OR WHAT?

151
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,440
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

152
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,290
IT'S ALL RIGHT,SWEETIE. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

153
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,950
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING WELL FOR A WHILE,BUT NOW.

154
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,690
MAYBE I SHOULD BEAT HER,DO YOU THINK?

155
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,700
I DON'T KNOW. THAT ONLY WORKS IF YOU KEEP AT IT.

156
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,170
A GOOD THRASHING ONCE OR TWICE A DAY TILL THEY'RE DOCILE.

157
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,490
BUT THEN THEY DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

158
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,510
BE A SHAME TO MARK UP A BEAUTY LIKE HER.

159
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,770
SHE IS,EH?

160
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,620
SHE'S A BEAUTY.

161
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,550
SHE IS THAT.

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,240
I GIVE HER SLAVES,MONEY,EVERYTHING. WHAT DO I GET?

163
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,310
NOTHING,THAT'S WHAT.I GET A HOUSE FULL OF WAILING.

164
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,460
MY WIFE WON'T EVEN COUPLE WITH ME.

165
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,230
WHY NOT?

166
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,480
SAYS SHE CAN'T WHILE HER SISTER STAYS.

167
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,460
WHAT'S HER SISTER TO DO WITH IT?

168
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,470
WHAT DIFFERENCE SHOULD THAT MAKE?

169
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,330
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?

170
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,470
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?

171
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,880
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME

172
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,280
THAT I'M SERVED THIS WAY?

173
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,670
YOU SHOULD LEAVE HER,MAYBE,

174
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,820
SEEING AS SHE MAKES YOU SO UNHAPPY.

175
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,520
NO!  I WILL NOT LEAVE HER.

176
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,420
I'D RATHER DIE THAN LEAVE HER.

177
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,920
IT'S ALL RIGHT,LAMB.

178
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,030
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

179
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,300
WHO,I SAY,

180
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,480
FACED WITH THE OVERWHELMING FORCE

181
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,410
OF THE FIGURES AND THE ARGUMENTS I HAVE HERE MARSHALLED

182
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,570
COULD RESIST THEIR OVERWHELMING CONCLUSION?

183
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,520
THEREFORE I ASK YOU,

184
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,210
HONORED CONSCRIPT FATHERS,

185
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,090
TO SUPPORT ME IN THIS IMPORTANT AND..

186
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,950
PATRIOTIC LEGISLATION WHICH WILL--

187
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,930
DOES ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK AGAINST THE MOTION?

188
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,860
NO OPPOSITION VOICED. NO DIVISION REQUIRED.

189
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,000
MOTION CARRIED.

190
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,230
EMPTY.

191
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,450
IF THERE'S NO WINE,WATER WILL DO.

192
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,870
THANK YOU,MY DOVE.

193
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,230
SO,LYDE,I WAS ASKING AROUND,YOU KNOW,

194
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,630
ABOUT YOUR MAN THERE,EVANDER.

195
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,060
ASKING AROUND?

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,950
SEE IF I COULD FIND OUT ANYTHING FOR YOU.

197
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,530
ONLY,I KNOW A FEW SHADY CHARACTERS SEE?

198
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,850
TYPES THAT MIGHT KNOW WHAT'S WHAT WHEN A MAN'S GONE MISSING.

199
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,810
ANYROAD,THEY TELL ME

200
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,770
THAT HE GOT HIMSELF INTO SOME TROUBLE

201
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,590
WITH SOME NASTY GREEK BOYS ACROSS THE RIVER.

202
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,460
- GAMBLING DEBTS THEY SAY.
- GAMBLING?

203
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,560
EVANDER NEVER GAMBLED.

204
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,420
WELL SURE,IT'S THE SORT OF THING

205
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,580
A MAN KEEPS QUIET AROUND HIS WIFE,ISN'T IT?

206
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,680
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

207
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,880
I'M SORRY TO SAY IT,BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S NOT COMING HOME.

208
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,900
DEAD,LOOKS LIKE.

209
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,280
ARE YOU SURE?

210
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,330
SO THEY TELL ME.
DEAD. KILLED.

211
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,280
IT ISN'T TRUE.

212
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,480
MY ADVICE,

213
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,080
BEST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

214
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,740
BEST GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

215
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,870
IT ISN'T TRUE.

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,070
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

217
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,690
YOU'VE STILL GOT PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU.

218
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,540
LOOK TO THEM,EH?

219
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,860
ISN'T THAT RIGHT NIOBE?

220
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,340
BEST SHE GETS ON WITH HER LIFE.

221
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,930
BEST SHE LOOKS TO THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE HER

222
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,300
FORGET EVANDER, FORGET THE PAST

223
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,680
WELL,I'M AWAY.

224
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,060
NEED A DROP OF WINE TO SET ME UP FOR THE DAY.

225
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,610
LYDE,PLEASE DON'T.

226
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,910
SHH.

227
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,610
I'M SO SORRY. I'M SORRY.

228
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,650
YOU'RE SORRY?

229
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,080
IT'S TOO LATE FOR SORRY,ISN'T IT?

230
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,060
YOU WEREN'T SORRY WHEN YOU WERE FUCKING HIM,WERE YOU?

231
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,600
YOU WEREN'T SORRY THEN. I PISS ON YOUSORROW!

232
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,460
I WILL NOT SHH. YOU SHH!

233
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,510
YOU'RE A THIEF AND A WHORE AND YOU STOLE MY HUSBAND!

234
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,930
I STOLE NOTHING! HE CAME TO ME!

235
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,680
HE CAME TO ME! I NEVER LOVED HIM. I LOVE MY HUSBAND!

236
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,690
AND IF YOU'D DONE-- IF YOU'D BEEN--

237
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,700
IF I HAD DONE WHAT?

238
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,750
IF I HAD GIVEN HIM A CHILD. IS THAT ?

239
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,210
I AM SORRY. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

240
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,450
- FORGIVE ME!
- I CURSE YOU,SISTER.

241
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,990
I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRET

242
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,640
FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILD,

243
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,110
BUT DON'T YOU EVER...

244
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,640
EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

245
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,350
BE CAREFUL!

246
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,590
AH!

247
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,370
BRAVO. BRAVO.

248
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,940
A LITTLE BLOOD LUST SUITS YOU,OCTAVIAN.

249
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,510
YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME. DOES HE?

250
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,500
- HE DOES
- TITUS PULLO IS A GOOD TEACHER.

251
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,400
WELL IT'S A PITY CAESAR ISN'T HERE.

252
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,720
HE'D PUT YOU ON HIS STAFF IMMEDIATELY.

253
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,270
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO AND JOIN HIM IN GREECE,

254
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,770
GET SOME REAL POMPEIAN BLOOD ON YOUR SWORD.

255
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,040
- DON'T BE SILLY,MOTHER
- WELL WHY NOT?

256
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,440
IF WE ARE NOT QUICK,POMPEY AND CATO AND ALL THOSE FOOLS

257
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,940
WILL BE DEAD BEFORE OCTAVIAN GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHINE.

258
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,770
- HE'S STILL A CHILD.
- I AM NOT.

259
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,320
HE IS NOT.  HE IS QUITE THE LITTLE MAN NOW.

260
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,930
I SHOULD THINK THERE'S MORE TO MANHOOD THAN SWORDPLAY.

261
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,580
OCTAVIAN,

262
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,790
- HAVE YOU PENETRATED ANYONE YET?
- MOTHER,PLEASE.

263
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,030
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE OR YOU HAVEN'T?
- HAVEN'T,BUT--

264
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,620
TITUS PULLO,DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO SORT THAT OUT?

265
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,300
I'M SURE I DID.

266
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,310
I-- SORRY,MA'AM. I'LL SEE TO IT.

267
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,980
DO THAT.

268
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,050
DON'T WORRY,DARLING. THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO IT.

269
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,520
ONCE YOU'RE IN THE SADDLE,AS IT WERE,

270
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,110
IT'LL ALL COME NATURALLY. ISN'T THAT RIGHT,PULLO?

271
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,180
THAT'S RIGHT MA'AM.

272
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,100
AND NONE OF YOUR SORDID SOLDIER'S SHE-WOLVES,MIND YOU.

273
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
SOMETHING CLEAN AND PRETTY

274
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,600
- CLEAN AND PRETTY IT IS.
- GOOD

275
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,690
I'LL GET MERULA MAKE YOU A TOGA.

276
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,550
- WHAT ELSE?
- PERHAPS YOU CAN ARRANGE HE KILL SOMEONE.

277
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,890
OH...

278
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,090
THAT WILL HAPPEN IN DUE COURSE.

279
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,340
WE JULII ALWAYS HAVE THE NEEDFUL ENEMIES.

280
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,050
HEALTH TO MY CHILD.

281
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,450
MY DAUGHTER.

282
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
I WISH FOR A SON,A HEALTHY SON.

283
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,190
- I,UH--
- GOOD NIGHT,THEN.

284
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,840
GOOD NIGHT.

285
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,960
HUSBAND.

286
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,980
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

287
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,790
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT PLEASE YOU IF WE HAD SOME TIME ALONE.

288
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,880
I SENT THE GIRLS AND LUCIUS TO CLARISSA.

289
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,550
- AND LYDE?
- SHE'S GONE TO A FRIEND'S.

290
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,610
- PLEASE,SIT DOWN.
- I'VE ALREADY EATEN.

291
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,740
OH...

292
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,130
BUT--

293
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,440
I CAN HAVE SOME MORE.

294
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,710
EXCUSE ME.

295
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,120
SIT DOWN WITH ME.

296
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,480
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- REALLY,SIT.

297
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,610
CAN'T FINISH ALL THIS ON MY OWN.

298
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,190
THLENDAR IS CORRECT...

299
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,030
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ME TONIGHT.

300
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,600
I WOULD.

301
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,210
I'D LIKE THAT.

302
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,250
MY DEAR MARK ANTONY,

303
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,020
I HOPE THIS FINDS YOU IN BETTER HEALTH THAN MY HOPES FOR VICTORY.

304
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,520
I CHASED POMPEY FROM ONE END OF GREECE TO THE OTHER

305
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,350
AND HE RESOLUTELY REFUSED TO FIGHT.

306
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,690
I THOUGHT THIS WAS HIS USUAL OBTUSENESS

307
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,340
BUT THE OLD MAN HAS SOMESE LEFT IN HIM YET.

308
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,480
WHILE AVOIDING BATTLE,

309
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,250
HE HAS GATHERED A GOOD 10 LEGIONS FROM THE EAST

310
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,900
AND I FIND MYSELF BADLY OUTNUMBERED.

311
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,210
NOW THE CAT BARKS AT THE DOG,

312
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,070
AND POMPEY IS CHASING ME.

313
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,150
I CAN OUTMANEUVER HIM FOR A WHILE

314
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,470
BUT NOT FOREVER.

315
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,000
MY MEN ARE TIRED AND ILL SUPPLIED

316
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
AND WE SHALL SOON HAVE TO STAND AND FIGHT

317
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,490
I ASK YOU TO BRING THE 13th HERE AS SPEEDILY AS YOU ARE ABLE

318
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,900
DAMNATION.

319
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,930
SHALL I SUMMON THE LEGION LEGATES?

320
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,380
NO. WAIT.

321
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,510
I MUST THINK ON THIS.

322
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,410
THIS IS LOVELY.

323
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,550
OH,IT'S JUST YOUR COLORING.

324
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,640
A LITTLE LOUD.  I'D PREFER SOMETHING PLAINER.

325
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,290
WHAT'S THE POINT IN PLAIN? WE SHALL TAKE IT.

326
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,240
PUT THIS ONE...

327
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,390
- DIVINE. OH,DIVINE

328
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,540
ANTONY WILL LOVE THIS. HE LIKES ME IN EASTERN STYLES.

329
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,410
- HOW MUCH FOR BOTH?
- 5,0.

330
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,560
- YOU ARE A THIEF.
- FOUR AND A HALF THEN.

331
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,700
THREE.

332
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,940
CAN WE AFFORD SUCH EXPENSE?

333
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,800
THINGS AS THEY ARE WITH CAESAR IN GREECE,

334
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,770
SURELY WE SHOULD BE MORE PRUDENT?

335
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,550
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING MY DEAR,

336
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,160
I'M THINKING AHEAD.

337
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,050
TITUS PULLO IS HERE,DOMINUS.

338
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,290
OH. TELL HIM I AM UNWELL.

339
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,980
HE COME BACK NEXT WEEK PERHAPS.

340
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,580
TELL HIM NOTHING OF THE SORT.

341
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,880
OCTAVIAN WILL BE READY TO SEE HIM IN ONE MOMENT.

342
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,230
AND GIVE HIM A PURSE.

343
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,600
YOU'VE PUT OFF THIS MOMENT LONG ENOUGH,MY DEAR

344
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,000
MOTHER

345
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
YOU WILL PENETRATE SOMEONE TODAY
OR I WILL BURN YOUR WRETCHED BOOKS IN THE YARD

346
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,900
OFF WITH YOU.

347
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,530
COMING THROUGH. NOBLE COMING THROUGH. MAKE WAY THERE.

348
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,860
DON'T WORRY,YOUNG MASTER. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.

349
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,050
IF THERE IS NOTHING TO IT,WHY IS SUCH A FUSS MADE OF THE THING?

350
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,020
YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT.

351
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,750
VAI,VAI! BE OFF WITH YOU!

352
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,240
THIS ISN'T NO INFANTRY FUCKHOLE,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

353
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,580
NOW NOW,MY HONEY,CALM YOUR STOMACH.

354
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,780
WE'VE COME FOR THE YOUNG MASTER HERE.

355
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,020
AND WE'RE WELL COINED.

356
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,770
OH WELL,EXCUSE ME,OF COURSE.

357
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,340
I MEANT NO DISRESPECT.

358
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,220
WE'RE HONORED TO SERVICE YOU,YOUNG MASTER.

359
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,350
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE YOUNG MASTER'S PLEASURE?

360
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,110
I'M SURE WE HAVE JUST THE THING.

361
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,030
SOMETHING EXOTIC,PERHAPS?

362
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,040
OR ELSE SOMETHING YOUNG?

363
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,140
LIGHT,SIMPLE.

364
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,520
LITTLE BIT SKINNY,ISN'T IT?

365
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,010
WON'T KNOW HE'S BEEN,WILL HE?

366
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,420
WON'T KNOW YOU'VE BEEN.

367
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,410
MORE SUBSTANCE,

368
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,140
YET STILL NYMPHLIKE,

369
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,780
GRACEFUL.

370
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,660
THIS ONE'S FRESH OFF THE BOAT...

371
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,410
- THAT WILL BE FINE.
- HOLD ON,YOUNG MASTER.

372
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,170
NO POINT HURRYING.

373
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,180
BIG DECISION,THIS.

374
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,810
- LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT--
- THIS ONE IS PERFECTLY ADEQUATE.

375
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,360
YOU WILL BE UTTERLY SATISFIED,I ASSURE YOU.

376
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,000
EGERIA,GO PREPARE YOURSELF.

377
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,740
IF WE MIGHT DISPENSE WITH THE PECUNIARY DETAILS...

378
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,500
- EH?
- OH,RIGHT.

379
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,730
- WHAT'S YOUR PRICE THEN
- 1,000.

380
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,310
GERRAE!

381
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,030
I COULD HAVE HALF THE WHORES IN NARBO FOR THAT,AND THEIR MOTHERS.

382
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,910
WE'RE NOT IN NARBO,WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE.

383
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,170
ALL RIGHT,MY DOVE.

384
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,190
WE'LL PAY.

385
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,100
BUT THE GIRL BETTER FUCK HIM LIKE
HELEN OF TROY WITH HER ASS ON FIRE,

386
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,650
OR I'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY.

387
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,650
- SPEAK.
- GNAEUS POMPEY MAGNUS SENDS GREETINGS.

388
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,710
HE HOPES YOU FIND HIS HOUSE SATISFACTORY.

389
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,110
IT'LL DO.

390
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,310
- GET TO HIS POINT.
- HIS POINT.

391
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,330
CAESAR IS DOOMED AND YOU WITH HIM,

392
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,090
- UNLESS YOU MAKE A SEPARATE PEACE.
- AND?

393
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,720
IF YOU DO,POMPEY WILL BE MERCIFUL AND GENEROUS.

394
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,190
HOW?

395
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,810
HE WILL GIVE YOU YOUR LIFE. A PROVINCE.

396
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,820
MONEY ENOUGH TO PRESERVE YOUR DIGNITY.

397
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,610
WHAT MAKES HIM THINK I VALUE MY LIFE SO HIGH?

398
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,440
WHY HAVE YOU NOT LEFT FOR GREECE?

399
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,700
DO NOT SMILE AT ME

400
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,570
RERN TOMORROW. I WILL GIVE POMPEY HIS ANSWER THEN.

401
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,370
NOT THAT WAY.

402
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,910
AND DISGUISE YOURSELF.

403
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,280
DISMISSED.

404
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,120
YOU TAKE CLOTHES DOWN?

405
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,430
THAT'S AN INTERESTING ACCENT.

406
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,820
NO UNDERSTAND.

407
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,380
WHERE--

408
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,630
ARE YOU FROM?

409
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,460
OH. WHERE FROM.

410
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,060
DON'T KNOW.

411
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,810
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE FROM?

412
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,970
ROME TAKE ME VERY YOUNG.

413
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,240
KILL MOTHER,FATHER,BROTHER,

414
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,590
TAKE ME.

415
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,540
OH.  I SEE. SAD.

416
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,090
TURN OVER,WOULD YOU?

417
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,320
ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES.

418
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,510
AH!

419
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,360
NICE PLACE,THIS.

420
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,040
CLEAN.

421
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,130
I DON'T SUPPOSE,

422
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,370
SEEING AS I'M WITH THE QUALITY...

423
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,960
NOT A CHANCE.

424
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,710
NO NO NO. NO,DO IT FOR REAL. FIGHT.

425
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,620
OH,COME ON,FIGHT,DAMN YOU! FIGHT!

426
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,630
THAT'S BETTER!

427
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,710
MMM,GOOD.

428
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,360
BRAVA,CYNTHIA!  BRAVA!

429
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,970
OH,DON'T BE SO SILLY,IT'S JUST A SCRATCH NOW.

430
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,220
THERE THERE.

431
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,840
YES,POSCA,WHAT IS IT?

432
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,750
I AM TO REMIND YOU OF YOUR DINNER TONIGHT WITH ATIA OF THE JULII.

433
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,090
SONS OF S.

434
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,890
WHERE IS HE? WHERE CAN HE BE?

435
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,640
BUSY MAN. POLITICS.

436
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,810
POLITICS? HE PROMISED HE WOULD COME.

437
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,600
CASTOR!

438
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,120
SEND A MAN TO POMPEY'S I MEAN,MARK ANTONY'S VILLA AND ENQUIRE HIS WHEREABOUTS

439
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,870
ANTONY'S WHEREABOUTS,IMMEDIATELY,DOMINA.

440
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,680
DO NOT SAY IT IS I WHO SENDS TO ASK.

441
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,930
NOT YOU SENDS TO ASK.

442
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,050
STAY.  HE'LL KNOW IT IS I WHO ASKED.

443
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,080
SEND NO ONE.

444
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,250
I WILL SEND NO ONE.

445
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,130
IF HE COMES,HE COMES,I DON'T CARE!

446
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,400
HALT!

447
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,280
WELCOME,DOMINUS.

448
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:22,380
SORRY TO BE SO HORRIBLY LATE. ENDLESS BUSINESS.

449
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,210
- WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?
- OF COURSE.

450
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,140
I CONFESS,I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN YOU WERE COMING.

451
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,840
SO THIS IS A LOVELY SURPRISE.

452
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,370
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT,I WILL GO AND DRESS CORRECTLY.

453
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,780
MMM. HERE HE IS,

454
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,500
YOUNG APOLLO

455
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,700
HOW WAs IT?

456
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,100
IT WAS PLEASANT

457
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,600
PLEASANT, I SHOULD SAY DO

458
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,900
- HOW WAS HE?
- LIKE BULL.

459
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,760
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

460
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,080
TELL ME.

461
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,680
MARK ANTONY DOES NOT INTEND TO GO TO GREECE TO HELP CAESAR.

462
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,950
I HAVE SWORN LOYALTY TO A MAN OF NO HONOR.

463
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,050
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO GREECE THEN.

464
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,270
- WE'LL BEHEET TOGR.
- IT'S TRUE,BUT STILL.

465
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,950
HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS SAID CAESAR'S CAUSE IS WRONG?

466
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,450
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

467
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,290
THERIS A MORAL PRINCIPLE INVOLVED.

468
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,500
WHAT AN IDIOT YOU ARE

469
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,900
NOT HUNGERY?

470
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,110
OH,AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF SOLDIER'S PORRIDGE,I'M EASILY SATED.

471
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,230
WELL,THIS LAST NEWS FROM GREECE CANNOT HAVE IMPROVED YOUR APPETITE.

472
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,890
HARDLY.

473
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,000
AND IS IT REALLY SO BAD? CAESAR ALWAYS FINDS A WAY TO WIN.

474
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,630
POMPEY HAS GATHERED 10 MEN FOR EVERY ONE OF CAESAR'S.

475
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,380
ARITHMETIC HAS NO MERCY.

476
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,720
I'D FEARED IT WAS SO.

477
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,230
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO THEN?

478
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,250
I DON'T KNOW.

479
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,000
YOU'VE BECOME A POWERFUL MAN. THE PEOPLE LOVE YOU.

480
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,050
ONLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

481
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,560
YOU COULD BE THE FIRST MAN IN ROME,IF YOU WANTED.

482
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,780
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

483
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,260
WELL,YOU SHOULD.

484
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,290
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT.

485
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,740
I'M THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

486
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,710
WATER.

487
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,820
I COULD SLEEP FOR A WEEK.

488
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,670
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

489
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,350
WE SHOULD GET MARRIED.

490
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,790
MARRIED?

491
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,660
WHY SHOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT OF ALL THINGS?

492
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,120
PERHAPS I LOVE YOU.

493
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,670
YOU'RE JOKING.

494
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,780
FOR A MOMENT THERE YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

495
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,160
I AM NOT JOKING WITH YOU.

496
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,280
OH,MY DEAR WOMAN.

497
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,850
PLEASE DON'T WORRY,M NOI'GOING SOFT ON YOU.

498
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,780
I'M THINKING STRATEGICALLY.

499
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,760
IF CAESAR IS DEFEATED,

500
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,680
I CAN'T VERY WELL FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH THE POMPEIANS.

501
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,510
- I NEED PROTECTION.
- TRUE.

502
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,480
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

503
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,560
IF CAESAR IS DEFEATED--

504
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,410
THEN I WILL BE DEFEATED ALSO.

505
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,830
ONLY IF YOU JOIN HIM IN GREECE.

506
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,140
BUT IF YOU STAY IN ROME,

507
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,050
YOU WILL BE VERY WELL SITUATED.

508
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,070
YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WITH YOU,

509
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,230
YOU HAVE POSSESSION OF THE CITY.

510
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,080
YOU ONLY LACK MONEY.

511
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,340
AND WHILST YOUR NAME IS PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE--

512
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,220
- I AM NO PATRICIAN.
- EXACTLY.

513
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,380
BUT ALLIED WITH MY HOUSE,YOU WOULD HAVE BOTH COIN AND NOBILITY

514
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,040
TO MAKE YOURSELF KING IF YOU WISHED IT SO.

515
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,180
AND YOU WOULD BE QUEEN.

516
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,110
I WOULD BE YOUR LOVING AND OBEDIENT WIFE.

517
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,940
IF ONLY I WERE WILLING TO DESERT A FRIEND.

518
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,890
A MAN OF YOUR OWN BLOOD.

519
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,500
- OH,TOO HONORABLE FOR THAT,ARE YOU?
- I LIKE TO APPEAR SO.

520
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,260
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL DIE FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES.

521
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,090
- WILL I NOT?
- CAESAR WILL DIE IN ANY CASE.

522
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,540
BUT YOU ARE FAR TOO CLEVER TO SHARE HIS FATE NEEDLESSLY.

523
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,600
I HAD NOT REALIZED UNTIL NOW...

524
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,960
WHAT A WICKED OLD HARPY YOU REALLY ARE.

525
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,700
GET OUT!

526
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,960
GET OUT!

527
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,050
THANK YOU,PULLO.

528
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,030
AT ATTENTION!

529
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,770
ABED IN DAYLIGHT,WHAT LUXURY.

530
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,750
WICKEDNESS.

531
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,710
FATHER,THAT DWARF IS ASKING FOR YOU.

532
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,980
EXCELLENCY MARK ANTONY

533
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,470
ORDERS 13th LEGION TO MUSTER ON THE FIELD OF MARS.

534
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,570
- WHY? WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- GREECE.

535
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,870
TRIBUNE!

536
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,150
- WHAT SHALL I TELL POMPEY?
- !

537
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,250
OF COURSE.

538
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,450
EXCUSE ME. I HAD FORGOT YOU.

539
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,890
HIS SKIN IS A LITTLE DRY.

540
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,380
HAVE HIM WELL-OILED BEFORE HE IS PRESENTED.

541
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,110
BONA DEA.

542
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,500
- I AM AFRAID TO ASK.
- GIFTS FOR SERVILIA.

543
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,500
HOW FINE YOU LOOK. LET ME SEE.

544
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:49,140
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. YOU'RE A REAL MAN AT LAST,EH?

545
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,910
WHY ARE WE GIVING GIFTS TO SERVILIA?

546
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,060
THE OLD CROW STANDS IN WELL WITH CATO AND THE REST.

547
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,200
WHEN CAESAR AND HIS DOG ANTONY ARE DEFEATED--

548
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,590
- IF THEY ARE DEFEATED.
- WHEN THEY ARE DEFEATED,

549
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,730
WE'LL NEED HER GOOD WILL.

550
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,500
- AND THIS WILL BUY YOU TO IT,YOU THINK?
- I DO NOT SEE WHY NOT.

551
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,310
A LARGE PENIS IS ALWAYS WELCOME.

552
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,650
- YOU THINK IT'S NOT ENOUGH?
- AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO HER?

553
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,380
- WHAT I DID? WHAT DID I DO TO HER?
- PLEASE!  I'M NOT STUPID.

554
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,250
IT WAS YOU MADE CAESAR RENOUNCE HER.

555
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,240
- WELL,WHAT IF I DID? SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT.
- DOES SHE NOT?

556
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,910
- SHE'S NOT STUPID EITHER.
- SERVILIA HAS NO GUILE IN HER.

557
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,180
IF SHE KNOWS IT,WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

558
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,150
YOU KNOW BEST,I'M SURE.

559
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,940
IN ANY CASE,YOU WILL TAKE THE GIFTS TO HER

560
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,740
AND SEE WHAT SHE'S THINKING.

561
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,820
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND OF YOU.

562
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,450
AND YOU WILL GO TO MEDIOLANUM.

563
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,490
- TIMON WILL TAKE YOU.
- MEDIOLANUM?

564
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,280
YES,THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD ACADEMY THERE.

565
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,050
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YOU'RE A MAN NOW.

566
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,180
ROME'S NOT SAFE FOR MEN OF THE JULII.

567
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,610
HIS TOENAILS ARE UGLY.

568
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,370
HAVE THEM CUT AND PAINTED AND PUT SOME FLOWERS ON HIS HEAD.

569
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,680
OH,AND SEND OVER SOME ICE. SIX BAS,SAY.

570
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,910
SIX BARRELS OF ICE.

571
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,590
WELL,DON'T LOOK SO FOOLISH.

572
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,210
I KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT.

573
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,810
YOUR MOTHER'S TOO KIND

574
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,190
TO WHAT DO I OWE THIS GENEROSITY?

575
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,640
IT'S A GESTURE OF FRIENDSHIP.

576
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,950
FRIENDSHIP.

577
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,510
THANK YOUR MOTHER FOR HER... FRIENDSHIP.

578
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,790
I HOPE ONE DAY TO RECIPROCATE HER...

579
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,260
FRIENDSHIP.

580
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,880
I WILL GO THEN.

581
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,790
EXCUSE ME.

582
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,620
WAIT.

583
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,700
PLEASE,FORGIVE MY ILL HUMOR.

584
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,860
THERE'S NOTHING TO FORGIVE.

585
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,810
I HAVE KNOWN YOU SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL. YOU HAVE A GOOD SOUL.

586
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,580
I KNOW THAT WHATEVER OTHERS MIGHT DO,

587
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,890
YOU ARE BLAMELESS.

588
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,680
I KNOW THAT.

589
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:15,170
I-- I  NOTDO THAT IS,I CANNOT--

590
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,820
SHH SHH SHH SHH.

591
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,690
IT'S ALL RIGHT. THERE'S NO NEED.

592
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,180
TELL YOUR MOTH

593
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,280

594
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:34,800
AND THAT I TREASURE HER FRIENDSHIP AS ALWAYS.

595
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,820
YOU MUST COME AND VISIT ME AGAIN. WILL YOU?

596
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,680
- I WILL.

597
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,730
I WANT THERE TO BE NO ILL FEELING BETWEEN US.

00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,170
I PROMISE.

599
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,130

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,860
BELLONA PROTECT YOU.

AND JUNO CAPE YOU

604
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,420
A FLEET OF SHIPS HAS SET SAIL FOR GREECE

605
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,810
CARRYING THE ARMY OF GENERAL MARK ANTONY.

606
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,660

A VERY GOOD OFFERING WAS MADE TO TRITON!

612
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:15,840
