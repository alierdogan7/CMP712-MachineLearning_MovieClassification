What're you doing, Sprout, huh?

7
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:45,078
What are you doing?
Come here, look at you.

8
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,783
Ah.

9
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:49,752
You gonna walk for me?

10
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,624
You gonna walk for your dad?

11
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,565
Let's try walking again.

12
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,271
There you go.

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,139
All right, there you go.

14
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:00,279
Look at you, big boy now, huh?

15
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:01,882
There.

16
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,223
See? It's easy.

17
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:08,032
Huh? Look at you.
(Kisses)

18
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,539
Keep going, keep going.

19
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,883
Sure you want him
to learn to walk so soon?

20
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,193
Well, he's almost a year old.

21
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,999
Faster he learns to walk,
the sooner he learns to march.

22
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,270
That's a good point.

23
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,611
Nah, you're a smart one, Thomas, huh?

24
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:27,550
Just like your ma, huh?

25
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:29,388
(Door opens)

26
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:36,836
Afternoon.

27
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,338
I thought regulars were trained
to fold their own bedding.

28
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:03,644
He'll be out before Christmas.

29
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,178
They will.

30
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:08,550
This fighting can't last.

31
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,956
If one redcoat in the house is as
close as it comes to us, then...

32
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,397
then I shall thank the Lord
and be done with it.

It's a pity His Majesty don't
pay for scalps no more, huh?

36
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,907
Used to offer 130 cobs a head.

37
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,545
For men, not for boys under 12.

(Men laugh)

39
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:22,688
That's all Washington
has left to send is boys.

40
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,924
Aye, Major?

41
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,895
Washington coulda had men.
(Urinating)

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,701
Coulda had Rangers.

43
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:38,072
If he were bolder,
not so tight with his purse.

44
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:41,936
Those pups died for nothing.

you start on the outside

These were not
Tory militia or Regulars.

70
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:26,603
They... they were Queen's Rangers.

71
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:38,351
Was it Robert Rogers?

72
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,456
It was luck, then.

73
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,625
Just bad luck you ran into him.

74
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,128
I asked for a coat.

75
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:49,630
Luck?

76
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,568
Sir, luck had nothing to do with this.

77
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,402
We both know that. The...

78
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:59,976
The British, they use Rogers and
his mercenaries like a bear trap,

79
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,143
and they knew precisely
where to set him.

80
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:04,646
This was an ambush planned in advance.

81
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,685
Are you saying there's a
breach within our ranks?

82
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,824
I'm saying

83
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,395
that they have spies everywhere, sir...

84
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:30,498
and that we need the same.

85
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,499
See to your shoulder.

86
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,701

I'll assign you new men.

General, please.
These scouting runs, they're suicide.

Captain Tallmadge.

I will not waste money on informers.

90

I agree, sir.
All I would need from you

91
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:50,513
is one man to serve as a courier
between myself and a friend in New York.

- New York?

- Thought you didn't like my tavern.

- What's this?
- I said I would repay my debt.

We're not even halfway
through the season.

This is only half of what I owe.

118
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:07,486
- The harvest isn't coming in as I hoped.
- Loopers or maggots?

119
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:09,387
I just need more time, Selah,
and then next season, I swear...

120
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,526
Next season? Of course, why not?

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,532
Perhaps by then you just pay me
back with my own cauliflower.

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,174
Abraham.

Well, I should be off, so...

130
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,035
No, now, wait.

131
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,404
We hardly see you anymore.

132
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,710
How is Mary and Thomas?

133
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,445
They're both well.

134
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:05,584

- You should come for dinner

is that his scabbard calls

00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,845
(Sawing)

182
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,214
Leave room for two nooses.

183
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,686
JOYCE:
Court-martialed?

184
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,389
Major, please. Show mercy.

185
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,925
Law, order,

186
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,328
authority.

187
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,064
We are the beacon of authority

188
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,566
in these colonies, Captain,

189
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,433
and we bear the burden
of that authority.

190
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,368
Major...

191
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,804
"Because authority,
though it err like others,"

192
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:10,307
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself

193
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,577
"that skins the vice o' the top."

194
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,412
- Do you understand?
- Is the major in?

195
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,380
Wait here.

196
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,085
Sir, this colonist has struck

197
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,619
an officer of His Majesty's
Royal Army.

198
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,421
Now, once I testify...

199
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:28,057
- You will not be court-martialed here.
- Oh.

200
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:30,662
You will return to England,

201
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,366
where you'll be cashiered
directly upon arrival.

202
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,834
Dismissed.

203
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:59,260
I knew that you would come.

204
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:02,196
I wish to offer my services,
for whatever they may be worth.

205
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,468
Mm, this is not a matter
for the provincial court.

206
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:08,708
One of my men was assaulted.

207
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,776
- This must be redressed.
- Without question.

208
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,678
But by the looks
of Captain Joyce just now,

209
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,312
I can tell there's more to this story,

210
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,151
and I thought I would
shed light on a few facts

211
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,120
in the service of clarity.

212
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:22,556
It involves some social
history of Setauket.

213
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,525
Provincial ephemera

214
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,561
and the passions of young people.

215
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:27,729
Probably worthless.

216
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:31,466
(Blows)
What history?

217
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:37,507
Anna Strong,
the wife of Selah Strong,

218
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:42,144
was engaged three years ago
to Abraham Woodhull.

219
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,911
You mean Abraham, your son.

220
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,251
Yes, they were childhood
friends, you see,

221
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,622
and our families shared friendship

222
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:53,024
until her father's patriot
politics drove us to disagreement.

223
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:57,031
Anna, unfortunately, took
her father's views to heart

224
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:00,399
and so broke the heart of my son,

225
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,702
who was raised to love
the law above all else.

226
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:08,339
"Love will not be spurred
to what it loathes."

227
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,888
So, why, then, did he rush
to the aid of her husband,

228
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:15,015
a suspected patriot?

229
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,286
Abraham has a dreamer's heart,

230
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,322
a romantic heart,

231
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:23,524
his mother's heart, if truth be told.

232
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:26,362
And he keeps room there for Anna

233
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,230
in spite of her betrayal.

234
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,765
Mm.

235
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,067
"Alas, that love,

236
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,837
so gentle in his view..."

237
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:40,043
BOTH: "...should be so
tyrannous and rough in proof."

238
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:50,320
(Panting)

239
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,996
Evening, Woodhull.

240
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,464
What are you doing?

241
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,735
(Slices rope)

242
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,371
Where are you taking Selah?

243
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:05,839
It's past curfew.
Run home to your father.

244
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:13,077
(Thunder crashing)

245
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,610
(Door opens)

246
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,145
(Panting)

247
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,014
(Door closes)

248
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,917
- Let me see you.
- I'm fine.

249
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,352
Just a few bumps, that's all.

250
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,253
(Winces)
Ah, ah.

251
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,922
How did this happen?
Why would you even go to that place?

252
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,858
Mary, Mary.

253
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,830
I'm fine. I'm home.

254
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:55,399
I went down the tavern
for a drink, is all.

255
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,671
Lord knows I could do with another one.
(Winces)

256
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,239
- Eat something first.
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,751
(Groans)

258
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,329
Is that one of mine?

259
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,031
They were your brother's
before they were yours.

260
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,733
I thought you wouldn't mind
if I brought one

261
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:29,136
for my little soldier here.

262
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,237
I don't know what
Major Hewlett told you

263
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:34,342
or what was said to him, but the
fault with this lies with...

264
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:37,076
- Selah Strong.
- With John Robeson.

265
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,042
He was the one
who started the fight.

266
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:42,809
And Captain Joyce,
who was well into his cup,

267
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:44,747
slipped and cut his hand
on one. That is all.

268
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,216
I doubt that's how he'll testify,

269
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,719
so be glad that testimony
won't name you.

270
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,355
Abraham...

271
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,292
why did you take money
from that man?

272
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,297
I warned you about Selah Strong.

273
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,464
- He's choleric by nature.
- (Thomas crying)

274
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,701
You should've come to me if
you needed specie or credit.

275
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,334
I have contacts on New York Island

276
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,333
who'd buy my hogs
at twice the market value.

277
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,001
All I need is someone
to run them into the city.

278
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,641
Sprout, let me give you
a little piece of advice

279
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,412
that my father here gave to me once.

280
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,847
"Neither a lender nor a borrower be."

281
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:22,215
You wouldn't have borrowed.
You would have worked.

282
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,216
(Thomas crying)

283
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,187
Good boy. Shh.

284
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,789
Good boy.

285
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,390
Good night.

286
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:41,200
(Sighs)

287
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,436
(Winces)
Let's have it.

288
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,686
I'll speak plain now.

289
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:01,356
You have responsibilities
to more than this farm,

290
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,956
to more than yourself.

291
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,893
- But, Father, I...
- Legacy is everything.

292
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:11,231
If you wish to preserve ours,
then stay away from those

293
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,135
who've already chosen
to sully theirs.

294
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,837
The Smiths, the Strongs,
the Tallmadges...

295
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,973
they chose the wrong side.

296
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,510
I wasn't taking sides.

297
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,779
I was just trying to do right.

298
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:31,650
Try harder.

299
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,319
And think on my offer.

300
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,591
Good night.

301
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:45,629
(Door opens, closes)

302
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:50,199
(Rain pattering)

303
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,668
(Shivering)

304
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:59,335
- Who's that? Who's there?
- It's me, it's me.

305
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,970
What are you doing?
There's a sentry.

306
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:04,205
He's staying dry for now.

307
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,842
We don't have much time,
all right, so please listen well.

308
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:09,411
They are planning to charge
you with insurrection.

309
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,348
I struck a redcoat,
that's all that matters.

310
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:13,683
No, no, not if you plead
guilty to the first charge.

311
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:16,118
Look, everyone knows
that Joyce is a drunkard.

312
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:19,821
They don't want to hang anyone in
Setauket, not in secure territory.

313
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:23,593
They're gonna send you
instead to the Jersey.

314
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:26,361
- Prison ship?
- Where you have friends.

315
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,895
You know others who have gone
and others who have gotten out.

316
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,248
- If you bribe someone...
- Is that why you came here?

317
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,321
To tell me this?

318
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,172
No, I came here to warn you.

319
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,540
And to have me forgive
your debt, no doubt.

320
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:39,376
No, I said I'd repay my debt in full.

321
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,280
I promised you that.

322
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:45,816
I'll make you a new deal.

323
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,584
What?

324
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:52,624
Take care of her for me.

325
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:02,701
She'll be all alone to run
our house and the tavern.

326
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:10,440
You take care of Anna while I'm gone

327
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,644
and I will forgive you your debt.

328
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:14,981
I don't need your forgiveness.

329
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:21,787
You are her husband, Selah.

330
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:26,324
And I'm going to repay my debt.

00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:39,484
This is all very secret.

357
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,352
This is war.
You never know who's listening.

358
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:45,790
Some intelligence for you, John.

359
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:48,360
England controls the harbor,

360
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:51,228
a bunch of blokes in red out there,

361
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:53,362
big navy behind 'em.

362
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,128
Thank you.

363
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,463
This is why you're worth
every penny,

364
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:02,330
no matter what
General Clinton says.

365
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:05,969
- Oh, what's that?
- A test.

366
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,705
Not for me.

367
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:09,740
For my source
within the rebel camp.

368
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:13,308
It's the location of a
secret store in Connecticut,

369
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,811
a safe house.

370
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,882
We want you to give it
the treatment

371
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:19,485
you gave the Continental Dragoons.

372
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,388
Scraps.

373
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,558
Feed it to your Regulars.

374
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:25,963
If the intelligence
continues to prove true,

375
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:29,000
I can trust his word
on targets with higher value...

376
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:33,168
- (Tinkling)
- ...like Washington.

377
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
Who is this mythical
source of yours, John?

378
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:42,843
Someone I know?

379
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,012
You won't do it?

380
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:52,089
- For double, we will.
- (Chuckling)

381
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,657
Recompense for the last test.

382
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,425
Recompense? You lost one man.

383
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,861
And a coat.

384
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:04,332
And a bonnet.

385
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:13,982
__

386
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,413
(Grunts)

387
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:22,517
(Frogs croaking)

388
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,901
- (Click)
- Hello?

389
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:44,371
(Gasps)

390
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:46,274
- Don't bloody move.
- Wait, wait.

391
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:47,841
I only came here to trade.

392
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,074
I've got cabbage.
Fresh cabbage, four bushel.

393
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:54,910
Four bushel?
You got nothing I want, Woody.

394
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:57,311
- Woody?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,377
- Caleb!
- (Laughs)

396
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,711
Let me look at that boy.
Look at that face.

397
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,211
- Caleb Brewster.
- (Laughs)

398
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:07,681
Right, I was hoping to see
someone I knew come across.

399
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:10,914
But this privateer here,
this pirate of produce...

400
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:13,852
- Come here! (Grunts)
- ...this Viking of vegetables!

401
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,222
(Laughing)

402
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:18,028
Vintage Brewster.

403
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:22,733
- What's Greenland like?
- Greenland?

404
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,334
- Yeah.
- It ain't green.

405
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,268
- Oh.
- Aye.

406
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,635
Well, it's right up your alley,
though, isn't it, Caleb?

407
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,871
- Aye.
- Harpoons and darkness

408
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:32,239
and vomiting seamen in boats
and all that stuff.

409
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:34,807
And more lucre than you've
ever seen, farm boy.

410
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:37,109
Outside this black market, of course.

411
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:40,677
Where else am I gonna trade
this finest cask of Madeira

412
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:43,816
for a head of Setauket cabbage?

413
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,850
All because of those
poor souls in the Bowery

414
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:47,716
can't get no healthy greens.

415
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,652
And those across the Hudson

416
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:53,125
can't get no decent box of tea.

417
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,059
I never said I was trading for tea.

418
00:28:57,228 --> 00:29:00,298
I do have silk, though, from Cathay.

419
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:02,201
Pounds, Caleb.

420
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,805
My haul there, it's worth 20.

421
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,941
(Laughs)

422
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,855
I'll pay you double that
in Continental dollars.

423
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,545
(Scoffs)
No, you're fine.

424
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:12,715
I've already wiped my arse today.
Thanks, Caleb.

425
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:15,018
Now I gotta be heading back.

426
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

427
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,194
You're in such a hurry
to leave your old friend, huh?

428
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:25,203
Who knows when we'll
see each other again?

429
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:29,143
You know I can't
show my face back home.

430
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:32,314
You know, I hear that
they tore out the pulpit

431
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:33,880
from Reverend Tallmadge's church.

432
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:37,215
Ripped out the pews,
made it into barracks.

433
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:38,786
Is that true?

434
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:45,626
How many are stationed there?

435
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,829
Look, I just keep my eye
on my crop, mostly.

436
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:52,796
When you're not smuggling it.

437
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,164
No, this was a onetime deal.

438
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,634
Onetime?

439
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,502
You won't see my face again
until the war is over.

440
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,443
15.

441
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:06,878
12.

442
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:08,747
(Inhales sharply)

443
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,852
(Sighs)

444
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:14,022
All right, 12 and that silk.

445
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,202
(Muffled)
Mrs. Strong.

446
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,236
Mrs. Strong.

447
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,069
You all right?

448
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:40,076
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I didn't hear you.

449
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,746
Captain.

450
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,985
I purchased Captain Joyce's commission
in the wake of his death.

451
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,918
Death?

452
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:51,887
His body was found this morning
in a field with his throat slit.

453
00:30:51,921 --> 00:30:54,459
You haven't heard?

454
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:57,132
No, I...

455
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,268
I've been at home.

456
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:02,369
Have you seen Abraham Woodhull?

457
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:06,009
What? No.

458
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,912
Why are you asking me this?

459
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,414
An officer in
His Majesty's Army is dead

460
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,450
following an altercation
with your husband

461
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:14,089
and with Mr. Woodhull.

462
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,762
Now, your husband has been
shipped off to prison

463
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:19,463
and Mr. Woodhull
is nowhere to be found.

464
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:22,133
(Breathing heavily)

465
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,011
I meant no...

466
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,149
Wait.

467
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,586
Accept my apology.

468
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,927
I know how you must feel...

469
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,428
with your husband gone,

470
00:31:45,463 --> 00:31:48,001
in your house alone.

471
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:52,574
I can only imagine your distress.

472
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:58,283
You need someone to protect you.

473
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:02,454
Captain, I beg you,
if you are a gentleman,

474
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:05,658
let me attend to my house in peace.

475
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,735
Thank you.

476
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,171
I shall have my laundry
ready by week's end.

477
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,240
This is my house, too.

478
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:19,912
I'm to be quartered here
by order of Major Hewlett.

479
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:22,982
I've already chosen which room.

480
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:33,098
(Insects chirping)

481
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,845
(Snoring)

482
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,026
- (Gunshot)
- (Gasps)

483
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,897
I'm not armed. Not armed.

484
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,464
Identify yourself.

485
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:33,268
Abraham Woodhull, from Setauket.

486
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:37,972
- Nice night for a sail, Woodhull?
- I thought so, yeah.

487
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:40,105
What's under the tarp?

488
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:47,052
Could I maybe interest you
gentlemen in a nice bolt of silk?

489
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:51,486
You're under arrest by order
of the Continental Congress.

490
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,254
- Charge is illegal trade.
- Wait! Wait!

491
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:58,489
(Muffled yelling)

492
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:00,360
You're not just a smuggler, are you?

493
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:03,127
(Coughing, gasping)

494
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:05,096
(Muffled yelling)

495
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:08,301
- (Water dripping)
- (Abe coughing)

496
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:12,334
Enough! That's enough.

497
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,404
(Gasping)

498
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:19,875
I know him. He's not a spy.

499
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,908
(Abe coughing)

500
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:26,412
Your name came through
on a dispatch, Mr. Woodhull.

501
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,118
Ben?

502
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,554
Tallmadge, is that you?

503
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:33,854
I set out from camp immediately.

504
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:41,695
It is you. It is you, thank God.

505
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,766
Thank God.

506
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:48,140
Ben, can you get me out of here?

507
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,708
Of course you can. Look at you.

508
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:52,880
- All right, just slow down.
- Look at you.

509
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:55,380
Ben, you know me.
I'm no smuggler.

510
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:57,783
- This is the first time...
- I know that, I know.

511
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:00,952
I told them
that you were a man of integrity

512
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:03,386
and that you'd make
every effort to cooperate.

513
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,620
Thank you.

514
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:06,986
Cooperate?

515
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,119
They need to know
who your contact was,

516
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:11,486
to make sure you weren't
giving aid to the enemy.

517
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:14,491
Ben, who is the enemy?

518
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,341
I told them that you
would never do something like that.

519
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,293
You know both sides
close an eye to this trade.

520
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,895
Trust me,
the enemy did not benefit here.

521
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:25,633
I do, I do trust you, Abe,
and I can get you out,

522
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:28,570
but you have to tell me who your
contact was at Frog's Point.

523
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:34,577
What's your true purpose here?

524
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:39,582
You didn't ride all this way
just to get me out of trouble.

525
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:43,454
This is a pardon for your release

526
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,122
signed by Governor Trumbull...

527
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:47,157
whom I convinced you were a friend.

528
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:48,760
Yeah...

529
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:50,265
if I tell you who I traded with.

530
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,779
Look, this shouldn't be a negotiation.

531
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:53,268
Well, good, because
I'm not giving the name

532
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,369
of someone who's just trying to get by

533
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,409
and who doesn't deserve
to be thrown in this hell

534
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,977
by the same Congress that
declares for our freedom.

535
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:03,411
I won't do it.

536
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,052
Why are you really here?

537
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:20,957
As I said, I have a permit signed by
the governor for you to return home.

538
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:25,458
He signed it after receiving word
from General Washington himself.

539
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:29,430
- Washington...
- (Chatting)

540
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,866
Look, we're of a mind

541
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,366
that if you can smuggle cabbage,

542
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,869
you can smuggle something
more valuable...

543
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,738
information.

544
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:43,040
- You've come to enlist me?
- To recruit you.

545
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,376
(Chuckles)

546
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,977
Abe, Congress does a lot more
than just declare for your freedom.

547
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:52,349
They fight for it. I fight for it.
Men die for it.

548
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,151
Well, I don't ask anyone
to fight for me.

549
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:56,652
I'm asking you.

550
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:59,688
Come on, we grew up together, Abe,

551
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:02,024
and I remember who you are,
even if you've forgotten.

552
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,195
All I ask is that you
fight for what you believe in.

553
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,548
I don't know what information
I could possibly...

554
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:13,073
Military... number of men,
number of cannons,

555
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,076
naval transports,
whether they're moving,

556
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,079
if so, where, what arrivals...

557
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:18,647
Ben, do you realize
what you're asking me?

558
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:20,986
You won't have to risk
crossing the Belt again.

559
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,687
Instead, you'll signal for a courier.

560
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,854
I have a system all worked out.

561
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,864
Well, have you worked out
how to explain my absence?

562
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,701
I was supposed to be back yesterday.

563
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:34,802
Use the truth.

564
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,271
You were on the black market.

565
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:37,840
Both sides close an eye to that trade.

566
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:45,179
Well, I shall need proof of that.

567
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,114
The silk...

568
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,952
and the 12 pounds.

569
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:52,686
(Scoffs)

570
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:01,061
(Coins jingle)

571
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:04,962
So, that's it?

572
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,200
You're free.

573
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,822
(Water sloshing)

574
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:52,258
All right.

575
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:55,326
(Breathing heavily)

576
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,761
(Shouts)

577
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:06,768
(Groans)

578
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,337
Robeson, over here!

579
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:11,305
Robeson, I need help!

580
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,705
(Groans)

581
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,653
(Panting)

582
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,279
There!

583
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:44,547
SOLDIER:
Stand still!

584
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,619
Wait, no. No, no, wait, wait.

585
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:49,019
Wait, no, no.
Wait, you've got the wrong...

586
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,986
(Groans)

587
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:52,886
I've been mugged.

588
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,989
And now you'll be hanged.

589
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:09,471
We found him wandering.
Looks like he's been in a fight.

590
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:11,073
Abraham, where have you been?

591
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,408
I've been looking all over for you.

592
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:13,942
We'll ask the questions, Judge.

593
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,675
I will ask the questions.

594
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,443
Captain Joyce was found
murdered this Tuesday morning,

595
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:20,308
and you have been missing
since... since...

596
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:23,646
Since Monday evening
when he was released.

597
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,517
(Panting)
Captain Joyce is dead?

598
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:28,519
Where were you?

599
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:34,256
I was with the enemy, sir.

600
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:39,324
I set out early Tuesday with a
cargo of cabbage from my field.

601
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:42,993
My aim was to barter it
on the London Trade.

602
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:46,828
And I did so for 12 pound sterling
and a bundle of silk.

603
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,228
On my return home that night,

604
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:52,268
I was overtaken by a brig
sloop just off the coast.

605
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:56,439
The crew claimed that I'd defied
the authority of Congress

606
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,943
and their justice was to rob me

607
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:00,579
and beat me and throw me
overboard, sir.

608
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:03,247
It seems like they also
robbed you of any proof

609
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,582
of your tragic tale.

610
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,789
I concealed it before
they boarded my scow.

611
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:17,762
- The money they took.
- Damn bloody fool!

612
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:20,565
Given to greed and
deserved what you got.

613
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,866
Sir, marked dispatch
just arrived for you.

614
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:26,503
Did you note the identity
of the assailants?

615
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:29,004
I know some of them, sir,
but it was very dark...

616
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:31,309
Smuggling is a crime,
and you will answer for it,

617
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:34,044
but more pressing are the
activities of these privateers.

618
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,614
Major...
(Whispers)

619
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:39,485
Yes, return to your home,
see to your family,

620
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,385
and then report
to your father's at 7:00,

621
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,620
and there we'll discuss
names and other details.

622
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:46,691
Captain, escort
Mr. Woodhull from the fort

623
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,494
unmolested.

624
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:50,460
Yes, sir.

625
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,147
Just because
you confessed to smuggling

626
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,582
doesn't give you an alibi for Joyce.

627
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,149
I've never killed anyone.

628
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,852
I have. Plenty just like you.

629
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:21,821
You may have fooled the major,
but not me.

630
00:42:28,224 --> 00:42:30,324
Travel safe!

631
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:02,918
(Gasps)

632
00:43:02,953 --> 00:43:04,487
What are you doing here?

633
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:06,323
Giving you this.

634
00:43:06,357 --> 00:43:07,891
It's what I owe Selah.

635
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:09,695
You can use it to buy his parole.

636
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,234
- What happened?
- I have to go.

637
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:16,302
Wait, wait, I can't take this.

638
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:17,704
- Why not?
- I can't take this.

639
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:19,473
- Why?
- He'll find it.

640
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:21,210
Who?

641
00:43:25,217 --> 00:43:26,749
Simcoe.

642
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,886
The Welshman.

643
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,155
- The one who put a pistol to your head.
- Yeah. I know of him.

644
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:35,525
- He's being billeted here and...
- What's he done to you?

645
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,897
- Has he touched you?
- He...

646
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:44,134
I hear him outside my door at night.

647
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,902
And he's been in my room when
I haven't, I'm certain of it.

648
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,808
And if he finds I'm hiding silver
you took off a dead soldier...

649
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:51,976
Wait, what?

650
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,477
You think I killed Captain Joyce?
You believe that?

651
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:58,081
You know me.
I didn't kill anyone.

652
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:03,585
What soldier do you know of that
carries 12 pounds sterling on his person?

653
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,387
- Tell me that.
- None.

654
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,290
And no farmer, either.
Where did you get it?

655
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:10,259
- (Door creaks)
- Come here, come here.

656
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:15,568
Look, I had to trade some goods.

657
00:44:15,603 --> 00:44:18,238
Caleb Brewster is running a shop out
of his whale boat on Devil's Belt.

658
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:21,140
- I had to trade with him.
- Caleb?

659
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:22,909
You saw him? How is he?

660
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:24,711
He's the same as ever.

661
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,381
He's unshaven, he's insane.

662
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,051
(Chuckles)

663
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:32,118
I saw Ben Tallmadge, too.

664
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,354
What? You saw him?

665
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:36,758
- They were together?
- No, no.

666
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:38,327
Ben is a...

667
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:40,761
he's a Connecticut Dragoon now.

668
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:43,229
He's got a shiny helmet and all.

669
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,669
He tried to recruit me
for a secret mission.

670
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:50,235
- Against the British?
- Don't worry, I won't do it.

671
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:52,472
Why not?

672
00:44:55,244 --> 00:44:57,446
What are you waiting for?

673
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:01,920
What more do they need
to take from us?

674
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:05,222
- (Jingles)
- Anna.

675
00:45:05,257 --> 00:45:07,292
Anna?

676
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:16,001
(Coins jingle)

677
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:30,349
Whatever you're doing, don't.

678
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,855
We can't afford to lose you.

679
00:45:38,157 --> 00:45:40,326
We?

680
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,034
I can't.

681
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,553
HEWLETT:
Excellent, as always.

682
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,055
Credit goes to Aberdeen.

683
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,890
I merely raise the pork.
She performs the alchemy.

684
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,925
You've hardly touched yours.

685
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,796
It's hard to eat
on a guilty stomach, I suppose.

686
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,298
My apologies.

687
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:14,433
Abraham, what I could not
say earlier

688
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:17,735
from my pulpit, as it were,

689
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:20,238
is that I view your crime
as a mere symptom

690
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:22,441
of a more serious disease

691
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,608
that is afflicting these colonies...

692
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:27,077
- Anarchy.
- You mean self-rule.

693
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:30,481
I mean chaos masquerading as freedom.

694
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:33,514
An excuse for criminal activity
and every man for himself.

695
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:35,919
Well said. If these upstarts

696
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:37,923
were truly concerned
with your liberty,

697
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:39,958
they wouldn't encourage
smuggling on the one hand

698
00:46:39,993 --> 00:46:41,961
and then roll you on the other.

699
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:44,633
So, we all must pay a tax.

700
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,704
The question is just who will collect?

701
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:54,240
"Oh, God, that one might
read the book of fate"

702
00:46:54,274 --> 00:46:57,342
and see the revolution of the times

703
00:46:57,377 --> 00:46:59,411
make mountains level.

704
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:02,582
"And the continent,
weary of solid firmness..."

705
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:05,616
BOTH:
"...melt itself into the sea."

706
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:08,485
Ah, your father is the only man
that I can find here

707
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,453
with an affection for the humanities.

708
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:12,657
Did you pass your trivium
onto your son?

709
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:14,629
No, man is above the law.

710
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:18,233
That is what you taught me,
and I will gladly accept

711
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,837
whatever punishment you deem
fit for my forgetting it.

712
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,438
I doubt you can afford
to pay the fine.

713
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:26,570
(Sighs) It pains me to
recommend imprisonment,

714
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:28,335
but we must have no favorites.

715
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:33,740
Ahem, there may be a temporary salve.

716
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:37,346
His Majesty has decreed that
any of his errant subjects

717
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,648
may be forgiven their transgressions

718
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,983
if they pledge an oath...

719
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:44,254
- An oath of loyalty, yes.
- Yes.

720
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:45,924
That is ideal.

721
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:47,592
It's a public oath and...

722
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:49,193
- (Snaps)
- Paper.

723
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:51,162
When it becomes clear
that your cooperation

724
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:52,531
assisted in the capture of the enemy,

725
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:54,738
then any doubt will be put to rest.

726
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,179
Sir?

727
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,947
The names of the men
who attacked you, remember?

728
00:48:10,552 --> 00:48:13,186
Yes, ahem.

729
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:17,793
The, um... They were boys
from Hempstead.

730
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,130
- Presbyterians.
- Mm.

731
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:22,266
Their names were

732
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,103
Daniel Taylor,

733
00:48:25,137 --> 00:48:27,440
William Washburn,

734
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:30,343
Matthew Mitchell.

735
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:34,412
And then there was
another one called Simon.

736
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:38,384
Didn't catch his family name,
but he was a fat one.

737
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:42,390
He was mean, with his head
shaved to the scalp.

738
00:48:42,425 --> 00:48:45,764
HEWLETT:
Excellent.

739
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,932
I shall pass this on to Captain Simcoe

740
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,272
with instructions that if he should
encounter any of these men on his raid,

741
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:55,510
- he will give them no quarter.
- Raid?

742
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:01,745
The dispatch that I received
today was from York City.

743
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:05,081
It's intelligence regarding a
rebel safe house across the Sound

744
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,416
where they're launching
their strikes from.

745
00:49:09,484 --> 00:49:12,353
We'll cross at night,
just like your attackers.

746
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:14,954
(Muted)
Silent approach,

747
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:17,190
bayonets fixed.

748
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:19,794
Give them their own medicine.

749
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,361
RICHARD:
Are you all right, son?

750
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:26,431
Not feeling true?

751
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,001
Oh, you must be exhausted.

752
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,968
Why don't you off to bed?

753
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:35,571
Yes. Please excuse me.

754
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,844
(Door opens)

755
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,214
(Figurines clatter)

756
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,493
(Faint chatter)

757
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:07,962
ANDRE'S VOICE:
"You will have heard, dear sir,"

758
00:51:07,986 --> 00:51:09,822
I doubt not long before this
can have reached you

759
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:11,825
that the rebels have been
routed from Harlem

760
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,358
and the whole house of York Island
has been made safe

761
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:15,726
from further harassment."

762
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,197
Harlem? This is ancient news.

763
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:22,433
- (Bell rings)
- HEWLETT: Aberdeen.

764
00:51:30,326 --> 00:51:32,926
ANDRE'S VOICE: "I harbor no doubt
that we will seize high command"

765
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,386
before winter sets in."

766
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:41,226
"Rebels' safe house. Connecticut,

767
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,797
Meigs Harbor. Show no quarter."

768
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,844
(Soldiers cheering, chattering)

769
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,915
<i>♪ I don't want to go to war ♪</i>

770
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:04,551
<i>♪ I'd rather stay at home ♪</i>

771
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:07,087
<i>♪ Around the streets to roam ♪</i>

772
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:10,920
<i>♪ And live on the earnings
of a highborn whore... ♪</i>

773
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:13,288
(Faint singing continues)

774
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:17,957
(Muffled yell)

775
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:20,025
You only have a few moments,
so I must be quick and clear

776
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:21,993
and you must hear every word.

777
00:52:23,928 --> 00:52:27,263
I think I might've found a way to
rid ourselves of Captain Simcoe.

778
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:28,967
- Simcoe?
- Yes.

779
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:30,534
He's upstairs. Are you insane?

780
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,967
But no one will know we're involved.

781
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:36,434
Ben Tallmadge has devised a way
so we can signal him in secret.

782
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:38,369
Ben? He's coming here?

783
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:40,870
No, he'll send a courier.

784
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:42,871
We'll meet in one of the
coves along the bay

785
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:44,939
and you will signal him which one.

786
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,707
I will?

787
00:52:46,742 --> 00:52:49,342
Yes, your home backs onto the water.

788
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:53,078
When you hang a black
petticoat from your peg line,

789
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:54,712
they'll know when I'm ready to meet.

790
00:52:54,747 --> 00:52:58,248
- Black petticoat.
- Look, it's not my plan.

791
00:52:58,283 --> 00:53:00,753
It's some idea of Ben's with...

792
00:53:00,787 --> 00:53:03,557
with General Washington,
but it's how we get Simcoe.

793
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:06,226
(Footsteps descending stairs)

794
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,893
Need any help down here?

795
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:11,731
Uh, yes, thank you.
A bit heavy for me.

796
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:20,610
Barrel.

797
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,746
"Over a barrel."

798
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:26,849
(Simcoe chuckles)
You know what saying I fancy?

799
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:30,756
"Over a barrel."

800
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:35,259
Do you like that one?

801
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:38,432
- Your men are thirsty.
- They can wait.

802
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:43,703
They do what I tell them to do...

803
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:47,472
because they know
what's good for them.

804
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,445
I expect.

805
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:58,380
You're captain now.

806
00:53:58,414 --> 00:54:02,584
I took note of the
epaulette on your coat.

807
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,986
I'll take special care not to damage it

808
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,956
when I finish your laundry.

809
00:54:13,992 --> 00:54:18,760
I'll hang it myself,
just as you requested.

810
00:54:20,495 --> 00:54:23,463
It'll be waiting
for you Saturday morning.

811
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:26,368
I'll be gone Saturday.
Back Monday.

812
00:54:26,403 --> 00:54:27,801
Monday, then.

813
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:32,806
Now, my husband and I
used to lift these together.

814
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:36,243
Shall we?

815
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:38,513
No need.

816
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:53,197
(Knife clatters)

817
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:11,239
What she doin'?

818
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,226
(Blade rings)

819
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,895
Quicker this time, huh?

820
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,832
Oh, Jesus, Caleb.
What are you doing here?

821
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,935
How's about you lower
the butter knife first?

822
00:55:43,308 --> 00:55:44,945
- What of Ben?
- Huh?

823
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,815
Ben Tallmadge, did he catch you?

824
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:49,449
- Did he find you?
- He didn't find me.

825
00:55:49,484 --> 00:55:50,819
We found you.

826
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:52,623
What?

827
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:54,525
We found you.

828
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,898
- You?
- Yeah.

829
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:02,737
- You're the courier?
- That's right, now he gets it.

830
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:05,440
But we... back at Frog's Point...

831
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:08,307
Yeah, that was the first interview.

832
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,409
The second was with Ben.

833
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:13,615
You passed muster when you
refused to give up my name.

834
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:16,586
Just want you to know
I was very touched by that.

835
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,555
You set me up?

836
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,729
You bastard!

837
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:25,769
Get off! Get off!

838
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:29,610
I'm Second Company,
Fourth Battalion,

839
00:56:29,644 --> 00:56:31,713
New York Regiment, all right?

840
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:34,780
I'm assigned to Captain Tallmadge
for special detail.

841
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:39,086
Anything you give me
goes straight to Ben.

842
00:56:40,987 --> 00:56:43,021
- Who else knows my name?
- No one.

843
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:44,789
Speak true!
Who else knows my name?

844
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:47,727
No one.

845
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:49,530
Get off.

846
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:53,470
Or hers!

847
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:04,447
Now, she put a petticoat
on that line for a reason.

848
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,480
What?

849
00:57:08,284 --> 00:57:11,851
I think you know something, Abe.

850
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,087
I think you wanna tell me.

851
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:17,257
Huh?

852
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:20,293
Come here.

853
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:23,698
You get a taste for boiling these
lobsters and you'll want more.

854
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:27,201
Yeah? And once I pass this up
the ladder, they'll want more.

855
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,739
Washington's been trying to get a man
inside the city since Howe took it over.

856
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:34,309
Well, he'll have to find
someone else, then, won't he?

857
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,144
This was a onetime deal for me.

858
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:38,978
Just like the last one?

859
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:45,453
Are you gonna tell me
what you know or not?

860
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:58,333
I, Abraham Woodhull,
do sincerely...

861
00:57:58,367 --> 00:58:00,268
Louder.

862
00:58:06,008 --> 00:58:08,842
(Loudly)
I, Abraham Woodhull...

863
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:15,712
do sincerely and faithfully
promise and swear

864
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:22,031
that I will bear true allegiance
to His Majesty, King George III.

865
00:58:25,822 --> 00:58:29,589
And that, with heart and hands,

866
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:32,291
life and goods...

867
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,631
will maintain and defend
His Majesty's government...

868
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,302
Get ready.

869
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:45,906
Present.

870
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:48,501
...and the laws of the
province of New York...

871
00:58:48,536 --> 00:58:49,934
SIMCOE:
Fire!

872
00:58:52,103 --> 00:58:54,172
...against all traitorous conspiracies...

873
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:57,544
- SIMCOE: Regulars, present...
- ...and attempts...

874
00:58:57,578 --> 00:59:00,346
Fire!

875
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:02,381
ABE:
...shall be made against his person...

876
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:04,150
(Shouting)

877
00:59:04,184 --> 00:59:06,822
ABE:
...crown

878
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:09,058
or dignity.

879
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:11,494
- (Gunshots)
- (Screaming)

880
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:16,033
And I will do my utmost endeavor...

881
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:17,765
(Grunts)

882
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,370
ABE: ...and make known to His Majesty
and his successors...

883
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,974
(Gunfire continues)

884
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:32,750
Come on!

885
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:36,553
(Shouting)

886
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:46,200
...all treasons
and traitorous conspiracies

887
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:50,136
which I shall know to be against,
or any of them.

888
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,606
(Gasping)

889
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,742
(Groans)

890
00:59:59,646 --> 01:00:02,480
(Groaning)

891
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:04,384
Captain Simcoe?

892
01:00:04,418 --> 01:00:06,422
Where'd you come from?

893
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:09,558
A little place you may have
heard of called Setauket.

894
01:00:11,494 --> 01:00:15,494
- God save the King!
- ALL: God save the King.

895
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,831
(Scattered applause)

896
01:00:38,283 --> 01:00:40,085
Tie him down.

897
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:57,233
What's that for?

898
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:01,006
I'm sending my best wishes
to Robert Rogers.

899
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:04,377
I was half hoping
he'd show up today.

900
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,378
Oi, well done.

901
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,181
Yeah, you, too.

902
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,584
This doesn't feel right, Ben.

903
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:14,718
Yeah, I know.

904
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:18,291
General Scott asked me if I thought

905
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:20,892
there was a breach within our ranks.

906
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:24,027
I have no better way to explain how
the redcoats even learned about...

907
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:27,298
No, Ben, I mean that
Woody came through for us,

908
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:30,431
and his sole request,
we choose not to honor.

909
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,903
We will.

910
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:38,307
After we pull the truth out of him.

911
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:41,705
He might know which friend
is truly our enemy.

912
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,641
All right, men, let's move out!

913
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:57,596
We should collect a five-pound
of flour while we're here.

914
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,054
All right, all right.

915
01:02:02,225 --> 01:02:05,125
I thought that you
presented yourself well.

916
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:08,095
Thank you, thank you.

917
01:02:08,129 --> 01:02:11,269
I thought this little fella
did awfully well as well.

918
01:02:12,572 --> 01:02:15,073
- Not so much as a peep.
- Ha, that's my boy.

919
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:17,877
That's my boy.
Come here, come here.

920
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:19,947
Come here to Daddy. There you go.

921
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,583
There you go.

922
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:24,086
You all right? Huh?

923
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,521
You like to listen
to your father, Sprout?

924
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:28,093
Huh? You like to listen to your father?

925
01:02:28,128 --> 01:02:30,464
A lost art.

926
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:34,032
That was impressive.

927
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:36,466
Well, I was very happy to do it.

928
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:38,335
Were you?

929
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:44,279
There are no boys in
Hempstead with those names.

930
01:02:46,148 --> 01:02:49,051
- Come again?
- I know you lied.

931
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:58,358
Don't try and deny it.

932
01:02:58,392 --> 01:03:01,993
You lied to Major Hewlett in my house,

933
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,461
in front of me.

934
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:06,831
Did you kill Captain Joyce?

935
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:10,400
Is that what you believe?

936
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,699
I don't know what you're hiding,

937
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:16,469
but I do know that you will tell me
because you will have no choice.

938
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:18,371
HEWLETT:
Richard!

939
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:25,340
I'm done protecting you.

940
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:38,517
(Thomas coos)

941
