He said he understands and it's OK.

Colonel Braddock...
is it not true that during the war

179
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,489
there was a price on your head
of 5,000 American dollars?

180
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,452
It was more like $20,000.

181
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,079
What?

182
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,332
Why don't you tell us
why there was a price on my head?

183
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,751
For your war crimes, of course.

184

The atrocities,
as documented in front of you,

were the real reasons
why Colonel Braddock was held here!

189
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:56,232
He was not a prisoner of war,
but a common criminal!

trying to get you recalled.

And the President is outraged...
publicly.

199

Ah, Miss Fitzgerald,
you look lovely tonight.

200
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,983
Uh, Colonel Braddock, there is a
question I've been wanting to ask you.

201
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,487
Is it true that you let
ten of your men die in prison

202
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,200
all because you alone refused
to admit your war crimes?

203
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,335
You are the most undiplomatic man
I have ever met.

204
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,091
I'm not running for office. Besides,
you don't know anything about me.

Missing in action for seven years,
escaping last year.

210
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,606
And you are now in Saigon
at the request of the President

211
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,484
to see if there are
any more Braddocks in Vietnam.

212
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,074
Like I said,
you don't know anything about me.

213
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,998
How about a nightcap?

214
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,963
Yeah, sure.

Yeah. It should be quite a night, too.

219
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,909
Now, look, Braddock, just because...

220
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:39,455

for a nightcap, not...

00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,798
You said "we."
You said "we're going back."

353
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:29,801
You owe me, Tuck. I need your help.

354
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,806
Yeah, I owe you.

355
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:37,058
More than once.

356
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,982
All right, you bastard.
I'll take you in.

357
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,567
But I'm not going ashore.

358
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,860
OK?

359
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,405
OK.

360
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,931
[chatter in foreign language]

361
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:19,976
Getting in is no problem.

362
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:23,479
I've been smuggling cigarettes
and booze for years.

363
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,775
My new Southern Belle's one of the
fastest boats in the water around here.

364
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,654
There she is.

365
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,744
What the hell is that?

366
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:43,875
Like my daddy always said,
don't believe everything you see.

367
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,722
Discourages pirates.

368
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,187
I'll show you something back here.

369
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:17,241
They're Detroit diesels.
Turbocharged, 650 horsepower.

370
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,161
We can hit 21 knots if we have to.

371
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:37,345
M-16s, grenades, C-4, LAW.

372
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,597
You're playing for keeps.

373
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,351
What the hell do you need
an assault raft for?

374
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,771
The camp's in the delta.
A raft is the easiest way in.

375
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:50,024
How come you never mention
getting out?

376
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:54,195
If we can hit the camp without raising
an alarm, we'll go back the way we came.

377
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:57,615
- That's nice. And if not?
- We'll think of something.

378
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,202
Great. Look, you wanna do me a favor?

379
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,037
Next time I ask you something
about the mission,

380
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,873
you don't tell me nothing, OK?
I'd rather not know.

381
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,875
- There is something else.
- What?

382
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,461
We could use a long-range chopper
as a backup.

383
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,005
Now how in hell are we supposed
to manage that?

384
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,800
We'll think of something.

385

386
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,721
Gentlemen,
I can help you with everything,

387
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,224
even the M-16s, but not the raft.

388
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,351
Bullshit, Carlos.
We both know you got one.

389
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:29,856
Got one? Sure, I got one.
I got the only one in all Thailand.

390
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,858
But have you got the money?
That's the question.

391
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,527
Let's see the sucker first,
then we'll talk money.

392
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,655
There she is. Yang!

393
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,911
Quite a unique weapon, eh?

394
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,376
She can run 60 miles an hour,
and, with her mufflers on,

395
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,670
no one can hear you coming.

396
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:56,215
Yeah, too bad a single bullet'll
put her out of commission.

397
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,092
Yang.

398
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,940
It's Kevlar.

399
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,067
Very expensive.

400
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,446
Same material your bulletproof vests
are made out of.

401
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:22,200
It will stop anything,
short of a grenade.

402
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,952
How much?

403
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,081
Twenty thousand American dollars...
for the raft.

404
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,876
The rifles and ammunition...

405
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,794
...I throw in, free.

406
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,638
Five.

407
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,557
Don't be ridiculous.

408
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,810
There is nothing like her
in all of Southeast Asia.

409
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,193
- Seven.
- Seventeen!

410
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,829
Fifteen. No less.

411
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:19,632
Ten.

412
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,012
Deal.

413
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:52,290
- [dance music playing]
- So, if I get this helicopter of yours,

414
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,166
are you willing to pay?

415
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,669
I didn't figure it was free.

416
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,217
- OK, then. What about the marking? US?
- It doesn't matter.

417
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,847
Just make sure I can count on the pilot.

418
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,766
Look around, my friend.

419
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:16,647
In this place, you can count on
people doing anything for money.

No. You promised me
I wouldn't have to get off the raft.

We're coming back on the raft.

533
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:50,849
Braddock?

534
01:27:51,684 --> 01:27:53,102
Is it safe?

01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,401
You guys are going home.

539
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,824
[panting] We're going home?

540
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,076
Damn right!

541
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:52,870
Give me your hand.

542
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:55,164
We're going home!

543
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,253

- How far to the coast?
- About six klicks.

549
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:03,107
Pray the boat's still there.

550

I wouldn't rent you the helicopter
for a million bucks!

588
