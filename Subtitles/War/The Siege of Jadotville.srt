<i>Left turn!</i>

182
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,425
<i>Quick march!</i>

183
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,342
Hey. Hey.

184
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,175
Hey, yes, hey.

185
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:10,550
[reporters clamoring]

186
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:20,758
We welcome the forces
of the United Nations here with open arms

187
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:22,592
but with some confusion.

188
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:26,383
We don't know why you are here
in Africa...

189
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,050
as we are quite capable
of looking after ourselves.

190
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,883
However, we will be thoughtful hosts.

191
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,633
Unless you come here to start trouble,

192
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:37,758
in which case

193
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,717
you will force us to tutor you

194
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,467
on how things are done here in the Congo.

195
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,883
- [reporter] General Tshombe!
- Gentlemen, that's it. We're done.

196
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,508
[Hammarskjöld]
<i>I had a call from Khrushchev earlier.</i>

197
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,800
He reminded me
of the UN's refusal to send in troops

198
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,342
when Lumumba asked me to.

199
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,842
It's amazing how good an atheist is
in inflicting guilt.

200
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,050
[chuckles]

201
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:05,758
Meanwhile,
they're building a wall in Berlin.

202
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,300
I know.

203
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,717
Kennedy called.

204
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,508
[O'Brien] What did the Sun King of Camelot
have to say?

205
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,217
[Hammarskjöld] We can't do anything
in Berlin, Vietnam or Cuba,

206
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,133
but we can defuse the Congo.

207
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,008
And I want you to go.

208
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:24,967
Put an end to General Tshombe's antics.

209
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,133
- Send him a message.
- Excuse me?

210
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,592
I want you to be our man on the ground.

211
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,300
But this thing, this...

212
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:34,467
could lead to another world war.

213
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,550
Yes, and everybody sees that.

214
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,217
So the man who stops it

215
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,967
will get a lot of credit.

216
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:43,300
We'll make up a plan.

217
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,217
What kind of plan?

218
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,842
One with a lot of moving parts

219
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:51,175
that requires a man astute
and hard-headed enough to pull it off.

220
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,550
We each have our part to play in history.

221
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:58,092
Yours is happening right now, Conor.

222
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,008
I believe I can...

223
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,175
accomplish the mission, sir.

224
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,300
Good, Conor.

225
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,133
Good.

226

<i>so I need your assistance,
General de Gaulle.</i>

229
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,425
<i>And what will you give in return?</i>

230
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:27,217
<i>It's in all our interests that the mining

231

<i>My old rival</i>

232
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:32,258
<i>would have nationalized

<i>If I lose power, it might still happen.</i>

234

<i>Your American friends wouldn't like that.</i>

235
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:41,925
<i>Okay, I will send you
1,000 of our best former legionnaires.</i>

236
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,967
<i>The mining companies
will hire them as security officers,</i>

237

Cheese!

248
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,800
[Gorman] You're gorgeous.

249
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,508
[Prendergast] Calling it a compound
is a joke.

250
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,508
We've got exposure on three approaches.
Overlooked from the south.

251
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,800
And there's a road splitting it in two.

252
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:12,383
We're wide open.

253
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,133
Okay.

254
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:18,383
Do we have shovels?

255
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:20,717
We do.

256
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,258
Have the men up for drill at 0600.

257
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:24,925
Yes, sir.

258
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,467
[McEntee] Dr O'Brien, how was your flight?

259
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,258
Very pleasant, thank you, General.

260
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,758
We have a lot to talk about.

261
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,883
We do. May I introduce General Raja?

262
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,633
- Welcome to the Congo, sir.
- Good to meet you.

263
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,508
[O'Brien] <i>Tshombe has crossed the line.</i>
<i>We need to stop him.</i>

264
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:04,467
We're beyond the point of no return.

265
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,800
You are therefore authorized to implement
Operation Morthor immediately.

266
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:11,467
I have decided
we should take aggressive action

267
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,133
to reclaim key buildings held by Tshombe.

268
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:16,175
There's a time for talking,

269
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:17,425
a time for being tough.

270
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,508
This is the latter.

271
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:21,967
Your soldiers have the distinction

272
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,842
of being the only troops
with any real military experience.

273
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,550
The others will be looking to them
to set an example.

274
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,467
Show them how decisive you can be.

275
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,300
This place is amazing.

276
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,467

285
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:43,008
[Gorman] It's a fucking snake!

[laughter]

289
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:51,092
These ones aren't poisonous.
Did you not read the info packs?

290
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:54,050
With all due respect, boss,
are you sure they're not poisonous?

291
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,842
- [Quinlan] Get out.
- Look out!

292
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:04,967
Out, you fuckers!

293
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,883
St Patrick himself.

294
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:07,842
[laughter]

295
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,842
[soldier] Back to it.

296
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,508
[Prendergast]
Weapons are state of the art.

297
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:51,717
For World War II, anyway.

298
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,092
These things... plastic.

299
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,217
Useless.

300
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,883
CQMS says we have food provisions,
enough for two days.

301
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,383
The men have their own rations, but mostly
biscuits you wouldn't feed to your dog.

302
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,133
Time to hunt and gather.

303
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,925
Let's go.

304
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:15,050
Yes, sir.

305
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:35,883
[man] How can I help you?

306
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,508
I'll take as much
as that truck outside can carry.

307
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:40,633
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,258
Where's the best bar in town?

309
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,508
At the end of the street.

310
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:49,258
I don't think you will find
any of the bars here to your liking.

311
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,383
Why is that?

312
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,758
I don't mean to be rude,

313
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:57,425
but you do know
that you're not welcome here, don't you?

314
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,383
I'll take one of these.

315
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,592
The people around here
are not particularly happy

316
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:07,258
with how things are working out.

317
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,508
They didn't like Lumumba taking over.

318
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,383
But he was elected by the people.

319
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:15,467
Who didn't put a lot of thought
into what would happen to the mines

320
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,883
when he took over.

321
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,925
Nationalizing the minerals,

322
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,758
throwing out the mining companies.

323
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,758
What did he expect to happen?

324
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,550
I don't suppose
he expected to be assassinated.

325
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,675
I love this country,

326
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,175
but you don't tell the companies

327
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:32,217
that have been making money here
for decades

328
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,050
that they're suddenly out of business.

329
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:37,342
I didn't tell them anything, madame,
but...

330
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:40,008
sorry that we're not welcome here.

331
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,008
Thank you for your time.

332
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:49,967
Let's get a drink.

333
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:55,758
[laughter and chattering]

334
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,633
[chattering stops]

335
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,342
[Quinlan] Three beers.

336
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,342
[Faulques] Won't you have a real drink?

337
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,592
What would that be?

338
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,133
French cognac.

339
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,175
Perhaps you'll have one with me?

340
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,842
Why are you here, Commandant?

341
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,092
To protect the locals
from a man who stole power

342
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:10,467
from the legitimately elected
prime minister.

343
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:13,717
Why are you here?

344
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:17,008
To protect the interest of the mines.

345
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,675
Plus Paris is freezing this time of year.

346
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:25,758
To Paris.

347
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:27,675
To Paris.

348
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,217
These people you're here to protect...

349
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,800
are you sure they want you?

350
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:43,925
I have my doubts.

351
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,008
But I also have my orders.

352
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,467
You follow all orders?

353
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:51,550
I'm a soldier.

354
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,175
That's how it's done.

355
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:59,175
I looked up the Irish army
to see how many wars they have been in.

356
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,133
You know what I found?

357
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:05,467

538
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:55,008
[gunfire]

539
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,425
Get to the trenches! Man your positions!

540
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:03,675
[soldier] Move, move!

541
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,425
[commotion]

542
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:14,008
[soldier] Go! Go!

543
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,550
You four, to me! Come on, move!

544
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,633
[soldier] Weapons ready!
Check your ammo!

545
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,717
[soldier] Fire!

546
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:29,217
[Prendergast] I want fire superiority!

547
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,050
- Corporal, get the Bren up front, now!
- [soldier] Mortar men, man your posts!

548
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:37,883
- Open fire!
- Hold down the left flank!

549
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,092
Sniper! Catch me up.

550
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,758
Fuckers came out of nowhere
and started shooting!

551
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:45,342
You're caught up, boss.

552
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:08,758
Move, move, move!

553
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,217
[soldier] Man your trenches!

554
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Sir.

555
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,883
They'll approach from high ground,
south.

556
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,133
Get ten of our best out there
to refuse the flank.

557
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:32,133
[Prendergast] The south flank? Sure, sir?

558
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:33,258
Yes. Now, go!

559
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:37,300
Yes, sir. Sniper, on me.

560
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,675
Reidy, follow me! Now!

561
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,675
Go now!

562
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:06,925
[cries out]

563
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,383
[Gorman yelling]

564
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:13,967
[Hegarty] Let me look at you.
Get the Bren back up! Let me look!

565
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,550
It's a scratch. You'll be fine.

566
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:19,050
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

567
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,300
You're fine, all right?

568
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,383
- I'm fine.
- Get back up. Get back up.

569
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,967
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

570
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,050
Sir!

571
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,967
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

572
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,342
We're under heavy attack.

573
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:33,467
Send very strong reinforcements
immediately. Very urgent.

574
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,175
[McEntee] <i>Operation Morthor</i>

575
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:37,842
<i>has led to the suspension
of the Katangan government.</i>

576
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,133
<i>We seized Katanga radio station</i>

577
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:42,883
<i>and all communications
at 0400 hours today.</i>

578
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:46,008
You attacked the enemy
without telling troops in the field?

579
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,550
<i>The operation
has been completed successfully.</i>

580
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,758
If the operation was a success...

581
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,467
then why are they shooting at us?

582
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:56,967
Fuck!

583
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,842
Sniper.

584
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,592
Go up to the trench now.

585
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:09,633
Give us some cover. Go on.

586
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:13,383
The rest of you, follow him. Go, go, go.

587
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,633
Sir, there's nobody here.

588
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,342
Because they're only coming from the east.

589
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:32,133
Right, three of you stay here.

590
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,050
The rest of you, pull back on me.

591
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,175
Let's go.

592
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:36,925
As we were.

593
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:40,008
[Prendergast] They are wide open!

594
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,050
[yells in French]

595
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,633
[Prendergast] Use cover.

596
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:50,050
Pair off.

597
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,592
[cries out]

598
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,550
Fuck!

599
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:06,258
[Prendergast] Reidy!

600
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,550
[groans]

601
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,842
Magazine!

602
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:12,758
Quinlan doesn't know what he's doing.

603
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:14,175
He's gonna get us killed!

604
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,092
I hope to fuck you're wrong!

605
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:21,175
[Prendergast] I'm going back for Reidy.

606
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:35,800
[Reidy cries out]

607
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:51,758
- Am I dying?
- No, you'll be grand.

608
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:54,258
[Prendergast] Start her up!

609
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,467
Bring her forward! Go!

610
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,633
Cover that mad bastard!

611
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:23,592
[mercenaries crying out]

612
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,217
[yells in French]

613
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:28,758
[whistle blows]

614
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,758
[engine starts]

615
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,758
[yells]

616
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:42,008
Faulques!

617
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,342
Faulques, come on!

618
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,592
[gunfire ceases]

619
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:55,800
[intermittent gunfire]

620
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:03,383
Cease fire!

621
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:05,800
Cease fire!

622
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,675
[gunshot]

623
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:12,258
Cease fire!

624
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:26,967
- [Prendergast] Hegarty, check positions.
- Send runners, one per trench.

625
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,883
[soldier] Yes, sir.

626
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,342
Get me Battalion HQ.

627
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:00,758
Sir.

628
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,800
General McEntee's staff
said he's unavailable.

629
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:05,258
Did you tell him we got attacked?

630
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,675
Yes. They said,
"God bless and hold tight."

631
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:10,633
"God bless"?
What's that supposed to mean?

632
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:14,175
Um... I suppose he means,
"May God's blessings be upon us," sir.

633
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:20,508
Start a radio log. From now on,
everything that's said goes on record.

634
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,092
Yes, sir.

635
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:16,050
- [gunshot echoes]
- [hyena whimpers]

636
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:46,550
[Quinlan] I'll run position one.

637
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,175
North flank.

638
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:51,258
Company Sergeant, you run position two.

639
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:52,467
East flank.

640
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,883
Hegarty.

641
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:57,092
Position three, south flank.

642
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:01,425
We were told the enemy were unprepared.

643
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,133
We were misinformed.

644
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:04,758
They got lucky,

645
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:06,342
but that only happens once.

646
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:10,050
Remember,
none of these men have seen battle.

647
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:14,467
On our next engagement, we will
overrun them with 20 times their forces.

648
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,633
Where are we in logistics?

649
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:19,258
FNs to the best marksmen.

650
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,133
Gustafs to the officers and the NCOs.

651
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:24,592
Each platoon splits the Brens and Vickers.
Donnelly is on the mortars.

652
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:25,925
But, sir...

653
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:27,800
they never sent us the heavy 81s.

654
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:31,050
We'll finish this in one all-out victory.

655
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:33,467
[yells in French]

656
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,258
All right? So let's go!

657
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:36,717
Let's go!

658
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,717
The real problem's the ammo.
We've only 13,000 rounds.

659
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,258
It's not gonna last long.

660
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,383
Sir, I've got General McEntee.

661
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:54,217
General, request an immediate update.

662
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,967
Report your situation, Commandant.

663
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,675
Company A, Jadotville

664
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,758
has been under mortar
and machine-gun fire.

665
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:01,592
Expect a heavy attack any moment.

666
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,633
I sent a man. I told you this was coming.

667
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,467
Watch yourself, Commandant.

668
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,592
<i>General...</i>

669
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:09,050
I'm in a bad situation here

670
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,175
and I need your help.

671
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:12,217
From the dead they left,

672
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,633
I'd say
we're looking at a force of about 1,500.

673
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:18,008
<i>I need you to send reinforcements
right now.</i>

674
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,800
Send as many as you can.

675
00:47:19,883 --> 00:47:22,758
There's a negative exercise outcome
if we don't get them.

676
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,467
Is that him?

677
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,592
[McEntee] Mm.

678
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,508
Commandant,
this is Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien.

679
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,425
I urge you to stop panicking.

680
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:36,550
<i>Panicking?</i>

681
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:39,800
<i>With respect, sir, are you aware
of the realities on the ground?</i>

682
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:41,967
I assure you I'm very well aware of them.

683
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,550
These are the final death gasps
of Tshombe's government.

684
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,342
I'm not sure he knows that.

685
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,300
Hold your position.
Allow our plan to play out.

686
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:50,967
<i>The plan is two days old</i>

687
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,300
and didn't include Tshombe's mercs.

688
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:55,300
What went wrong with your plan, sir?

689
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:57,842
Sounds like you're looking for an excuse,
Commandant.

690
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:00,842
We each have our part to play in history.

691
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,592
Yours is happening right now.

692
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:04,550
Rely on us to make sure it all works out.

693
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,633
Sir, I don't understand
what you just said to me,

694
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,967
and in tactical terms
I don't understand what you're doing.

695
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,008
I have 150 boys here
and we need reinforcements.

696
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,592
No, you listen to me, Quinlan.

697
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,383
There are larger things at play
than you can possibly imagine.

698
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:20,633
I don't give a damn
about the larger things!

699
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:22,300
We're a company under siege

700
00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:24,217
and we require your assistance!

701
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,592
Discuss the details with General McEntee.

702
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:27,758
Jesus Christ!

703
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:31,258
<i>General,
does he have a clue what he's doing?</i>

704
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,758
All our troops in the field
are on Operation Morthor, Commandant.

705
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:37,092
We don't have any reinforcements.

706
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,217
Exactly.

707
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:40,758
<i>Nobody thought this was a possibility,
did they?</i>

708
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,217
When do our men come back in?

709
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,175
<i>A heavy-weapons battalion's
expected here within 12 hours.</i>

710
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,467
They'll be sent out to you immediately.

711
00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:51,383
Thank you, sir.

712
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:53,425
One more thing.

713
00:48:54,258 --> 00:48:55,842
We could do with some whiskey.

714
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:56,967
[chuckles]

715
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,050
I'll see what I can do.

716
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:08,467
[Quinlan] Follow me.

717
00:49:11,175 --> 00:49:14,050
What exactly did he mean
by "negative exercise outcome"?

718
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:17,883
It means that without reinforcements...
we're fucked.

[Tshombe on TV] <i>The aggressive action</i>
<i>of the United Nations</i>

720
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:30,717

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,092
<i>It is unfortunate for my beloved country</i>

722
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:35,383
<i>that the United Nations peacekeepers</i>

723
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,300

<i>Or, should I say, peace enforcers.</i>

725
00:49:42,425 --> 00:49:43,467
Desmond!

00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,883

730
00:49:52,508 --> 00:49:53,550
Sir.

731
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,133
I want a private meeting with Tshombe.

732
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:57,258
Somewhere neutral.

733
00:49:58,675 --> 00:49:59,717
Just the two of us.

734
00:51:17,925 --> 00:51:20,050
They're coming! Get ready for it!

735
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,300
Into your trenches!

736
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:22,425
[commotion]

737
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:27,467
[soldier panting]

738
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,925
[Quinlan] Pick your targets!

739
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:37,008
Get ready!

740
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:51,592
[Prendergast] Cover up and pick a target!

741
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,717
Stand to!

Cooley, you are snatching the trigger!

745
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:23,883
Slow down!

746
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,050
Breathe, squeeze, kill!

747
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:28,300
Breathe again!

[mercenary yells]

749
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,675
Good man, Cooley! Keep it up!

750
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,217
[soldier] Over here!

751
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:44,758
Sniper!

752
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:47,592
- Boss?
- Can you hit the schoolhouse?

753
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:51,758
Yeah.

754
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:53,133
Bren in a single shot.

755
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,508
I need the Bren!

756
00:52:59,258 --> 00:53:00,300
Go on!

757
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:04,842
The man in the white suit.

758
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:10,592
Do you have his heart?

759
00:53:14,092 --> 00:53:15,217
Yeah, boss.

760
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:16,675
Take it.

761
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:30,008
Do you think he was important?

762
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:34,217
If he was... we won't
have to wait too long to find out.

763
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:36,217
Hey!

764
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:39,800
[gunfire intensifies]

765
00:53:41,842 --> 00:53:43,550
Retreat! Retreat!

[yells in French]

00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,008
[Quinlan] Pick your targets!

768
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:01,258
[Quinlan] Cease fire!

769
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:03,508
Hold your fire!

[gunfire continues]

771
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,342
Cease fire!

772
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:07,717
[Prendergast] Cease fire!

773
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:09,717
[soldier] Cease fire!

00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,258
[intermittent gunfire]

775
00:54:15,675 --> 00:54:16,967
Cease fire!

776
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,258
[soldier] We've got to clear
that whole area.

777
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:58,508
[Quinlan] Cover me.

778
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,800
Commandant Quinlan.

779
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:32,633
You're a good drinker,
but not such a good soldier.

780
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,008
And I believe I can be of help to you.

781
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:38,425
That's nice of you.
How do you aim to do that?

782
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:39,758
By making you see sense.

783
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,008
You do realize that you are outnumbered

784
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:44,133
by a factor of 20?

785
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,800
I see a lot of dead men here.

786
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,800
None of them are mine.

787
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,342
Yet you must see
that your position is untenable.

788
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:55,967
The only way to survive this
is to let the politicians sort it out.

789
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,758
We were attacked without provocation.

790
00:55:58,842 --> 00:56:00,258
We responded.

791
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:01,925
We will continue to respond

792
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:03,300
if you continue to attack.

793
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,508
I'm afraid I have orders to follow.

794
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:07,925
I require your surrender.

795
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,592
You're not formally recognized
to accept surrenders.

796
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,133
But I am.

797
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:15,300
I'll accept yours.

798
00:56:17,342 --> 00:56:18,467
That's not an option.

799
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,717
Nevertheless,
we would like a cease fire...

800
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,758
to send in ambulances
and remove the dead and wounded.

801
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:38,175
Tell your men we have a cease fire.

802
00:56:56,175 --> 00:56:58,008
Use that flag as a range marker.

803
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,717
Joyce, get the Vickers ready.
Set up a position in the chapel.

804
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,008
Yes, sir.

805
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:05,592
[Joyce] Murphy!

806
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,467
[Quinlan] Hold your fire.

807
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:28,175
[door opening]

808
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:20,758
Boss! Boss!

809
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,008
It's a trap!

810
00:58:22,675 --> 00:58:23,675
Move!

811
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:28,550
Open fire!

812
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,342
[soldier] Get the mortars ready!

813
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,342
[Quinlan] Donnelly!

814
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:45,592
Take those fuckers out!

815
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:47,758
I'm on it!

816
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:50,008
Get down!

817
00:58:56,592 --> 00:58:58,092
Incoming!

818
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,550
Sergeant!

819
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:12,092
Sergeant!

820
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:15,592
Cover fire!

821
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,175
Hegarty, get in the trench!

822
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:29,592
Come here! Come here!

823
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:36,925
Come on.

824
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:38,842
Grab hold of my belt and don't let go.

825
00:59:38,925 --> 00:59:41,175
[Hegarty] I can't see! I can't see!

826
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,383
[yells in French]

827
00:59:49,925 --> 00:59:51,467
I'm blind! They hit my head!

828
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,133
You're fine. You're fine.

829
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:55,300
We're going for the trench, all right?

830
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,675
Don't drop me.

831
00:59:57,758 --> 00:59:59,842
Yeah, boy. Fuck, okay, come on.

832
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:17,592
- [shouts in French]
- [whistle blows]

833
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,217
[mercenaries yelling]

834
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:25,342
[Joyce] We have to move.

835
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,300
Go!

836
01:00:28,717 --> 01:00:29,592
Go! Go! Go!

837
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,508
Target: X-ray four.

838
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,592
Two thousand two hundred yards.

839
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,092
Fire one!

840
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:16,550
Dud. Timer blew.

841
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,842
Bag it.

842
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,217
[Donnelly] Fire two!

843
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:33,800
[grunts] Right in the red ring!

844
01:01:33,883 --> 01:01:35,342
[sequential explosions]

845
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,508
That's their mortars going off.

846
01:01:40,217 --> 01:01:41,383
[shouts in French]

847
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:44,175
Pick your targets!

848
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,675
- [whistle blowing]
- [mercenaries yelling]

849
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,967
[mercenary cries out]

850
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,008
Retreat!

851
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,217
Cease fire!

852
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:05,300
[distant soldier] Cease fire!

853
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:09,383
[gunfire ceases]

854
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:34,550
You acquitted yourself well out there.

855
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,592
What?

856
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,508
Nothing.

857
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:45,967
It was something.

858
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,925
I felt scared.

859
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,550
- It's only natural.
- No, that's not it.

860
01:02:56,467 --> 01:02:57,633
I was scared.

861
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:01,758
But then... I liked it.

862
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:04,133
The killing.

863
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:06,925
It's what you're trained to do.

864
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:08,717
You didn't like it.

865
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,883
Each man reacts differently
to killing another man.

866
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,092
None of us have done this before.

867
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,258
Talk to me in a few days.

868
01:03:27,842 --> 01:03:29,467
Oh, you think we'll last that long?

869
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,467
How many dead at Radio Katanga?

870
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,592
Thirty, sir.

871
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:48,633
This will negate a vast reserve
of goodwill towards the organization

872
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:52,092
and show that we cannot behave any better
than any single country.

873
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,883
Sir, these things happen in war.

874
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:55,550
Not in my war.

875
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:00,008
What was O'Brien's role in all of this?

876
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:02,925
He's a smart man, sir,

877
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:06,050
but he's an academic
who thinks that everything stands still

878
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,717
while he thinks about what to do.

879
01:04:12,092 --> 01:04:13,258
We are a new thing.

880
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,133
Sometimes new things stumble.

881
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:17,717
But we pick ourselves up...

882
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:21,550
instead of pretending
that we didn't fall.

883
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:24,675
So we're going to say that,
in our first military intervention,

884
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:25,592
we got it all wrong?

885
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:28,383
We acknowledge the action...

886
01:04:29,758 --> 01:04:31,300
but we distance ourselves.

887
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,717
It's our plan, our forces.

888
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,800
How do we distance ourselves?

889
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,550
By applying blame.

890
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:01,300
Dr O'Brien.

891
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:03,633
General Tshombe.

892
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,758
[Tshombe]
I would say, "Welcome to my country.

893
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:10,175
Make yourself at home,"

894
01:05:10,258 --> 01:05:12,217
but it appears you already have.

895
01:05:13,717 --> 01:05:15,050
Well, there are those

896
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:17,300
who might say you're a little premature

897
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,425
in taking command of who you welcome.

898
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,800
Would you rather my predecessor
was still in charge?

899
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:25,383
The only people he welcomed
were the communists.

900
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:28,425
Or perhaps
you would rather we send all our cobalt,

901
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:31,175
copper and uranium to the USSR?

902
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:32,342
[O'Brien chuckles]

903
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,300
Of course not, General.

904
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:38,217
It's just you haven't been elected
to the office you claim to hold.

905
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,217
I am merely saying that Katanga,

906
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,342
my province,

907
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,008
is no longer part of the Congo...

908
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,342
and I am its president.

909
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:49,300
Yes, well, that's a little like Texas

910
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:52,008
saying it's no longer part of the USA,

911
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:54,675
that its oil
gives it the power to do that.

912
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,800
[Tshombe chuckles]

913
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:57,675
Factually, that would be correct.

914
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,508
They were part of Mexico.

915
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,300
America land-grabbed Texas.

916
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:04,508
Sir, I would like to see
an end to the conflict

917
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:07,508
between the United Nations
and those loyal to you in Katanga.

918
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:11,883
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

919
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:14,342
in a United Nations resolution.

920
01:06:18,925 --> 01:06:21,717
That's... simply not being realistic.

921
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,967
Do you think we did not hear the rumors

922
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,342
about the Radio Katanga massacre?

923
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:38,758
Rumors? Well...

924
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:42,883
- They're inaccurate.
- I don't think so.

925
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:46,592
I think the United Nations,

926
01:06:46,675 --> 01:06:50,508
this paragon of virtue and fairness...

927
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,092
executed my loyalists.

928
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:56,425
[Tshombe] Hm?

929
01:06:58,008 --> 01:07:00,508
Sir, I'm sure we can find a way

930
01:07:00,592 --> 01:07:02,633
to draw ourselves back from the brink.

931
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:07,592
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

932
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:10,550
in a United Nations resolution.

933
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,883
That's simply not going to happen.

934
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:16,633
Then enough of this, Dr O'Brien.

935
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:21,092
The United Nations went from peacekeeping

936
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:22,467
to peace enforcement.

937
01:07:23,717 --> 01:07:25,133
And your mission has failed.

938
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,175
Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen

939
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,550
left out in the field?

940
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:37,008
What do you mean?

941
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:38,133
Because I didn't.

942
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:42,008
I didn't forget about them at all.

943
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:58,717
My boys are giving everything they've got,
but there's just not enough of us.

944
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:02,550
I give you my word, you'll have
reinforcements with you tomorrow.

945
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:05,425
We'll hold out
until our last bullet's spent.

946
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,425
We could do with that whiskey.

947
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:16,217
[Quinlan]
They're going after the ammo hut!

948
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:19,175
[soldier] Go, move!

949
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:27,175
[Quinlan] Get this out of here! Go!

950
01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:32,717
- [Quinlan] Go!
- Run!

951
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,967
Grab this one.

952
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,717
That will be blowing up all night.

953
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,217
We'd better get our reinforcements
tomorrow.

954
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,467
We'd fucking better.

955
01:09:05,592 --> 01:09:07,258
[US Ambassador] <i>Mr Secretary General,</i>

956
01:09:07,342 --> 01:09:10,258
in view of your failure
to prevent civil war in the Congo,

957
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:13,258
President Kennedy
has personally told me to insist

958
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:15,592
that the United States play a larger part

959
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:19,050
in your mishandled military adventure.

960
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:20,758
Please tell President Kennedy

961
01:09:20,842 --> 01:09:22,300
that I appreciate the offer.

962
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,050
[USSR Ambassador] You are aware
that if you had responded sooner

963
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:29,592
to Prime Minister Lumumba's
request for UN intervention,

964
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,758
we would not be where we are today.

965
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:34,383
We might well have arrived here
by other means.

966
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,967
Has General Tshombe
even accepted a cease fire yet?

967
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,425
He has not. That's my first priority.

968
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,633
Thank you, gentlemen.

969
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:44,383
- [aide] Sir?
- Call Tshombe directly.

970
01:09:45,258 --> 01:09:48,133
Tell him that the Secretary General
of the United Nations

971
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,092
is flying to meet with him in the Congo.

972
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,092
See if that gets his attention.

973
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:01,425
[flies buzzing]

974
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,467
Would you like to say a few words?

975
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,467
They poisoned the water.

976
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,258
Take what you can from the barrels.
It's all we have. Do it now.

977
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:27,008
- Cooley, get more buckets.
- Yes, sir.

978
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:30,092
[distant heavy gunfire]

979
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:34,508
Radio! That'll be our reinforcements.

980
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:37,592
[distant gunfire continues]

981
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,842
What are you hearing?

982
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:43,008
Nothing of ours, if that's what you mean.

983
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:46,633
Let's go!

984
01:10:53,133 --> 01:10:54,842
Is that my reinforcements I hear?

985
01:10:54,925 --> 01:10:57,092
Kane's platoon are at the bridge.

986
01:10:57,883 --> 01:11:00,050
Thirty men?
What happened to the battalion?

987
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:02,092
<i>It's all we could get.</i>

988
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,967
<i>They're under heavy bombardment.</i>

989
01:11:05,092 --> 01:11:06,675
<i>They may have to pull back.</i>

990
01:11:06,758 --> 01:11:08,550
Our only hope is that you reach us!

991
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:10,092
<i>I'll try to get through to them.</i>

992
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,967
We're facing bigger numbers
than we were advised!

993
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:33,092
<i>We have to pull out!</i>

994
01:11:33,175 --> 01:11:34,800
<i>Pull back! Pull back!</i>

995
01:11:35,675 --> 01:11:37,508
Sir. McEntee.

996
01:11:37,592 --> 01:11:39,258
[Prendergast] Back to your positions.

997
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:43,133
- Quinlan.
- [McEntee] <i>They can't break through, Pat.</i>

998
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,508
The Gends have shored up
with the big guns.

999
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,883
Don't we have a load of big guns, Sean?

1000
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,133
Don't the United-fucking-Nations
have a load of big guns?

1001
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:52,633
<i>Not that we can get to you.</i>

1002
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:55,883
[Prendergast] Get ready!

1003
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,050
You're hanging us out to dry.

1004
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:01,175
Tell me you're not.

1005
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:05,967
[Prendergast] They're splitting
into platoons! Target their heavy guns!

1006
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,342
Open fire!

1007
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:10,633
Tell me what I'm supposed to do, General.

1008
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,342
<i>General!</i>

1009
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:20,508
Carry out your orders, Commandant.

1010
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:22,508
Hold your ground.

1011
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:24,967
Defend Jadotville.

1012
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,800
With what? A firm tone?

1013
01:12:29,883 --> 01:12:30,925
[gunfire]

1014
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,008
[clicking]

1015
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:54,925
Ammo!

1016
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:56,592
We need more ammo over here!

1017
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,425
[soldier] Make it last!

1018
01:13:05,675 --> 01:13:09,133
I'm going to start charging you
for every fucking bullet that misses!

1019
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:15,050
[Quinlan] Stick to your positions!

1020
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:16,508
Last magazine!

1021
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:22,258
Go and find out where our fucking ammo is!

1022
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:29,967
I have to round up more ammo!

1023
01:13:36,717 --> 01:13:39,758
Fucking... little bastards!

1024
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:42,008
Get off! Get off!

1025
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:52,717
[Prendergast] Hold fire!

1026
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,842
[gunfire ceases]

1027
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:57,967
[mercenaries yelling]

1028
01:14:04,258 --> 01:14:05,300
We didn't do that.

1029
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:08,258
[high-pitched whining]

1030
01:14:08,342 --> 01:14:09,217
Incoming!

1031
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:39,550
Cooley!

1032
01:14:43,175 --> 01:14:44,008
Find his head!

1033
01:14:46,425 --> 01:14:47,258
There he is!

1034
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,758
Get him some air.

1035
01:14:50,258 --> 01:14:51,300
[gasps]

1036
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,550
[cough and splutters]

1037
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,758
[medic] We're running out of supplies.

1038
01:15:14,842 --> 01:15:16,883
Some of these lads won't last much longer.

1039
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,092
Any dead?

1040
01:15:23,675 --> 01:15:24,883
[medic] Not yet.

1041
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:57,717
[Donnelly] Medic!

1042
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
Eyes on the south flank!

1043
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:02,592
[medic] Let's get him inside.

1044
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:24,467
[Quinlan groans]

1045
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:36,467
And we're out of morphine.

1046
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:39,383
[Quinlan] Oh, fuck.

1047
01:16:42,008 --> 01:16:43,467
What's it like, getting shot?

1048
01:16:46,092 --> 01:16:47,383
I wouldn't recommend it.

1049
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:57,717
Dr O'Brien,

1050
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,675
<i>you have made a very bad thing much worse.</i>

1051
01:17:00,758 --> 01:17:03,633
Sir, I made my decisions
based on conditions in the field.

1052
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:07,175
<i>Your decisions have led to more bloodshed.</i>

1053
01:17:07,258 --> 01:17:10,383
Sir, Operation Morthor
has still been successful in the main.

1054
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:13,467
But you allowed a massacre
at the radio station.

1055
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,967
You expect me to defend that?

1056
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:18,633
What am I to do
if a commander chooses to go in hard?

1057
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,175
You're the man on the ground.

1058
01:17:20,258 --> 01:17:21,717
Not every square inch of it, sir.

1059
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,217
General Tshombe
was willing to negotiate before this.

1060
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,842
Now he's broken all relations.

1061
01:17:25,925 --> 01:17:29,925
And I am told there is an Irish company
stuck in the middle of nowhere under siege

1062
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:32,842
<i>as a result
of your Radio Katanga disaster.</i>

1063
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:37,508
Dag... you more than anyone understand
I couldn't control every circumstance.

1064
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:39,258
<i>You're attached to it, Conor.</i>

1065
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:41,092
Best leave you unattached to me.

1066
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:43,675
<i>It's about protecting the organization.</i>

1067
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,675
Secretary General,

1068
01:17:45,758 --> 01:17:47,925
<i>I believe I made the correct decisions.</i>

1069
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:49,842
If you disagree, when you're here...

1070
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,633
I'll tender my resignation.

1071
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,008
I'm quite sure you think you're right,
Conor.

1072
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:58,467
But facts on the ground says different.

1073
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,717
And I will have to accept
that resignation.

1074

01:37:09,842 --> 01:37:13,592
[Quinlan] <i>As General Tshombe</i>
<i>continued to play games with the UN...</i>

1253
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:14,842
<i>we sat in jail,</i>

1254
01:37:14,925 --> 01:37:17,425
<i>under sentence of death, and waited.</i>

1255
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,383
<i>Finally, about a month later,</i>

1256
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:26,300
<i>word came that we were to be sent home.</i>

1257
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:28,717
Right, come on. Let's go.

1258
01:37:30,008 --> 01:37:31,467
I wanna get out of this tip.

1259
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:32,592
Come on. Hurry up.

1260
01:37:33,883 --> 01:37:35,008
Come on.

1261
01:37:35,092 --> 01:37:36,133
[all cheer]

1262
01:37:37,175 --> 01:37:39,758
<i>We were too relieved
to care what deal had been done,</i>

1263
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:42,633
<i>and traveled back
knowing that we'd held our own ground...</i>

1264
01:37:43,633 --> 01:37:46,133
<i>and done Ireland and the UN proud.</i>

1265
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,842
[McEntee] Commandant Quinlan.

1266
01:38:14,258 --> 01:38:15,300
Welcome back.

1267
01:38:17,133 --> 01:38:18,758
It's a poor reception, I know.

1268
01:38:19,717 --> 01:38:21,633
I'm putting them all up for medals.

1269
01:38:21,717 --> 01:38:24,175
For a virgin army... hell, for any army...

1270
01:38:24,258 --> 01:38:25,550
they were magnificent.

1271
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:28,467
It's not the right time.

1272
01:38:29,675 --> 01:38:30,717
What do you mean?

1273
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:34,133
There's not going to be
any mention of this.

1274
01:38:36,758 --> 01:38:38,217
It's a complicated situation,

1275
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:41,092
and frankly,
you've made it more complicated.

1276
01:38:41,175 --> 01:38:42,217
How?

1277
01:38:44,175 --> 01:38:45,383
By surrendering.

1278
01:38:46,175 --> 01:38:47,675
You made us look bad.

1279
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,133
Look, it's not just me, you understand.

1280
01:38:53,258 --> 01:38:55,383
The whole United Nations has been judged.

1281
01:38:56,592 --> 01:38:59,758
If we treat your men like heroes,
then we damage the institution.

1282
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:03,008
Is this coming from you or O'Brien?

1283
01:39:03,883 --> 01:39:05,550
That's an impertinent question.

1284
01:39:06,342 --> 01:39:07,383
Lads.

1285
01:39:11,467 --> 01:39:12,925
What kind of a soldier are you?

1286
01:39:14,467 --> 01:39:15,883
We can make it a lot worse.

1287
01:39:16,675 --> 01:39:19,008
There's talk of a court martial
for cowardice.

1288
01:39:21,925 --> 01:39:22,967
Do it.

1289
01:39:23,467 --> 01:39:24,508
I don't care.

1290
01:39:25,342 --> 01:39:26,383
Not just for you.

1291
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,383
For them.

1292
01:39:42,258 --> 01:39:44,175
You can have him court-martialed for that.

1293
01:39:45,383 --> 01:39:47,508
No, it would only kick up too much dust.

1294
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,008
Anyway...

1295
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:52,383
I think he owed me that one.

1296
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:55,050
I was right to do it.

1297
01:39:58,383 --> 01:40:00,342
If I hadn't,
the world would be at war now.

1298
01:40:01,467 --> 01:40:03,925
Well, he doesn't understand
how the world works.

1299
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,342
