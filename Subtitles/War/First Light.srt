00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,640
Saffa, this is Gannick Red 2, are you receiving me?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,040
Shit. Christ.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,160

GUNFIRE

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
People say to me, you know, "How do you remember these things?"

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,920
How do you expect me to forget?

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,400
You don't, can't.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
And I remember it vividly, you know.

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,040
It's not just a question of remembering - you can see it,

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,120
see things, see people, see aeroplanes.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,320
The experiences of being a Spitfire fighter pilot

22
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,320
in the Battle of Britain stay with you forever.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,080
And you can't do anything about it.

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,120
PLANE ENGINE

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
See your pass, please?

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,400
This is it, sir.

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,080
Enter.

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
No time to stand on ceremony. Wellum?

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,520
Straight from training?

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,680
Yes. And I didn't quite finish that.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,800
How old are you, exactly?

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Almost 19.

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
I said exactly.

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,880
- 18 years, 9 months. 
- Jesus.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,440
What's your Christian name?

36
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Geoffrey.

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,840
But everyone calls me Geoff.

38
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,360
Do they indeed?

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
My name's Mac.

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm a doddery old sod from the first war.

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Pray that this one doesn't last as long, eh?

42
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Bet you haven't done any time in Spits either, have you?

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,560
No, sir.

44
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,120
PLANE ENGINES OVERHEAD

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Who the bloody hell are you?

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,600
- Wellum, sir. 
- Mac told me your name was Geoff.

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,240
- Oh. 
- Said you looked a right cheeky bugger.

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,640
I think you should be called Boy.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,800
What do you reckon, Tommy?

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,440
TOMMY SNIGGERS

51
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Brian Kingcome, commanding officer...acting.

52
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,760
What time is it?

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
It's that time again, Brian.

54
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,960
Tempus fugit, Boy.

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
If you start feeling sorry for yourself, he'll sling you straight on the scrapheap.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,920
We're off to the pub.

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,440
Coming?

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,240
GENERAL CHATTER

59
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,560
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

60
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Only those who've seen the whites of the enemy's eyes are allowed to sign up.

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,320
But once you're signed up, you're up.

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,520
Nobody gets rubbed out here.

63
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,720
- There you go. 
- What is it?

64
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,960
Pilot's one true friend.

65
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Bottoms up.

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,280
Bloody hell!

67
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,400
BOTH LAUGH

68
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Oh, dear. I do fear you're going to need another.

69
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,440
Medicine too strong for you?

70
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
GEOFF RETCHES

71
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,720
Sorry, sir.

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
You'll call me Brian. I'm not your bloody father.

73
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes, sir...Brian.

74
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,120
Come back in for more?

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,480
The hair of the dog. Best thing for it.

76
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,520
HE RETCHES

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Suit yourself.

78
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,320
But know this, Boy - I haven't the time to train you up on Spits.

79
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,440
You can have a go tomorrow but God help you if you break the bloody thing.

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
HE RETCHES

81
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Another bleedin' boy wonder.

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
Morning, sir. Nice day for it.

83
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,120
She's all warmed up for you, sir.

84
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,880
Let's get you sorted out, sir.

85
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,280
There you are, sir.

86
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,720
I've done my homework.

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,640
That's good, sir.

88
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't worry, sir. You won't be flying her.

89
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
No, she'll be flying you.

90
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,280
Excuse me, just one thing. How do you start it again?

91
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Throttle.

92
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,360
Set it to about there to start.

93
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Once you're up, nip her up on the friction, otherwise you'll fly along like a hobby horse.

94
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,200
Engine start.

95
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,560
Hit it the same time as the booster call.

96
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,640
I use these two fingers.

97
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,000
V for victory.

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,280
Primer pump.

99
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,440
Give her a good old glassful - she's a greedy cow - and dual magnetos.

100
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't forget to check for your mag drop,

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
and Fanny's your aunt.

102
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,040
Go on, sir, wake her up.

103
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Fresh from the cradle

104
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,400
and we're giving him a thousand horsepower and eight machine guns to play with.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,880
What a way to win a war!

106
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
OK, so...

107
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,480
Fuel on.

108
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,160
Primer pump.

109
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,280
Throttle, descent.

110
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,800
Clear prop.

111
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,320
Magnetos on.

112
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,440
Engine start. On.

113
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
God help us.

114
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,800
The first flight in a Spitfire was a little bit awe-inspiring.

115
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,840
People don't understand.

116
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,120
It was an achievement because it was then THE aeroplane,

117
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
everybody spoke about Spitfires, and here was I flying one.

118
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,560
And I wasn't 19 years old.

119
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,200
There you are, careering around at 300 knots in this thing.

120
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,160
Just the slightest thought that goes through your brain

121
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,600
conveys it to your hands and your feet,

122
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,480
and the next thing you know, the aeroplane's doing it.

123
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,680
You feel detached from fellow man.

124
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,320
It's clean.

125
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,360
It's pure.

126
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,880
It gets into the very soul.

127
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,440
It gets into the soul and you think, "This is absolutely beautiful."

128
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,920
How many of those things have you written now?

129
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,960
You really want to know?

130
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,040
I just hope to Christ we're not headed for another bloody April.

131
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
1917.

132
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,320
Yes.

133
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,520
I really thought we were going to lose everyone back then.

134
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,240
And now we're chucking them into the meat grinder all over again.

135
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,400
PLANE ENGINE APPROACHES

136
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,800
Let's hope his landing's better than his takeoff.

137
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,480
Bit lumpy.

138
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,160
- You OK, sir? 
- Jesus H.

139
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,080
Was that really an hour?

140
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,920
She's sweet, isn't she?

141
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
Yes.

142
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,120
Absolutely bloody marvellous!

143
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,320
What I'd give to be a pilot.

144
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I came down with my pal Eddie.

145
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,440
I said, "You do the sea, I'll do the air."

146
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,160
He joined the Navy.

147
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,760
I'd just love to see the world.

148
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Actually, I hear Germany's very pretty this time of year.

149
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Are they all bloody idiots where you're from, then?

150
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,880
Morning.

151
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,400
I was going to do my very best to be a good fighter pilot,

152
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,440
because unless you were,

153
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,800
then the chances were that you were going to get bumped off,

154
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
and that didn't appeal to me at all.

155
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,280
The Germans had marched through Europe - Scandinavia, France -

156
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,000
and the threat of invasion was very real indeed.

157
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,240
Here we were with bullets flying all over the place.

158
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,080
If you could survive three weeks,

159
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,240
you had a good chance of surviving six,

160
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,760
or even longer.

161
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,800
I've had quite a few hours on the Spits now, Mac.

162
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm ready for this.

163
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
Oh! I saw him in my sights.

164
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,920
I couldn't quite believe it at first, right there in front of me.

165
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,840
Before I knew what I was doing, I'd ripped into him.

166
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,240
Then there he was, smoke billowing, out of control, spiralling towards the ground.

167
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,840
Who was he?

168
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,840
Who was who?

169
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,080
Have you any idea who Boy's talking about, Mac?

170
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,720
Haven't the foggiest, Brian.

171
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,920
Boy, come and sit your arse down here.

172
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,280
Show this Welsh wally a thing or two about the fine art of chess.

173
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
Easy.

174
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,440
- Are you happy to do this now? 
- I'd rather get this one out the way.

175
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
SINGING

176
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,040
- One of yours? 
- No.

177
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,920
Different squadron.

178
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,600
Sorry, didn't see you there.

179
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,320
You must be Drummond. Welcome aboard.

180
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,240
Heard all about you, obviously.

181
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,200
Norway, wasn't it?

182
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,160
Must have been one hell of a battle.

183
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,520
It was.

184
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,320
Have you been trained on the reflector gunsight?

185
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,640
No. Nobody has.

186
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
It's a joke, isn't it?

187
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,840
OK, sir, let's go through it again.

188
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,640
OK.

189
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,160
Eyes tight shut, sir?

190
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,640
- Say it fast this time. 
- Trim.

191
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,560
Brakes. Set.

192
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,320
- Not bad, sir. 
- Get on with it. 
- Mixture.

193
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,960
Did I get it right?

194
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,360
- Yes, sir. 
- Good. Try me some more.

195
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,800
Fuel select.

196
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,760
Good, sir.

197
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,560
Now...

198
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,280
Cock.

199
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,360
(Cock...)

200
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,120
- Cock? 
- You've got to get this one right, sir.

201
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
It's a vital piece of equipment.

202
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,200
It's just not part of the aeroplane, sir!

203
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,000
- BOTH LAUGH 
- Sods!

204
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,120
I've been reaching in the dark for that for years.

205
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,160
- Right, go again. 
- Right, ready?

206
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,840
You're to report for ops at first light.

207
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,320
That's if you haven't gone off the idea in the meantime.

208
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,120
No.

209
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,880
Of course not, Brian.

210
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
The bad news is,

211
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,320
you're going to be my wingman.

212
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,280
That way, I get to keep eye on you.

213
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,960
Brian...

214
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
I won't let you down.

215
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,360
I was very much aware, would I measure up?

216
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,640
You were defending...

217
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,520
this country...

218
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,320
against an utterly... ruthless Nazi regime,

219
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,760
bombing hell out of our civilian population

220
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,600
and every city and town they could find.

221
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,320
What did they expect?

222
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,440
Shake them by the hand?

223
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,520
Stroke them?

224
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,560
No, stop them!

225
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,320
This is what my duty is,

226
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,680
in a single-seater interceptor fighter.

227
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
And I didn't want to be afraid.

228
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,120
LABORIOUS BREATHING

229
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,920
HE MURMURS

230
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,840
You're not superstitious, are you, Boy?

231
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,160
How can he sleep at a time like this?

232
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Cos he's bloody useless.

233
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,040
Why was she watching a man being condemned for her own murder?

234
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,960
SHE could murder me any day.

235
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,920
PHONE RINGS

236
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,440
Yes?

237
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,080
Squadron scramble!

238
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,920
BELL RINGS

239
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,760
ENGINES ROAR Start!

240
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
Engines start!

241
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,400
Ah! Fucking wake up, will you?

242
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,040
Form up, form up.

243
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,000
Stay with me, Boy.

244
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,760
Hello, Saffa, gunning squadron airborne.

245
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,240
I'm steering 120 and climbing hard, over.

246
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,280
Oh, my fucking Christ.

247
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Stay with me, Boy, stay with me.

248
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
Here we go!

249
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,640
OK, Boy, a good first burst, then away. Watch for 109s.

250
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,240
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

251
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Shit.

252
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,640
109s above the first block coming round to six o'clock,

253
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,840
3,000 feet above.

254
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,680
Come on, come on!

255
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,480
Come on. (Come on, come on!)

256
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,160
Come on! Come on! Yes!

257
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,920
QUICK, SHALLOW BREATHING

258
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,600
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

259
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,320
MECHANICAL CLUNKING, NO GUNFIRE

260
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,800
Oh, Christ.

261
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,320
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

262
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,640
Christ! Come on.

263
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,000
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

264
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,840
Fuck! Get off!

265
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,840
Close.

266
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,400
Stall, you fucker, come on.

267
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,760
SHALLOW, QUICK BREATHING

268
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,080
Sir, are you OK, sir?

269
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,280
Sir, are you OK?

270
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
We were caught by a 109.

271
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,160
- She'll have to go away, sir. 
- Away?

272
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,960
I don't think we'll be repairing this one.

273
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,120
You'd better rustle me up another one.

274
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,560
Want to be ready for the next up.

275
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,960
'When that 109 caught me off that Heinkel, I remember thinking,

276
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,280
'"If you can get away with this, you'll get away with anything,"

277
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,040
'cos he should have killed me.'

278
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440
Look at Boy's cravat, you look like our glorious leader!

279
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,560
We're going to see if we can't bag ourselves some trophies beforehand.

280
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,840
Big trophies.

281
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Boy.

282
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,960
You're one lucky sod.

283
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,480
You should have stuck on my wing.

284
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,560
If there were any justice in the world,

285
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,200
you'd be cinders now.

286
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,680
Are you coming to this party or not?

287
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,360
Grace?

288
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,080
I'll see you inside.

289
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,800
I can't tell if that's a pleased look or not.

290
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,560
I just...

291
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,280
What are you doing here?

292
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,880
I did write, I'm working near Brasstead.

293
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
Come on, Geoff.

294
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,760
Friends of yours?

295
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Yes.

296
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,640
- I'll introduce you. 
- I'd like that.

297
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,640
I was sorry to hear about your brother.

298
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,520
You look beautiful.

299
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,600
You look different.

300
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,280
What would persuade you to dance with me?

301
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,520
Just be yourself.

302
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,680
# Them that's got shall get

303
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,040
# Them that's not shall lose

304
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,880
# So the Bible said

305
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,440
# And it still is news

306
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,160
# Mama may have

307
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,080
# Papa may have

308
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,560
# But God bless the child that's got his own

309
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,880
# That's got his own

310
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,320
# Yes, the strong gets more

311
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,400
# While the weak ones fade

312
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,080
# Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

313
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,800
# Mama may have

314
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,720
# Papa may have

315
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,760
# But God bless the child that's got his own

316
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,080
# That's got his own

317
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,240
# Money, you got lots of friends

318
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,800
# Crowding round the door

319
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,360
# When you're gone and spending ends

320
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,360
# They don't come no more

321
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,680
# Rich relations give

322
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,200
# Crust of bread and such

323
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,000
# You can help yourself but don't take too much

324
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,400
# Mama may have

325
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,360
- # Papa may have... # 
- MACHINE-GUN FIRE

326
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,000
# But God bless the child that's got his own

327
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,160
# That's got his own. #

328
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
Look, for what it is, it's a splendid little car.

329
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,240
How much?

330
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,520
- Five quid. 
- Yeah, can't go wrong with a fiver.

331
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,000
Good little runner, too. Seats four.

332
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,560
Make a good passion wagon.

333
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,120
In a Ford 10?!

334
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,200
I'd pay you back, first of the month.

335
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
And what happens if you get the chop in the meantime?

336
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,360
Come on, I'd do the same for you.

337
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,920
So when do we get to see this high-powered projectile of yours?

338
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,080
And the first round's on you.

339
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,480
God, Geoff, you'll wear me out.

340
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,440
Oh!

341
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,200
What a gorgeous brooch.

342
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,120
Nothing special.

343
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,560
Just a little trinket I picked up, you know?

344
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,040
Oh.

345
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
I see.

346
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,720
What are you doing?

347
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,360
- I thought you said it was nothing special. 
- That's a month's wages.

348
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,080
Oh!

349
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,560
Where the bloody hell did you throw that, Grace?

350
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,240
- Can you see? 
- Shall we have a look? 
- Yeah!

351
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,160
Grace...

352
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,320
I know.

353
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,840
I feel the same.

354
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
Soon.

355
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,320
It's getting late.

356
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,640
PLANE ENGINE OVERHEAD

357
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,080
No clouds.

358
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,440
Must be lovely up there this evening.

359
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
Geoff.

360
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,680
Geoff.

361
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,120
You're getting cold.

362
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,080
I was like a dog with a bone. They couldn't shake me off.

363
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,880

- Yes. 
- See anyone bail?

No.

368

00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,600
I swear...

545
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,120
if ever I own a house, I'm never getting a bloody telephone.

546
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,200
What were we doing this time last year?

547
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,480
Easy. Contemplating a fourth pint of Shepherd's down the Pretty Pigs.

548
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You, Tom?

549
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,760
Have you ever been to Beauchamp Chapel in Warwick?

550
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:33,360
It's on Church Street. There are these great medieval stone tablets

551
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,760
of the earls and knights of the county.

552
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,320
Good for brass rubbing, you know.

553
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,200
Odd to think we led normal lives once.

554
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,760
Brass rubbing normal?

555
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,240
THEY LAUGH

556
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,600
Yeah, bloody move, Wade.

557
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,000
You know there's ground crew outside?

558
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,800
Buggered if I like the look of this.

559
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,720
We're going over the water.

560
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,920
Convoy patrol.

561
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,280
Two aircraft. Krauts are nailing our shipping again.

562
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,120
In this weather, Brian? Jesus H.

563
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,720
Control wanted the whole flight up.

564
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,200
Are you hearing this, Trev?

565
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,720
I'm asleep and, what's more, I haven't heard a bloody thing.

566
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,360
I've already called this one.

567
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,520
Tommy, you're up with Boy.

568
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,880
Right, then.

569
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,320
Off we go.

570
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,920
Even a high priest can't control the weather, sir.

571
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,600
How long will you be gone?

572
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,400
At least an hour, maybe more.

573
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,760
Bloody hell.

574
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,960
'Red 2, Red 2. How is it going?'

575
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,480
Red 1. I can see very little.

576
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,440
I think my RC's giving up.

577
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,920
Red 1 do you read me?

578
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,240
Repeat, RC very bad.

579
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,640
Shit, shit!

580
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,960
Come in, Red 1.

581
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,240
Red 1, come in.

582
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,080
'Red 2, say again.

583
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,280
'We have a bandit 10 miles east approaching.'

584
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,560
Red 1, received.

585
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,600
Understand. Bandit approaching.

586
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,560
Come in Red 1. Red 1, do you read me?

587
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,880
This must be what eternity feels like.

588
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,320
Jesus. Fucking cloud!

589
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,040
Red 1, bandit sighted.

590
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,560
Red 1.

591
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,720
GERMAN VOICES ON RADIO

592
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,280
Shit!

593
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,840
Shit, fuck!

594
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,480
THUNDER

595
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,400
Fuck! Fuck!

596
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,760
Come on, little lady.

597
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,440
Get me home.

598
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,840
He dived away.

599
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,720
- I think he went after something. 
- You think?

600
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,520
- Lost RT. 
- Then you should have turned back.

601
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,840
I did.

602
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,280
Where the bloody hell is he?

603
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,800
Get yourself inside.

604
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,840
Fuck.

605
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,240
What was the last heading you were flying?

606
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,760
I'm not sure.

607
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,960
PHONE RINGS

608
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,360
Yep? No.

609
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,440
What just happened?

610
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,880
I've no idea.

611
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,080
I swear to Christ, it's him.

612
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,240
What?

613
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,240
All right, sir? We were expecting you over an hour ago.

614
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,720
Just a bit tired.

615
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,440
Geoff, where the hell have you been?

616
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,200
Any news on the Junkers I shot down?

617
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,800
What?

618
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,080
Junkers '88.

619
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,840
But then if I had hit it...

620
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,960
- Geoff. 
- All that metal.

621
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
- You must have seen it. 
- Where were you?

622
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,040
Chasing a fucking German, where were you?

623
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,800
- RT failure means abort, what part of that don't you understand? 
- Sorry, Brian, you know how it is.

624
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,000
You've nothing to prove, Geoff.

625
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,560
We were never to have a moment's peace.

626
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:36,480
The summer of 1941, I went on 50 missions, escort and fighter sweeps, over northern France.

627
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,600
I didn't think any more about dying or being killed, it didn't worry me.

628
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,840
I'd become an automaton.

629
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,560
You all right, sir?

630
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,000
'Tommy Lund was a lovely chap,

631
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,080
'very dear friend, very dear friend.'

632
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,680
'He went into the Channel, but all the best blokes did

633
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,040
'and yet the blokes like me got away with it.'

634
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,960
I don't know about you ladies, but I plan on getting stupidly, stinkingly arseholed.

635
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,760
You can count me in.

636
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,560
INAUDIBLE

637
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,120
'I think I was like a...

638
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,480
'a bit of stretched elastic.

639
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,680
'I think I'd reached the end at that time, but I didn't know it.

640
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,200
'You don't know it.'

641
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Geoff.

642
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,280
You're off ops.

643
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,000
Though we're very sorry to see you leave us.

644
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,240
Beg your pardon, Brian?

645
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,320
You've done bloody well...

646
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,400
but it's over.

647
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,880
18 months of this is enough for anyone.

648
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,800
Why, Brian?

649
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,040
I don't understand.

650
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,080
- Have I put up a black? I don't understand. 
- You've come to the end of the line.

651
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,800
That's all.

652
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,320
You're finished.

653
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,880
Now, you've got a posting to an OTU, to instruct.

654
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,840
Don't want to go.

655
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,880
I know.

656
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,120
'I felt the peak of my life was behind me.'

657
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,040
'I'm not going to reach here again,

658
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,520
'everything else is going to be...

659
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,480
'with the curve going downwards, the graph going downwards.'

660
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,200
I remember your first day here.

661
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,840
The words "right", "cocky" and "bastard" spring to mind.

662
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,000
You know, Boy...

663
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,600
I was never more happy than when I saw you landing safely today.

664
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,920
Your posting come through just before you took off.

665
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,800
It was too late to stop you,

666
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,680
but... like I said...

667
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,120
when you landed...

668
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,120
"At least", I thought,

669
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,880
"Geoffrey Wellum has made it and lived."

670
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,560
God knows I've written enough letters to the parents of those who didn't.

671
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,280
'I asked myself, "Was it worth it?

672
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,400
'"Was it worth it?

673
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:58,560
'"All those young men I fought and flew with, all those chaps that are no longer with us?"'

674
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,880
'I ask myself that question and I can't answer it.

675
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,720
'I suppose it must have been.'

676
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,600
'Suppose it must have been.'

677
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,680
'I am still struggling.'

678
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,920
We never did get to sign it.

679
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,680
Nobody wants a medal,

680
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,240
nobody wants a thank you.

681
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,440
But it would be nice just to be remembered,

682
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,640
because then you must think of all of us

683
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,960
and not just those of us who survived.

684
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,320
Flying alone,

685
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,280
nothing gives such a sense of mastery over mechanism,

686
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,840
mastery indeed over space.

687
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,160
Time and life itself is this.

688
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:32,920
Only the lonely threshers of the sky, hidden from the Earth, have gazed on it.

689
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,280
Only we, who went up late into the high places

690
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,120
under the shadow of wings.
