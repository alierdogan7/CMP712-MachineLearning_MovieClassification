I'm an only child. No siblings.

177
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,778

decided not to "sibble" anymore.

We fool around at the hospital
with these a lot.

181
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:42,636
Uh-huh. I think you
better blow this up.
I'm not a big fan of fainting.

182
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,871
Just think of it
as a balloon with fingers.

183
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,207
Or an udder
in search of a cow.

184

That's "udderly" ridiculous.
If they don't come soon

You knew where you stood
in those days.

198
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:37,491
Franklin Roosevelt
was always the president.
Joe Louis was always the champ.

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,892
And Paul Muni
played everybody.

200
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:48,666
Eloise McKay. Eighth grade.
You have to understand.
Those were the old days.

201
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:52,174
We were brought up
to think that girls were
different, and I was young.

202
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,710
I mean, girls were martians.

203
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,584
Eloise McKay let me touch her slip.
She brought it to school in a box...

204
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,382
and I took it behind the science
building and touched it.

205
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:10,722
That was it. The whole transaction
could have been conducted by mail.

206
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,787
I hope I haven't shocked anyone.
I mean, we're all adults here.

207
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:18,595
By the way, I'm a doctor,
and I can tell you for certain
that you're pregnant.

208
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:20,966
And we know what
causes that nowadays too.

209
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,067
The smartest doctor
I ever knew was Samuel Sacks,
head of our medical school.

210
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:32,945
What a terrific guy. I remember
one day a student was talking
to him, and he said...

211
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:38,511
"Doctor, what would you do
if a patient died just
as he was leaving your office?"

212
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:44,390
Without missing a beat, Sacks
said, "I'd turn him around so it
would look like he was coming in."

213
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:47,089
A lovely man.

214
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:51,998
Do you know who I hated?
Mrs. Tomassino, my geometry teacher.

215
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:57,301
She terrified me. She stood over me
in the front row with this big yardstick.

216
00:13:57,373 --> 00:14:00,399
I used to look up into her nose.

217
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:02,411
She had three nostrils.

218
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:05,937
I guess she thought it was
symmetrical or something.

219
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,381
But she was really nice
if I got something wrong.

220
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:11,079
She was very helpful.
She'd look down at me and say...

221
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,379
- [Shouts] "You got it wrong!"
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>

I wish I wasn't standing so close
to me when I said that.

be here by now.

00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:23,413
She worked with a parrot.
He didn't help her strip or anything.

326
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:26,508
While she got undressed,
he stood on the side and talked dirty.

327
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,849
<i>It was an exciting act.</i>
<i>What a body.</i>

328
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,857
She was built great too.

329
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35,792
[Korean]

330
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,853
<i>Yeah. But what I don't understand is</i>
<i>how she got that way</i>...

331
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:40,865
anymore than how we did.

332
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,528
Look at your hand.
It's one of the most incredible
instruments in the universe.

333
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:47,868
Of all the bones in the body,
one fourth are in the hand.

334
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,908
Forget the hand.
Look at your thumb...

335
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:53,706
that wondrous mechanism that
separates us from the other animals.

336
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,146
The world-famous opposable thumb,
that amazing device...

337
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:01,482
that has transported more students
to college than the Boston post road.

338
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:04,182
Ideal for sucking,
especially as a baby.

339
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:08,693
And lauded in song and story
as the perfect instrument
for pulling out a plum.

340
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:12,822
Or, in the case of the Caesars,
for holding it down for
the gladiator to die...

341
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:17,198
or holding it up, which means
"See you later at the orgy."

342
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:22,332
My friends, for getting up and down
the pike, in your pie, in your eye...

343
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,639
I give you the thumb.

344
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:29,670
Have you any idea, Farmer Brown,
of the incredible complexity...

345
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,682
of this piece
of human apparatus?

346
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,709
[Korean]

347
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:38,723
Of course not. Never having spent
any time at Sol and Sol's...

348
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,884
swilling borscht and jamming
Latin into your brain...

349
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,054
while trying to imagine
if Lefty the waitress
is wearing a garter belt...

350
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:50,068
you have no idea of the balletic
interplay of parts that
make up the human thumb.

351
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:57,341
The flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis
flexes the metacarpal bone.

352
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:02,005
That is, draws it inward
over the palm...

353
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:05,812
thus producing
the movement of opposition...

354
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,875
and the Boy Scout salute.

355
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,356
<i>Because of this</i>
<i>magical engineering, we could do this.</i>

356
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,650
And this.

357
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:19,930
[Coughing]
And this.

358
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:24,595
But our greatest triumph comes not
from flexing the metacarpal bone...

359
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,128
and making a fist, which always seems
to be thirsting to be clenched...

360
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:30,141
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:33,007
Our greatest moment
is when we open our hand...

362
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,980
cradling a glass of wine,
cupping a loved one's chin.

363
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,040
And the best...

364
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:41,052
the most expert of all...

365
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,419
keeping all the objects of our life
in the air at the same time.

366
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,459
My friends, for your
amusement and bemusement,
I give you the human person.

367
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:54,724
Thumb and fingers flexing
madly, straining to keep aloft
the leaden realities of life...

368
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,289
ignorance, death and madness.

369
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:01,098
Thus we create for ourselves
the illusion that we have power...

370
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,574
that we are in control,
that we are... loved.

371
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:08,509
[Korean]

372
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:16,645
Thank you. For my next trick, I will
attempt to become stiff as a board.

373
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:23,118
I hate to eat and faint, but I don't know
if I can even make it down to my knees.

374
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,661
<i>[Horn Honking]</i>

375
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:27,663
That's him. It's gotta be. Radar!

376
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,790
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>
- Lassie, it's Radar!

377
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,733
I'll be right there. Wait a second.
Give me my stuff, will you?

378
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:37,068
Wait a minute. Don't...
Wait a minute. My shoes.
Thank you. Thank you.

379
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,040
[Korean]

380
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:47,180
Thank you.
The love I'll leave with you.

381
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,787
[Korean]

382
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,552
Take care.
Good-bye, Margo.

383
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,019
<i>[Vehicle Departing]</i>

384
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:05,231
- Anybody home? [Korean]
- <i>[All Speaking Korean]</i>

385
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,429
You get it?
"I have returned to Korea."

386
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:11,099
I brought you some "presentos."
For vegetables. Very good.

387
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:13,108
- [Korean]
- You're welcome.

388
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:16,339
Kids, some comics
and some candy.

389
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,814
Not very good for you.
You better eat the comics
and read the candy.

390
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:21,817
Sir, some tobacco.

391
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:25,150
I think you'll find it's a little better
than the manure you've been smoking.

392
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:27,951
- [Korean]
- Thank you.

393
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:31,050
Here's my name
and my unit in Korean.

394
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:34,221
I want you to contact me
when it's time for the baby, okay?

395
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:36,822
- [Korean]
- Boy, that smells delicious.

396
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,834
What are you cooking?
What is that?

397
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:41,336
- [Korean]
- Oh, thank you.

398
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:43,531
That smells so good.

399
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,910
Mmm. Meat.
Where did you get meat?

400
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,047
Wait a minute.
Where's the dog?

401
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,176
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>
- Oh, it's delicious.

402
00:24:56,252 --> 00:24:58,540
What do you put in it?
