181
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,178
Wish we had more like him.

182
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,478

187
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,644
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.

188

Who's next?

189
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,443
It's Anderson, sir.

190
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,116
Well, that's more like it.

191
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,159
Maybe your boys are finally
getting the reins.

192
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,660
I hope so, sir.

193
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,458
Now, who's next?

194
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,624
Lieutenant Dickinson.

195
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,308
Well, you can tell Lieutenant Dickinson
for me,

196
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,709
he couldn't hit a bull in the butt
with a bass fiddle.

197

Is this it?

202
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,827
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

203
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,871
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement,

204
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,602
capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air

205
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,644
and at quite a long range.

206
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,149
Now, listen, Colonel, as you know,
we're short on patrol planes.

207
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,653
We're going to have to rely
on this thing to detect the enemy.

208
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,155
General, radar should do the job.

209
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,420
Well, what's it doing here?
Why isn't it set up?

210
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,120
We were about to truck it up
that mountain, General.

211
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,663
That peak up there is the ideal spot

212
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,996
to put our main radar post.

213

it'd be clear of all interference.

to put her up there.

220
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,258

No, sir, not unless
we want to fight them.

we're going to fight them.

I spoke to General Miles,

with General Marshall.

Do you even trust your own wife?

00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,612
Do you?

240
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,155
Yes. Come to think of it,
I believe I do.

about this one.

on all trade with Japan."

hostile action.

00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,172
Why send a warning at all?

263

00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,182

give us the full inside story?

we were invited to the White House,

532
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,356
I would have dressed.

533
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,359
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

534
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,361
Although she's very informal personally,

535
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,363
I've heard she's a stickler for protocol...

536
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,365
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

537
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,314
[Man Yelling in Japanese]

538
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,337
Well?

539
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,340
Captain Wilkinson's.

540
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,282
Did you see the president?

541
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,285
No. I saw Harry Hopkins.

542
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,584
And did he read the, um,
whatever it is?

543
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,784
No. He doesn't have the key.

544
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,293
I gave the pouch

545
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,296
to a naval aide who was there,
Lieutenant Schulz.

546
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,798
He took it in to the president.

547
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,801
And the president has a key,
I suppose.

548
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,429
Yes, of course he has.

549
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,302
And did Lieutenant Schulz

550
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,306
say anything?

551
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,604
He said thank you.

552
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,475
Darling, step on it, will you?

553
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,287
Sir, Admiral Stark can't be reached.

554
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,290
Should I take this
to the chief of staff?

555
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,293
Well, it's after 10:00.
General Marshall always retires early.

556
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,304
I see no reason to disturb Marshall

557
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,306
with something that's incomplete.

558
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,809
Wait till you have the final part.

559
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,311
Yes, sir.

560
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,313
If you're so concerned, Commander,

561
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,748
why don't we call the chief of war plans...
Admiral Turner?

562
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,752
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

563
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,719
You don't happen
to know where he is.

564
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,791
No idea.

565
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:49,160
The president has already discussed it
with me.

566
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,839
He sent a personal message
to the Emperor,

567
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,843
but when the final part
of this comes in,

568
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,345
I'd like to see it then.

569
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,846
Good night, Commander.

570
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,348
Good night, sir.

571
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,352
I was starved. I bet you are.

572
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,362
Oh, thank you, dear.

573
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,868
Can't you tell me anything...

574
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,870
even a hint?

575
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,377
You'd think the world
was falling apart.

576
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:33,039
Admiral Stark
talked to the president.

577
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,880
What did the president say?

578
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,321
He sent a personal message
to the Emperor.

579
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,321
Gordy. Chad.

580
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,323
Gordy, we've got those 12 B-17 s

581
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,325
coming in from California
in the morning.

582
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,328
Yes, sir. General Martin arranged for
Honolulu radio to stay on the air all night

583
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,330
so the planes could
home in on the station.

584
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,832
Fine. You and I had better be
in that control tower

585
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:26,833
at 7:30 sharp.

586
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:27,834
Yes, sir.

587
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,835
Dear.

Tyler.

589
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,278
I've got a job for you.

590
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,280
Sir.

Lucky boy.
Lucky boy!

598
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,808
Well, Captain, how's it feel,

first command, first patrol?

600
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:11,811
Just fine, Mr. Goepner.

601
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:19,319
In fact, I think I'll turn in for a while.

602
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,825
Good night, sir.

603
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,826

"Precisely 1 p.m. Your time."

616
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,094
I'll be right over.

617
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,752
Look at the time
on the president's message.

618
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,685
I should have had it hours ago.
