The Jerries are here!

00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:04,398
(US ACCENT) How you doin', ma'am?

4
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,478
It's OK. We're here to beat
the Krauts.

5
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:19,637
Excuse me, Miss, we're lost.

6
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:22,517
Could you tell us the way
to Hawthorn Cross, please?

7
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,597
Well, you can't get through
that way.

8
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:26,757
You'll have to go back the way
you came.

9
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:30,636
Thank you, Miss. Turn her around,
will you, we've got to go back.

(WOLF WHISTLES)

11
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:35,556
Knock it off, you guys,
we're meant to be guests here.

12
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,874
Where have you been, then,
you're late.

13
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,553
Haven't you seen?
The Dough Boys are here.

14
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,553
What? Just now, outside.
Didn't you hear them?

15
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:15,633
Dough Boys? They'll be on their
way up to Hawthorn Cross.

16
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:19,553
So it's true, then?
What?

17
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,833
The airfield.
What airfield?

18
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,912
You'll see soon enough.

19
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:27,552
Americans. Late for the last one,
late joining this one.

20
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,552
I'll have another.

21
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,191
Good shot, Farnetti.

22
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,271
There it is.

23
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,311
What do you think?
Mud.

24
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,311
That all you gotta say?
What else is there to say?

25
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:50,670
We're how many feet above sea level?
You tell me, captain.

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,710
So?
Oh, come on.

27
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,390
It's been raining for three weeks.
Drainage? Forget about it.

28
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,510
You try to land a Fort here,
it'll disappear. Captain...

29
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,550
You're on my land.

30
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,590
This is my land.

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,989
Hi. I'm John Kieffer,

32
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,909
215th Engineers.

33
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,909
You're on my land.

34
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:13,829
Now get back in that...whatever you
want to call it

35
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,429
and get off my land!
Sir, this is Hawthorn Cross, right?

36
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,468
I'm afraid we have
a requisition order.

37
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,428
You should have received the papers.
I've received nothing.

38
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,308
Now, I shan't tell you a third time.

39
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,908
Can't you tell this guy
we're on the same side?

40
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:34,187
Stow it, Joe. With all due respect,
sir, you shouldn't threaten us
like this.

41
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,347
OK, OK, we're leaving. But you
shouldn't have done that.

42
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,547
We'll be back.

43
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,144
I thought you were a goner
at Trondheim.

44
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,624
It was close.
It was a mess.

45
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,583
If it wasn't for you...
Forget it.

46
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,743
You're well out of it, mate.
Believe me.

47
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:34,343
I just wish I could join you.

48
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,983
After Trondheim there was Namsos.

49
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,183
Then France, now Africa.

50
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,942
It's never gonna bloody end.

51
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,582
How's Perry?
Jack Perry?

52
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,542
You didn't hear?

53
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,342
He went west.

54
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,262
No... I didn't hear.

55
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:55,062
Benghazi, poor sod.

56
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,341
Come on. Have another one.

57
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,981
No. I've got to go.

58
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,581
I've had enough of this beer.

59
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,261
How about a Scotch?
You'll be lucky.

60
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,340
Things are that bad?

61
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,260
I'll walk home with you.
No...I'm staying.

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,220
I'll see you around.

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,980
It's been good to see you.

64
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,899
I'll have another.

65
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,499
Were you wanting Scotch?

66
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,738
Will?
Dad.

67
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,778
You still up?

68
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,818
I waited up for you.

69
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:43,858
Well, I'm here.

70
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,138
Been boozing?
Yes.

71
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,578
That's the third night in a row.
I was down at the Wheatsheaf.

72
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,897
I saw Paul Milner.
Do I know him?

73
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,537
I was with him in Norway.

74
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,497
He's a policeman now.

75
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:59,537
I'm off to kip.

76
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,537
You're only here for a week.

77
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,697
I've hardly seen you.

78
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,056
I'm here tomorrow.
You'll see me then.

79
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:43,654
Dad, what are you doing up
this late?

80
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,133
What do you think I'm doing? I'm
waiting for you. I'm all right.

81
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,773
You shouldn't be out this late,
not on your own.

82
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,813
You know how your mother and me
worry about you. Dad...

83
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:56,453
Working in that pub. You should
never have left Benson's. Dad...

84
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,413
PHONE RINGING
What's that now?

85
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:04,092
Hello. Stan Davies speaking.
Stan, who is it?

86
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,132
Sshh.

87
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,612
Yep. Right.

88
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:10,452
Yeah, I know it, yeah.

89
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:14,171
All right, I'm on my way.
What's happened?

90
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:16,651
A fire in Market Street.
I've got to go over.

91
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,211
At this time of night?
It's not a raid, is it?

92
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,571
Come on, these things don't happen
by the clock. I have to go.

93
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:26,091
You go back to bed. And Susan, you
get in yours. You need to rest.

94
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:29,010
I'm on my way. Night, Dad.
Goodnight, and don't wait up.

95
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,170
You're very late.
Oh, don't start on me, Mum.

96
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,810
I never know what you're up to
any more.

97
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,970
What makes you think
I'm up to anything?

98
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,529
Here you are. Take this.

99
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,889
No need to tell Dad.

100
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,969
Just...go out and get yourself
something nice.

101
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,049
This is ten bob.

102
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,009
Where did you get this?

103
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,808
Tips...

104
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:03,968
DOOR OPENS

105
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,048
Good morning, sir.

106
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:08,568
Morning. Sergeant Brooke?

107
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:11,527
Yes, sir. You must be Mr Foyle.
That's right.

108
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,647
Very good to meet you, sir.

109
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,847
I've just been transferred
from London. Deptford Green.

110
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,887
I wasn't too keen to be sent here,
to be honest. Oh?

111
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,007
It's a bit out in the sticks.

112
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:25,126
I'm Sam Stewart.
Nice to meet you, Miss.

113
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,086
Anything else?
Not really, sir.

114
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,886
Oh, actually, sir, there was a fire
last night

115
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,846
in...Hilton Village.

116
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,726
Nothing suspicious, though.

117
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:39,005
Local lads say it was started by
a spark from the fireplace.

118
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,085
Your sergeant, Mr Milner,
he's gone over there. Has he?

119
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,445
Yes, and there's a gentleman
waiting for you.

120
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:47,205
I didn't know what to do with him
so he's in your office.

121
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:50,725
Name of Kieffer. Captain.
He's a Yank.

122
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:54,724
Have the Americans arrived
in Hastings? Looks like one has.

123
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,844
I've never actually seen
an American. Except in the films.

124
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:01,324
Jimmy Cagney!
All cowboys or gangsters.

125
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,204
I was thinking more of Clark Gable.

126
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,003
Oh, yeah?

127
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:12,083
You've had a problem or two at
Hawthorn Cross, is that right?

128
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,323
Look, Mr Foyle, I don't want to get
the guy into any trouble.

129
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:17,363
I mean, if I go to my people

130
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:20,162
they're gonna come down on him
like gangbusters.

131
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,322
So I thought if I came
to someone local...

132
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,402
Who are we talking about?

133
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:26,962
This farmer...Barrett.

134
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,962
David Barrett.

135
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:31,202
I can understand why he's upset.

136
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:35,081
You know his family have owned that
place since, gee, Queen Whoever.

137
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,401
But I'm beginning to feel he could
be a danger to my men.

138
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,521
And why's that?

139
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,161
Well, first time we went up there
he had a shotgun.

140
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,321
Took a pot shot at one of the Jeeps.

141
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,440
And there have been other incidents.

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
Blocking our path with his tractors,
snooping around.

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,440
He won't talk to us.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,560
And you're building an airfield,
is that right?

145
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,200
It's on his land.
It was requisitioned.

146
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,159
Well, the...least I can do
is talk to him.

147
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,599
Thank you very much.
Is that it?

148
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,799
Well, as a matter of fact...

149
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,119
they've given us this old school
as a base.

150
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:19,798
It's a hell of a place.
Damp, draughty and stuck
in the middle of nowhere and...

151
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,398
Well, that's my point. I want
someone to come and give us a talk.

152
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,638
A talk on what?
The English.

153
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:29,717
None of my boys has ever been out
of the States before.

154
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,557
Some of them feel
they've landed on another planet.

155
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,957
I need someone to come out and tell
us what goes on around here. Who?

156
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:38,317
I don't know. A teacher, priest,
whoever.

157
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,597
I don't get a chance to get out
and meet many British people.

158
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:44,756
Say, I don't suppose...you'd
be interested, would you?

159
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:47,796
No. No, no. You're right.
Not my territory, you know.

160
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:51,436
OK. Well, if you think of anyone,
would you let me know? I will.

161
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:55,636
You know, until two weeks ago I
didn't even know what a kipper was.

162
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:57,555
We need help.
I can see that.

163
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,075
Hey, sugar.

164
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,155
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

165
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:08,835
I don't see anyone else around.
Well, my name's not Sugar.

166
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,794
Well, what is it, then?

167
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,834
Can I help you?

168
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,514
I'm Joe Farnetti. I'm here
to pick up my captain.

169
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,834
Oh...
Are you a cop?

170
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,714
No, not really. You
still haven't told me your name.

171
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:25,873
It's Stewart. Sam Stewart.
Sam, as in Samantha?

172
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:28,793
Yes. How would you like to see
a movie with me tonight?

173
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,753
Sam Stewart?

174
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:34,593
With you?
That's the general idea.

175
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,713
I don't even know you.
Here's your chance to find out.

176
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:41,112
And you don't know me, either.
Are all you Americans like this?

177
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:44,192
I can't speak for the others.
I'm afraid I'm busy tonight.

178
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,432
How about tomorrow night?
Even busier.

179
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,712
I'm here for a lot of nights.
Everything all right?

180
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,672
Uh-huh.

181
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:55,791
Mr Foyle, thank you for everything.
Let me know how you get on. I will.

182
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,791
Farnetti.
Captain.

183
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,751
I'll be seeing you.

184
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,511
Clark Gable?

185
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,670
What do you think I am, Mr Foyle?

186
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,910
What are you gonna do, arrest me?

187
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,790
No, of course not.
That's the last thing we want.

188
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,150
The Yanks. Nobody invited them
to come over here.

189
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,509
We can win the war without them.
Can we?

190
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,349
They come marching on to my land
without so much as a by your leave.

191
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:29,709
Your land, I'm afraid, has been
requisitioned by the War Office.

192
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,349
Not the Americans, so if you have
any argument, take it up with them.

193
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:36,068
So they've got you on their side,
then?

194
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,628
All right, I took a shot at them.

195
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,708
I was wrong to do that
but I've got a temper on me

196
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,628
and sometimes I act off the top
of my head.

197
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,667
I'll pay for the damage
if that's what you want.

198
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,707
No, no, no. But you should just...
leave them alone.

199
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,667
Oh, that's what I should do, is it?

200
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:58,387
Right, let me show you something.

201
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:07,306
My family have been on this land
for 100 years.

202
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,866
My dad farmed here
and his dad before him.

203
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,626
You go back to the Domesday Book,

204
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,746
there was a farm here
at Hawthorn Cross.

205
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,945
Now this. There's gonna be
a runway here,

206
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:21,105
petrol dump over there.

207
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,145
Water towers, fire stations.

208
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,185
I've seen their plans.

209
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:29,344
120,000 cubic yards of concrete.

210
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,144
400,000 feet of wire.

211
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:36,984
By the time they finish here,
well...there'll be nothing left.

212
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,624
Hastings is in the front line.
We can't expect nothing to change.

213
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,423
I don't expect anything.
But let me tell you this.

214
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,383
We're worried about Hitler invading.

215
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,943
What's the point?
The invasion's happened.

216
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,023
They take our land right
from under our noses.

217
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:56,263
And you say we can't do nothing
about it?

218
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:58,222
We just have to stand there
and watch?

219
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:01,982
Well, it doesn't make any sense.

220
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:46,499
Bob Milner, are you in charge?
Stan Davies.

221
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,659
It was a spark from a fire?
That's what they're saying.

222
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:55,778
Caught the bedclothes. The whole lot
went up like Crystal Palace.

223
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:58,658
You came over from Hastings?
Yeah.

224
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,138
It's a long way
for a little house fire.

225
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,098
I knew the son.

226
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,017
William Grayson.
He didn't make it, then?

227
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,897
He died this morning.

228
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,857
I'm sorry. I knew it was bad.

229
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,937
You were here last night?

230
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:18,337
Yeah, but when I arrived
it was almost over.

231
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,856
Started in his bedroom.

232
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:23,176
See, the bed is close
to the fireplace

233
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,136
and the blanket must have caught.

234
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,256
The door was locked from the inside.

235
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:30,816
We found the key by the bed.
He never got to it.

236
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,696
I don't know why.

237
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:35,535
There was nothing we could do.

238
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,095
Have you spoken to his old man?

239
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:40,055
Not yet.

240
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:43,135
Is it safe to go up?
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,095
Just watch yourself on the stairs.

242
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:43,091
According to this the fire was
started by the bedclothes catching
light. Nothing untoward.

243
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:46,210
I know, sir, but...I'd
still like to look into it.

244
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,490
Over the weekend, in my own time.
Because...?

245
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,850
At Trondheim when I was wounded
he carried me out.

246
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,850
And I hadn't seen him since then.

247
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,089
I can't believe that he came home
and he died like this.

248
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,769
Well, war, you know, people die
in the strangest circumstances,
even heroes.

249
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:10,009
Yes, but I don't understand
why he didn't get out.

250
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:14,328
He'd locked himself in but he could
have opened the door.

251
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,248
There was a key
right beside the bed.

252
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,088
And why was it locked
in the first place?

253
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:21,728
All right. Look into it.

254
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,527
Did you hear him come in?
I saw him.

255
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,487
I waited up for him.

256
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,967
He'd been drinking.

257
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,127
He'd been drinking with me
at the Wheatsheaf.

258
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:37,087
He'd been drinking every night.

259
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,246
It was getting to him, the war.

260
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,286
He wasn't himself.

261
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,366
Was he very drunk?

262
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:47,286
He could barely stand up.
What were you drinking?

263
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:50,646
Just bitter.
He must have had plenty of it.

264
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:55,085
Why did he lock the door?

265
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:57,125
I don't know.

266
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,885
He had nothing to hide.
He'd never locked it before.

267
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,165
So what happened?

268
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:08,204
Well, I was woken up about an hour
later.

269
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:11,364
12 something. I knew something
was wrong straightaway.

270
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,924
Was it the smoke?
I smelled it before I saw it.

271
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:16,004
The whole top floor was alight.

272
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:19,204
When I got up the stairs
I tried to open his door.

273
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:21,283
Wasn't he awake?

274
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,323
I banged on the door
and he heard me.

275
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:26,243
He shouted to me, "I can't see!"
And that's all he said.

276
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:30,643
Then the ceiling in the corridor
come down and that's all I remember.

277
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,402
They dragged me out
but they couldn't get Will.

278
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,242
(QUAVERING)
They couldn't get to him.

279
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:42,202
Oh, Mr Foyle.
Good morning, how are you?

280
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:44,242
I'm good, how are you?
I'm very well.

281
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:46,962
Do you...?
You bet. You too?

282
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,041
I do. Been looking after you, then?

283
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,201
They couldn't have been
more helpful.

284
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:54,601
I was dropping in to get some new
line. You brought this over?

285
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:59,121
Sure as hell wouldn't leave it
behind. Brand new tournament rod.
Reuben Leonard.

286
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:02,001
Reverse guard grips. Hooded silver
nickle butt cap.

287
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,360
Weighs in at four ounces.
How about you?

288
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,520
Well, nothing as grand as that.
Classic split cane.

289
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,400
10 foot?
9'6".

290
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,840
Heavy.
Keeps the bait on the move.

291
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
Still old-fashioned, though.

292
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,239
How do you feel about having a go
with mine?

293
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,319
Well, I'd feel very privileged.

294
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,759
Good. Maybe we can go up to
the river together

295
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,839
and...I'll swap with you.

296
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,519
Mind you, I'd want something
in return.

297
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,199
Oh, yes?

298
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,438
Remember that little talk
I mentioned?

299
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:32,678
I still haven't found anyone.
Oh, really?

300
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:38,198
Brand new Reuben Leonard.
Best rod on the market.

301
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:42,278
How long would this talk have to be?

302
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,517
Well, as long as you'd like
it to be.

303
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,117
Maybe we could have some dinner
afterwards?

304
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:49,077
How about tomorrow night?

305
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,557
All right.
I could send a car.

306
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,517
No need. I'll get there.

307
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,236
Hooked.

308
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:06,476
I left Will here. How much more
did he have to drink?

309
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:08,516
I don't know. A couple of pints.

310
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:10,476
He was sober enough when he left.

311
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,075
He was after whisky.
There is no whisky.

312
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,915
We ran out.

313
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,515
That's what I don't understand.

314
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:23,515
I had a few drinks with him.
With respect the beer here
wouldn't knock anybody out.

315
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,474
I serve a good pint.

316
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:28,234
But according to his father

317
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,394
he could barely stand when he got
home a couple of hours later.

318
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,474
Might have gone somewhere else.

319
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,594
There's the King's Head
or the Red Lion just down the road.

320
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,753
What time did he leave?
Don't know. Didn't notice.

321
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,193
There was a barmaid working here.

322
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,433
Yeah. Susan.

323
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,793
She'll be in this evening.
Do you know where I could find her?

324
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:51,873
I doubt if she can tell you
anything.

325
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:56,952
I'd still like to speak to her.
I'll get her address.

326
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,191
Come on...

327
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,031
What is it?

328
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,631
(GIGGLES)

329
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,710
Stockings!

330
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,270
I haven't seen a pair of real
stockings since...

331
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,190
..the Christmas before last!

332
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,149
The Christmas before last?

333
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:38,949
I was still in college.

334
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,789
In New York?

335
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:45,589
Oh, tell me about New York.
I can't wait to see it.

336
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,549
You won't believe it.

337
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:51,188
Skyscrapers so tall they touch
the clouds.

338
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,468
That's why they're called
skyscrapers.

339
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,588
Fifth Avenue...
Central Park...

340
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,668
GUNSHOT

341
00:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,028
Sshh.
What is it?

342
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,988
GUNSHOT

343
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:05,987
Probably Farmer Giles
and his blunderbuss.

344
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,947
(GIGGLES)

345
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:15,987
I love you, James.

346
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:17,946
I love you so much.

347
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:20,986
You're going to show me everything.

348
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,226
And I want to go shopping
in Manhattan.

349
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:27,106
I'm gonna see a show on Broadway...
Hold your horses.

350
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,146
We got a war to fight first.

351
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,145
No need to be in such a rush.

352
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,225
You weren't exactly slow,
Private Taylor.

353
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:39,305
Well, a girl like you, I was just
lucky to get to you first.

354
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:44,784
And anyway...

355
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,064
We may have less time
than you think.

356
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:51,104
What do you mean?

357
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,984
What do you think?

358
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,224
Well, what?
You know...

359
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:00,423
No. Tell me.

360
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:04,423
James, why are you looking at me
like that?

361
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,223
Tell me.

362
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:14,862
Has anyone told you you've got
beautiful hazel eyes? Tell me.

363
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,782
Well...

364
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,220
Jimmy...

365
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,140
Jimmy!

366
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:00,019
Well, thanks for giving up
your evening.

367
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,059
It's a pleasure, sir.

368
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,139
Do I really have to stay?

369
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:08,258
I thought you wanted to get to know
the Americans?

370
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:11,338
Well, if the one I met was anything
to go by...

371
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:13,698
Forward?
Fresh.

372
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,538
Well, they're a long way from home.

373
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,578
Fighting a war they thought had
nothing to do with them.

374
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,577
It's not any big surprise, is it?

375
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,417
DCS Foyle to see Captain Kieffer.

376
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:40,056
Have you heard from Andrew, sir?

377
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,256
No.
Sorry to ask.

378
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,376
I just haven't heard any news
for a while.

379
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,416
Well, I'm not sure he's enjoying
being an instructor.

380
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:55,055
Missing his spit.

381
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,855
Still, I'd have thought
he'd have written.

382
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,975
No, not recently.
But he's due some leave.

383
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,653
Welcome to Saint Preserve Us.

384
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:20,933
Well, that's what some of the guys
call this place, anyway.

385
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,333
St Mary's All Saints. Was that
the original name of the place?

386
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,413
Yes, it was a school.

387
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,613
They must have been teaching
survival.

388
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,332
So, a one-hour talk in the hall

389
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,892
then I hope you'll both stay
for something to eat.

390
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,932
RADIO

391
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:38,012
I'll bring these up tomorrow.

392
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:40,772
As long as it doesn't rain.
Thank you, Mary.

393
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,212
You should get married again.

394
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,731
I had enough the first time.

395
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:50,811
I don't know what I'd do
without her and that's the truth.

396
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,851
You'd manage perfectly well.

397
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,931
You going to stop for a cuppa?

398
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,571
No, no, I'd...
I'd best get back.

399
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:59,770
By the way, I've got some news.

400
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,570
Ben's on his way.

401
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,090
What?
Why didn't you tell us?

402
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,490
Well, I only got the telegram
this morning.

403
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,530
He's back from Iceland?

404
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,850
He's in Greenock.

405
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,449
But that's Scotland.
When's he coming?

406
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:18,729
Well, he doesn't say. Just says,
"Arrived safely, coming soon."

407
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,729
Susan will be thrilled!

408
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:24,489
Think so?
Course she will.

409
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,208
Does she ever talk about him?

410
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:31,528
You know how it is with young people
these days.

411
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,568
The parents are the last to know.

412
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:36,488
I wish the two of them would set
a date, give us something

413
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:38,568
to look forward to.

414
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:41,807
RADIO: 'The Americans never wanted
to be part of this war.

415
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,527
And although they're now arriving
in Britain,

416
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:46,727
they don't want to be there.

417
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,847
They are paid more than the British.

418
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,767
They eat more than the British.

419
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:56,046
He's right, you know.
What? Lord Haw-Haw?

420
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:58,086
You're not serious?

421
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:00,166
I don't even know why we have it on.

422
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,046
I know he's a traitor
but he's right about the Yanks.

423
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:05,726
It's all a joke to them.
They don't give a damn.

424
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:08,165
And if it hadn't have been
for Pearl Harbour

425
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:10,445
they wouldn't have come over here
at all.

426
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:13,205
But now they're here, they think
they own the place.

427
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,725
They're taking everything
we've got.

428
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:19,725
Come on, Dave. Ask that girl
of yours if you don't believe me.

429
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,805
What are you talking about?

430
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:23,844
No, no. I've said enough.

431
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:25,884
Thanks for the washing.

432
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:27,844
I'll see you in the week.

433
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,363
And I really do appreciate that.

434
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:42,003
Then of course there will be
many things you won't understand
about us. Yeah, warm beer.

435
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,723
Tea.
Broads in uniform.

436
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:47,123
Well, yes, even so,

437
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:51,442
I think you'll find there are a lot
more things we have in common
than you'd imagine.

438
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:54,762
It might perhaps help to remember
that for over two years now

439
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:57,842
while the Germans have...bombed us

440
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,842
they've tried to starve us.

441
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:05,121
We've been on our own and
we might...look a little shabby.

442
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:07,841
A little rough at the edges,
a bit quiet, perhaps.

443
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,881
But the fact of the matter is...

444
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,961
we're very pleased to see you,

445
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:15,881
even though some might say you
took your time getting here. Hey!

446
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:18,840
But now you've arrived it's our job
to make you welcome

447
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,920
and to look after you

448
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,800
and as long as you don't criticise
the King and Queen

449
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,560
and remember to drive on the right
side of the road,

450
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,760
that is, the left side of the road,
you have every chance
of seeing the war out. Thank you.

451
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,679
OK, everybody, that's about it.

452
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,599
Before you go for chow, does anyone
have a question? Yes.

453
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,039
Mr Foyle, there's something
I don't understand.

454
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,958
This girl came up to me
in the post office the other day

455
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,118
and asked to borrow a rubber.
LAUGHTER

456
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:50,958
So I was wondering, did she ask me
to take her out?

457
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:54,518
Stow it, Farnetti. Rubbers don't
mean the same thing over here.

458
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:57,358
So, if you wanna go to the john,
Mr Foyle,

459
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,317
how do you say that in English?

460
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:03,717
Well, I'm old enough not to have
to ask, Mr Farnetti,

461
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:06,557
but if you need help, you'll find
there are lots here

462
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,557
who'll be happy to oblige.

463
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:24,396
What?
I had a copper in here.

464
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:27,115
He was looking for you.
Why?

465
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:30,075
Someone got killed.
Albert Grayson's boy, Will.

466
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:32,115
There was a fire.
Yeah, I know.

467
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:35,875
What's that got to do with me?
He was here the night it happened.

468
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,475
So?
The copper said he was drunk.

469
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,114
I don't know what he did
after he left.

470
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,394
If he was killed in a fire I can't
be held responsible, can I?

471
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:47,794
Listen, did you serve him any...
Alan!

472
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:52,474
We've got to talk about this.
Decide what to do.

473
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,753
Two boys, six and nine.

474
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:01,833
Here's my wife, Ellie.

475
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,833
Do you miss them?

476
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,833
Oh, yes, I surely do.

477
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,833
How about you, do you have kids?

478
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:10,992
Yeah...I have a son.

479
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,952
You know, I've been thinking.

480
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:17,712
Maybe inviting some local
people here for a dance,

481
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:20,472
get to know us better,
what do you think? Good idea.

482
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,551
Fill up?
I will, thank you.

483
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,231
What's wrong with you, Taylor?

484
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:30,071
Forget it, Farnetti.

485
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,150
I forgot. Excuse me.

486
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,750
You're not eating?

487
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,150
I haven't seen so much food in ages.
I don't know where to begin.

488
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,029
So...thought again about my offer?

489
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,989
What?
Movies.

490
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:59,309
Oh. Um...yes I have thought again

491
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,229
and I've decided to say no
for a second time.

492
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,948
You got a boyfriend?
Actually, I do.

493
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,268
Well, forgive me. I was
just trying to be...friendly.

494
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,588
Excuse me, sergeant.

495
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:17,308
Oh, yeah, you two haven't met,
have you?

496
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:21,587
This is Sergeant Jack O'Connor.
How do you do.

497
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,667
It was a good attempt, Mr Foyle,
papering over the cracks.

498
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,347
I beg your pardon?
Them and us.

499
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,667
You need us, so be nice to us.

500
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,906
I take it you're not very happy
to be here, then?

501
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:38,026
You tried sucking up to Hitler,
that didn't work,
so you went to war with him.

502
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:41,466
You almost lost that by yourself
and now you've dragged us in.

503
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,466
No, I'm not crazy to be here.

504
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:47,745
Sorry about that. He had no right
to speak to you in that way.

505
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,705
Oh, not at all.
No need to apologise.

506
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,625
You want another beer?

507
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,225
Yeah, why not?

508
00:31:57,225 --> 00:32:01,224
So, I guess there's no chance
you'll come to the dance with me?

509
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,304
The captain wants to have a dance.

510
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:08,024
You ever tried the jitterbug?

511
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:11,944
I don't know what that is.
I promise. No hands, right?

512
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:14,903
I'm just...5,000 miles
away from home

513
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:16,983
and I don't wanna dance with Taylor.

514
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,623
I'm sure he looks good in a dress.
Oh, he does.

515
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:24,143
Listen, I really should be going
now.

516
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,103
Sam...

517
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,742
I haven't had anything to eat yet.
Here, take these.

518
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:32,822
I couldn't. I just can't.
I'll send them over.

519
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:34,942
Listen, thanks once again
for coming.

520
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,582
No, well, look, it was a great
pleasure helping out

521
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,382
but there's the little matter
of our arrangement.

522
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:43,621
The arrangement, what arrangement?
The Reuben Leonard!

523
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:46,061
Well, the day after tomorrow?
I'd be delighted.

524
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:48,301
And you'll bring me...?
That was the deal.

525
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,421
I'll mail them to you.

526
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:56,900
Or post them. Whatever.

527
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:59,296
'Dear Sam, I know it's been
a long time since I've written

528
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,376
and I'm sorry.

529
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,616
I'm sorrier still
to have to write this.

530
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,895
I can't say I've had a good time
at Debden.

531
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:09,215
Lots of reasons
and of course I was missing you.

532
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,295
I never seem to get any leave.

533
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:14,335
Sam, there's no easy way
to write this,

534
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:16,415
but...I've met someone else.

535
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:18,894
I can't explain it
and I feel wretched

536
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:21,414
but I was going mad on my own,
without you, I mean.

537
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:23,374
And it just sort of happened.

538
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:26,254
The last thing I want to do is
to hurt you.

539
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:28,854
But I thought I should make
a clean breast of it.

540
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,814
And, well, there you are.

541
00:34:31,894 --> 00:34:33,973
God knows when I'll be home.

542
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:36,653
And you probably wouldn't want
to see me anyway.

543
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:38,933
But at the very least
you can begin again.

544
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,413
Good luck, Sam.
Don't think too badly of me.

545
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,853
Andrew.'

546
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,252
I'm sorry, Mr Milner.
She's not here.

547
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,451
Do you know where she is?
She went to see Dr Rogers.

548
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,131
She wasn't feeling too well.
She works too hard.

549
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,211
Why do you want to see her?

550
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,731
I'm investigating the death
of Will Grayson.

551
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:13,011
She hasn't anything to do with
that. She hardly even knew him.

552
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,370
She may have been the last person
to see him before he went home.

553
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,890
I'd just like to know
if he said anything,

554
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,290
if there was anything on his mind.
You think he did himself in?

555
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,330
Perhaps you could ask her
to look in.

556
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,290
It's important.

557
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:30,529
Susan's a good girl, you know.

558
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:33,489
She'd never get mixed up in anything
that wasn't right.

559
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,289
How long has she worked at
the Wheatsheaf?

560
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:40,449
About a year. She used to work
at Benson's over at Bexhill.

561
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:43,088
Benson's?
They make chemicals.

562
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:46,248
They started taking on girls
back at the start of the war.

563
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:49,728
Girls doing men's jobs. Susan
thought it'd be an opportunity.

564
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:52,368
She's always been ambitious.
So what happened?

565
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:55,008
She didn't like it.
The chemicals got up her nose.

566
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,807
So she started at the Wheatsheaf.
That girl had her head screwed on.

567
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:01,327
She could do better,
that's what I told her.

568
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:05,287
Do you know the landlord there?
Alan Carter?

569
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:08,287
Yeah, he's all right.
She'll be there later.

570
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:11,366
If you want her,
that's where she'll be.

571
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,206
Thank you.

572
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,284
(GASPS)

573
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,444
You shouldn't creep up on me
like that.

574
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:45,324
I nearly spilled the whole lot.
I want to talk to you.

575
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:47,244
What about?
All this.

576
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:50,324
Look, a man is dead.
We are responsible.

577
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:52,883
It could be murder, manslaughter,
I don't know.

578
00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:56,443
I should never have listened to you
in the first place.

579
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,723
But now you're gonna listen to me.
What?!

580
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:00,803
This has got to go.
The whole lot of it.

581
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,763
We can't stop now.
Why not?

582
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,883
I need the money.

583
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:07,442
Can't you see this isn't about money
any more?

584
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,802
It is for me.
I need to get out of here.

585
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,802
What are you talking about?
We're not stopping.

586
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:15,682
You can't make me.
We'll see about that.

587
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,642
Oh, yeah?

588
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:20,481
And what if I told the police
about your little business?

589
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,001
I could tell them you made me
help you.

590
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,961
I'm half your age.

591
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,121
Who do you think they'd believe?

592
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,081
You wouldn't do that.

593
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:33,720
Wouldn't I?

594
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,360
At the start you were all over me.

595
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,320
Weren't you, Alan?

596
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
Well, we're not stopping.

597
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,240
And if I go down, YOU go down.

598
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,959
Just remember that.

599
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,959
We're gonna have the pumping
stations here

600
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,919
and here.

601
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,638
Is that for parachute stores?
Exactly.

602
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,358
What about water supply?

603
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:06,598
It's crazy, isn't it?

604
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,798
We're still pumping water out.
This place is a swamp.

605
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:13,798
When we've finished it, we'll have
to find a way to pump it back in.

606
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:17,077
120,000 gallons a day.

607
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,117
Can you do it?

608
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:21,077
I'll work something out.

609
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:25,037
Hey, captain.
Mind if I go into Hastings?

610
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,197
I got some things to do.

611
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:31,196
Sure, Farnetti, you got chow time
like everyone else.

612
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:33,276
What's her name, Farnetti?

613
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:36,076
Hey, Farnetti,
look where you're going. Relax, Dan.

614
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:37,436
What's eating you, Taylor?

615
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:41,436
Nothing, captain. Sergeant,
can I have a word with you?

616
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,355
Go ahead.
In private?

617
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:55,275
Pregnant?

618
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,354
That's what she says.

619
00:38:57,354 --> 00:39:00,274
And it's yours?
That's what she says.

620
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:03,554
Jesus, Mary, that's what I call
FUBB for sure.

621
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,514
What am I gonna do?

622
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,114
She wants you to marry her?

623
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:11,633
I've only known her a few weeks. I
can't marry her, for Christ's sake!

624
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:13,913
I'm 23 years old.

625
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:17,513
I don't want to be a dad, you know?

626
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,433
It's a bit late to think about that,
don't you think?

627
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,472
Can't they...?

628
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:28,832
You know, don't they, over here...?
You don't get it, Taylor.

629
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:31,672
She had her claws in you
the first moment she saw you.

630
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,752
She's nothing but a gold-digger.

631
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:36,712
She was just waiting for someone
like you to come along.

632
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,511
My parents will kill me.

633
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,951
You're a fast operator,
I'll give you that.

634
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:45,511
How long have you known her?
Five, six weeks.

635
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:48,871
And you believe her about the baby?
I don't know. I guess so.

636
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:51,870
Well, unless she has some kind
of accident,

637
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,470
looks like you're stuck with her.
Accident?

638
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,470
It's a war, Taylor.

639
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,110
Accidents happen.

640
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,229
Good morning, Miss Stewart.

641
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:09,589
Good morning, sergeant.
Call me Brookie.

642
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:11,709
Everyone does.
Brookie...

643
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,229
There's someone to see you, Miss.

644
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:16,189
Oh?

645
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,908
Private Farnetti?
Miss Stewart.

646
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:33,068
You didn't get much of a chance
to eat anything last night

647
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:36,027
so I said I'd bring some stuff over.
Thanks very much.

648
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:39,227
There's...there's some coffee,
oranges, some cookies.

649
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:41,187
You know, that kind of stuff.

650
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:45,547
Aren't you going to get into
trouble? Hell, no, we got plenty.

651
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:51,466
I just wanted to apologise

652
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,986
for maybe coming on a bit strong.

653
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,346
I should have listened to
your Mr Foyle.

654
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:58,346
You know, them and us.

655
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:00,986
It's just where I come from,
people are really...

656
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:03,585
I noticed.
Yeah...

657
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:07,305
So...well, anyway...

658
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,305
Enjoy it.
Thanks.

659
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:11,625
And...I'll see you around.

660
00:41:12,985 --> 00:41:15,664
Private Farnetti.
Yeah?

661
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:19,504
This dance, the jitterbug...
Tomorrow night.

662
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:22,264
I was wondering if the invitation
was still open?

663
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,704
I'd love to come.
Really?

664
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:29,503
What about...your boyfriend?

665
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:33,063
I don't think he'll mind.

666
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:36,223
Swell. That's swell!

667
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:42,623
HORN

668
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:56,262
I'll just put it down here, then.

669
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,221
Thanks, Mary, I'll take it up later.

670
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:01,461
Are you going to stay up here?

671
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,861
I've got nowhere else to go.

672
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,461
It must be impossible for you, this.

673
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:09,021
There's men everywhere.

674
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,380
What did you mean the other day

675
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,340
about Susan?

676
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,260
What about her?
Susan and Ben.

677
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,339
You seemed to think there was
something wrong. No, no...

678
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:26,299
I was talking out of turn.

679
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:31,379
You don't know how much it means
to me, this wedding.

680
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:34,339
I just want her to settle down.

681
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,139
You know what sort of girl she is.

682
00:42:38,578 --> 00:42:40,618
She gets ideas.

683
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:42,578
But...

684
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:46,098
Her and Ben, they've known
each other a long time now.

685
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:48,378
They'll be very happy together.

686
00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:51,618
I wonder if any of us will ever
be happy again with this war.

687
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,857
Have you seen what they're doing
over there?

688
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:55,937
I know.

689
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:59,497
If I complain they'll only get the
police on to it. Nothing I can do.

690
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,857
They've sent Ben up to Iceland.

691
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:04,817
Susan left on her own down here.

692
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:09,416
Oh, we're all changed, all of us.

693
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,656
I don't think we'll ever be
the same again.

694
00:43:13,616 --> 00:43:15,696
Is there something
you're not telling me?

695
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:19,736
No, no... Don't you worry, Mary.

696
00:43:19,736 --> 00:43:21,775
Ben'll soon be home.

697
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,935
Everything will be all right.
I promise.

698
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:29,775
You're a shirt short,
I'll pick it up later. All right.

699
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:36,614
Come here, you little beauty.

700
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,534
How many's that?
Three.

701
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:42,334
Same fly?
Yeah.

702
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:46,414
Well, that's my fly.
I know.

703
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,453
Got it?

704
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:57,653
What do you think?

705
00:43:57,653 --> 00:43:59,613
A two-pounder.

706
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,732
So, how did you get on with my rod?

707
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:09,452
Well, it's beautiful, it's just
that I'm not catching anything.

708
00:44:09,452 --> 00:44:12,212
It's a poor workman who blames
his tools. Thank you.

709
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:16,131
I keep trying.

710
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,771
Been a cop for long?

711
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:26,531
Too long.

712
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,451
I was an engineer

713
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:32,050
plodding along in a little place
called North Bridge, Massachusetts.

714
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,210
This all must have come
as quite a shock to you.

715
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,210
Pearl Harbour was a wake-up call.

716
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,289
You know, Christopher,
I could never understand

717
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,929
how many of my countrymen
were against this war.

718
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:47,809
The isolationists.

719
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:52,609
So when did you sign up?
Last November.

720
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,569
A month before Pearl.

721
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,608
I had a kid brother,
his name was Brian.

722
00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:02,608
He was 25 years old serving
in the US Navy.

723
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:05,688
Destroyer.

724
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:07,648
The Reuben James.

725
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,207
They were on convoy duty
in the Atlantic.

726
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:15,327
At the end of October
they were torpedoed and sunk.

727
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:18,087
German U-Boat.

728
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,087
115 people lost their lives.

729
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:24,407
Brian was among them.

730
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:27,086
You know what?

731
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:29,326
No-one noticed.

732
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,286
No-one said anything.

733
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:33,926
You see, nobody wanted to go to war.

734
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:36,246
They wanted to pretend
it hadn't happened.

735
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:40,445
Sorry.

736
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,405
I volunteered the next day.

737
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:48,885
I've got a feeling I'd be better off
with my old split cane, you know.

738
00:45:48,885 --> 00:45:51,525
That's something I'm learning about
you Brits.

739
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:53,724
If it's old, it's got to be good.

740
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:57,404
And you lot think that what's good
needs improving.

741
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:59,244
Hey, I'm the one who caught
the fish.

742
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:01,324
Well, you're the one with my rod.

743
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:04,084
I tell you what, let's call it even
and go get a drink.

744
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:07,043
Warm beer?
Sounds perfect.

745
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:37,761
You look nice.
Thanks, Mum.

746
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,561
Are those new stockings?
Where did you get them?

747
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:43,161
Oh...I've had them ages.

748
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:45,481
I was keeping them
for a special occasion.

749
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,480
Now, don't you be out too late.

750
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,040
Mum...
What did Dr Rogers say?

751
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,280
Oh...I'm just a bit run down.

752
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,360
I'm fine.

753
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,600
Oh, I haven't told you.
Ben's coming home!

754
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,680
Ben?
He sent a telegram from Scotland.

755
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:05,399
When's he coming?
He should be here any time now.

756
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:09,959
Why didn't you tell me?
I haven't seen you.

757
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,759
David only told me the other day.

758
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,318
Aren't you pleased?

759
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,038
Course I am.

760
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,038
It's just...I don't want to see him
at the moment.

761
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:25,318
Not now.

762
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:28,158
You know how he feels about you.

763
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:31,557
Mum, we haven't seen each other
for months. It's not his fault.

764
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,837
You should have told me.
I have told you.

765
00:47:37,797 --> 00:47:39,757
He's a good boy.

766
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,477
He'll look after you.

767
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,396
You were both so happy.

768
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:49,756
The two of you. At school together.

769
00:47:50,196 --> 00:47:52,476
It'll be just like old times,
you'll see.

770
00:47:57,036 --> 00:47:59,035
Don't wait up, Mum.

771
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:14,914
BIG BAND MUSIC

772
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:22,034
Girls...

773
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:54,227
Hello, David.

774
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:56,307
Night, night. Thank you, driver.

775
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:58,307
Uncle David.
Ben.

776
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,427
You look well, you've lost weight.

777
00:50:00,427 --> 00:50:02,866
Navy grub.
So how come it took you so long?

778
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,826
No trains. Troop movements.

779
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:07,546
Well, I can hardly believe
you're here.

780
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,746
I've missed you.
Are you on your own?

781
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,786
Who else were you expecting?

782
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:14,826
You know... Where is she?

783
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:16,905
Come on, let's get home.

784
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:18,905
Yeah, but where is she?

785
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:21,105
Well, she's not here, is she?

786
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,145
I can see that.

787
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,465
I can't tell you
what's been going on here.

788
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:28,105
It's... Everything's changed.

789
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:30,145
What?

790
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,104
Come on, let's get home.

791
00:50:35,224 --> 00:50:37,264
Sir.

792
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:39,344
What are you doing here?

793
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:41,784
I wasn't going to come
but I changed my mind.

794
00:50:41,784 --> 00:50:45,223
Well, good for you. Not the sort
of place I'd expect to see you.

795
00:50:45,223 --> 00:50:48,183
I'm just doing my bit
for Anglo-American relations.

796
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:50,663
Absolutely.
They have wonderful doughnuts.

797
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:57,463
You know what I'm talking about,
Jack? See you later.

798
00:50:58,782 --> 00:51:00,742
Christopher!
John.

799
00:51:00,742 --> 00:51:02,862
I'm so pleased you could make it.

800
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:06,422
This is a colleague of mine,
Paul Milner. Hello, Paul, welcome.

801
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:09,182
Go grab some chow.
Make yourself at home. Have a drink.

802
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:11,142
Thank you.

803
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:54,298
Are you OK?

804
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:56,298
What is it?

805
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:59,138
Are you all right?
Yeah, we're fine, thanks.

806
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:02,098
I'm a doctor. Can I help?
It's something I ate.

807
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,218
Let's get him into another room.

808
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:07,457
We'll have a look at him.
Just take it easy. Nice and slow.

809
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:38,135
TUNE ENDS

810
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:40,695
APPLAUSE
Come on, one more.

811
00:52:45,255 --> 00:52:47,615
BAND STRIKES UP SLOW TUNE

812
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:49,654
Hello.

813
00:52:49,654 --> 00:52:51,654
Hello.

814
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:55,574
I didn't think you'd come.
I said I would, didn't I?

815
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,934
You said you would and you said
you wouldn't.

816
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:00,814
I'm glad you did.

817
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:22,452
TUNE ENDS

818
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:28,292
Where's Jimmy?
Jimmy?

819
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,412
James. Taylor.

820
00:53:30,412 --> 00:53:32,811
He's not coming. He's sick.
You're lying.

821
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:34,851
I just left him. A minute ago.

822
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:37,011
With a doc.
What's wrong with him?

823
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,091
Maybe he heard YOU were coming.

824
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,730
DANCE MUSIC STARTS AGAIN

825
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:10,369
So, you want to dance?
You'll have to show me.

826
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:12,329
My pleasure.

827
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:32,883
Susan Davies.

828
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:36,962
Her parents live in the village.

829
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:41,082
I spoke to them yesterday.
About Will Grayson's death.

830
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:46,322
I wanted to speak to her but she
was proving difficult to track down.

831
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:49,122
Was she involved?
Yes, sir.

832
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:51,081
I'm sure of it.

833
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,679
Nylon.

834
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,839
I wonder where she got those?

835
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:48,317
You don't think she was
involved with any of my men?

836
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:52,037
Well...you have a soldier here
name of Taylor?

837
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:54,917
James Taylor. He's a private.

838
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:58,077
Is it possible to talk to him,
would you mind?

839
00:56:58,077 --> 00:57:00,316
You put me in
a very difficult position.

840
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:03,036
If you're suggesting Taylor
or any of my men

841
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:05,276
could have been responsible
for this...?

842
00:57:05,276 --> 00:57:07,316
It does seem a possibility.

843
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:09,596
I'd hate to obstruct you in any way

844
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:12,836
but I have to tell you my first
responsibility is to my men.

845
00:57:12,836 --> 00:57:16,355
Well, of course. I'm not even sure
I can let you speak to them.

846
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,555
This is an American base.

847
00:57:19,555 --> 00:57:22,195
Theoretically,
you are on American soil.

848
00:57:24,035 --> 00:57:26,715
Meaning?
All I'm saying

849
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:30,234
is that a murder here could have
ramifications beyond you and me.

850
00:57:37,474 --> 00:57:40,394
Maybe we should let
the MPs handle this?

851
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:42,433
Are you asking us to leave?

852
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,593
Hell, no.

853
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:46,553
No. I'm just saying...

854
00:57:46,953 --> 00:57:49,513
..this could be more complicated
than it seems.

855
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:52,793
Well, a girl is dead. It's my job
to find out how it happened.

856
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:56,552
Seems pretty straightforward to me.
We should both tread carefully.

857
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:59,192
Some local doc saw me.

858
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:02,632
I went to lie down.

859
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:06,152
After that, I...
I guess I fell asleep.

860
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,112
Went to lie down where?

861
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:11,431
In my quarters.
You didn't see the girl?

862
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:15,551
No. I...

863
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:18,111
I doubt I would have even
recognised her if I had.

864
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:21,351
Your quarters lead on to
the corridor where she was found.

865
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,030
I was...I was asleep there.
I didn't see anyone.

866
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,070
Door...closed, do you remember?

867
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,670
It was open.

868
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,469
I was...

869
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,589
I was half awake.

870
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:41,989
Half asleep.

871
00:58:43,029 --> 00:58:45,069
But...

872
00:58:45,069 --> 00:58:47,029
But I heard her out in the corridor.

873
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,948
'I don't want to see you now.

874
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:54,908
You shouldn't have come here.
Just leave me alone.'

875
00:58:56,428 --> 00:58:58,508
Was that all?

876
00:58:58,508 --> 00:59:00,788
There was...
There was something else.

877
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:04,707
She said something...like...

878
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:08,267
she was still working and...

879
00:59:09,427 --> 00:59:11,587
And he could see her later.

880
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:13,427
That was it.

881
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:16,347
He?
Whoever.

882
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:22,986
I tried to get up but I couldn't
move and...

883
00:59:22,986 --> 00:59:24,946
so I think I fell asleep again.

884
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:29,026
Right.

885
00:59:29,026 --> 00:59:31,905
You wear identity discs, don't you?

886
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,745
Dog tags, sure. Yeah, we all do.

887
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:35,705
Would you mind if I had a look
at yours?

888
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,785
They're...they're gone.

889
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:56,024
She was engaged.
He won't know.

890
00:59:57,624 --> 01:00:00,623
We're...we're going
to have to tell him.

891
01:00:00,623 --> 01:00:04,463
Who's that?
His name's Ben Barrett.

892
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:07,383
He used to have a job
down at the baker's before the war.

893
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:12,343
The two of them met at school.
Barrett?

894
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:16,462
His uncle farms
up at Hawthorn Cross.

895
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:19,662
He joined up.

896
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:21,622
They sent him to Iceland.

897
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:26,782
He's coming home on leave.
Where are his parents?

898
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:30,501
They were killed two years ago.

899
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,461
Bombed in London.

900
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:38,621
Do you mind if we take a look
at your daughter's room?

901
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:08,978
Is this Ben?
Yeah, that's him.

902
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:10,978
That was taken about a year ago.

903
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:13,538
Being apart must have been hard
for them.

904
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:16,258
It's hard for us all, Mr Foyle.
Well, yes.

905
01:01:17,698 --> 01:01:20,818
Did he ever write? No, he was
never much of a one with words.

906
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,857
Presents, gifts,
did he send anything?

907
01:01:24,857 --> 01:01:26,817
No.

908
01:01:28,497 --> 01:01:30,577
Where was that taken?

909
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:33,137
It was taken outside
the chemical works.

910
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:35,177
Benson's?
Yeah.

911
01:01:35,177 --> 01:01:37,696
Sir...
..in Bexhill?

912
01:01:37,696 --> 01:01:39,696
Yeah.

913
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,176
Susan's diary. She always kept one.

914
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,536
I don't think she wrote much in it,
though.

915
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:50,895
So...

916
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:53,935
Would that be somebody's birthday,
maybe?

917
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:56,135
No, her birthday's the 13th.

918
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:59,175
Well, it was the 13th.

919
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:03,735
All right. Mr Davies,
we'll find who did this to her.

920
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:05,694
Yes.

921
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:10,494
She had so many dreams, that girl.

922
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,814
She wasn't just going to sit around
this village

923
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,854
for the rest of her life.

924
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:19,813
She wanted to be someone.

925
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:25,093
Now that's all over.

926
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,332
Did you enjoy yourself last night?

927
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:36,932
Yes, sir. I did.

928
01:02:36,932 --> 01:02:38,892
Until...

929
01:02:40,292 --> 01:02:42,332
Yes.

930
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:44,412
Did you see anything?

931
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:46,331
Susan Davies for example?
Yes.

932
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:49,211
I saw her arrive. I saw her
talking with O'Connor.

933
01:02:49,971 --> 01:02:53,251
He wasn't being very friendly.
Well, is he ever?

934
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:57,651
Nothing after that?
No, sir.

935
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,611
I was dancing.

936
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,810
Yes, I saw.

937
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,289
Well, I didn't see anything.

938
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,089
And I was there. Poor girl.

939
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:20,089
I gather you had to treat
one of the Americans.

940
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:22,169
A private, yes.

941
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:25,009
James Taylor was his name.
What was wrong with him?

942
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:28,008
A nasty attack of gastritis.
Can be really crippling.

943
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,008
He was in a lot of pain, poor chap.

944
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,528
What could have brought that on,
do you think?

945
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:34,568
Something he'd eaten, perhaps.

946
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,648
Mind you, he'd been drinking too.

947
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:39,968
Anyway, I got him to bed.
That was the best place for him.

948
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:45,047
And the dead girl
was a patient of yours?

949
01:03:45,047 --> 01:03:47,487
Well, everyone in Hilton's
a patient of mine.

950
01:03:47,487 --> 01:03:49,767
It's a small village
and I'm the only doctor.

951
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:53,047
And she came to see you recently?
Yes.

952
01:03:53,047 --> 01:03:56,246
Because she was pregnant?
How did you know that?

953
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:59,966
It was in our doctor's report.
Did she say who the father was?

954
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:02,406
No. It wasn't Ben Barrett,
that's for sure.

955
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:05,486
I rather fear it was one
of our American friends.

956
01:04:05,486 --> 01:04:08,606
Well, they do have an eye for
the main chance.

957
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:11,925
And it must be said that some
of the girls round here

958
01:04:11,925 --> 01:04:15,205
have had a bit of a spring
in their step since they arrived.

959
01:04:15,205 --> 01:04:17,605
Right, but she didn't give you
a name?

960
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,965
No. But I'll tell you this,

961
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:22,245
she couldn't have been happier
about it.

962
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:25,844
She thought this new baby was going
to give her a whole new life.

963
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:27,844
Oh, it's very sad.

964
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:34,044
And you're just gonna let him walk
in and pin it on us?

965
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:37,483
Think I can do anything about it?
Yes, sir, you probably can.

966
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:39,403
Are you hiding something?
No.

967
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,643
I'd seen her around the village,
sure.

968
01:04:42,643 --> 01:04:45,603
But I didn't even know her name.
What about you, James?

969
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:47,603
Did you know her?

970
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:50,443
No... No, sir.

971
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:53,482
I spoke to her once or twice
in the village but...

972
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:56,562
We talk to a lot of Jills.
I mean, she liked to hang around.

973
01:04:56,922 --> 01:04:58,762
I can't tell you much more
than that.

974
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:01,002
What's the story with the dog tags?

975
01:05:01,002 --> 01:05:04,802
I don't know, sir. I had them round
my neck at the start of the evening.

976
01:05:04,802 --> 01:05:07,121
I was sick, I was out of it.

977
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:09,521
What was it you were drinking?
I don't know.

978
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:12,001
Some strong...strong stuff.

979
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:15,241
Are you saying someone took
the dog tags while you were asleep?

980
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,401
I guess they must have.

981
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:21,120
What about the others?
Anyone else seen hanging around
with this girl?

982
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,120
I can ask around, sir,
if it'll help.

983
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,200
No, that won't be necessary.

984
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,320
But when Foyle comes back,
which he will,

985
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,000
we're gonna have to work with him,
OK?

986
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,160
I don't see that
it's his business, sir.

987
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,239
This is a US base. We should leave
it to the Snowdrops.

988
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:38,879
It was an English girl.
I don't care who she was.

989
01:05:38,879 --> 01:05:42,039
He's gonna come in here and try
and pin her death on one of us.

990
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,319
That's all.

991
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,278
Dismissed.

992
01:06:00,038 --> 01:06:02,117
Jimmy... Jimmy!

993
01:06:03,717 --> 01:06:05,797
What is it?

994
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:07,797
What you said in there.
What about it?

995
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:10,517
That you didn't know her.

996
01:06:10,517 --> 01:06:13,717
That you only spoke to her
now and then in the village. So?

997
01:06:13,717 --> 01:06:16,316
That's not true.
What difference does it make?

998
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:19,076
She's dead, man.

999
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:21,836
Someone killed her, man.
What, you think it was me?

1000
01:06:28,995 --> 01:06:31,395
O'Connor.
What do you want, Farnetti?

1001
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:36,155
We should have told him.
What do you mean?

1002
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:39,515
There's nothing to tell.
What about her and Taylor?

1003
01:06:39,515 --> 01:06:41,595
What about...

1004
01:06:41,595 --> 01:06:43,554
What about you giving her money?

1005
01:06:44,954 --> 01:06:46,914
You got a big mouth.

1006
01:06:50,194 --> 01:06:53,514
Sergeant, we can't just walk away
from this.

1007
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:56,233
We gotta tell them what we know.

1008
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:02,673
It's none of your goddamned
business, Private.

1009
01:07:03,513 --> 01:07:06,393
She was a girl. She got killed.

1010
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:09,033
That's the end of it.

1011
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:17,792
How did it happen?

1012
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:21,952
If you're here, if you're asking
these questions,

1013
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:24,671
are you saying someone killed her?

1014
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:26,671
Is that what you're telling me?

1015
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:28,671
She was strangled.

1016
01:07:30,871 --> 01:07:33,591
Is your nephew here, Mr Barrett?
Ben?

1017
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:38,350
You're not telling me you think
he's got anything to do with it?

1018
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,510
Is he here?
Now, listen to me.

1019
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,790
You don't have to be a bloody
detective to know who did this.

1020
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,350
It's staring you in the face.
The Yanks.

1021
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:50,030
They were all there drinking
and dancing.

1022
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,149
It could be any one of them.

1023
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:54,749
She was killed at
the dance, then, was she?

1024
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:59,469
Wasn't she? I presume she went
to the dance

1025
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:01,709
because the whole village was going.

1026
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:03,589
Everyone went.
And you?

1027
01:08:04,629 --> 01:08:07,628
No.
But you were seen.

1028
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:13,468
I was outside the building, that's
true, but I never went inside.

1029
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:15,548
So you did go?

1030
01:08:15,548 --> 01:08:19,228
I went, but when I got there
I changed my mind.

1031
01:08:20,307 --> 01:08:22,467
Taking their food like that.

1032
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:24,507
I don't know.

1033
01:08:24,507 --> 01:08:27,467
I'd enjoy it more if I'd known
it had come from Hitler.

1034
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,467
So I turned around

1035
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:31,667
and...came home.

1036
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:33,666
Did your nephew go?

1037
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:36,466
No. Ben, he was here.

1038
01:08:36,466 --> 01:08:39,026
His fiancee was there, wasn't she?

1039
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:41,026
Did he not know she was there?

1040
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:43,146
Well, yes.

1041
01:08:43,146 --> 01:08:45,786
And it was his first day back
on leave, wasn't it?

1042
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:48,825
Well, of course he wanted
to see her. He was going to go.

1043
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:53,545
But he was dog-tired. He'd come
all the way down from Iceland
then Greenock then here.

1044
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:55,505
He had his supper and went to bed.

1045
01:08:58,025 --> 01:08:59,985
So where is he now, then?

1046
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,224
Couldn't say.

1047
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,024
If he shows up, would you
ask him to be in touch with us?

1048
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:10,064
He'll want to see you. We all will.

1049
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:12,304
We all want to know
who's done this.

1050
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:23,023
Did you believe him?

1051
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:26,103
Did you?
No.

1052
01:09:26,703 --> 01:09:28,982
He isn't very fond of Americans,
is he?

1053
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:34,302
If Susan Davies was having an affair
with an American, perhaps he knew?

1054
01:09:35,302 --> 01:09:37,382
Or maybe Ben Barrett found out?

1055
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:41,222
He comes home on leave, finds his
girlfriend pregnant by another man.

1056
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:44,701
Should we put out an alert?

1057
01:09:44,701 --> 01:09:47,541
No, we should give him the benefit
of the doubt

1058
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,501
for the time being.

1059
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,179
Well, then, what are
you going to do?

1060
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,499
I think I'll go to London.

1061
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:16,539
I wish I'd never come.

1062
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:18,779
You can't just leave.

1063
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,819
The police were here.
Want to see you.

1064
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:22,859
I've got nothing to say to them.

1065
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:24,818
She's nothing to me any more.

1066
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:29,618
Ben...
I've only got a week's leave.

1067
01:10:31,138 --> 01:10:32,538
I'm sorry.

1068
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:36,298
Do you really think I want to spend
any more of it here after all this?

1069
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,817
You've got to see them. They were
asking questions about you.

1070
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:42,457
Now you listen to me.

1071
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:45,897
You can't tell them.
What?

1072
01:10:45,897 --> 01:10:47,897
You can't tell them about her.

1073
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:51,377
Why not?

1074
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:54,056
I know I shouldn't have told you.
That's why not.

1075
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:57,896
If you tell them that you knew
about her and this Taylor

1076
01:10:57,896 --> 01:10:59,856
you know what they're gonna think.

1077
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:03,376
What do YOU think?

1078
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:08,455
Where were you last night?
I told you.

1079
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:11,935
You want me to lie to them?

1080
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,895
What do you want me to do?

1081
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:18,095
I should leave.

1082
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,334
Where have you been?

1083
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:36,093
Actually, sir, I've been having tea.
I'm sorry.

1084
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:38,053
At 11 o'clock?

1085
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:41,893
With Joe Farnetti,
an American from the base.

1086
01:11:41,893 --> 01:11:43,853
Is that the one
you were dancing with?

1087
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:47,413
Yes, sir.
Tell me in the car.

1088
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:54,052
I wouldn't normally take time off,
sir.

1089
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:58,012
He said it was about the case.

1090
01:11:58,692 --> 01:12:00,732
He knows something.

1091
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:02,691
He didn't tell me what.

1092
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,651
He did say that a lot of the men
knew Susan Davies.

1093
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,371
They were getting stuff from her.

1094
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:13,611
Stuff?

1095
01:12:14,411 --> 01:12:16,370
That's all he said.

1096
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:32,729
Sir...

1097
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:36,169
I know this isn't the right place
or the right time.

1098
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:40,129
There's something I've been meaning
to tell you.

1099
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:44,288
I got a letter from Andrew
the other day.

1100
01:12:44,288 --> 01:12:46,248
And...

1101
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:49,288
He's sort of...thrown me over,
I'm afraid.

1102
01:12:50,008 --> 01:12:52,048
He's met someone else.

1103
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:53,968
I didn't know that.

1104
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:55,968
No, there's no reason
why you should.

1105
01:12:55,968 --> 01:12:58,327
I didn't want to mention it on duty
but...

1106
01:13:00,967 --> 01:13:03,007
He was very nice about it.

1107
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:04,967
Very honest.

1108
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:09,487
And it's absolutely true that with
him in Debden and me over here

1109
01:13:09,487 --> 01:13:11,446
it really wasn't going to work.

1110
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:16,286
But there we are.
I just thought you should know.

1111
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,486
Thank you.

1112
01:13:25,605 --> 01:13:27,645
I had a feeling you'd be back.

1113
01:13:27,645 --> 01:13:29,605
It's my job.

1114
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,405
Want to speak to one of them?
Yeah.

1115
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:34,845
James Taylor? You've seen him
once already.

1116
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:36,805
That's right.

1117
01:13:41,324 --> 01:13:43,564
Have Taylor come up to my office,
please.

1118
01:13:43,564 --> 01:13:45,644
Right away.

1119
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:48,844
There you are.

1120
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:51,804
KNOCK ON DOOR

1121
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:59,003
Mr Foyle.
Mr Taylor.

1122
01:13:59,003 --> 01:14:01,403
Mr Foyle has some more questions
to ask you.

1123
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,723
Just one.

1124
01:14:03,723 --> 01:14:06,283
I don't have any more to tell you.

1125
01:14:07,482 --> 01:14:11,642
Erm... Before you became ill
what had you been drinking?

1126
01:14:13,402 --> 01:14:17,082
Some sort of British stuff.
What exactly?

1127
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,321
Liquor. I don't know exactly
what it was.

1128
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:22,281
Where did you get it?

1129
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,001
Answer him, Taylor.
Sir...

1130
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:26,961
Just do it.

1131
01:14:27,841 --> 01:14:31,401
O'Connor gave it to me but
there was nothing wrong with it.
I had too much.

1132
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,361
Where did he get it?

1133
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,080
Susan Davies?

1134
01:14:54,839 --> 01:14:56,959
I don't know what you're talking
about.

1135
01:14:57,959 --> 01:15:00,199
A man is dead and you may have
killed him.

1136
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:03,038
And Susan Davies has been murdered.
You were there.

1137
01:15:03,038 --> 01:15:05,118
That wasn't me.

1138
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:07,478
I swear to you, that was nothing
to do with me.

1139
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,598
Where is it?
Where's what?

1140
01:15:09,598 --> 01:15:12,158
The still.
Sir...

1141
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,876
This way, sir.

1142
01:15:56,035 --> 01:15:57,994
Cuff him.

1143
01:16:04,194 --> 01:16:06,074
Give us a minute, would you?

1144
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:08,034
Not you, Carter.

1145
01:16:09,994 --> 01:16:11,953
Sit down.

1146
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:21,953
Oww!

1147
01:16:24,473 --> 01:16:26,272
Sarge...

1148
01:16:27,632 --> 01:16:29,592
Get him out of here.

1149
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:43,551
I was going to get rid of it.
I was getting rid of it all.

1150
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:46,511
It was never my idea. It was hers.

1151
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:50,151
She picked up the know-how
when she was at Benson's.

1152
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,350
She talked me into it. Said
it would be a laugh, that's all.

1153
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,430
It wouldn't do anybody any harm.

1154
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,550
Industrial strength alcohol,
however you disguise it,

1155
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:01,070
can cause asphyxia, insanity,

1156
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:04,550
blindness, death.
No.

1157
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,509
Will Grayson is dead
because of you.

1158
01:17:07,509 --> 01:17:09,629
It wasn't my fault.

1159
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:14,829
He didn't want his father to know
what he was doing so he locked
the door and drank a bottle of it.

1160
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,869
The room caught fire
but he was blind.

1161
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:18,949
Blind drunk.

1162
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:21,268
That's what your moonshine
had done to him.

1163
01:17:22,148 --> 01:17:24,628
He called out to his father,
"I can't see."

1164
01:17:25,148 --> 01:17:29,468
But it wasn't the fire. It
wasn't the smoke. It was you. No.

1165
01:17:29,468 --> 01:17:31,508
There was a key right beside
the bed.

1166
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:33,668
But he couldn't see it
to let himself out.

1167
01:17:35,427 --> 01:17:37,667
You killed him, Mr Carter.
No, I told you.

1168
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:40,227
It was never my idea.
It was the girl.

1169
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:43,227
I have stopped.
I was going to destroy it.

1170
01:17:44,387 --> 01:17:48,147
But she threatened me. She said she
was gonna tell you I made her do it

1171
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:51,386
but it wasn't like that, it was her.
She wanted the money.

1172
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:53,906
She had these plans. America.

1173
01:17:53,906 --> 01:17:55,826
How did you get that?
What?

1174
01:17:56,306 --> 01:17:58,266
The thing on your neck.

1175
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:01,626
Oh...

1176
01:18:01,626 --> 01:18:04,145
I was clearing some brambles
in the garden.

1177
01:18:08,145 --> 01:18:10,105
What are you thinking?

1178
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:14,465
I never laid a hand on her.

1179
01:18:14,465 --> 01:18:16,504
I swear to you.

1180
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:18,464
I never went anywhere near her.

1181
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:26,224
Excuse me, I want to see Mr Foyle.

1182
01:18:26,224 --> 01:18:29,024
I'm afraid he's not available
at the moment, sir.

1183
01:18:29,024 --> 01:18:32,063
Well, can you tell him David Barrett
is here to see him.

1184
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:34,303
And can you tell him...

1185
01:18:34,303 --> 01:18:37,143
I did it. I killed Susan Davies.

1186
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:41,463
And can you tell him...
I want to confess.

1187
01:18:51,702 --> 01:18:55,222
I lied to you the last time
we spoke.

1188
01:18:57,622 --> 01:19:00,021
I went to the party like I told you.

1189
01:19:01,661 --> 01:19:04,301
But I didn't leave. I went inside.

1190
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:07,421
And I went in to find her.

1191
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:09,461
Because of what she'd done.

1192
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:11,421
Not to me.

1193
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,620
To my boy.

1194
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,700
I never had any children.

1195
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,660
Ben was like a son to me.

1196
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:23,060
And when I think of him up there
in the cold

1197
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,100
fighting for his King and country

1198
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,059
while she was...

1199
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:30,419
..seeing someone...

1200
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:33,739
A Yank.

1201
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:35,699
I told you it'd be one of them.

1202
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:38,699
And I was right, wasn't I?

1203
01:19:40,018 --> 01:19:42,178
I saw him with her.
Coming out of the barn.

1204
01:19:47,018 --> 01:19:50,378
I should have told Ben. Of course
I should have told him, but...

1205
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,417
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1206
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:56,017
He was asleep like I told you and...

1207
01:19:57,057 --> 01:19:59,137
(SIGHS)

1208
01:19:59,137 --> 01:20:01,057
Then I decided
that I'd deal with it.

1209
01:20:04,697 --> 01:20:07,896
By killing her?
No, no, not kill her.

1210
01:20:08,856 --> 01:20:10,816
Just to see her to plead with her.

1211
01:20:11,776 --> 01:20:14,656
Oh, I don't know, I don't know
what was going on in my head.

1212
01:20:16,656 --> 01:20:18,816
I went in the back way.

1213
01:20:18,816 --> 01:20:20,736
And I ran across her
in the corridor.

1214
01:20:21,615 --> 01:20:23,655
We didn't talk much.

1215
01:20:23,655 --> 01:20:25,615
She didn't want to see me.

1216
01:20:26,575 --> 01:20:29,615
And then...
Well, then I just lost my temper.

1217
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:34,895
That's all there is to it.

1218
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:36,854
There's...nothing else to say.

1219
01:20:40,374 --> 01:20:42,334
Do you know that...

1220
01:20:44,134 --> 01:20:45,974
..you could hang for this?

1221
01:20:48,014 --> 01:20:50,093
I feel sorry for Stan and Mary.

1222
01:20:50,093 --> 01:20:52,293
I mean, they'd no idea
she was like that.

1223
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:54,373
They just thought the best of her.

1224
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:56,493
I just wish they didn't
have to find out.

1225
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:01,933
Do you know the name of the American
that Susan was seeing?

1226
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,092
Taylor.
Thank you.

1227
01:21:07,452 --> 01:21:09,412
Any feelings at all for this girl?

1228
01:21:10,372 --> 01:21:12,412
No, sir.

1229
01:21:12,412 --> 01:21:14,372
Sir, I didn't...

1230
01:21:16,052 --> 01:21:20,131
I was just so lonely.
I got a girl back home
and I missed her so much.

1231
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:24,691
And Susan...
At first she seemed so friendly.

1232
01:21:26,331 --> 01:21:29,371
One thing led to another.
She wanted me to marry her.

1233
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:33,930
That wasn't going to happen.
My parents would have killed me.

1234
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,170
Anyway, I told you,
I didn't love her.

1235
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:38,130
I know how that sounds.

1236
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:44,689
Well, you could have told us
all this in the beginning,
the night she was killed.

1237
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:48,129
The person who did this is still
out there, so you haven't helped.

1238
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:51,329
I'm sorry, sir.

1239
01:21:51,329 --> 01:21:53,529
I was... I was scared.

1240
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:55,409
I was ashamed.

1241
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:06,608
Mr Barrett?
Who are you?

1242
01:22:06,608 --> 01:22:08,888
We're the police. We've been
expecting you

1243
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:10,728
to be in touch with us.
Yeah?

1244
01:22:10,728 --> 01:22:12,887
Can we have a word?
Please yourself.

1245
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:17,607
I don't care what he said.
He didn't kill anyone.

1246
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:19,847
He wouldn't have hurt Susan.

1247
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,927
He's known her her whole life.

1248
01:22:21,927 --> 01:22:25,487
Her mum and dad are his friends.
I'm telling you, he didn't do it.

1249
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:28,006
Why is he telling us he did, then?
I don't know.

1250
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,006
You tell me.

1251
01:22:30,006 --> 01:22:32,766
You've just come back from Iceland,
haven't you?

1252
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:35,366
Yes.
Convoys, is that right?

1253
01:22:35,366 --> 01:22:37,326
I can't talk about it.

1254
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,565
Would you talk to us about Susan?

1255
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:47,245
What?
Susan.

1256
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,965
We met at school.

1257
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:53,485
So I gather.
I understand you're engaged?

1258
01:22:55,044 --> 01:22:56,964
We were.

1259
01:22:56,964 --> 01:22:59,684
Were you aware of the...

1260
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:02,684
relationship she was having
with one of the Americans?

1261
01:23:02,684 --> 01:23:04,684
Yes. My uncle told me.

1262
01:23:04,684 --> 01:23:06,644
Did he? He says he didn't.

1263
01:23:07,923 --> 01:23:10,243
Uncle David doesn't know
what he's saying.

1264
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:13,683
Finding that out after being away
for so long

1265
01:23:13,683 --> 01:23:15,723
must have been quite a shock?

1266
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:17,923
It wasn't a shock.

1267
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:19,963
She was always that way

1268
01:23:19,963 --> 01:23:22,642
if you want the truth, Mr Foyle.

1269
01:23:22,642 --> 01:23:26,082
Dreaming.
Never happy with what she had.

1270
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,722
Even at school she wanted to travel,

1271
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:32,722
see the world.

1272
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:35,442
I often wondered if she'd
ever really settle down.

1273
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,361
And if she did, would it be with me?

1274
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:44,241
So...then what did you do?

1275
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:46,241
I went to the pub.
Which pub was that?

1276
01:23:46,241 --> 01:23:48,601
The Royal Oak, Hastings.

1277
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:50,720
Your uncle told us
that you went to bed.

1278
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,800
Well, he's lying again.

1279
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,280
He thinks I killed her.
Don't you see?

1280
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,880
He's protecting me
because he thinks I did it.

1281
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,960
Well, I didn't and neither did he.

1282
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,359
So the two of you are wasting
your time. You might as well leave.

1283
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:07,199
Mr Barrett,

1284
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,159
you can go.

1285
01:24:10,559 --> 01:24:12,639
What?

1286
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,959
You can leave.
I've spoken to your nephew.

1287
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:17,039
What are you saying?

1288
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,598
I'm saying that
you're free to...free to go.

1289
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:24,078
Making a false confession is
construed as wasting police time

1290
01:24:24,078 --> 01:24:26,238
and obstructing the course
of justice

1291
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:29,278
but I understand why you did it,
so you're free to go.

1292
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:31,277
What about Ben?
What about him?

1293
01:24:31,277 --> 01:24:33,317
Didn't he...?

1294
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:35,277
No.

1295
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,397
I thought that he'd killed Susan
and I...

1296
01:24:40,397 --> 01:24:43,197
I thought it was my fault.

1297
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:46,396
I did more than that.

1298
01:24:47,196 --> 01:24:49,316
I wanted him to be angry.

1299
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:53,356
I don't know how I could have
done that, Mr Foyle,
but I wanted him to...

1300
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:55,276
I just don't know
how I could do that.

1301
01:24:55,956 --> 01:24:58,036
There's someone else, Ben.

1302
01:24:58,036 --> 01:25:01,315
He's taken her.
He's sweet-talking her.

1303
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:05,395
And now...she doesn't
want to know you.

1304
01:25:10,795 --> 01:25:13,194
I told him about her and Taylor.

1305
01:25:14,154 --> 01:25:16,594
And so God help me,
I didn't spare any details.

1306
01:25:17,554 --> 01:25:19,514
I wanted to make him angry.

1307
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,114
He's one of these Yanks.

1308
01:25:24,114 --> 01:25:27,353
They come over here and they don't
give a damn about our boys

1309
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:29,393
out there fighting the war.

1310
01:25:29,393 --> 01:25:31,473
They earn twice as much as you do.

1311
01:25:31,473 --> 01:25:34,033
They've got food,
they've got everything.

1312
01:25:35,553 --> 01:25:37,513
But that's not enough.

1313
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:42,072
James Taylor. That's his name.

1314
01:25:43,032 --> 01:25:44,992
And you should do something
about it.

1315
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:52,512
So you tried to get him
to go to the dance
to pick a fight with Taylor?

1316
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,671
I did. And that's where I thought
he'd gone.

1317
01:25:57,271 --> 01:25:59,311
Not at all what happened though,
is it?

1318
01:26:01,311 --> 01:26:03,071
No.

1319
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,270
Susan...

1320
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,230
Susan!

1321
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,710
Susan?

1322
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:19,790
I thought it must have been Ben.

1323
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,990
I thought he must have come
across her.

1324
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:28,189
It was my fault.

1325
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:32,549
And you took the identity discs?

1326
01:26:34,509 --> 01:26:36,588
How do you know that?

1327
01:26:36,588 --> 01:26:39,268
Well, somebody did and it certainly
wasn't her.

1328
01:26:39,268 --> 01:26:42,948
The string wasn't broken so it
would have come over Taylor's head

1329
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:46,588
not something you're able to
do while you're being strangled,
perhaps?

1330
01:26:46,588 --> 01:26:48,668
I was going to leave

1331
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:51,387
then I heard some men calling out
his name.

1332
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:55,787
Taylor, come on!

1333
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:57,867
What is he doing in there?

1334
01:26:57,867 --> 01:27:00,267
Private First Class Taylor,
where are you?

1335
01:27:00,267 --> 01:27:02,307
First Class what?!

1336
01:27:02,307 --> 01:27:04,266
LAUGHTER

1337
01:27:07,906 --> 01:27:09,866
DRUNKEN SINGING

1338
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:25,585
Taylor?

1339
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:28,865
I didn't even think about it,
actually.

1340
01:27:28,865 --> 01:27:32,224
It just seemed,
well, the right thing to do.

1341
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:37,984
I wanted to punish him
and protect Ben.

1342
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,144
I know it wasn't right.
It was a wicked thing to do.

1343
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:45,583
But to be honest with you, I...

1344
01:27:45,943 --> 01:27:48,743
I don't know how I could.

1345
01:28:06,462 --> 01:28:08,502
Who did kill her, Mr Foyle?

1346
01:28:08,502 --> 01:28:10,462
Do you know?

1347
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:20,781
Mr Carter...
Yes?

1348
01:28:20,781 --> 01:28:23,661
We're arresting you for the murder
of Susan Davies.

1349
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:27,021
You don't have to say anything...
No. You can't pin that on me.

1350
01:28:27,021 --> 01:28:29,060
I had nothing to do with it.
Sit down.

1351
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,940
You're wrong.
You were heard.

1352
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:34,180
Who, who was?
Yourself and Susan Davies.

1353
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:36,100
Who by?
One of the Americans.

1354
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,140
He was in a room next to
the corridor where you killed her.

1355
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,459
I don't want to see you now.
You shouldn't have come here.

1356
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:45,499
Please...
Just leave me alone.

1357
01:28:45,499 --> 01:28:50,379
Stop following me. I'm still
working, do you understand?

1358
01:28:50,379 --> 01:28:54,139
So what sort of evidence
do you call that?
Is that a reason to kill her?

1359
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:56,218
No, but he misheard, didn't he?

1360
01:28:56,218 --> 01:28:58,578
It was nothing to do with her
still working

1361
01:28:58,578 --> 01:29:01,818
but very much to do with keeping
your illegal still working.

1362
01:29:01,818 --> 01:29:03,898
Which was the reason you killed her.

1363
01:29:03,898 --> 01:29:07,658
Blood was found under her nails.
What's that got to do with me?

1364
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:11,337
From that.
Look, that's not...

1365
01:29:11,337 --> 01:29:14,417
I told you where I got that.
It's your blood.

1366
01:29:24,976 --> 01:29:26,936
I had to.

1367
01:29:27,376 --> 01:29:29,416
I had to make her stop.

1368
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:31,616
But she wouldn't listen to me.

1369
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,656
I...I couldn't make her listen.

1370
01:29:33,656 --> 01:29:36,056
And a man had died.

1371
01:29:36,815 --> 01:29:40,415
I don't want to see you now.
You shouldn't have come here.

1372
01:29:40,415 --> 01:29:42,455
Listen...
Just leave me alone.

1373
01:29:42,455 --> 01:29:45,535
I'm going to keep the still working,
do you understand?

1374
01:29:45,535 --> 01:29:47,535
What are you doing, get off!
No!

1375
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:49,495
Get your hands off me!

1376
01:30:08,373 --> 01:30:10,333
I never meant to hurt her.

1377
01:30:27,932 --> 01:30:30,372
Sam...
Sir?

1378
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:34,571
Listen, I should apologise.

1379
01:30:34,571 --> 01:30:38,531
I've made...judgements about you
and your personal life

1380
01:30:38,531 --> 01:30:40,651
which I had absolutely no right
to do

1381
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:42,731
and as a result I...

1382
01:30:42,731 --> 01:30:46,090
I might have spoken out of turn.
That's quite all right, sir.

1383
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:48,210
I should have said something
earlier.

1384
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,770
Well...I'm sorry about Andrew.

1385
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:54,170
It's the war, isn't it?

1386
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,050
I suppose so.

1387
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,569
Can I give you a lift home?

1388
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:03,609
No. I'll walk.
You get an early night.

1389
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:06,649
Thank you.
And...

1390
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:09,609
Have a very good time.
Thank you.

1391
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,009
Goodnight.

1392
01:31:18,888 --> 01:31:20,848
Christopher!

1393
01:31:25,888 --> 01:31:28,367
I just missed you at the station.

1394
01:31:28,367 --> 01:31:31,487
So you've finally caught the killer,
eh? Yep.

1395
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:34,167
And it wasn't the wicked American?
It wasn't.

1396
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:36,607
I guess Lord Haw-Haw
will be sorry about that.

1397
01:31:38,447 --> 01:31:40,487
Look...
TURNS OFF ENGINE

1398
01:31:40,487 --> 01:31:42,646
I might as well come straight out
with it.

1399
01:31:46,046 --> 01:31:48,086
I wanna say I'm sorry, OK?

1400
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,006
This business about the girl.

1401
01:31:50,006 --> 01:31:51,966
I'm new here.

1402
01:31:51,966 --> 01:31:55,006
I know how you British are always
murdering each other

1403
01:31:55,006 --> 01:31:57,365
but I didn't expect to get
caught up in it.

1404
01:31:57,365 --> 01:31:59,565
So... Maybe I behaved like a jerk.

1405
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:03,285
Well, you did what you thought
was right.

1406
01:32:04,245 --> 01:32:06,485
Can we put all this behind us?
Of course.

1407
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:10,124
Good. And in the interests of
furthering British/US friendship

1408
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,964
I happen to have a quart
of Jack Daniels in the back.

1409
01:32:12,964 --> 01:32:16,604
Don't suppose you'd care to come
back to base and help me drink it?

1410
01:32:16,604 --> 01:32:18,804
To help the war effort?
Exactly.

1411
01:32:18,804 --> 01:32:20,924
Don't see why not.
Climb aboard.

1412
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:32,203
By the way, what's a jerk?

1413
01:32:32,203 --> 01:32:35,923
Let me explain.
Nothing to do with dried meat?

1414
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:38,002
Nothing to do with dried meat!

1415
01:32:38,002 --> 01:32:40,802
That's jerky.
That's jerky?

1416
01:32:40,802 --> 01:32:44,722
OK, look, a jerk is someone who...

1417
01:32:46,002 --> 01:32:48,922
Not even the Prime Minister knows
what we're doing here.

1418
01:32:48,922 --> 01:32:51,641
They do it to us, we must be
prepared to do it to them.

1419
01:32:51,641 --> 01:32:53,601
You've developed it,
what's the cure?

1420
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:04,721
I want you to marry me.
And I want to never let you go.

1421
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:14,800
