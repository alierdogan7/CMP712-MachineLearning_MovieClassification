1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,242
Hey. How's it going, Danny?

2
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,377
It's going great, Uncle Len.

3
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,479
Good, good, good.

4
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,147
I'm going to need those chairs

5
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,448
for the wedding reception
tomorrow night.

6
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,083
They going to be ready?

7
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,318
They'll be ready.

8
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,287
Good, good.

9
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,727
Is everything okay, Danny?

10
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,596
Yeah.

11
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,798
I was just...

12
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,267
You know, listening
to the party upstairs.

13
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,270
It just sounded like fun.

14
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,971
Yeah.

15
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,608
It's a group of soldiers
shipping out tomorrow morning.

16
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,143
They deserve to have some fun
their last night here.

17
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:26,146
Just wish I was
going with them.

18
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:30,083
I know.

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,487
Well, you be thankful
that that polio didn't leave
you with more than a limp.

20
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,190
For a while there,
none of us thought you
were going to make it.

21
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,192
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.

22
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,660
Oh, you don't mean that.

23
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,863
Think of what
that would've done.

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,334
But now all I am
is a useless cripple,

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,869
a useless 4-F cripple.

26
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,338
Useless?

27
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,340
[chuckles]

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,313
Look at
this fine workmanship, Danny.

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,717
This is a gift.
Look what you can
do with your hands?

30
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,354
Yeah, but I'd rather have
a rifle in my hands,

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,256
going after the Japs
or the Krauts.

32
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,358
I know.

33
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,263
Is Mr. Toulon
still staying here?

34
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,232
Yeah, he's
in his room upstairs.
Wonderful old man.

35
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,568
He was in Europe, you know.
He was fighting the Nazis.

36
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,102
Well, that's what he says,

37
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,137
but sometimes I think
he's prone to tall tales.

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,673
No, Uncle Len, it's true.

39
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,644
You know,
the Nazis killed his wife?

40
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,547
Mr. Toulon said the Nazis
wanted to steal his puppets,

41
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,816
so now he even has
a special hiding place

42
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,254
so they don't fall
into the wrong hands.

43
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,089
It's because he has
a secret.

44
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,558
He can make them move
without the strings.

45
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,328
[laughing]
No, Uncle Len,
it's true, really.

46
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:50,931
I've seen it.

47
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,266
Come to think of it,

48
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,001
maybe he has some work
for you. Huh?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,470
Maybe you could help him
with those puppets of his,

50
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,972
repairing them, fixing them up,
that sort of thing.

51
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,041
Have you thought of that?
I guess you're right.

52
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,477
I suppose I could ask him.
You should.

53
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,447
After you're done here,
I'm not going to have
any work for you,

54
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,648
not for a while anyway.

55
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,452
And if I worked
for Mr. Toulon,

56
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,287
Your mother
needs to see you, Danny.

57
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,623
She misses you.
So does your brother.

58
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,391
Yeah, I know.
I miss them, too,
but...

59
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,259
But...

60
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,161
But you don't want
to be cooped up here

61
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,830
with your old uncle,
either, huh?

62
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,934
Well, you'd rather be
overseas fighting.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,802
Hopefully the war
will be over soon

64
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,071
and we won't need
to fight anymore.

65
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,441
I'm going to let you get
back to your work, Danny.

66
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,609
I'll tell the cooks to have
dinner prepared for you
in the kitchen

67
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:40,848
when you're done, huh?

68
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,417
[both laugh]
How would that be, huh?

69
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,487
Thank you, Uncle Len.
Okay.

70
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,494
[footsteps pattering]

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,897
[panting]

72
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,607
[panting, grunting]

73
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,956
[panting]

74
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,615
[screams]

75
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,483
[gasping]

76
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,021
[screams]

77
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,960
[cocks]

78
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,780
[fires]

79
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,594
Mr. Toulon?

80
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,996
You all right?

81
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,004
Mr. Toulon?

82
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,881
Oh, my God.

83
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,433
[people chattering]

84
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,007
[door opens]

85
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,075
What the devil?

86
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,945
[gasps]
Danny.

87
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,579
Mom.

88
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,248
Great to see you.

89
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,983
I didn't think you'd be
back till next week.

90
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,184
Your Uncle Lenny said...

91
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,453
Oh, yeah, we finished early.

92
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,854
What's all this?

93
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,256
Oh, it's just something
I'm working on.

94
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,991
I'll take it over to my room.

95
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,294
Oh, leave it.
Let me have a look at you.

96
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,230
I swear you've gotten taller.

97
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,398
Mom, I've only been gone
for three weeks.

98
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,134
But for sure
you've lost weight.

99
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,803
Sit down.
Let me get some food in you.

100
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,472
Nonsense.
Leave it.

101
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,442
Sit down.
I'll fix you up
a quick lunch.

102
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,430
Look out!
[laughs]

103
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,271
Did that Uncle Len spoil you
with that 20-year-old Scotch
of his?

104
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,439
Come on, you know
I didn't get any Scotch.

105
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,840
What?

106
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,978
Oh, that's right.
You're an Ovaltine man.

107
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,181
Very funny, very funny.

108
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,615
Don't ship out
for another week.

109
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,251
Do you know
where you're going yet?

110
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,252
Not yet.

111
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,254
I hope not Japan.

112
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,558
It would be like we live
there already,

113
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,094
Oh, hush, Donny.

114
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,196
They're Chinese,
not Japanese.

115
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,598
What's the difference?
[both giggle]

116
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,200
They've never given us
a lick of trouble

117
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,401
in all the years
we've been here.

118
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,436
Yeah, well, after the war,

119
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,072
I'm going to make enough money
to get you out of Chinatown.

120
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,573
[chuckles]

121
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,443
I'm hoping
they send me to Europe.

122
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,711
Wow, the Jerries.

123
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,313
Yeah, I'd love to get
my hands on them.

124
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,914
It's cold over there
right now, though.

125
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,882
I'm going to freeze
my ass off.

126
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,320
And you've got to watch out
for those Panzer tanks
of theirs.

127
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,356
[Don]
Oh, yeah.
Enough talk about the war.

128
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,225
What else is there
to talk about?

129
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,492
How about baseball

130
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,328
or this nice weather
we're having?

131
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,064
Mom, come on. The war is
what matters right now.

132
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,099
[sighs]
I just don't like
to think about it.

133
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,036
That's all.

134
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,237
Getting hurt over there.

135
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,938
I'll be okay, Mom.

136
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,174
God willing.

137
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,981
Look, you know I wish
I was going over there
with you, right?

138
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,716
I know, little brother.

139
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,652
Think about what
that would do to Mom.

140
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,254
You know, the Mitchells
down the street,

141
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,523
they got three boys serving...

142
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,959
Yeah, and have you seen
Mrs. Mitchell lately?

143
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,894
Looks like she's aged
30 years.

144
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,198
We can't do that to Mom.

145
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,568
Handle what better, dear?

146
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,237
No, no, I don't
want to be stuck here.

147
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,474
Look, I love you, Mom,

148
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,008
and I'd be going over
to serve

149
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,243
if I wasn't
a goddamn cripple.

150
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,711
Hey.
Danny.

151
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,046
Well, it's true.

152
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,048
You may think
your leg is a curse,

153
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,451
but to me it's a blessing.

154
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,589
Well, the Army doesn't know
what they're talking about.

155
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,425
Honey.
Nobody's saying
you can't, Dan.

156
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,527
Just the way the ball bounced.

157
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,430
You have to do what you can
from here in the home front.

158
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:17,104
Like what,
restoring furniture?

159
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,938
No, no, I think
you got something.

160
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:23,443
Why don't you build
a special chair for Hitler?

161
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,312
He goes to sit down, and wham!

162
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,447
A spear goes
right into his ass.

163
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,450
Don.

164
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,435
[Don]
You he could make these things
move without strings?

165
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,872
[Danny]
I saw it.

166
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,276
I don't know. There's
nothing cheap about it.

167
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,878
That's why I think
he killed himself.

168
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,681
Because he didn't want
to hand over his secret
to those Nazis.

169
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,883
Nazis?

170
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,786
Come on, you're telling me
that Nazis made the trip
all the way here

171
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,623
to take some little puppets
from an old man?

172
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,326
That's a little far-fetched
even for you, little brother.

173
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,428
It's not the puppets
that they wanted.

174
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,965
It's the secret
to whatever makes them move.

175
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,769
Yeah, well,
I think you've been reading
too many of those pulps.

176
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,740
Huh.

177
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,814
What's this?
[chuckles]

178
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,550
Oh, that's one Mr. Toulon
was trying to repair.

179
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,587
[chuckles]
Six arms, huh?

180
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,390
That's what we need
against the Krauts.

181
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,292
[imitates gunfire]

182
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:49,162
Take that, you dirty Nazis.

183
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,830
[chuckles]

184
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,132
I don't even need a gun
to kill those bastards.

185
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,668
You know how great I am
at sneaking up on people.

186
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,804
Please, you don't
have to remind me.

187
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,672
I stained my shorts
when you got me earlier.

188
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,543
Yeah.
If they send me to Japan,

189
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,747
I'll use my skills to sneak up
on those Japs in the jungle...

190
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,048
[makes whooshing noise]

191
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,550
And slit
their yellow throats.

192
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,819
Yeah, I bet you would.

193
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,754
[mock gasping]

194
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,389
Hey, there's a Duke double bill
downtown tonight.

195
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:21,428
You want to go?

196
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,430
Come on, forget the puppets.

197
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,564
They're not going anywhere.

198
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,666
Let's have some fun together.

199
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,501
I'm only here
for another week.

200
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,770
Call up that cute girl
of yours. What's her name?

201
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,104
Beth.

202
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,374
Beth. She's a dame, huh?

203
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,443
Hey, have her bring her sister
if she's got one.

204
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,346
Hm?
All right.

205
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,994
[knock on door]

206
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,371
Yes?

207
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,808
We are looking
for Roland Tomasi.

208
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:46,012
Tomasi is dead.

209
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,491
Leave your dramatic
gestures to me.

210
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,561
[snickers]
A woman?

211
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,097
Your astonishment
is refreshing.

212
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,568
I would advise
against using your weapon.

213
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,874
We're here to contact Tomasi.
What happened to him?

214
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,646
As you know,
Tomasi was a traitor
as an American,

215
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,583
a fascist sympathizer,

216
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,585
a fifth columnist

217
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,687
willing to ally himself

218
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,690
with the Germans,
such as yourself,

219
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,092
as well as the Japanese.

220
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,662
However, his treachery
extended extended to those

221
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,732
he allied himself with.

222
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,435
When he betrayed me
in a simple matter,

223
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:21,508
well, he met
with an unfortunate end.

224
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,276
I have taken over his plan

225
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,382
to strike at the heart
of the American war effort.

226
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:33,352
You're willing to stay
if you wish,

227
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,957
or you may leave unharmed.

228
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,430
Klaus and I could
just as easily take over
this plan as you.

229
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:47,967
You mean
if you kill me and my men,

230
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,504
but more likely
we'd all kill each other.

231
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,973
What purpose would that serve?

232
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,778
The Germans and the Japanese
are not friends,

233
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,782
yet we share a common enemy.

234
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,585
Perhaps we can work together.

235
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,022
Sake?

236
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:18,598
To making the American swine
bleed.

237
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,745
Let me ask you something.

238
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,549
Why is a Japanese woman...

239
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:40,653
And I mean a beautiful
Japanese woman...

240
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,590
Hiding in an opera house

241
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,025
in the heart of Chinatown?

242
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,729
What better place
for a Japanese to hide?

243
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:53,833
Americans can't tell
any of us apart anyway.

244
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,607
Your English
is very practiced,
very convincing.

245
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:05,612
May have to do something
with the hair,

246
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,380
but it might work.

247
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,818
Yes, it might just work.

248
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,694
You all have
these little holes.

249
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,796
Why is that?

250
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,942
Oh, no, Beth.

251
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,838
I'm late, I know.
Again. My lunch hour
is almost over.

252
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,308
Sorry.

253
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,044
Chocolates.

254
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,947
Well, at least
that's something to eat.

255
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,782
I really am sorry, Beth.

256
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,217
I just got to working
on those puppets

257
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:56,222
and kind
of lost track of time.

258
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,690
Like Pinocchio, huh?

259
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,559
Don't be silly.

260
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,928
What's this?

261
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,000
Ben? Anybody I should be
worried about?

262
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,902
He's just one of the guys
on the floor

263
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,238
thanking me for getting
his hours shifted around.

264
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,373
Mm-hm, you sure that's all?

265
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,843
Because I think I see your nose
growing there, Pinocchio.

266
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,013
Hush, you're my man,
and you know it, Danny Coogan.

267
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,082
See?

268
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,724
So you're been playing
around with puppets, huh?

269
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,860
Is that your excuse, Coogan?

270
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,361
Hello, Mr. Gifford.

271
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,063
You're late
for your lunch date

272
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,665
because you're playing
around with puppets.

273
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,767
No, it's not that.

274
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,201
Oh, save it.

275
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,103
You'll learn
your lesson soon enough

276
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:49,575
when some quicker guy
is on the draw.

277
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:53,012
Yeah, I know.

278
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,148
I'm trying to run a plant.

279
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,818
I'm doing something
for the war effort.

280
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,121
What happens if my invoices
don't get filed

281
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:05,457
and one of my secretaries
keels over from starvation?

282
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,695
It's okay, Mr. Gifford,
really. I don't mind.

283
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,030
Yeah, well, I do.

284
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,032
I don't like you, Coogan.

285
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,935
A young guy like you
should be fighting
in the war,

286
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,137
not playing
with stupid puppets.

287
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,939
I would be fighting,
Mr. Gifford.

288
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,909
I want to be fighting,

289
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,013
Oh, stop bawling.

290
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,682
I lied about my age
so I could go over to France

291
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,183
and fight for my country,

292
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,620
so stop whining
about your goddamn leg.

293
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:36,923
Why, you...

294
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,059
Yeah. You better think twice,
Coogan.

295
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,729
Lucky you got your girl here

296
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:49,869
to save your ass.

297
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,404
You got 10 more minutes,
Beth.

298
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,942
Yes, Mr. Gifford.

299
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,877
Don't mind him, Danny.

300
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,278
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

301
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,947
Yes, he does.

302
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,849
What do you mean?

303
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,885
He's right.

304
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:07,153
But your leg.

305
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,188
I should've lied,
like he did.

306
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,023
I should find
some way around it

307
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,826
instead of sitting around here
feeling sorry for myself.

308
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:28,274
Danny, don't.

309
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,210
That jerk Gifford
is right about Beth.

310
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,481
She's not going to wait around
for a guy like me.

311
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,717
What does a great girl
like that want with
a cripple anyway?

312
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,823
She had flowers on her desk
from some guy at the plant,

313
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,258
probably some guy
with big muscles,

314
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,361
who's really handsome,
some guy who's going
to do his time at the plant

315
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,131
and go over and serve,

316
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,066
some guy way better than me.

317
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,736
Look at me.

318
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,605
There's a war going on
out there,

319
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,740
and I'm stuck here talking
with a bunch of stupid puppets

320
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,910
all because of this game leg.

321
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,796
I should be able
to fix you right up.

322
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:31,971
What is that?

323
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,998
Oh, my God.

324
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,200
You are alive.

325
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,880
[both laughing]

326
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,349
How do you...
How do you like it?

327
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,353
What island?

328
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,554
Uh...

329
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,427
You've got to be quiet, okay?
We're going to surprise her.

330
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,697
Look, I'm even
on time for lunch.
Can you believe it?

331
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:42,068
You've got to be still now,
all right?

332
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,143
What is it?

333
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,445
What's wrong?

334
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:40,026
[laughs]

335
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:44,096
Hey, honey.
Wow, you're right on time
for lunch.

336
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,897
Let me call Ripley's.

337
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,766
Who was that guy?
Who?

338
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,302
The guy who was just in here.
Who was that?

339
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,671
That's Ben.
I told you before.

340
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,274
He's one of the guys
that works on the floor.

341
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,744
He just needs somebody
to talk to sometimes.
That's all.

342
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,346
Yeah, well...
There's nothing
to be jealous about.

343
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,514
Well, I bet you
his name isn't Ben.

344
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,617
What are you talking about?
Your friend?

345
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,519
He's one of the guys
who killed Mr. Toulon

346
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,920
up an the inn
a couple weeks ago.

347
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,256
Remember
I told you about it?

348
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,558
Yes, but Ben?

349
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,992
His name isn't Ben.

350
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,194
He's a Nazi.

351
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,130
[laughs]
Don't be ridiculous.

352
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,831
I saw his face, Beth.

353
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,101
He bumped into me
when I was going
to help Mr. Toulon.

354
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,635
I mean, he looks
a little bit different,

355
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,971
but that's definitely him.
I'm sure of it.

356
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,407
Ben, a Nazi?

357
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,076
You're being paranoid,
honey.

358
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,510
I'm not being paranoid.

359
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:34,346
All of his papers
are in order.

360
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,148
I checked them myself.

361
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,085
Besides, he's not from Germany,
silly.

362
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,019
He's from Burbank,
for heaven's sake.

363
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,057
What's in the bag?

364
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,426
Nothing. I mean,
what does it matter?

365
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,161
You don't believe me anyway.

366
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,263
Danny, don't be like that.

367
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,032
Come on, just show me.

368
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,569
He's a Nazi,
and I'll prove it to you.

369
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,338
Danny.

370
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,454
[Man]
Big Ben.

371
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,289
Brooklyn Dodgers going
all the way this year.

372
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,525
Oh, I've got to go
with St. Louis.

373
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,059
[groans]
You've got to be kidding me.

374
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,294
Bunch of rummies,
those guys.

375
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,462
We'll see about that.

376
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,231
Want to make it interesting?

377
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,266
Let's talk tomorrow.

378
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,602
Yeah, yeah.
Have a safe night.

379
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,709
Heil Hitler.

380
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,380
I knew it.
Hitler-loving Nazi scum.

381
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,584
For nearly a week,

382
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,453
you have been entrenched

383
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,356
within the enemy's
own back yard.

384
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,324
No difficulties?

385
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,559
None.

386
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,627
I've even made a few friends.

387
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:41,267
All I have to do is badmouth
us Krauts

388
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,468
or especially you Japs,

389
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,537
and I fit right in.

390
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,606
Oh, and talk about baseball,

391
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,808
and this is the toughest part.

392
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,813
Strikes, runs, errors...

393
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,615
Damn ridiculous sport.

394
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,652
It all sounds promising,
very promising.

395
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,056
So were you able
to procure the item?

396
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,427
I've been flirting
with the cute girl
that sits in the office.

397
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:12,163
And she suspects nothing?

398
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,732
She's quite taken by me.

399
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,236
What can I say?
It must be my good looks.

400
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:23,809
You Germans
are far too satisfied
with yourselves.

401
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,346
Confidence.

402
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,014
After charming the girl,

403
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,450
it was an easy thing
to snoop through her office

404
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,552
when she was out
with her boss.

405
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,010
Good, very good.

406
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:03,782
This appears
to be the loading bay.

407
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,753
Let's see
what you guys can do.

408
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,425
And this...

409
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,561
That is a storage room
that's always locked.

410
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,563
No one is allowed in there.

411
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,900
It must be where
they are keeping their
secret ingredient.

412
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,669
Ingredient?

413
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,072
Yeah.
Tomasi had a theory

414
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:32,344
the Americans are planning
to use a new material.

415
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,646
We do not know
what it is called,

416
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,548
but it doesn't matter.

417
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:43,422
This new material

418
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,857
and the secret storage room

419
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:50,596
appears to be right
next to the break room.

420
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,532
Perfect. Perfect.

421
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,869
[rattles]

422
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,063
[speaks German]

423
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,605
It is a simple device,

424
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,608
but powerful.

425
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:40,746
Set the timer and walk away.

426
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,767
A perfect fit.

427
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,403
In two days,
when you go to work,

428
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,506
leave it in the break room,

429
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,576
set the timer, and exit.

430
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:14,012
The explosion will ignite
the storage room,

431
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,115
detonating this secret
material with it.

432
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,151
Setting off
a chain reaction.

433
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,822
The entire facility,
the workers,

434
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,592
and all the new bombs inside

435
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,427
will be engulfed in moments,

436
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:33,499
crippling their war efforts.

437
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,735
I admire your planning,
lovely Ozu.

438
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:42,073
And you, Max,
on your subterfuge.

439
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,877
The puppets.

440
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,847
[screams]

441
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,117
Get them.

442
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,097
Get that boy!

443
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:14,773
The puppets.
Puppets?

444
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,174
The old man's puppets.

445
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:19,745
Toulon's, the one
we were sent here to find.

446
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,580
He killed himself...

447
00:41:21,647 --> 00:42:07,092
A true coward...

448
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,695
Looks like you got in
a pretty good lick.

449
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,701
Damn Nazis.

450
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:24,309
Honey? What's
all the noise in here?

451
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,512
Uh, nothing, Mom.
I'm sorry if I woke you.

452
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,814
I heard you come home.
It's late.

453
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,685
Is everything okay?

454
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,320
All right.

455
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,555
Well, be sure you're home
for dinner tomorrow night.

456
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:39,557
We're having
a little celebration
for your brother.

457
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,959
He ships out soon, you know.

458
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,961
Yeah, I know. I'll be here.

459
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,731
All right, good night.
Night.

460
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,182
[sighs]

461
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,084
Came out okay, too.

462
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,865
These are blueprints

463
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,734
to the plant
where Beth works.

464
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,535
That Nazi's
been imitating a Yank

465
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,505
so he can get access
to the plant.

466
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,240
He's planning on blowing it up.

467
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,478
We've got to find a way
to stop them.

468
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,613
I knew I could
count on you guys.

469
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,893
What are you doing up?

470
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,095
I couldn't sleep.

471
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,898
Oh, wow.

472
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,033
That sandwich looks great.

473
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,868
Did you leave some for me?

474
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,036
Yeah, there's plenty.

475
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,137
Oh, good.

476
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,538
Hey, Don,

477
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:04,442
can I talk to you really quick?

478
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,313
Hey, little brother, let me
get some of that grub in me,

479
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,982
and them I am all ears
for you, okay?

480
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,151
Oh. [Laughs]
Excuse me, madam.

481
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:17,355
It's nice to meet you.
[laughing]

482
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,124
You've been drinking.

483
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,926
Just a few.

484
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,830
Went down to the Duke
double bill downtown.

485
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,397
Again?
We just saw that last week.

486
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,868
And then... then we went
to McGinty's.

487
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:32,670
Oh, that's where I saw
this girl.

488
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:35,373
Whoo, her name was Gale, and...

489
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,908
Or Marsha.

490
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,077
Uh...
[laughs]

491
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,679
Anyways, little brother,

492
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,248
the gams on this girl...

493
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,184
I mean, they were
up to her neck.

494
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:48,419
Whoo-hee-hee.
Shh.

495
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:52,924
Oh... Oh, shh-shh.
Don't wake Mom.

496
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,627
Hey... Hey, how's your girl?

497
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,329
How's that going?

498
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,831
I don't know.

499
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,900
What? What's wrong?

500
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,502
I just don't think
it's going to work out.

501
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,705
All those guys
down at the plant, they
all got their eye on her.

502
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,375
So what?

503
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,243
You've just got to make sure

504
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,713
that you're the only one
she's thinking about.

505
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,916
One of those other guys
gets in the way,

506
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,818
you just pow. [Chuckles]

507
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,719
Show them who's boss,
right?

508
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:28,860
Yeah, I guess so.

509
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,763
Don't you forget that.
Okay?

510
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,099
Sure, Don.

511
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:35,533
Mm.

512
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,470
Now, what is it you wanted
to tell me about those dolls?

513
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,872
They're puppets.

514
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,841
Oh, sorry.

515
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,976
Those puppets.

516
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,145
What about them?

517
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,047
Oh, forget it.
I'll tell you later.

518
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,816
You sure?
Yeah.

519
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,818
All right.

520
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,221
Mm.

521
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,502
No, he's right.

522
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,438
Even though I can't
go overseas and fight,

523
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,074
I can still do my bit
right here at home.

524
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,811
Somebody's got to stop those
guys from blowing up the plant,
right?

525
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,781
You guys with me?

526
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,361
[knock on door]

527
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,996
Come in.

528
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,967
Hey, sweetie.

529
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:49,074
Wow, you look great.

530
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,508
And for my own
special soldier.

531
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,844
Thanks, honey.

532
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,549
[Beth]
Are you okay?

533
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,351
Oh, yeah.
Look, forget about all that.

534
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,720
I'm sorry
I was being such a jerk.

535
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:08,693
Oh, come here, though.
I need to show you something.

536
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,095
Yeah.
There are bigger problems.

537
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,530
What do you mean?

538
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,135
It looks like a blueprint.

539
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,637
Uh-huh, to the plant.

540
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,740
But... [sighs]...
How did you get this?

541
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:25,010
From your new friend Ben.

542
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,778
What?
Yeah, I followed him
last night,

543
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,048
after he got off work,
and he went to this
opera house in Chinatown,

544
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:34,886
not that far from here

545
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,455
and three Japs.
One of them
was this dragon lady,

546
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,457
and they're all
in this together, Beth.

547
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,959
In what together?

548
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,593
They're planning
on blowing up the plant.

549
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,062
They had a bomb.

550
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:52,870
You're really serious,
aren't you?

551
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:54,805
And they're planning
on putting it here,

552
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,541
near the field depot.
When?

553
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,976
Two days from now.

554
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,911
Look, I overheard everything.

555
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,149
If this is true,
you've got to tell somebody.

556
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,117
Yeah, and who's
going to believe me?

557
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,986
I have enough trouble
getting you to believe me,

558
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,287
let alone anyone else.

559
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,190
I'm the boy who cried Nazi.

560
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:13,858
So what are you going to do?

561
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,426
[sighs]

562
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:18,863
I'm going down there,
to that opera house.

563
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,365
Danny.
Don't worry.

564
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,100
I'm just going to take
some pictures.

565
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,035
I'll make somebody believe me,

566
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,503
and I'll be all right.

567
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,904
I've got help.

568
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,074
Who?

569
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,044
They won't hurt you.

570
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,113
Oh, my God.
How are they moving?

571
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,416
It's Toulon's secret.
I found it.

572
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,588
It's all right.

573
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:48,393
Yeah, go ahead.

574
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,071
I'm so sorry, Danny.

575
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:06,911
Sorry for what?

576
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:09,780
Look, I need you to stay here
and help Mom with the party.

577
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,949
If she wonders where I am,
just make up some excuse.

578
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,551
I'm worried you're be hurt,
Danny.

579
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,953
With these guys helping me,
I'll be all right,

580
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:18,956
and don't worry.
Like I said, I'm just going
to take some pictures.

581
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:35,240
* [slow jazz]

582
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,610
[scratches]

583
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,212
Infernal racket.

584
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,014
[speaks German]

585
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:20,118
I take it you are upset.

586
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,420
Stay calm, Buddha.

587
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,226
Klaus!

588
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,796
What's happening here?

589
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,269
Nothing more.

590
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:41,072
Isn't that right,
my dear Klaus?

591
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,408
We don't have time
for this nonsense.

592
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,310
Our mission
may be in jeopardy.

593
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,313
Because of the boy?

594
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,181
He can't know anything.

595
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:54,785
If he does,
he must be taken care of.

596
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,321
How?

597
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,324
I've been on the phone
with the Bodega Bay Inn.

598
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,293
It seems our boy
was restoring furniture
for them

599
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,529
during his stay.

600
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:08,133
His address...

601
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,368
here in Los Angeles,

602
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,970
not far from where we are.

603
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,706
Once again, fate at work.

604
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,981
Get the boy and his puppets.

605
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,484
Let nothing stand in our way.

606
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,653
Heil Hitler.
F r der F hrer.

607
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:39,864
Perhaps we should celebrate
our upcoming victory, Ozu.

608
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,634
What did you
have in your mind,
my dear Max?

609
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:47,772
Maybe something to unite
our partnership.

610
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,075
Do not mistake me

611
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:53,144
as a Western harlot

612
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,680
or one of your German whores

613
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,882
who find your arrogance
arousing.

614
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,686
Have I made my point clear,
my dear Maximilian?

615
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:28,746
How's it coming in there,
dear?

616
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:32,850
Let me take those.

617
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,185
Well, if you think so.

618
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,753
I know so. Go on.

619
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,555
Okay. Um...

620
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,590
[gasps]
You frightened me.

621
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,726
What are you doing, sneaking
around like Béla Lugosi?

622
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,561
That's what I do, Ma.

623
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,163
Don, you weren't supposed
to be home until 6.

624
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:47,865
You ruined the surprise.

625
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,668
Oh. Oh, look at that.

626
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,670
It's nice. Thanks.

627
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,572
But what's
Danny going to think?

628
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,874
What do you mean? He knows
we're having the party.

629
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:58,643
Yeah, but he wishes
he was going over there

630
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,578
to fight with the rest of us.

631
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,847
This is just going to remind him
that he's not going.

632
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,649
You guys should have
the party for him, too.

633
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,885
We are. I've got
a few surprises for him.

634
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,654
I'm going to wear
a new dress that I bought.

635
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,156
Plus I made him
his favorite apple pie.

636
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,991
Ooh.
The pie!

637
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,494
I've already taken
the pie out, hon.
It's perfect.

638
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,830
You're a life saver.

639
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:25,736
Where is Danny anyway?

640
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,037
Wood staining stuff?

641
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,640
You know, whatever he uses
for his job.

642
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,311
Oh, yeah, hammer and nails,
all that technical jazz.

643
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:36,481
You.

644
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,751
We'll call you
when it's ready.

645
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:44,188
You guys are shipping me out
before I get shipped out.

646
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:45,556

Oh, that must be the mailman

649
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,430
with that package
from Aunt Jane.

650
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,233
Yes? Can I help you?

651
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:58,436

[whispers]
With these pictures,

655
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,922
Bring these bastards down
in no time.

656
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,944
Oh, no.

657
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,450
Mom.

658
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:22,487

Oh, God.

Don. Don!

663
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,626
Don, hang on.
I'll go get help. Hang on.

664
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:05,530
No, there's no time,
little brother.

665
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,032
He took Beth.

666
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,467
I know that.

667
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,869
You stay still.
Save your strength, okay?

668
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,605
You go get them.

669
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:17,508
You... go get them.

670
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,109

Don?

Don?

675
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,422
Don?

676
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,723
[weeping]
No, Don.

677
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:54,078
I'm going to get
those bastards, Don.

678
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,014
And you're going to help me.

679
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,086
So part of you
can keep on living, okay?

680
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,678
Just as long as you don't mind
being inside a Jap.

681
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:41,986
Please work.

682
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,255
Toulon.

684
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,062
Come on.

[mutters]

686
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,726
How do you feel?

687
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:32,803
You know, we can really
use those sneaking skills
of yours.

688
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:38,809
Here.

689
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:51,221
Wow.

690
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,297
[grunting]

691
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:12,009
Stop! Touch her again,
it'll be the last thing
you remember.

692
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:21,018
I apologize
for their conduct.

693
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,688
You're no better
than they are.

694
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,090
To you, perhaps,
it may seem that way,

695
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,624
but, again,

696
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,426
I apologize.

697
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,395
I don't care
about your apologies.

698
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,099
By now, of course,
you know my name is not Ben.

699
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,035
You're a Nazi,
just like Danny said.

700
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,837
A soldier following orders.

701
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,071
For Hitler.

702
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,107
The leader
of the new world.

703
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,910
Not if our boys have
anything to say about it.

704

[floor board creaks]

705
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,949
What's going on here?

706
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:54,852
Your men are savages.

707
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,021
They are men

708
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,957
with the needs and desires
of men.

709
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:04,061
I see,

710
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,063
Yet the desires of you men,

711
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,265
your animals, must be granted?

712
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,934
Is that it?

713
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,171
Don't be jealous.

714
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:17,975
It does not
befit a leader.

715
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:30,620
We tied the girl here
in the center of the stage

716
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,024
so that no one can
attempt to free her
without our seeing.

717
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:37,928
I understand,
but does that mean
she must be toyed with?

718
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,029
Why do you care?

719
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:41,198
She's nothing but bait.

720
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,401
Does not
a dead worm on a hook
still attract a fish?

721
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:47,537
She is not a worm.

722
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:51,241
You seem to have developed
feelings for this little tramp.

723
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:54,745
Do not let this cloud
your judgment.

724
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:11,028
I hope you don't expect me
to thank you.

725
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:14,098
No, I don't expect you
to understand, either.

726
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,533
What don't I understand?

727
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,938
You can never understand
the cause of which
I am fighting for.

728
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,007
The slaughtering
of innocent people

729
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,975
by a mad dictator?

730
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:28,112
That's not a cause.
That's evil.

731
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,915
You'll never defeat
freedom and democracy.

732
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,024
Perhaps in a different time

733
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,059
and a different life

734
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:44,795
we could've meant something
to each other.

735
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:46,163
I'd rather be dead.

736
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,999
You may just get your wish.

737
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:09,319
[floor creaks]

738
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,416
[gagging]

739
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,637
[gagging]

740
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,250
[gagging]

741
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,591
[grunts, gurgling]

742
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:40,237
Good job.

743
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:41,805
[gagging continues]

744
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,308
[chair topples,
glass clatters]

745
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,444
[radio crackling]
Can your hear me?

746
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,546
Can you?

747
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:53,017
Excellent. Yes.

748
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,319
It is going well here,
Commander.

749
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:03,393
Yes, he will be killed.

750
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,964
As will the two Germans.

751
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:11,435
And we will take
the boy's secret,

752
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:15,105
the one the Germans
are so eager to control.

753
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:19,209
Yes, it will belong
to Japan...

754
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:20,577
to the Emperor.

755
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,950
Hello?

756
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,153
Hello, Commander?

757
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,101
You'll never win the war.

758
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,070
You might kill me and Danny.

759
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:49,039
Even if you blow up the plant,
you still won't win.

760
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,310
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

761
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:57,481
I bet if she did,
she'd be ashamed of you.

762
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:00,284
Not that you care, of course.

763
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,951
You've probably been
a disappointment to her

764
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,520
your whole life, haven't you?

765
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:05,489
Ever since you were
a German boy

766
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:09,326
pulling the wings
off of German flies.

767
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,995
She probably did the best
she could, didn't she?

768
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,563
But you're hopeless.

769
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,293
[screams]

770
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:54,498
The boy, he's here.

771
01:08:56,132 --> 01:09:02,172
And here I thought
my wardrobe was extravagant.

772
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:06,343
What you call extravagance

773
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,579
I call pride.

774
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:16,586
You Nazis,

775
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,555
Let's go.

776
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:39,609
It seems your men have proven
to be quite useless.

777
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,479
If these two are an example
of Japan's finest,

778
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:45,081
your country has no hope
for winning this war.

779
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:47,584
They were killed by magic.

780
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:51,421
There is no defense
against sorcery.

781
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:55,259
They were killed by a boy
and his puppets.

782
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:08,798
[gasp] Danny.
Oh, thank God.

783
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,867
I... You...

784
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,001
and Don...

785
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,269
I know. I know.

786
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:14,638
I'm so sorry.

787
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,673
It's okay.

788
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,943
Don's still here in spirit,

789
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,812
and he wouldn't want us
crying right now.

790
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,549
We'll both cry about it later,
okay?

791
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,552
Right now we've got
to get you out of here.

792
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,687
Okay? That's my girl.

793
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,021
Come on.

794
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,865
Klaus!

795
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:48,037
Your man proved to be
no more efficient than my own.

796
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:52,642
It appears
only you and I remain.

797
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,845
We must find them
before they escape.

798
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,382
You take the rear.
I will guard the front.

799
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:01,518
For the Emperor.
F r der F hrer.

800
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:03,487
We shall see.

801
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,968
We've got to go, Tunneler.

802
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,614
You have performed admirably,
but now it's over for you.

803
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,516
What's in the bag?

804
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:36,386
Drop it, boy.

805
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:37,554
Danny.

806
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:39,889
It'll be okay.

807
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,363
American surrenders.

808
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:48,765
Very good.

809
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,807
Ninja?

810
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:03,112
Are we not come
from the same cloth, Ninja?

811
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:06,850
Aah! Aah!

812
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,485
[yells]

813
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,153
No!

814
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,080
[footsteps running]

815
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:49,859
The F hrer
will be very pleased.

816
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,466
Looking for something?

817
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,902
Where's the bomb?

818
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,638
There's no way we're going
to let you blow up the plant.

819
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,940
Where is it?

820
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,542
[click]

821
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,443
[ticking]

822
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:11,981
The timer's counting down!

823
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,983
Yeah,

824
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,619
and he'll flip the switch
and set it off

825
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,186
before the timer goes, too,

826
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:20,189
unless, maybe,
you want to be blown up.

827
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,125
Isn't that what
your kamikaze pilots do?

828
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:27,564
They blow themselves up
for the cause.

829
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,132
[speaking Japanese]

830
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,734
Dedicated and brave.

831
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,338
[Danny]
Okay.

832
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,008
To nosedive your airplane
into the belly of a battleship.

833
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:43,446
But brave?
I don't know about that.

834
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:45,615
Think about it.

835
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:47,917
We aren't the ones
holding the bomb.

836
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,754
Order it to move away
from the bomb.

837
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:56,660
No.

838
01:14:56,726 --> 01:15:00,229
Besides, I don't think
he likes you very much,

839
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:03,032
and I know he doesn't like
the German.

840
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:06,269
After all, the Germans killed
his master, Mr. Toulon.

841
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:21,918
The sorcery
is truly powerful.

842
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:24,487
And that's why you'll never
get your hands on it.

843
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,522
[Max]
Do not be so confident.

844
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,858
[clicks timer off]

845
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,061
You've done well
up to this point, boy,

846
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:36,032
much better
than I ever could've
expected from a cripple.

847
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,868
But victory is far
from assured.

848
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:40,336
You'll still never
get the secret.

849
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:44,941
Once again you speak
before victory is in hand.

850
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:48,411
Danny,
he's got the puppet.

851
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,582
I knew our alliance
would prove to be
fruitful, my dear.

852
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:55,819
Step away, dear.

853
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,589
Lay down your sword.

854
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:10,734
I should've known
that Nazis cannot be trusted.

855
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,435
You have no code of honor.

856
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,839
Well, I have the puppets
and the gun, so stay back!

857
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,042
The serum
that's in those puppets

858
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,544
will only last
a limited time.

859
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:23,012
Where's the rest of it?

860
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,013
It's hidden.

861
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,615
Then you will
take me to it.

862
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:26,750
Like hell.

863
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,752
Oh, but you will.

864
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,754
First I will do things
to your girl

865
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,889
that you have never
even dreamt of doing.

866
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:37,794
Then I will hurt her, badly,
all while you watch.

867
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:39,128
And if that
is not good enough,

868
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,497
then I will begin
torturing you,

869
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,400
and if anyone
who knows torture,
it is we Nazis.

870
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:48,337
Our doctors have devised
such unimaginable techniques

871
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:51,140
used in the death camps
of Auschwitz and Dachau.

872
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,043
Yeah, how to torture
innocent civilians.

873
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,780
Oh, we torture soldiers, too.

874
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,882
In our prisoner-of-war camps

875
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,518
we torture many
of Allied soldiers,

876
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:06,823
men who served their country
more nobly than you,

877
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:11,194
men of true value
and integrity,

878
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:16,032
strong specimens,
not worthless cripples
like you!

879
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,735
[blade whooshes]

880
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:20,636
[liquid gurgling]

881
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:04,881
She's gone.

882
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:08,051
She took the puppets with her.

883
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,286
Except for Ninja, Blade,
and Pinhead.

884
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:15,091
If it's war that Jap wants,

885
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:17,693
we'll give it to her.
