00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,950
THE LITTLE SOLDIER

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,260
Narrator: I'm too old to play
an active role.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,460
It's time to think things over.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,110
Geneva.

5
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,630
Lake Leman divides the city
in 2 parts.

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,190
3 days ago, secret agents
declared a deadly war open...

7
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,170
here on neutral territory.

8
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,270
$800.

9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,080
I thought of myself
suddenly...

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,280
Bruno Forestier...

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,060
a reporter for the French
Information Bureau.

12
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,770
More Terrorist Attacks

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,230
Geneva Professor Dies
Following Attack

14
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,600
They're at it again. Shit.

15
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,800
They're completely crazy.

16
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,740
Geneva, May 13, 1958.

17
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,310
Argon once wrote,
"Painless May...

18
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,790
"June, cut to the heart."

19
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,640
"Love one another"

20
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,920
Things OK?

21
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,260
Someone called for you.

22
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,630
- You said I was here?
- Yes.

23
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
I told you not to!

24
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,420
The sky reminded me
of a Klee painting.

25
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
"Where do you come from?

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,850
"Where are you?
Where are you going?"

27
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,600
What's going on, kid?

28
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,640
Hi.

29
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,970
Bruno, what are you up to?

30
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,270
A nice Paul Klee.

31
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,930
My date's nicer.

32
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,940
Who is she?

33
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,940
You're to take
photos of her.

34
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,780
What if I don't
want to see her?

35
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,650
She's chic. Come on.

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm due
at the Brazilian Consulate.

37
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,720
Go tomorrow.

38
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,020
I can't do it now!

39
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,420
Girls like lots of chit-chat.

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,060
Is it that Danish gal?

41
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,060
Yes. You know her?

42
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,260
Michel told me about her.

43
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,100
I bet you want to lay her.

44
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,930
She has a mouth
like Leslie Caron.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,270
No. I only screw girls
I'm in love with.

46
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,500
I bet 5 minutes with her,
you'd be in love.

47
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,740
How much will you bet?

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,180
- I don't know.
- $50.

49
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,240
If you want.

50
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,080
$50 that I don't fall for her.

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
The first time I met her...

52
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,290
she seemed to be right
out of a Giraudoux play.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,630
Veronica?

54
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,050
Kill a guy from behind
with a gun or a knife...

55
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,590
but not with a bomb.

56
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,790
Killing from a distance
isn't honorable.

57
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,420
You don't know a thing.

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,270
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,230
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,240
Lachenal, the art prof killed
yesterday.

61
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,410
His car was booby-trapped.

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,410
By whom?

63
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,450
The French.

64
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,480
What do you know about it?

65
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,010
You don't know what
you're talking about.

66
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,250
It's irritating.

67
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,990
Students are all alike.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,700
I know his daughter.

69
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,260
She's often at the ice skating
rink.

70
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,740
You're right. It's terrible.

71
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,590
Aw, shit.

72
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,230
What's up?

73
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,600
This is a bore.

74
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,600
They thought I said "war."

75
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,700
I said it was the same thing.

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,760
She stared at me.

77
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,580
Good-bye.

78
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,620
For your photos, tomorrow
at 5:00.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,450
Where are you going?

80
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,590
A mystery.

81
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
You really are mysterious.

82
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,890
Yes. I'm a secret agent.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,540
Veronica.

84
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,650
Shake your hair loose.

85
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,760
Here's your $50.

86
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,270
Where are you going?
Is it important?

87
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,940
One never knows
what's important.

88
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,270
I was still very young
and foolish.

89
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,920
Blue skies? Rain? Who knew?

90
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,670
Up to now,
my life had been simple.

91
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,840
A guy with no ideals.

92
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,050
And tomorrow?

93
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,400
I asked him for a light.

94
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,260
Again I asked him
for a light.

95
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,950
At times I felt
I was wasting my time.

96
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,790
Veronica...

97
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,130
did she have Velazquez-gray
eyes, or were they Renoir-gray?

98
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,770
Alfred Latouche or his brother
usually met me.

99
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,470
Maybe they'd been caught.
And what about me?

100
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,270
- Hello, Jacques.
- Hello, Bruno.

101
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,940
Get in.

102
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,590
Our antiterrorist group
was financed

103
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,790
by an ex-parliamentarian
who had been pro-Vichy.

104
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,930
How's it going?

105
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,930
OK. You?

106
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Do you know Jacques?

107
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,270
That's him?

108
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,770
I don't know the other guy.

109
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,770
Your man?

110
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,770
No, the one in back.

111
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,070
Who's he?

112
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,800
If anyone asks, play dumb.

113
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
Good luck!

114
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,290
Bankers, parachutists,
car salesmen, prodigal sons.

115
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,090
The secret war mixed men
and ideas at a deadly pace.

116
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,670
Do we go or not?

117
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,170
We're good.
It's 10 to 5:00.

118
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,680
If his car's there,
stop by the fountain for Paul.

119
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,220
It's a '57 Nash convertible.

120
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,790
Well, Bruno?

121
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,950
What?

122
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,290
What are you thinking?

123
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,290
I don't know.

124
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,850
You're supposed to know.

125
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,100
What were you
going to say?

126
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,100
Nothing.

127
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,040
Go on, say it.

128
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,270
I changed my mind.

129
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,330
What's that book?

130
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,210
"Thomas the Imposter."

131
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,210
Ah. Jean Cocteau.

132
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,380
Yes. Listen to the end.
It's wonderful.

133
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,890
"William flew, leaped,
and ran like a hare.

134
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,250
"Not hearing the shots,
he stopped..."

135
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,090
"turned breathlessly.

136
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,990
"Then he felt a sharp jab
in the chest.

137
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,000
"He fell.

138
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,330
"He'd become deaf
and blind."

139
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,100
"'A bullet, ' he thought.

140
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,730
"'I am lost unless
I pretend to be dead. '

141
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,770
"But for him, fact
and fiction were one."

142
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,950
"William Thomas was dead."

143
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,790
It's beautiful.

144
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,430
I'd like to die like that.

145
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,590
Don't worry.
Maybe you will. Soon.

146
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,100
What's gotten into you?

147
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,360
Why?

148
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,370
Because you're a pain
in the ass, big boy.

149
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,030
We're thinking about Saturday.

150
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,980
What were you doing in Annecy?

151
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
I was hoping to take
Veronica to Brazil.

152
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm opening a painting gallery.

153
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,880
I was planning to buy
3 Modiglianis.

154
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,080
Lucky for me
I don't have any.

155
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,280
With whose money?

156
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,980
I'll pay it back.

157
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,530
We're here.

158
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,220
"O, days of changing flowers...

159
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,760
"I recall the rose bowers."

160
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,560
Why was I obsessed
by that poem?

161
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,100
Turn the radio down.

162
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,110
You know that guy
who does that show?

163
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,000
Palivoda on Radio Geneva?

164
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,370
Yeah, that's him.

165
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,410
There he is.

166
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,270
I soon realized they suspected
me of being a double agent.

167
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,450
Let's go.

168
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,030
His show's called
"A Neutral Speaks."

169
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,570
That kills me.

170
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,970
You ever seen Palivoda,
Bruno?

171
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,370
Before today?

172
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,380
Yes.

173
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,410
No.

174
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,610
- Take a good look at him.
- Why?

175
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Because you're going
to kill him.

176
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,880
Why me again?

177
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,550
I got the order from Paris.

178
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,250
I'm just passing it on.

179
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,460
Jacques said it would be
very easy.

180
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,900
Drive along next to him
like now...

181
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,340
and fire...

182
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,600
when you're opposite him.

183
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,100
Roll up the window!

184
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,590
They're sure in Paris
he works for the rebels?

185
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,850
I'm amazed. He's Swiss.

186
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,050
I'm not. It's less dangerous...

187
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,200
to talk on the radio
than to fight.

188
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,530
The Swiss have never been
very courageous.

189
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,030
Just look how they drive.

190
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
They even signal
to pass a biker.

191
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,200
It infuriates me.

192
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,900
Want to go to the hotel?

193
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,540
No. To the office.

194
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,980
Is it true
Latouche is dead?

195
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,210
Yes. They found him
in a bathtub Tuesday...

196
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,310
at the Bristol Hotel.
They'd cut out his tongue.

197
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,480
There was blood everywhere.
Scared?

198
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,750
Shooting people
isn't a joke.

199
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,620
We can loan you the car
if you want.

200
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,060
It doesn't have
Geneva plates.

201
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,240
It's too dangerous.

202
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,300
Why me and not Paul?

203
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,340
Because you're the best.

204
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,070
I don't want
to kill Palivoda.

205
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,480
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

206
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,510
A moment ago, yes,
but now, no.

207
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,180
I don't know why.

208
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,890
If I killed him,
I'd feel like a loser.

209
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,950
That's unimportant.

210
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,790
Victory's better than defeat.

211
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,870
The Spanish Republicans'
welfare is fine.

212
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,400
It's not mean. It's
a thing to be proud of.

213
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,710
Benjamin Constant and
Mme de StaeI lived there.

214
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,980
We chose you expressly
to see if you're afraid.

215
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,920
Afraid? I'm not
afraid at all.

216
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,390
I just don't feel
like doing it.

217
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,550
I won't do it.

218
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,960
We'll make you do it.

219
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,220
You can't force me.

220
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,930
No one can force
a soldier to kill.

221
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,490
What are you thinking?
it's easy.

222
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,870
The Swiss know
you're a deserter.

223
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,960
One little slip, you get
sent back to France.

224
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,410
I mustn't lower my eyes.

225
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,880
No one'll get you out
of an army jail again.

226
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,920
Kill him, or
it'll be your turn.

227
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,080
Ask Jacques.

228
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,580
You'll kill me.

229
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,590
26 is awfully young
to die, little prince.

230
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,780
If they force me, I'll kill,
but not till then.

231
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,290
So that's what I told them.

232
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,260
Let me out. So long.

233
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,760
So I can count on you?

234
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,360
No. I'm a pain
in the ass.

235
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,500
That's not funny.

236
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,600
Jacques!

237
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,980
What's he doing?

238
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,480
I felt it was important
not to be a loser.

239
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,530
Next I phoned
the Brazilian Consulate...

240
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,570
to ask about visas for
a Frenchman and a Russian girl.

241
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,270
They were already closed.
I'd call the next day.

242
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,910
At night, the starlit skyline
is very moving...

243
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,420
both hard and mysterious...

244
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,450
in the likeness of mankind
and what goes beyond it.

245
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,080
She pretended not to see me.

246
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,290
I didn't stop.
I'd see her the next day.

247
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Later I noticed
a car tailing me.

248
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,680
I had trouble losing it.

249
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,900
"Now all is still.

250
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,940
"The enemy rests
in the shadows."

251
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,960
Summer was coming,
yet I felt it was winter.

252
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,260
Paul, what are you up to?

253
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,240
Her place wasn't bad.

254
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,080
I've just moved in.

255
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,640
It's not bad.

256
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,920
Yesterday I didn't see you,
but I thought of you.

257
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,950
Now I see you, but
think of something else.

258
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,930
Is this all you have?

259
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,760
Yes.

260
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,600
I thought
you'd need lights...

261
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,760
Oh, no, no, no.

262
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,270
This is very fast film.

263
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,600
It's Agfa Record.

264
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,200
When photographing a face...

265
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,610
Iook at me...

266
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,800
you photograph the soul
behind it.

267
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,410
She had deep shadows
under her eyes.

268
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,750
They were Velazquez-gray.

269
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,550
Where do you want me?

270
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,890
Anywhere. Doesn't matter.

271
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,590
Do as you please,
and I'll shoot.

272
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,100
I'll ask questions.
It'll make it easier.

273
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,400
You seem afraid. Why?

274
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,440
Yes. I'm afraid.

275
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,930
You don't need to be.

276
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,740
It's like being questioned
by the police.

277
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,480
She was less pretty
than the day before.

278
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,070
Yes, yes, a little.

279
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,710
Photography is truth...

280
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,780
and cinema is truth
24 times a second.

281
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,420
Your name's Veronica what?

282
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,120
She didn't answer right away.

283
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,470
Veronica Dreyer.

284
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,300
You're a Finn.
No, Danish.

285
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,470
No. I'm Russian...

286
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,740
but born in Copenhagen.

287
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,210
Are you with your parents
in Geneva?

288
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,080
No. I'm alone.

289
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,590
A foreigner speaking French
is lovely.

290
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,690
Where are your parents?

291
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,760
They were shot
during the war.

292
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,590
Huh. Shot by whom?

293
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,400
That's no concern of yours.

294
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,940
By the Germans?

295
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,440
By the Russians, then?

296
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,580
That doesn't concern you.

297
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,620
Why won't you tell me?

298
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,610
That's just the way it is.

299
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,050
Hold your hair up.

300
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,680
Veronica's charm was herself...

301
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,350
the fall of her shoulders...

302
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,860
her anxious look...

303
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,520
her secret smile.

304
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,240
It's strange. My father
was also shot...

305
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,070
on Liberation Day.

306
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,410
Drieu La Rochelle
was his pal.

307
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,710
Don't be afraid.
Don't remain motionless.

308
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,550
What would you like me
to do?

309
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,380
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

310
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,860
Light a cigarette...

311
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,860
take a shower.

312
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,890
I don't think so.

313
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,050
No? Why?

314
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,150
She turned suddenly.

315
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,100
You never take showers?

316
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,760
I said whatever came
into my head.

317
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,570
I'd like to take shots
of you showering.

318
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,580
You really don't want to?

319
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
No.

320
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,200
Why?

321
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,610
Because it's idiotic.

322
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,780
Afraid I'll see your body?

323
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,430
What do you mean,
idiotic?

324
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,060
What are you thinking
right now?

325
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,860
Move a bit.

326
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,740
Do you ever think
of death?

327
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,210
She looked so anguished.

328
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,440
And suddenly I had
the extraordinary sensation...

329
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,740
that I was photographing Death.

330
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,250
Then all became normal again.

331
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,750
Have you dated lots of boys
since coming to Geneva?

332
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,060
Yes.

333
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,220
Why?

334
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,730
Just asking.

335
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,230
I bet you've posed
in a bathing suit.

336
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,570
No. Never.

337
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,610
Now what are you thinking?

338
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,580
Are you thinking about me?

339
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,580
Yes.

340
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,780
What are you thinking
about me?

341
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,960
How come you won't answer?
You're afraid.

342
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,550
Pull your hair back.

343
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,730
Hold that record jacket
up over your face.

344
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,230
Do you believe in freedom?

345
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,240
No.

346
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,380
Would you be afraid
to kill someone?

347
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,420
Oh, you annoy me.

348
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,050
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

349
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,390
Yes. I have a brother.

350
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,390
What's he do?

351
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,050
He's in Moscow.

352
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,100
He's a student
at the Stanislavsky Theater.

353
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,900
The Russians
are always studying.

354
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,900
What?

355
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,100
Russians are always studying.

356
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,900
Odd that you wanted
to be an actress.

357
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,940
She lighted a cigarette
and asked why.

358
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,010
Why?

359
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,520
Actors just shuffle along.

360
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,880
I have contempt for them.

361
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,710
You tell them to laugh...
they laugh.

362
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,190
Tell them to cry, they cry.

363
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,020
Tell them to crawl,
they do it.

364
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,690
I find that grotesque.

365
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,160
I don't see why.

366
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,360
I don't know.

367
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,030
They're not free people.

368
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,840
- Look.
- What?

369
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,840
"An actor."

370
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,740
Yes. It's by Klee.

371
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,220
Do you like Paul Klee?

372
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,250
Yes.

373
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,720
It's not important
how others see you...

374
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,890
but how you see
your own face.

375
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,060
Did Paul Klee say that?

376
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,100
No, I did.

377
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
Do you have a record?

378
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,240
Yes. What would you like?

379
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,430
Some Bach?

380
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,580
No. It's too late.

381
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,080
Bach's for 8:00 in the morning.

382
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,410
A Brandenburg at 8:00
is wonderful.

383
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,750
Mozart?

384
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,410
Beethoven?

385
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,250
Too early.

386
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,090
Mozart's for 8:00
in the evening.

387
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,750
Beethoven's music
is very profound.

388
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,920
Beethoven's for midnight.

389
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
No, what we need
is some Haydn...

390
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,960
some good old Joseph Haydn.

391
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,610
What are you thinking?

392
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,130
Same thing as you.

393
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,270
Do you know
what a test is?

394
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,960
No.

395
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,940
It's a drawing to discover
a person's character.

396
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,470
I'll do one for you.

397
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,780
I often used this on women.

398
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,280
They love to play games
like little girls.

399
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,480
So you suggest playing
children's games.

400
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,950
Do anything you want,
anything at all.

401
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,990
Just finish the drawing.

402
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,800
Did Hugh tell you about
our bet the other afternoon?

403
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,740
When you gave him $50?

404
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,740
Yes.

405
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,740
No.

406
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,900
You don't know why
I gave him $50?

407
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,950
No.

408
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,580
You do it, too. I'd like
to know your thoughts...

409
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,590
OK.

410
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,920
also.

411
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,950
You'll see.

412
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,910
"I love you."

413
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Jacques and Paul were parked
in front of the Century.

414
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,280
I pretended not to see them.

415
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,790
Veronica and I
talked about art.

416
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,690
She insisted Gauguin was
a greater painter than Van Gogh.

417
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,090
She was obviously wrong.

418
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,570
Who's the girl?

419
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,770
A cover girl.

420
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,240
Are you staying with me
or not?

421
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,080
I don't know.

422
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,280
I don't know, Bruno.

423
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,420
When we left Club 58...

424
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,950
you remember?

425
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,090
You took my arm.

426
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,750
I shouldn't have?

427
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,760
No.

428
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,130
Why not?

429
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,290
Because it made me
want to sleep with you.

430
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,470
Now you seem to be saying
that's impossible.

431
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,610
You shouldn't give your arm
to men you don't like.

432
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,970
Good night.

433
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,720
You think it'll work?

434
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,420
Sure. Bruno's a coward.

435
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,260
Then Paul took my car.

436
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:50,290
He and Jacques put
the Swiss police on my neck.

437
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,600
Go on! Go on!

438
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,640
Go on!

439
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,710
My Pontiac!

440
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,220
You schmuck! My Pontiac!

441
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,090
Stop! Stop! Police!

442
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,570
It's a German song.

443
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,410
Shall I translate?

444
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,070
"O, radiant dawn,

445
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,310
"radiant dawn!"

446
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,720
"Too soon you announce
my death."

447
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,250
"Soon the trumpets
will resound..."

448
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,130
"and then..."

449
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,070
"I shall have to leave
this beautiful life."

450
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,380
7:00 in the morning.

451
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,150
A handful of snapshots taken
from around the world...

452
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,920
pass by me
like bad dreams...

453
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,960
Panama...

454
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,760
Rome...

455
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
Alexandria...

456
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,270
Budapest...

457
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,530
Paris.

458
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,900
The bad dream continues.

459
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,740
"We entered the war
as if entering school."

460
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,610
So began Bernanos' novel
"Humiliated Children."

461
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,780
Fear Destroyed This Couple

462
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,420
I lit a cigarette.

463
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,920
This morning I feel
like a little boy. Why?

464
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,220
Asking questions is more
important than finding answers.

465
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,630
Veronica.

466
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,570
Give me a drag.

467
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,910
I'm hungry.

468
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,540
I had a nightmare.

469
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,880
I was in a theater.

470
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,580
I met the devil
during intermission.

471
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,060
And he was very well-dressed.

472
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,060
It was truly him...

473
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,600
with hairy legs
and horns.

474
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,900
And he had a thigh wound...

475
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,230
a big red scrape.

476
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,430
It was awful.

477
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,770
Yes? Who is it?

478
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,410
Where are you going?

479
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,410
Go back to sleep.

480
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,950
God, she was beautiful.

481
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,280
I wondered if she was only
pretending to sleep.

482
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,850
Police.

483
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,410
Are you Bruno Forestier?

484
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,510
Yes. What's wrong?

485
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,360
Put on a coat
and come with me.

486
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,690
No. I've done nothing.

487
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,030
Don't play games with us.
You're wanted in France.

488
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,690
Yes, I deserted.
But my papers are in order.

489
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,860
Get your coat.
We'll see.

490
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,400
All right, I'm coming.

491
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,550
He seemed quite serious,
the inspector.

492
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,060
"Hit-and-run,"
the papers said.

493
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,390
In time, the perpetrator...

494
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,980
would be turned over
to French authorities.

495
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,760
As I didn't know anything
yet, I denied everything.

496
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,100
There. You see?

497
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,770
Sir...

498
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,100
please?

499
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,940
- You shouldn't have fled.
- I wasn't there.

500
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,210
Oh, so it's a Frenchman?

501
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,550
They try to get away
with anything!

502
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,850
Were you there or not?

503
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,050
Never look down
before a cop.

504
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,690
You don't know?

505
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,850
What an ass I was.

506
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,520
But... the gentleman
has witnesses.

507
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,760
In that car!

508
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,020
I understood too late...

509
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,900
the crap had begun
for my not killing Palivoda.

510
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,560
So... are we going
to the station?

511
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,900
I had lost
my first major battle.

512
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,580
So, are you going
to file charges?

513
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,420
A tremendous feeling of
Ioneliness settled through me.

514
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,260
Maybe freedom began
with remorse.

515
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,970
- Where'd you go?
- To get cigarettes.

516
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,440
You didn't take a bath?

517
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,140
I didn't feel like it.

518
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,770
A woman's shoulders are
very pretty and noble.

519
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,940
You're odd this morning.

520
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,280
Yes. I'm becoming a coward.

521
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,320
What?

522
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm becoming a coward.

523
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,000
It's strange. When I look
myself in the face...

524
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,770
I get the feeling I don't match
what I think is inside.

525
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,280
In your opinion...

526
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,440
what's more important,
the inside or the outside?

527
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,920
It was a beautiful object...

528
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,620
black, mysterious,
incorruptible.

529
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,280
It's what cameraman
Raoul Coutard called...

530
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,780
the law of the big hassle.

531
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,110
Each time I was ready
to fire...

532
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,310
an unexpected event
prevented me.

533
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,900
And each time
the coast was clear,

534
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,700
I hesitated several seconds...

535
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,610
and again it was too late.

536
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,610
It's especially difficult,
if it's not your profession,

537
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,620
to try to kill a man
several times.

538
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,450
It's like fouling up
a suicide.

539
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,740
After a while,
I became fed up.

540
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,060
I don't think it was
the act of killing someone...

541
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,230
that upset me.

542
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,830
That's happened before.

543
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,750
No, it wasn't that.

544
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,180
And I've always thought...

545
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,240
conscientious objectors
were fakes.

546
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,950
Simply, each act has
a right time and a wrong time.

547
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,880
Paul's always as frisky
as a cub scout.

548
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,210
He and Jacques
are full of ideas...

549
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,580
of secret plans.

550
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,740
Nothing stops them,
not even a wild idea...

551
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,940
like making me kill Palivoda
in front of 36 people.

552
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,700
Accused of being a traitor...

553
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,570
for me to strike down an enemy
was my only way out.

554
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,590
When I drew my revolver,
I felt Paul aim his at me.

555
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,610
Bruno!

556
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,620
Hey, Bruno!

557
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,120
How's your Danish
lady friend?

558
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,780
Shit. They're leaving.

559
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:00,950
What are you doing?

560
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,520
You do work for them.

561
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,500
Me? Not at all.

562
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,230
OK, are you dreaming?

563
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,730
I'm fed up.
Go to hell.

564
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:16,200
Now with both the French
and the Arabs after me...

565
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,940
I was done for sure.

566
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:18,980
Yes.

567
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,740
No. I'm going
to take a bath.

568
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:29,750
I'll see you later
at Club 58, if you want.

569
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:32,660
Why?

570
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,920
I can't stay here.

571
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,930
Tomorrow I'm going
to Zurich.

572
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,770
I'm catching a plane
to Brazil.

573
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,770
Veronica...

574
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,620
why don't you say something?

575
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,050
I don't know
what to say.

576
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,080
Tell me lies...

577
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,590
and that you're not sad
that I'm leaving.

578
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,590
I'm not sad
that you're leaving.

579
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm not in love with you.

580
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,270
I won't join you in Brazil.

581
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,940
I won't kiss you
tenderly.

582
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,360
I packed and went to Zurich.

583
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:17,870
They were no longer Geneva's
lights, but more like Rio's.

584
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,700
And I wondered if I was
happy to feel free...

585
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,740
or free to feel happy.

586
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,270
Hello, Jacques?

587
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,770
It's Paul.

588
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,310
Be careful, big boy.

589
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,120
Yeah.

590
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,130
Today the tragedy
is politics.

591
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,220
No, not for me. Napoleon.

592
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,230
Listen, Bruno...

593
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,960
Let... let me talk!

594
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,090
I'm calling to say
your car's at the Century.

595
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,120
My head hit the ground so hard,
I lost consciousness.

596
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,930
I forgot to count the stairs
to know where we were.

597
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,950
Who did you call
in the garage?

598
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,220
Are you going
to torture me?

599
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,730
Are you scared?

600
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,750
Of course I'm scared.

601
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,760
His passport.

602
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,200
Who issued this passport?

603
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,630
The French Consulate here?

604
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,000
There's an Arab joke
about a guy...

605
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,040
who calls and says, "Allo?"

606
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,080
The other guy says, "It's Ali."

607
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,080
- Do we strip him?
- Yes.

608
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,210
If I'd yelled, they'd
have hit me again.

609
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,810
Better to just take it.

610
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,250
Who is he?

611
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,220
I don't know.

612
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,720
And him?

613
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,690
Never seen him.

614
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,420
Jacques Aurelian Mercier.

615
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,900
Ex-volunteer in Indochina.

616
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:18,240
Disappeared after a trial
for dealing in piasters.

617
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,240
Reappeared in '57
in Rotterdam...

618
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,110
when the freighter Aramis
was blown up...

619
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,880
in '59 in Frankfort...

620
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,250
when Professor Dietrich
was assassinated.

621
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,150
And now he's in Geneva.

622
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,420
He's the one
you were phoning.

623
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,760
What number did you dial?

624
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,130
What was the number?!

625
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,430
I didn't care whether
I told them or not.

626
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,310
I simply didn't feel like it
and said so.

627
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,950
They asked me
to work for them...

628
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,510
but refused me an advance,
so I said to go to hell.

629
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,720
Him, too... Alfred Latouche...

630
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,420
he refused to talk.

631
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,090
And so did his brother Etienne.

632
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,090
You want the same?

633
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,570
Poor Etienne. He'd lowered his
head to protect his throat...

634
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,940
resulting in his catching
the razor full on the chin.

635
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,580
I hope you're brave.

636
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,410
This'll be tough.

637
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,420
I don't know if I am...
but we'll see.

638
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,620
Take him to the bathroom.

639
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,570
Get up!

640
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,390
One is soon stricken
from the world of the living.

641
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,220
And being a realist...

642
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:17,020
it's the sole privilege
of the dead.

643
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,720
What privilege?

644
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,090
To no longer die.

645
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,980
Torture is so monotonous
and sad...

646
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,290
it's difficult to talk about it,
so I'll barely mention it.

647
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,260
What number did you call?

648
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,770
Are you afraid?

649
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,600
Why are you doing that?

650
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,570
Sometimes you have to...

651
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,450
make your way with a dagger.

652
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,620
A spark can set
the entire plain ablaze

653
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,840
In Budapest, I'd already
seen torture.

654
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,880
I wondered if I'd
be able to bear it.

655
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,420
Now my moment had come.

656
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,730
The faucets.

657
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,890
I know that others
endured worse...

658
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:41,400
but I never encountered
any martyrs or screams...

659
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,630
so I can't discuss it.

660
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,310
I only know I forced myself
not to yell...

661
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,110
and soon stopped struggling.

662
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,350
Think of anything, quick,
anything to avoid the pain.

663
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,690
The sea, the beach, the sun.

664
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,890
Think so fast you can't
think of anything.

665
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,370
Write to Veronica! Quick!
Don't think about the pain.

666
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,730
Quick! Write a letter.
Faster yet.

667
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,400
Beat the speed of pain.
A letter to Veronica...

668
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,870
better than the one
Desnos sent his wife.

669
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,200
Veronica...

670
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,230
What happened?

671
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,270
You passed out.

672
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,930
Did I cry?

673
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,590
Why do you ask?

674
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,230
What's going on?

675
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,640
He asked if he cried.

676
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,440
I wonder why
that interests him.

677
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,390
Because it's important.

678
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,520
Between torture sessions, we had
great political discussion.

679
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,690
They said I was an idiot
with no ideals.

680
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,320
And like all organizations
with specific goals,

681
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,160
they tried to indoctrinate me.

682
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,030
"The French also tortured.

683
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,200
"Prisoners awaited in obscurity
either prison...

684
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,740
"or the result of
their attempts to escape...

685
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,940
"that is to say, a hail
of bullets in the back."

686
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,270
Djamila's fiance...

687
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,010
died that way.

688
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,820
There's no doubt that strength
is superior to intelligence.

689
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,760
You have to be strong,
it's true, to resist strength.

690
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,570
I again thought of other
things... vacation, Brittany...

691
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,010
bicycle rides,
girls with flowers.

692
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,810
Why didn't I give up the phone
number? I can't recall.

693
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,950
Out of dignity? I don't
even know what that means.

694
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,550
The phone number.

695
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,840
When I was worn down,
I screamed for help...

696
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,820
but I didn't realize
I was so weak...

697
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,680
I couldn't be heard
two meters away.

698
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,480
When I thought I was screaming,
I was barely murmuring.

699
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,610
I wondered what
the shirts were for.

700
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,340
Palivoda?

701
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,930
It's Cavalier FK.

702
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,830
Air doesn't penetrate cloth
soaked with water.

703
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,270
It's impossible to breathe.

704
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,820
"A revolution's leap forward
is like a ship...

705
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,420
"already visible
on the distant horizon.

706
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,120
"It's like the sun's disk...

707
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,130
"whose rays..."

708
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,970
"already pierce
the darkness.

709
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,470
"It's like a child...

710
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,970
"who's soon to be born."

711
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,780
Did he tell you
the phone number?

712
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,010
No. No. Nothing yet.

713
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,780
But with this,
we'll learn something.

714
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,110
No, no.

715
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,490
We don't want to leave
any marks.

716
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,390
Why did I want
to commit suicide?

717
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,430
I should've given them
the information.

718
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:20,600
That's how the French
got themselves so disliked.

719
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,910
I put the blade
between my teeth...

720
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,450
because I couldn't manage
with my hands.

721
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,530
For better or for worse for me,
they came in too soon.

722
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,800
Then...

723
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,970
then came the electricity.

724
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,300
A guy I knew
brought the material.

725
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,780
Now I remember.
He's the one...

726
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,410
who gave Veronica a puppy
the first time we met.

727
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,310
OK, it'll work this time.

728
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:10,920
Electricity's very simple.

729
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,720
They attach electrodes
anywhere on your body...

730
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,700
and turn on the current.

731
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,100
You don't die,
but you're maimed.

732
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,810
Remember what Lenin said...

733
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,440
that in a revolution,
there are no easy tasks...

734
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,110
nor easy methods.

735
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:48,250
Everything's valid in all
aspects of the struggle.

736
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,500
The revolution's victory
is certain.

737
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,630
It will triumph.

738
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,380
Then they told me to get
dressed. I was exhausted.

739
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,710
I thought about jumping
out the window.

740
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,080
If we were on the ground floor,
good. If not...

741
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,930
What are you
thinking about?

742
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,930
I'm thinking
about Pierre Brossolette...

743
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,400
how he died.

744
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:34,430
It was in '47
at Gestapo headquarters.

745
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,270
He'd been tortured
for 2 months.

746
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,610
They'd put out his eyes.

747
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,460
One day they took him to a room
to question him again.

748
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,960
He'd suffered so much
he knew he'd crack.

749
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,060
He sensed there was
a window in the room.

750
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:12,240
So as they questioned him,
he moved near it...

751
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,240
little by little...

752
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:18,950
groping.

753
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,260
And when he touched the glass...

754
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,560
he threw himself
through it.

755
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,660
Luckily, it was
the first floor.

756
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,970
Veronica had told me
she worked for the Arabs...

757
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,770
but that she would flee
to Brazil with me.

758
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:50,110
Excuse me. Have you seen
my pal Forestier?

759
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,120
Miss?

760
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,240
No.

761
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,620
OK. Thanks.

762
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,590
He's surely there.

763
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,390
Then why wouldn't
she tell us?

764
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,560
I don't trust her.

765
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:27,220
Why would you rather
die than talk?

766
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,520
They'll kill me anyway.
I don't know.

767
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,750
Luckily, it was
only the first floor.

768
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,820
You look nicer
without makeup.

769
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,730
I watched her sit down.

770
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,770
I liked the way
she lit a cigarette.

771
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,110
That's not true.

772
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,810
Yes, it is.

773
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,050
Why is it empty?

774
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,220
Because I was leaving.

775
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,890
I was going away.

776
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,060
We didn't dare
look at each other.

777
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,740
There aren't any marks.

778
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,920
No. Just a burn here.

779
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,750
They were very careful.

780
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,750
Due to the UN, Cairo
surely gave them orders.

781
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,190
No one came
to ask about me?

782
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,600
Yes, just as I came in.

783
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,880
I saw your friends again.

784
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,970
Which ones?

785
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,440
They came yesterday...

786
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,850
on behalf
of the French Consulate...

787
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,010
the thin one who looks
like an elevator boy...

788
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,560
and the other one...
a gigolo.

789
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,560
Who are they?

790
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,690
It's Paul and Jacques.

791
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,060
I'm sure of it.

792
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,700
We're the ones
who killed Lachenal.

793
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,540
Why did she turn her back?

794
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,910
No. I find that
idiotic.

795
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,210
Palivoda, yes...

796
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,080
but Lachenal
had done nothing.

797
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,750
He thought the Algerian war
was unfair.

798
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,050
But that's all.

799
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,750
Yes. I don't know.

800
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,990
You always say that.

801
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,930
I'm listening.

802
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,900
Mohamed Messousa...

803
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,740
16 Chapelit Street.

804
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,740
Where can I call you?
Why not?

805
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:07,080
OK, big boy.
You call us.

806
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,410
In exchange for
2 diplomatic passports,

807
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,450
I gave him
the Arabs' address.

808
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,280
Tell the photographer
to see Paul.

809
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,430
In your files...

810
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,490
do you have a girl
named...

811
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,140
V... Veronica Dreyer.

812
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,040
Veronica Dreyer?

813
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:43,140
Call me back.
Veronica Dreyer.

814
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,120
And what about me?

815
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,950
Why do you work for the rebels?

816
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,510
Some political conviction?

817
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,980
It's difficult to say.

818
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,620
Little by little...

819
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,890
I just became exhausted.
but at any rate...

820
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:02,990
I decided that the French
are wrong.

821
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,600
The others have an ideal.

822
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,770
But not the French.

823
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,780
It's very important
to have an ideal.

824
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:22,450
Against the Germans,
the French had an ideal.

825
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,290
Against the Algerians,
they don't.

826
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,730
They'll lose the war.

827
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,130
You think so? I don't.

828
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,460
Yes, I do.

829
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,800
Today everyone hates the French.

830
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,050
I'm very proud to be French.

831
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,620
But I'm also
against nationalism.

832
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:56,050
One defends ideas,
not territories.

833
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:00,060
I love France because
I love the films of du Bellay...

834
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,220
and Louis Aragon.

835
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,260
I love Germany
because I love Beethoven.

836
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,560
I don't love Barcelona
because of Spain...

837
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,570
but I like Spain
because Barcelona exists...

838
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,110
and America because
I like their cars.

839
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,710
I don't like Arabs because
I don't like deserts...

840
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,180
nor Colonel Lawrence...

841
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,180
nor the Mediterranean
or Albert Camus.

842
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,620
No, I like Brittany.
And I hate the south.

843
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,260
Breton light is very soft...

844
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,950
not like in the south.

845
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,320
And the Arabs are lazy.

846
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,470
But I have
nothing against them.

847
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,760
Or against the Chinese.

848
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,200
No, I'd like to ignore them.

849
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,970
But today it's terrible.

850
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,950
If you calmly do nothing...

851
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:56,280
you get hell
for doing nothing.

852
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,820
We do things
without conviction.

853
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:03,090
It's a pity to make war
without conviction.

854
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,220
Why is the Vatican
anticommunist?

855
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,590
He's an odd pope, this one.

856
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,930
All men are brothers.

857
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,800
I'm not a brother to train
conductors in Peking...

858
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,600
nor in San Francisco.

859
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,110
A priori, I don't care
about them.

860
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,940
Maybe someday...

861
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,620
I'd like to know
what's become of Sasovotsky.

862
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,950
He's not automatically
my brother...

863
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,120
because he has eyes
and ears like me.

864
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,630
And vise versa.

865
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,930
There are objects,
I don't know...

866
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,090
One likes them,
but not others.

867
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,160
Or colors.

868
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,930
For example,
I hate dark red.

869
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,270
It's the same with men.

870
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,940
We can't be made
to love them all.

871
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:05,210
As Guitry said, "We no longer
know where to love."

872
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,720
She looked at me.

873
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,920
I think women should never
be more than 25.

874
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,390
Men become more handsome
as they age.

875
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,590
Not women.

876
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,260
It's greatly unfair
for a woman to age.

877
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,930
And I've noticed
something strange.

878
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,730
Women, when they
commit suicide...

879
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,070
they always leap...

880
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,240
under a train
or out a window.

881
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,410
They're so afraid that they'll
mess up the attempt...

882
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,780
that they throw themselves
forward.

883
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,280
That way, it's
impossible to turn back.

884
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,290
Men never do this.

885
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,590
Men rarely jump
in the subway.

886
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:50,600
Women rarely cut their wrists.

887
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,800
It's both brave
and cowardly of them.

888
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,540
Yes. I don't know.

889
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,700
Life says women are right...

890
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,400
but gives death to men.

891
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,940
Death is what's important.

892
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,280
Van Gogh said we'll use death
to go to a new star.

893
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:17,550
There's something more
important than ideals...

894
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,590
but what?

895
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:23,730
There's something more important
than not being conquered.

896
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,060
I wish I knew what, exactly.

897
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,070
Pathetic.

898
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,930
At school, I admired
that word.

899
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,670
Now I despise it.

900
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,240
"Taciturn."

901
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:40,250
There's a beautiful word.

902
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,910
Like "guild."

903
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:45,250
I'm lost if I don't
pretend to be lost.

904
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,450
I think everyone
has an ideal.

905
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,260
But everyone is missing
something more important.

906
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:54,620
I'm sure that God
doesn't have an ideal.

907
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,970
There's a very,
very beautiful saying.

908
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,500
Whose is it?

909
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,870
I think it's Lenin's.

910
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,070
"The future esthetics
is ethics."

911
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,740
It's a beautiful saying,
very moving, too.

912
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,910
It reconciles
the Left with the Right.

913
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,580
What do Leftists
and Rightists think?

914
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,410
Today what's the revolution for?

915
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:27,780
The Right wins, then
applies Leftist policies.

916
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,490
And the other way around.

917
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,100
I win or lose,
but fight on alone.

918
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,100
In the thirties, young men
had a revolution.

919
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:42,670
For example, Malraux,
Drieu La Rochelle, Aragon.

920
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,900
We have nothing.

921
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,740
They had the Spanish
Civil War.

922
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,910
We have no war.

923
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:52,080
Aside from ourselves...

924
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,090
our own faces,
our own voices...

925
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,120
we have nothing.

926
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,680
But maybe it's important
to recognize the sound...

927
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,350
of your own voice...

928
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:03,900
and the shape of your face.

929
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,730
On the inside,
it's like this...

930
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,570
but when I look at it,
it's like this.

931
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:18,440
You look at me but don't
know what I'm thinking...

932
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,380
and never will know
what I'm thinking.

933
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,710
Right now,
a forest in Germany.

934
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,410
A bicycle ride.

935
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,710
It's over.

936
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:33,060
Now... a cafe terrace
in Barcelona.

937
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,750
Now... it's already over.

938
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,220
I'm trying to delimit
my own thoughts.

939
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,760
And speech. Where
does speech come from?

940
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:47,270
Maybe men talk endlessly
like goldminers...

941
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,270
Iooking for the truth.

942
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,740
But instead of digging
in rivers...

943
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,940
they dig in their thoughts.

944
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,710
They eliminate words
of no value...

945
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,020
and end up finding one...

946
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:07,390
just one...
just one golden one...

947
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,060
and already all is silence.

948
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,730
Why do you love me?

949
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,070
I don't know.

950
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,410
Because I'm crazy.

951
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,760
Who are you calling?

952
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,530
French Information Bureau.

953
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,930
Hang on.

954
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,440
OK. Give him to me.

955
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,050
Hello? Who's this?

956
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,320
Who is it?

957
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,090
It's Bruno.

958
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,250
Who is it?!

959
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,300
Bruno!

960
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:20,200
What's wrong?

961
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:22,100
I don't know. Bruno!

962
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,400
Bruno Forestier!

963
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:28,740
Wrong address?

964
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,610
Maybe they moved.

965
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,870
We've just spoken with Paul.

966
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,420
Paul found no Mohamed Messousa
at that address.

967
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,890
So no passports for me
and Veronica...

968
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,590
unless I kill Arthur Palivoda.

969
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,430
OK. Come over now.

970
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,710
Brilliant.

971
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:06,950
Yes.

972
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:10,740
Thanks. You're great.

973
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,610
OK. See you next week.

974
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,120
You're right, Paul.
A girl.

975
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,590
Alone, in town.

976
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:21,750
Is either a whore
or an informer.

977
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,800
She must know the Arabs'
address. She must know it.

978
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,710
Lock the door.
You never know.

979
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,280
Do they know
you were tortured?

980
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,480
Yes.

981
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,160
I'm glad.

982
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,290
The police found my Chevy
on a Swiss highway.

983
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,800
When will you be back?

984
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,770
I have to find Palivoda.

985
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,440
Maybe tonight... or tomorrow.

986
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,570
That's a cute dress.

987
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,070
Yes. It's a present.

988
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,440
From the guy
who gave you the puppy?

989
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,740
Did you sleep with him?

990
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,280
He dated me
a long time.

991
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,120
It's not important.

992
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,620
But it is.

993
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,460
See you soon.

994
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,490
See you soon.

995
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,130
Who is it?

996
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:22,250
It's Bruno.

997
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,410
Who's there?

998
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,450
Bruno!

999
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:26,910
It's you, Bruno?

1000
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,920
Bruno!

1001
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,290
Bruno Forestier!

1002
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,260
The rest happened fast,
and the situation...

1003
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,270
which seemed very complex
became very simple.

1004
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,640
While I went to meet them...

1005
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,940
the French hid Veronica
in a villa on the lake...

1006
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,310
and tortured her badly...

1007
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,980
to get the Arabs' address.

1008
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,720
I didn't know it yet.

1009
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:11,060
Jacques said he'd give me
Veronica and our passports...

1010
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:13,600
once I'd killed Arthur Palivoda.

1011
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:27,440
At times you must make your way
with a dagger.

1012
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,130
It was after killing Palivoda
I learned Veronica was dead.

1013
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,200
One thing I've learned is
not to be bitter.

1014
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,220
I was just glad to still
have so much time left.
