1
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,110
We here already.

2
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,620
Hey. Wake up March. 
We're back in the war boy.

3
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,570
Hey, this isn't the town. It's a hospital.

4
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,880
Give me an egg special.

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
C'mon. sit down. You won't 
find a real nurse at this hospital.

6
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,970
They're real.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,450
Yeah.

8
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,710
They're real alright.

9
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,050
Real real.

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,970
3 of them.

11
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,600
And there's probably more inside.

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,420
It's a real hospital.

13
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,510
That's what it says.

14
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,020
325th evacuation

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,400
Hey March. Come back here.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Come on. Get back in that truck.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,510
Kirb, you come with me.

18
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Pull it up. Pull over there. Wait for us.

19
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,280
Honey?

20
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,160
I, Andy

21
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,800
He's cracked sarge. He's cracked.

22
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Come on. Let's get him.

23
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,440
What's the matter with you?

24
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,200
Leave me alone, will ya?

25
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,250
Boy, that's an officer 
you're messing around with.

26
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,810
I'm sorry Lieut. Just that, 
he hasn't been gettin much sleep

27
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,260
I'm alright. I'm alright. This is my wife.

28
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,520
This your wife?

29
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,530
Yeah.

30
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,730
Oh honey. This is the sarge, 
and that's Kirby, my best buddy.

31
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,300
Well uh, congratulations, uh.

32
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,600
Huh, ha. Pleased to meet you Sir, uh, Miss.

33
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,880
What are you supposed to call..

34
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,250
Mrs. March? I don't know.

35
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,840
Lieutenant March.

36
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,920
Lieut. March. What's happening here?

37
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,120
This is Andy, my husband, Doctor. He, uh

38
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,470
And these men?

39
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm Sergeant Saunders, 361st. 
We're in a convoy headed forward, uh.

40
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,600
Corporal March just found 
out his wife is stationed here, Sir.

41
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,220
Sir, you see uh

42
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,820
Perhaps you'd better hold 
your reunion outside Lieut.

43
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,050
These other men aren't feeling quite that chipper.

44
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm sorry Doc.

45
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,820
Go ahead. You're relieved of 
duty until your husband's convoy leaves.

46
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,120
Thank you, Sir.

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,200
This is a real bedside manner for you.

48
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,370
Walk, er. Let's go outside.

49
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,770
Come on, honey.

50
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,970
Ah, He's got one.

51
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,920
He's got a nurse.

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,650
Andy, please.

53
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,000
Let 'em look.

54
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,520
Andy, not here. It isn't fair.

55
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,770
Been such a long time, honey.

56
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,520
I, I was asleep and I heard the 
guys talking, and then I heard hospital 
and then 325th, and I just knew it.

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,500
Couldn't believe it, but I knew it.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,350
How've you been. Your letters haven't 
caught up with me for over a month now.

59
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,770
I just can't believe you're here.

60
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm here.

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,770
Excuse me Lieut. 
We have to move out. 
The convoy's already moved out.

62
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,450
Aw, come on sarge. I haven't seen her since

63
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,800
The Sergeant can't help that.

64
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,770
We have to move out March. Sorry.

65
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,420
Look, Sarge. Once we cross 
the river we're gonna be moving fast.

66
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,770
I may not get a chance to 
see her till after the war.

67
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,050
What are you talking about. You're 
better off than the rest of us right now.

68
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,950
You stay out of this Kirby. What do 
you know about it. You're not married.

69
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,750
You don't gotta be married..

70
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,300
I'll talk to Lieut. Hanley.

71
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Maybe we can swing a couple of days for you.

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,800
You're kidding.

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Really?

74
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,370
I, I'd give my right arm for 48 hours.

75
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,800
Did you hear that honey.

76
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,220
I said I'd ask. I can't promise anything.

77
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,470
A fat chance you got of getting 
a pass in the middle of the war, March.

78
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,120
You really think it might be possible Sergeant'

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,300
I'll do my best Lieut.

80
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,570
Let's go Kirby. March, 2 minutes.

81
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,500
Nice to have met you.

82
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,050
Yeah. Any friend of Andy's is a friend of mine.

83
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,870
Howcome he can do that?

84
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,370
It's his wife, numbskull.

85
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,770
His wife?

86
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,850
Yeah. His wife.

87
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,770
They're married. That means 
they got, uh, privileges.

88
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,450
March. We're moving out.

89
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,870
I didn't know your husband was over here. Nice.

90
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,750
Have them take him right 
over to the surgery tent.

91
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,600
Well, has, has he gone?

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,970
Yes. He's gone.

93
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,720
It's a shame you didn't have more time.

94
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,170
His Sgt. gonna try to get him a pass.

95
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,770
He's not sure if he can, but he's going to try.

96
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,450
Well, I'll be damned. Oh uh. 
We have an abdominal in half an hour.

97
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,570
Would you like uh, some coffee, maybe?

98
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,900
There's a lispodite down there if 
you have to fill up your canteen.

99
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,550
Hey March.

100
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,070
You and me. We're buddies, right.

101
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,450
Sure Kirb. You know that.

102
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,120
How's come you never 
told me that you was married.

103
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,970
I don't know, I

104
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,000
I started to a lot of times, but

105
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,450
The way you talk about women. 
All the different ones, I mean.

106
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,270
I, I just love her.

107
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,770
very much.

108
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,300
I guess I just

109
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,900
didn't want to share her, not even talking.

110
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,700
How long you been married?

111
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,350
Two days. Not counting the 8 months we been apart.

112
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,800
8 months?

113
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,670
That means, you got hitched in England, right?

114
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah. That's where I met her. Hah.

115
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Boy, you should've seen the chain of command 
we had to go through to get permission. Hoho.

116
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,950
Huh, well how does Company deal with 
somebody's only been together 2 days, though.

117
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,770
Omaha Beach.

118
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,400
Do you think the sarge can 
really swing that pass for me.

119
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,950
Aw, forget it. Look, you believe in Santa Claus.

120
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,700
Take you an Act of Congress to get.

121
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,870
What happened to you Saunders? Breakdown.

122
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,470
No, not quite. It was Corporal March.

123
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,750
He ran into his wife.

124
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,920
Sergeant. I asked you what happened.

125
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,420
You see, she's a nurse and she 
was stationed at a hospital that we passed.

126
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,250
And it took some doing, prying them apart.

127
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,120
We're lucky you got here this fast.

128
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,570
March is with you, isn't he?

129
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh yes. He's up in the truck there.

130
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,600
Lieutenant, about March.

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,100
You know what they're talking about right now?

132
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,020
About whether to give March a 
pass so he can go see his wife.

133
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,720
Aah, it's the truth. We saw him kiss her.

134
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,020
C'mon Kirby. Get to the end of the line.

135
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,950
Eh. Put me there.

136
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,670
I'll put you on top of the moon

137
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,050
Hey. Come on. Back in the line.

138
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,700
That's enough.

139
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Forget it.

140
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,570
Come on Kirby. Move.

141
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,320
Hey Billy. Did he kiss her 
right out in front of everybody.

142
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Oho, I'll say.

143
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,020
Hey, she's an officer.

144
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,650
So what. She's a girl, isn't she.

145
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,770
Well yeah, but I mean..kissing an 
officer. What if she pulls rank on him.

146
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Billy, have you ever been married?

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Nooo

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,070
Well, have you ever had 
a girl? I mean, a real girl.

149
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,050
You guys make me sick.

150
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,150
What's eating him?

151
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,050
Bonjour.

152
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,420
Hey March.

153
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,070
Yes sarge.

154
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,350
It's in the works. The Lieut's gonna 
make a request from Cpt. Harper.

155
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,720
Hey sarge, if uh, if you can do 
this for me, you're gonna have the 
workingest, neatest, finest soldier you ever saw.

156
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:39,950
Yeah.

157
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,860
I won't forget it sarge.

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,660
It's alright.

159
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,620
Je ne pas parle anglais.

160
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,740
Je nes parle vous.

161
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,980
Je ne comprend pas.

162
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,740
Hey.  You think you can 
pull back out here in a minute.

163
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,140
Kirby.

164
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,700
Come on.

165
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,460
How's that for a weekend pass, huh.

166
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,580
You just forget it.

167
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,620
Yeah. You forget it sarge, Okay.

168
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,520
She's not for you Kirby. Not your type.

169
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,740
What are you talking about. 
I don't see any off limits sign on her.

170
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,580
Hey, why don't you just 
calm down till we get to Paris

171
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,050
I need, just get a name.

172
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,580
I know her name.

173
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,790
It's trouble.

174
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,110
Now, come on. Get in the truck. Let's go.

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,250
Hey Kirb.

176
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,220
The Lieut.'s gonna send my
 request for a pass on to

177
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,020
Someone's ready.

178
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,770
Hat trick.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,690
Okay.

180
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,440
Got a little straight.

181
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,010
Hey Kirby. Don Juan.

182
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,560
C'mon get your feet wet. It'll cool you off.

183
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,800
You know Kirby doesn't care about money.

184
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,140
Come on. Let's play cards.

185
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,290
That's right.

186
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,080
Kirby cares about just one thing.

187
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,110
What's that?

188
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,230
Kirby.

189
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,920
Hey sarge. The Lieut. wants to see you right away.

190
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,240
Hey sarge. Maybe that's about my pass.

191
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,270
Hope so, March.

192
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,960
Hey Crowne. Why don't you grab a seat.

193
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah. Yeah, Not me. I've got
 better ways to spend my money.

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,310
Okay. A pair of Queens bets.

195
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,410
You alright.

196
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,370
Hey uh. You get a good look at March's wife.

197
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,980
Uh huh.

198
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,750
Pretty?

199
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah. huh.

200
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,760
He seemed like not much of 
a ladies man to me. Did he to you?

201
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,400
You want to see a real good looking thing.

202
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,980
Are you kidding?

203
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,880
I got one I'm gonna see tonight. 
Now, if you wanna tag along, 
maybe she's got a friend.

204
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,100
Kirby. You slip a gear.

205
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,390
You just tag along and find out.

206
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,140
How far you figure that last village.

207
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,410
Kirby. You can't go in there after dark.

208
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,820
I'll see.

209
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,490
Hey. Hey sarge. Did it come through.

210
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,810
Not yet March. It's in the works.

211
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,880
Hey, what the Lieut. want sarge.

212
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,900
We're to lay wire to the 
combat outpost tomorrow, daybreak.

213
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,660
Oh, no.

214
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,880
Who goes?

215
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,870
Littlejohn and Billy. Packard, Caje, you and I cover.

216
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,710
Who rides shotgun for Billy and me.

217
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,960
Uh.

218
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,500
Well, March. It's his turn.

219
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,330
Wait, wait a minute. What if his pass comes up?

220
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,840
Yeah.

221
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,700
Let somebody else ride shotgun.

222
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,410
Awright now. Wait, wait, wait a minute.
 I was up last trip.

223
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,040
Naw, he's right.

224
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,520
That is, unless you wanna 
volunteer for your buddy.

225
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
What do you...

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
You don't really think that pass 
is gonna come through, do you?

227
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,110
Yeah. So does the Lieut.

228
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,090
Okay. Who's gonna stand in the
 path of romance. I'll ride shotgun.

229
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Thanks Kirb.

230
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
 I'll ride 3 in a row when I get back. 
Thanks a million Kirb.

231
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,220
Okay.

232
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,220
Oh, what was it.

233
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,730
Queen.

234
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,420
Fifty cents.

235
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,360
Alright.

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,790
You're not really going into town Kirby.

237
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,160
Yeah, I'm really going into town Kirby. 
Now you gonna stay here or you coming with me.

238
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,150
Help me out you really got a girl.

239
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,620
Coming or not.

240
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,780
When we get caught, we've had it.

241
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,380
Don't wait up for me.

242
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,950
Didn't I tell you. It's a cinch. Come on.

243
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,530
Seized up, huh.

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
That was a big reception.

245
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,880
Got a favorite that goes here.

246
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Just sit down will ya. shift over.

247
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,120
Hey. Is there any table service. Servir. Service

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,520
Oh, no, no, no Monsieur.Ah look ah

249
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,260
Well, we'll have a bottle of cognac.

250
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,020
Out of cognac. Ce mon javais.

251
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,940
Oh, uh

252
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,500
Wine, ca vais. Wine, wine.

253
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,610
That's good, that's good.

254
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,700
Here comes it.

255
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Uh, my name is Kirby, Kirby.

256
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,730
Kirrbee.

257
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,820
Kirrbee, what's your name?

258
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,570
Claire.

259
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,280
Eh, Claire. Hey listen Claire, I came

260
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,920
Claire, Monsieur, does not understand english.

261
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,210
Perhaps I can help you.

262
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,180
Oh, look. Thanks friend. 
You tell her that I'm the 
guy she smiled at this afternoon.

263
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,500
I think, uh, you're mistaken.

264
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,860
Heh. You mean I don't know 
when a girls coming on to me.

265
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,880
Hehe. You ask her what time 
she gets through, would you please.

266
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,900
When she gets through Monsieur

267
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,090
she goes home.

268
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,930
She's bethrothed to my brother.
 You see, he fights with the, 
how do you say, the Resistance.

269
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,780
Well, I don't know anything about that, but, uh

270
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,090
she seems big enough to think for
 herself, so let's just let her decide, alright.

271
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,580
I speak for my brother. I speak for Claire.

272
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,770
Look Claire, uh. When you get finished, 
when you close up here, I'm gonna meet

273
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm gonna meet you outside

274
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,120
Ecouter moi bien, Monsieur.

275
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,640
You come here to drink

276
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,090
then drink.

277
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,770
Because if you look for something 
else, you're going to find trouble.

278
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,200
Hey, uh. I think he's got a
 point there eh. All of them.

279
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,300
Wait. Wait just a minute.

280
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Hey, come on Kirb. Let's go.

281
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,760
No no. Go on if you want to. 
I'm not leaving here until she tells me to go.

282
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,980
Awright. I'm going.

283
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,860
HUH! Thanks a lot.

284
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
Hey. Look.

285
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,860
You smiled at me, and I smiled 
back at you, so, I come see you.

286
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,540
I tell you, Monsieur. Leave her alone.

287
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,720
Don't put your hands on me, friend.

288
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,240
C'est pardon. Col a fairez chaud.
 Il pol a baques.

289
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,680
(French)

290
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
(Caje shouts in surprise)

291
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,880
What was that?

292
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,540
What's going on?

293
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Kirby. Come on.

294
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,320
Kirby.

295
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,660
Kirby.

296
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,160
Crowne.

297
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,980
Come on. Come on. Get up.

298
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,740
What?

299
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,760
Get up. C'mone.

300
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
Where's Kirby?

301
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,320
I said Where's Kirby?

302
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,800
Didn't he get back yet?

303
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,940
Get back? From where?

304
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,180
What?

305
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,540
Now where's Kirby. You answer me.

306
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,960
I, I don't know Sgt.

307
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,060
Back from where Crowne. Don't lie to me.

308
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,620
I want to know where Kirby went.

309
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,780
What're you asking me for?

310
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,060
Where's Kirby? Now you answer me.

311
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,080
We went into town. I came 
back alone. I guess he's still there.

312
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,240
What do you mean, you guess.

313
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,400
He was with that french girl. 
At least, he was trying.

314
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Looked like trouble to me, so I came back.

315
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,680
I guess he did alright after all.

316
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
He did alright.

317
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
He's liable to be tried for missing a patrol.

318
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,560
Now you get over there to the Lieut. and 
make out a full report on the both of you.

319
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Sgt. I came back.

320
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
Get over there.

321
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,480
Come on. Come on.

322
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,780
Oh sarge. Did it, did it come through.

323
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,340
No, not yet, but you're gonna 
have to ride shotgun with us after all.

324
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,360
What happened to Kirby. I thought he was gonna.

325
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Ah, your buddy went over the hill.

326
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,680
Kirby went over the hill?

327
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,240
We're moving out in 15 minutes.

328
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,960
Maybe your pass will be 
ready by the time we get back.

329
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,140
Go on.

330
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,820
Well, we were only there
 for a few minutes Sir.

331
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,240
At least I was.

332
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
Kirby was really hooked on that girl.

333
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,940
Why did you leave?

334
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,420
Because it looked like trouble in it.

335
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,080
I tried to get him to go with me.

336
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,360
(phone ringing)

337
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,100
Stand at attention soldier.
(phone ringing)

338
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,400
Stand at attention soldier.

339
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,180
King 2. Lieut. Hanley.

340
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,300
Yes Sir. I'm looking into it now Captain.

341
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,520
How is he.

342
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
That's a break Sir.

343
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,220
Yes Sir. I'll get my report 
in right away. King 2 out.

344
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,220
Thank you Sir.

345
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,020
For what?

346
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,720
For not mentioning me to the captain, Sir.

347
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,420
Private Crowne. You were absent 
from the Bivouac area without 
permission. Is that not correct.

348
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,380
Yes Sir.

349
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,820
That is absent without leave. Is that correct?

350
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,540
Well Sir. Yes Sir, but I did come back.

351
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,000
You're going on my report to Captain Harper.

352
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,460
You'll be punished along with Kirby as
 soon as he gets out of the hospital. Dismissed.

353
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,060
Got a dandy for you Lieut.

354
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,600
What is it. Bullet wounds or shrapnel.

355
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,840
Just whiskey bottles and hard toed shoes.

356
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,660
Aaagh!

357
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,260
Take it easy, will you Doc.

358
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,240
What's his name and outfit.

359
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,940
Kirby, King Company, 361st infantry.

360
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,680
361st

361
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,960
Nurse.

362
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,020
Yeah. First things first, Lieut.

363
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,420
Put him in that open bed over there.

364
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,900
Sure thing Lieut.

365
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000
(groaning)

366
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,500
Aah.

367
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,980
How did this happen?

368
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,280
He got beat up. 
Good old fashioned alley fight. 
Why? Do you know him, Lieut.

369
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,140
He's a friend of my husband.

370
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,960
He was here yesterday.

371
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,400
Is his Company still in this area?

372
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,920
I don't know. You'll have to ask him Lieut.

373
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,620
All we do is scrape them up, and deliver them.

374
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,840
(kapow)

375
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,840
(BANG)

376
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,760
Take cover.

377
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,240
Take cover. Artillery's gonna 
start coming on our ass.

378
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,640
March.

379
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,960
Let it go.

380
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
March.

381
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
BLAM

382
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
BLAM

383
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
BLAM

384
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
BLAM

385
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
BLAM

386
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
BLAM

387
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
BLAM

388
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
BLAM

389
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
BLAM

390
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
BLAM

391
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
BLAM

392
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,300
(Oompf)

393
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,000
Cut it off.

394
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh come on. Hey, it hurts.

395
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Any way to talk to an officer.

396
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,480
What?

397
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,960
Oh. Um. uh, sorry Lieut.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,700
Forgot where I was.

399
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,200
Uh. Oh. It's a hospital.

400
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,540
Feel better.

401
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,660
Hey. You're March's wife, aren't you.

402
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,200
I met you early this morning.

403
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,460
Yesterday.

404
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,360
Oh, yesterday.

405
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Now ain't that something.

406
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,080
Too bad old March didn't 
get beat up by those guys, huh.

407
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,460
Yeah,. I mean, uh, then he'd be here 
with you right now instead of me.

408
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,540
How is he?

409
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,260
Oh, March is doing great, uh

410
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,600
Far as I know the Lieut. is trying
 to rustle up a pass for him

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,020
So's you two can finish up your honeymoon.

412
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,720
Well, Kirby.

413
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,220
It's refreshing to have someone like you in here.

414
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,660
Reminds me of the old 
days at L.A. County General.

415
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,300
Knifings, beatings, smashups. How you feeling?

416
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,600
Terrible.

417
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,260
Well, Im not surprised. 
You got a nice concussion there.

418
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,040
And two badly sprained, 
if not broken, fingers.

419
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,640
and uh, How many stitches were there?

420
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,420
36

421
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,200
36 stitches in your head.

422
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,280
Plus that black eye.

423
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,480
Oh, Lieut. Willows. 
Would you take over here please.

424
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,560
Yes Sir.

425
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,940
Lieut. March. I'd like to see you for a moment.

426
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,900
Alright, doctor.

427
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
Well?

428
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,000
Well, what?

429
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,820
Did he get the pass? 
Is he gonna be here for awhile?

430
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,280
I don't know.

431
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,880
(crying)

432
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,620
Lieut. The guys got back.

433
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,660
What happened?

434
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,300
Artillery, heading back.

435
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,440
I don't know how bad it is, but it's pretty bad.

436
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,620
Where's Doc.

437
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,920
Back at Company CP. They had some trouble.

438
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,680
Put him in the jeep. It's only a few 
miles back to the EVAC hospital.

439
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,960
And his wife. Alright. Come on. 
Put him in that jeep.

440
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,640
I'd like to take him back Lieut.

441
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,360
Sure. Who do you want to go with you?

442
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,560
Kirby.

443
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,060
Oh, he's there already.

444
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,480
He's what?

445
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,300
Take Crowne. He'll explain on the way.

446
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,940
Alright. You get in that jeep.

447
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,600
I guess it doesn't matter much now, but

448
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,480
his pass came through.

449
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,060
Maybe Kirby can use it.

450
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,800
How you feeling, pal.

451
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh, I hurt, aah.

452
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,820
Well, you got nothing to 
worry about. I heard them talking.

453
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,220
You'll be out of here tomorrow.

454
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,380
That's what I'm worried about, huh.

455
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,560
I got a feeling I'm gonna be 
digging trenches all the way to Berlin.

456
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,680
What'd you do. Get in a fight with a non-com?

457
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,760
Um I, had a little skirmish with 
the entire French Underground.

458
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,300
Just that, I wasn't where I 
was supposed to be at the time.

459
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,160
AWOL huh. Well, don't worry about it.

460
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,140
They could call it desertion and just shoot you.

461
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,640
Heh, thanks a lot pal.

462
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,600
How do you feel?

463
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,740
Oh, worse. Hey Lieut. 
Did you hear anything from my outfit yet.

464
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,040
They know you're here.

465
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,100
Well, that's something at least.

466
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm not under arrest or anything am I?

467
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,060
Why should you be under arrest?

468
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,400
I can think of a couple of reasons.

469
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,260
Did you hear anything 
from March? I mean, Andy.

470
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,500
Not yet.

471
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,020
You will. I betcha he comes barreling 
through that door any minute now.

472
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,000
How well do you know Andy.

473
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,940
Andy and me's best buddies.

474
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,020
He sure kept you a secret though.
 I have to admit that of course.

475
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,280
If you was a wife of mine, I'd have 
your picture plastered up all over the place.

476
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,300
I'd even be talking about you to total strangers.

477
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,040
Maybe Andy doesn't know me 
well enough to talk about me.

478
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,340
You see, we haven't known 
each other for very long.

479
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,860
Hmph, well. I knew old March had 
something going for him though cause

480
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,040
he's always sneaking off by himself writing letters.

481
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,220
You must have got one every day.

482
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,240
Almost.

483
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,080
Hey, that's some dame, huh.

484
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
You bet.

485
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,040
To look at her you'd think she was just about 
the sweetest, purest girl ever, wouldn't you.

486
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,320
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,660
She's married to your friend, isn't she?

488
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,620
Yeah, that's right. What about it?

489
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,500
Well she's holding hands with the good doctor.

490
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,560
Are you kidding?

491
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,940
Well I been here for 3 weeks.

492
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,400
I might have a couple pounds of 
kraut lead in me, but I'm not blind.

493
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,280
I don't believe you.

494
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,180
What evers the make, she's not your wife.

495
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
Give us a hand, will you.

496
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,040
Bring a stretcher.

497
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,180
Some of the splints are pretty bad.

498
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,580
Take him in there.

499
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,580
I'll get Doctor Anders.

500
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
Well hey. Hey sarge. Over here.

501
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay, I give up. Arrest me, 
but get me outta here, will ya.

502
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,900
I put him in the ready ward doctor.
 In case you want to operate.

503
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,380
This is the Sergeant that brought him in.

504
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,360
I see. Lieut March. Get the information
 from the sergeant. I'll go and have a look at him.

505
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,660
Hey Captain.

506
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,660
You're Andy's sergeant, aren't you.

507
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,920
Uh, Yes. Yes ma'am.

508
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,440
No.

509
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,980
Please God, don't let it...

510
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,720
What happened.

511
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,060
It's old March, huh.

512
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,180
Did uh...

513
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,140
Did, did he get hurt bad?

514
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,980
Well, what're you trying to do? 
Blame the whole thing on me.

515
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,200
Sgt. now look. He, he was up for that patrol in 
the first place. I was just doing him a favor by

516
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,960
Okay sarge. Look. I didn't mean to duck anything.

517
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,940
Sarge.

518
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,840
Sarge, I got myself beat up now

519
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,980
You know I wouldn't do that on purpose.

520
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,420
Well come on. Say something will ya.

521
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,380
Got nothing to say.

522
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,740
Lew?

523
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,780
Yes?

524
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,140
Is it very bad?

525
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,560
I don't know. It could be. 
Some of the metal penetrated the skull.

526
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,660
How much or how far I won't know until I go in.

527
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,660
He's got to live.

528
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
He's just got to live.

529
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,300
Amelia, I'm gonna do the best I can.

530
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,100
I know how important it is for all three of us.

531
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,100
Cause if he died

532
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,080
we

533
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,820
They're going to release you tomorrow molrning.

534
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,740
Did they tell you?

535
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,300
Good. Maybe I'll give old 
March this bed. It's a dandy.

536
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,400
You can see everything from here.

537
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,440
Doctor Anders is going to operate now.

538
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,120
He's really very badly wounded.

539
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,180
Doctor Anders, huh.

540
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,420
Now that's, cozy.

541
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,200
I don't understand what you're talking about.

542
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Oh yes, you do. Lieutenant Miss March.

543
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,860
You understand alright.

544
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,660
You're in enough trouble now, Kirby. Don't press it.

545
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,860
Well you tell me why she's not mad 
at me for ducking out on that that patrol

546
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,500
So's that her husband could 
go get himself blown up.

547
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,460
I'll tell you why.

548
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,500
cause she got the guilts right up to there.

549
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,020
All the time old Andy was

550
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,440
in the mud just scrounging around 
trying to fight this lousy war she was in
 there playing patty-cake with her doctor.

551
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,340
Now you shut up Kirby. 
You hear me. You just shut up.

552
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,320
I'm sorry Lieut.

553
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,360
Kirby

554
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm gonna see to it they throw the book at you.

555
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,140
For what? Just telling the truth. 
You ask him.,he'll tell you.

556
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,380
I don't have to ask anybody. 
It's none of my business.

557
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,780
And it's none of your business. 
You got it. You just shut up.

558
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:26,000
Only one thing is your business one thing and 
that's all and that is being a soldier and doing 
your job and that is the one thing you didn't do.

559
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,560
And now I'm gonna tell you something else. 
You wanna know the reason why she didn't 
get burned at you for sending March on that detail.

560
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,460
Cause she didn't know. Wanna 
know why. Cause I didn't tell 
her because that's none of her business.

561
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,400
And now I want you to do some deep 
thinking about who's up to where with the guilts.

562
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,260
And while you're at it you just give
 a little thought to your best buddy 
March who's out there being operated on.

563
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,920
Cause he might not make it.

564
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,080
And if he doesn't pull through
 I'm not gonna forget it.

565
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,300
(Chuckling)

566
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,320
Now there's what I call a tough
(Chuckling)

567
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,900
Now there's what I call a tough

568
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,460
Shut up.

569
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,480
Would you like some coffee Sergeant.

570
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,480
Yeah. Thanks.

571
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,920
Thank you.

572
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,040
We don't have any milk.

573
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,440
Oh black coffee is fine.

574
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,860
Would you like to sit down.

575
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,760
No thanks.

576
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,040
How long do these things
 usually, usually take.

577
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,520
It depends.

578
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,020
He was telling the truth.

579
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,740
I am in love with Doctor Anders.

580
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,140
After the war I'm gonna leave Andy.

581
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,380
Look Lieut. Your personal life is your own.

582
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,280
I want to tell you.

583
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,840
Cause if he dies

584
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,100
Doctor Anders and I could never

585
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,420
It would always be between us.

586
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,440
Do you understand Sergeant.

587
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm trying to.

588
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,340
It's not as bad as it sounds.

589
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,960
I'm trying to be honest.

590
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,860
I fell in love with this man.

591
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,400
I didn't try to, didn't want to.

592
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,800
I just did.

593
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,040
Thanks for the coffee Lieut.

594
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,060
What would you do?

595
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,400
Please Sergeant.

596
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,160
Look Lieut. Everybody's got a problem. 
Everybody. You, Kirby, March.

597
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,300
There's no time for it. 
There just isn't enough time.

598
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,200
Only thing I can do is try to hold onto my men.

599
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,980
Keep them alive.

600
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,120
You know.

601
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,900
that boy.

602
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,440
has just about the toughest 
skull I ever run across.

603
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,380
Thank god. Thank God.

604
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,660
Now take it easy.

605
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,940
There's nothing to really worry about.

606
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,040
Uh, Captain?

607
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,080
If Kirby's ready for release we can take him back.

608
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,300
Oh. Certainly Sergeant. Kirby can go anytime.

609
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,900
Oh. Lieut. March. Would you 
prepare Private Kirby for checkout.

610
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,880
Your husband's gonna be alright.

611
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,700
Of course Doctor.

612
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,660
Whoa.

613
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,320
Now you keep warm and 
come back and see us soon.

614
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,100
Honey, Sir. Where I'm going they got bars

615
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,060
balls and chains and no girls of any kind.

616
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,460
That's for sure. Hah.

617
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,980
You think you're gonna sit this war out 
in some soft stockade, you just forget it.

618
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,600
Like I said. Enjoy the war. Bye.

619
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,320
Alright. Get em down.

620
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,240
I still think she gave old March a rotten deal.

621
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,520
So a quick war marriage doesn't work.

622
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,620
What are we supposed to do.

623
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,640
Write our Congressman.

624
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,920
Besides if March's head is as 
hard as the doctor said it was

625
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,260
maybe he won't let her go.

626
