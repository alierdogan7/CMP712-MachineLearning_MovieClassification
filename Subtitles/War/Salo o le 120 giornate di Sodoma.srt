00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:15,369
SALO, or THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM

2
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:21,490
Masters

3
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,684
Storytellers

4
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:30,083
Male victims

5
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:37,763
Female victims

6
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:46,290
Daughters

7
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:50,484
Militia

8
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,644
Collaborators

9
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:59,885
Servants

10
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:53,452
Written and directed by

11
00:02:56,015 --> 00:03:01,647
Northern Italy, during the
Nazi-Fascist occupation

12
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,893
ANTE INFERNO

13
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,933
Your Excellency

14
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,773
President

15
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,053
Your Grace

16
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:11,529
All things are good when
taken to excess

17
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,652
Come on, let's go

18
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,653
Where are you going?

19
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:57,772
Claudio! Your scarf, my son!

20
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:12,005
Sorry, we're obeying orders

21
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:40,169
Marrying each others' daughters will
seal our destinies for ever

22
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,932
President, take as your lawful spouse
His Excellency's daughter, Tatiana

23
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,765
President, I will marry
your daughter, Susy

24
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:56,370
Your Excellency and my brother the
Bishop will marry my daughters

25
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,484
The preparations for our
undertaking are completed

26
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:11,530
In puberty's ambush, maidens bloom,
all unaware of impending doom

27
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:17,926
They listen to the radio, drink tea,
unaware they will lose their liberty

28
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:24,325
Bourgeois recoil not from slaughter
though victim be son and daughter

29
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:17,332
-What's this one's name?
-Claudio Cicchetti

30
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:36,326
-What is your name?
-Franco

31
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,288
I knew you'd consider him

32
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,493
A girl helped us catch him

33
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:44,963
The fool thought he was in for
romance, and ended up in a sack

34
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,686
-What is your name?
-Sergio

35
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,288
Shouldn't we inspect them?

36
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,169
Trousers down, shirts up

37
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,808
That will do

38
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,811
Lamberto Gobbi

39
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:36,015
Carlo Porro

40
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:41,131
Umberto Chessari... just look
at him, gentlemen

41
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:47,206
I waited two whole weeks
to ambush him

42
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,771
...and this is Ferruccio Tonna,
from Castelfranco

43
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,172
From a subversive family

44
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:16,326
The one with the curly hair,
Tonino Orlando

45
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,006
I know him

46
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:22,885
I've waited two long years for him

47
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:24,928
Your Excellency, please help me

48
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,445
His father was a senior judge,
like myself

49
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,966
A southerner, aren't you?

50
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:38,170
Don't expect me to deflower you.
In time we will decide..

51
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:41,926
...who will do you that
delightful honour

52
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,772
That's right, Tonino

53
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,524
Eva, come along

54
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,604
Try to behave yourself

55
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,966
Come, no one will harm you

56
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:14,090
Show these nice gentlemen
all your hidden charms

57
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:38,728
What a beauty

58
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:44,170
A delicious bum, solid yet bouncy

59
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,332
Tits to revive a dying cripple

60
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,964
Bring us another one

61
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:57,290
Signora Castelli, your turn.
The gentlemen are waiting

62
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,444
Please let me go home

63
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,931
Albertina's father is a professor
in Bologna

64
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:51,369
To slip her out of the convent school
we had to convince two nuns

65
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,808
You'll prefer us to the sisters,
won't you?

66
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,450
I don't know yet, sir

67
00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,363
Very well, undress her

68
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,686
Just a moment

69
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,414
We didn't notice her blemish.
She's a pretty virgin, too

70
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:40,969
Don't you disgrace me,
I know your little tricks

71
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,814
We waited until she came out
with her mother...

72
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:55,692
...pushed the mother into the river,
where the damned fool drowned...

73
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:59,528
...right before this angel's eyes

74
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:10,567
There were nine boys, now only eight

75
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:16,646
Anyone know the difference between
"8", "no-no", and the family?

76
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,210
What's the difference?

77
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:24,012
"8" is twice four,
"no-no" is twice not for

78
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:27,848
-What about the family?
-They're fine, thank you

79
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:20,648
Everything is prepared
according to your wishes

80
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,931
You herded, feeble creatures,
destined for our pleasure

81
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:08,006
Don't expect to find here the freedom
granted in the outside world

82
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:12,486
You are beyond reach of
any "legality"

83
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,564
No one knows you are here

84
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:20,048
As far as the world goes,
you are already dead

85
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:24,325
These are the laws which will
govern your lives

86
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:32,009
"At six p.m., the company will
assemble in the "Hall of Orgies"...

87
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,286
"... where our Storytellers...

88
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:40,965
"...will tell us stories, each with
a particular theme

89
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:47,244
"Our friends have the right
to interrupt at any moment

90
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:53,765
"The purpose of the stories is to
inflame lust; all will be permitted

91
00:20:54,575 --> 00:21:00,491
"After dinner, the gentlemen will
conduct the so-called orgies

92
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,965
"The Great Hall will be
adequately heated

93
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:08,293
"Participants, appropriatedly
dressed...

94
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:12,973
"...will lie on the floor
like animals...

95
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,691
"...they will intermingle...

96
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:22,245
"...copulate indescriminately,
incestuously and sodomistically

97
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:26,406
"That will be the daily procedure"

98
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,369
No servants here!

99
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:45,933
"Any man caught in flagrante delicto
with a woman...

100
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:49,412
"...will be punished by
the loss of a limb

101
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:55,367
"The slightest religious act by
anyone will be punished...

102
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:58,090
"...by death"

103
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:14,404
CIRCLE OF MANIAS

104
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:22,925
I was born at a girls' boarding
school, where my mother was a servant

105
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:27,045
One day, my sister asked if
I knew Professor Gentile

106
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:30,885
"Well, look outside, he's waiting
for you...

107
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:34,725
"...to show you something
he's shown me"

108
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,168
She said: "Don't run away

109
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:41,368
"He'll give you some money"

110
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:46,570
I ran out to meet him.
I couldn't believe it

111
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:52,645
-"Where are you going?"
-"To put away the chairs, Professor"

112
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:57,247
"Your sister will do that. I'll show
you something you've never seen"

113
00:23:57,815 --> 00:24:01,285
I followed him into a room

114
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:07,925
He took his huge penis from out of
his trousers and began to masturbate

115
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,889
"Have you ever seen the like?

116
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:14,725
"I've shown your sister and
girls of your age

117
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:20,488
"Give me a hand. Provoke the semen
from which we're all created

118
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:24,328
"I'll make it spurt on your face

119
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:28,165
"This is my sole passion, my child...

120
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:31,688
"...and you are about to see it"

121
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,252
At that very moment...

122
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:38,847
...l was immersed in a white jet,
drenching me from head to toe

123
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:46,093
You mustn't omit any detail...

124
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:51,006
...otherwise your stories will not
arouse us sufficiently

125
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:08,810
I know I was urged to give
every detail...

126
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:14,568
...every particular,
even the slightest...

127
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:20,328
...that may illuminate the
human passion

128
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:23,370
I've not overlooked anything

129
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:29,606
You haven't given us details about
the size of the Professor's penis...

130
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:33,445
...or the nature, the consistency
of his emisssion

131
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:39,208
Did you fondle his genitals,
did he oblige you to do so?

132
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:43,046
Dear Signora Vaccari, more clarity

133
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:48,490
From now on I shall conceal nothing.
May I continue?

134
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:54,893
Time the staff of my old age
had some fun

135
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:02,130
Shortly after my seventh birthday...

136
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:05,448
...l took a girl friend to see
the Professor

137
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:10,252
One of his colleagues was with him.
They drew me inside

138
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:13,766
Looking at me, one said to the other:

139
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:18,253
"Goffredo, didn't I tell you
she was a little beauty?"

140
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:23,370
"She is a rare little jewel",
replied Goffredo

141
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:30,730
Then he took me onto his lap
and gave me a kiss

142
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:34,246
-"How old are you?"
-"Seven, Professor"

143
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:38,085
"You are fifty years younger than me"

144
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:41,926
Then he gave me another kiss

145
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:46,413
Meanwhile, the other prepared
some kind of strange syrup

146
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:52,488
They made me drink it, saying:
"It will make you pee"

147
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:57,610
"All we want of you, dear child,
is that you urinate

148
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:01,729
"And that you do that with me,
alone together"

149
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:11,053
I want this miserable boy
punished severely

150
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,925
We are at your service

151
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:18,733
He had the insolence to
pull away from me

152
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:22,891
You can choose one of ours

153
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:25,968
No, thank you

154
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:35,808
It would take too much to
satisfy me now

155
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:41,449
A moment ago, only the slightest
effort would suffice, but now...

156
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:48,489
You know to what we're driven
by frustrated desire

157
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:51,927
All I ask of you...

158
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:56,448
...is exemplary punishment
for this bastard

159
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:02,893
My Lord, I feel ready to satisfy you

160
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,408
I need no instruction

161
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,290
No, let me be

162
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:16,645
There are a thousand occasions when
one does not desire a woman's anus

163
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:21,293
I'll wait. Let Signora Vaccari
continue her story

164
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:28,486
Everything was so arranged that he
swallowed every drop of my piss

165
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:32,325
At that moment his penis,
overcome by victory...

166
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:36,165
...cried tears of blood over me

167
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:41,609
Then, passion consumed, the Professor
seemed to realize...

168
00:28:41,975 --> 00:28:48,005
...his idol no longer inspired
such religious fervour

169
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:56,211
Without ado, he put ten lire in my
apron pocket and pushed me out

170
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:09,211
The boy's hopeless at masturbation,
he needs a lesson

171
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:13,605
You'd think he'd never seen
a man's tool

172
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,930
Well, friends...

173
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:35,052
...Signora Vaccari will turn them
into first-class whores

174
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:37,610
Nothing is more contagious than evil

175
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,852
You are mistaken, Your Excellency

176
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:44,891
Some can do evil only when
passion drives them to it

177
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:51,365
They are always unhappy, regretting
the evils of the previous night

178
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:51,203
Umberto, Franco... what do you say?

179
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:10,530
Handsome

180
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:22,563
Efisio, it's my turn

181
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:05,453
On the Peratibridge

182
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:10,892
A black flag flies

183
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:17,605
The mourning of the Julian regiment
that goes to war

184
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:47,685
The best young men lie
under the earth

185
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:29,445
The gentleman are not satisfied
with you

186
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:33,445
The first thing you must learn
is how to hold it

187
00:34:07,415 --> 00:34:08,973
Go on

188
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,649
Up and down

189
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,487
Squeeze it harder...

190
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,370
...and stroke beneath with
the other hand

191
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:28,172
Slut! See how it's done

192
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,646
There were nine girls, now only eight

193
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,725
Here's a number eight story

194
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,804
It's about a man who had a friend
named Six-times-eight

195
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:04,329
Going home in the blackout one night
they lost each other

196
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,171
Our man tried to find his friend,
looking everywhere

197
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:12,972
At last he thought he saw something
in the darkness

198
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:18,969
He was overjoyed, thinking he had
found his friend

199
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:24,489
-He cried: "Six-times-eight!"
-"Forty-eight", came the reply

200
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:32,484
Music! Signora Vaccari will tell us
another story...

201
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:36,325
...to stimulate us for
another skirmish

202
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:46,252
I was nine when my sister took me to
Milan to meet Signora Calzetti

203
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:50,733
She examined me and asked if I
wanted to work for her

204
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:54,883
I said I would, if the pay was good

205
00:35:55,255 --> 00:36:01,285
My first client, a stout man named
Vaccari, looked me over carefully

206
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:08,325
At once I showed him my pussy,
which I thought was very special

207
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:14,730
He covered his eyes:
"Out of the question

208
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:20,169
"I'm not interested in your vagina,
cover it up"

209
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:25,285
He covered me up, making me lie down

210
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:31,052
He said: "All these little whores
know is to flaunt their vaginas

211
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:35,454
"Now I'll have to recover from
that disgusting sight"

212
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,574
He wrapped me in a sheet,
like a mummy...

213
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:43,172
...leaving only my behind uncovered

214
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:49,293
He caressed it gently, opened
and closed the cheeks...

215
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:52,488
...began to suck it greedlily

216
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,333
Then he carefully...

217
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:03,686
...put his member between my buttocks,
his movements became frenzied

218
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:13,605
"Such an adorable behind, the sweet
little anus. Now I'll anoint it"

219
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:16,809
He said that three or four times

220
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:20,332
I never saw him again

221
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,174
Your first client...

222
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:26,733
...had an idea of women that
most of us do not share

223
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:30,167
Homage to the rear temple...

224
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,607
...is more fervent than the other

225
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:38,253
I put this question to the company

226
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:44,008
How can we determine the true
inclination of a boy or girl?

227
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,331
Their best part, in other words

228
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:51,693
I believe by masturbation of the
requisite body areas

229
00:37:52,055 --> 00:37:55,206
Let's take the youngsters about whom
we have doubts...

230
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:59,204
...and take them aside to verify

231
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:11,526
Observing, with equal passion
and apathy, Guido and Vaccari...

232
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,735
...masturbating the two bodies
which belong to us...

233
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:18,565
...inspires a number of interesting
reflections

234
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:22,086
Would you care to elaborate,
dear Duke?

235
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,845
We Fascists are the only true
anarchists

236
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:26,688
Naturally...

237
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:31,373
...once we've become masters of the
state, true anarchy is that of power

238
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:34,932
However, look at their
obscene gestures...

239
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:37,247
...like deaf-mute language...

240
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:43,845
...with a code none of us can break,
no matter how great our power

241
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:47,050
There is nothing to be done

242
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:51,684
We must restrict our impulses
to a single gesture

243
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,647
He came. Now he is a man

244
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,924
Little Sergio, we're proud of you

245
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:07,445
-She's a woman now
-Our first couple has been formed

246
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,090
Sergio, you've proved you're a man

247
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:13,054
She is your prize

248
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:41,968
Come forward

249
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:50,134
Appreciate the goodwill of
these gentlemen...

250
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:54,768
...who allow you to enjoy such
a great privilege...

251
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,445
...we will solemnize your marriage

252
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:20,809
What a fine thing

253
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:52,168
What a whore

254
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,888
Get out, you sluts!

255
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:32,645
Let us resume the ceremony

256
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,733
Will you, Sergio...

257
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:37,883
...take Renata for your wife?

258
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:46,891
I pronounce you man and wife

259
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,005
Clear off, all of you!

260
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:28,806
If you salute him,
then you are bound

261
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:35,205
If you are for him,
if you are sound

262
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:40,046
Then you must join up,
honour bound

263
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,845
Lustily! Aren't you newlyweds?

264
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:56,008
Give rein to your feelings

265
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:18,724
Get busy, idiot

266
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:08,333
No! That flower is reserved for us

267
00:45:07,255 --> 00:45:10,327
The principle of all greatness
on earth...

268
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:15,530
...has long been bathed in blood

269
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:21,290
My friends, if memory does not
betray me:

270
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:27,372
"Without bloodshed, there is
no forgiveness

271
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:31,011
"No forgiveness without bloodshed".
Baudelaire

272
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:35,045
Excellency, the expression is not
to be found in Baudelaire...

273
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:39,010
...but in Nietzsche's
The Genealogy of Morals

274
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:44,003
It is neither from Baudelaire
nor Nietzsche...

275
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:49,449
...nor in Saint Paul's
Epistle to the Romans

276
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:50,964
It's Dada

277
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:57,446
Sing me that sweet melody
l loved so much, that goes da-da

278
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:04,805
Delicious creature, do you want
my dirty underpants?

279
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:08,645
My old underpants. What incomparable
refinement

280
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:12,803
You see how sensitive I am
to the value of things

281
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:19,845
Little angel, my greatest desire is
to grant your wish

282
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:23,686
You know I respect all tastes
and whims

283
00:46:24,335 --> 00:46:27,532
However baroque, all deserve
to be respected

284
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:35,848
Because we're not their masters,
even the most bizarre manias...

285
00:46:36,215 --> 00:46:41,608
...derive from a basic principle
of refinement

286
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:46,730
Yes, old buggers, it's a question
of delicacy

287
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:07,210
One day Madam sent me to
another libertine

288
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:16,169
He took me to a room with
a splendid Chinese carpet

289
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:21,610
After making me undress, he ordered
me on all fours, like an animal

290
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:33,452
Having stroked my head two or
three times...

291
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:38,646
...he said: "I want to see if you're
as quick as my dogs"

292
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:42,008
He threw two chestnuts across
the room...

293
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,891
...saying: "Good bitch, fetch!"

294
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:58,614
I thought it best to go along
with the game

295
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:14,093
You have two beautiful eyes...
then look

296
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:19,533
Piss

297
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:50,883
"Filthy muck, putrid bitch",
he shouted, approaching me

298
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:56,649
Then he ejaculated over my back

299
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:01,450
Then he left

300
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:04,329
I dressed...

301
00:49:05,015 --> 00:49:08,803
...and discovered 25,000 lire
in my coat

302
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:32,489
Eat!

303
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:57,006
Your Excellency, are you convinced?

304
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:01,773
It is when I see others degraded
that I rejoice...

305
00:51:02,135 --> 00:51:07,368
...knowing it is better to be me
than the scum of "the people"

306
00:51:07,895 --> 00:51:13,606
Whenever men are equal, without that
difference, happiness cannot exist

307
00:51:13,975 --> 00:51:17,763
So you wouldn't aid the humble,
the unhappy

308
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:20,251
In all the world...

309
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:24,483
...no voluptuousness flatters the
senses more than social privilege

310
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:03,052
My next story is about the mania
of Minister Missiroli

311
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:07,203
I went to the Minister's office
at ten one morning

312
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:10,284
The moment I entered,
the doors closed

313
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:14,566
"What are you doing here,
you little bitch?

314
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:18,723
"Who gave you permission
to disturb me?"

315
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,288
I hadn't been warned of what
would happen...

316
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,369
...so I was frightened by the welcome

317
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:33,694
I can't take any more

318
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:45,610
He tore off my clothes,
shredded them...

319
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:50,730
...and threw them into the fire

320
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:13,446
Then he stretched out
seemingly semi-conscious...

321
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:17,609
...in a chair...

322
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:19,853
...and ejaculated...

323
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:24,973
...making his sperm fall upon the
charred remains of my clothes

324
00:54:29,455 --> 00:54:31,411
CIRCLE OF SHIT

325
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:09,605
Don't you think, Signora Maggi...

326
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:16,005
...that before your stories, you
should show us your best part?

327
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:19,845
With the greatest of pleasure

328
00:56:25,695 --> 00:56:28,129
These buttocks merit our attention

329
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:32,292
I have seldom seen better

330
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,404
Very kind of you to say so

331
00:56:38,255 --> 00:56:41,292
We thank you. Please begin

332
00:56:42,975 --> 00:56:47,685
I see that you gentlemen esteem
the rear end...

333
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:53,450
...so I shall devote my stories
to this subject

334
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:56,170
My story will interest you all...

335
00:56:56,695 --> 00:57:01,894
...especially our dear President;
it concerns a particular mania...

336
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:07,654
...his dearest caprice, which
enabled me to make his acquaintance

337
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:12,572
Conceal my turpitudes from
these innocents

338
00:57:14,295 --> 00:57:18,049
Enough. I am eager to hear
Signora Maggi's voice

339
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:29,605
My childhood years were spent in
endowing my body with the capacity...

340
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:35,486
...to satisfy the basest,
most outrageous desires

341
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:38,888
I soon became expert in that
difficult task...

342
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,088
...and my fame spread throughout
ltaly

343
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:44,889
My clients included many
celebrities...

344
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:49,123
...and to them I gave the best
of myself

345
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:56,490
My first story concerns a most
curious episode in my life

346
00:57:57,495 --> 00:58:00,965
Signora Evola, the Madam
I worked for...

347
00:58:01,335 --> 00:58:07,046
...sent me to a client after feeding
me a large laxative-spiced meal

348
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:11,209
The client was an old
Carabinieri General

349
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,726
He made me undress him and
put a nappy on him

350
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:19,850
I was used to such fixations,
I was ready to help him

351
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:25,209
Suddenly, my bowels rebelled and he
ordered me to relieve myself...

352
00:58:25,655 --> 00:58:30,331
...which I did without embarrassment

353
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:35,849
He made me dip my fingers in
the excrement...

354
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:40,970
...and feed it to him like a baby

355
00:58:42,295 --> 00:58:47,369
He swallowed everything, imitating
the cries of a baby...

356
00:58:48,055 --> 00:58:50,250
...and ejaculated into his nappy

357
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:55,685
I knew a man capable of quite diverse
refinements of the sort

358
00:58:56,055 --> 00:58:59,525
We expect only the best tales of you

359
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:06,563
My next story took place in Verona

360
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:12,648
I was told that the client
waiting at a hotel...

361
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:17,452
...was an old nobleman,
notorious for his depravity

362
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:21,286
My curiosity was immense

363
00:59:21,655 --> 00:59:26,092
That evening my mother was more
intolerant than usual

364
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:30,492
She pleaded with me not to go

365
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:34,723
I couldn't resist the temptation,
so I killed her

366
00:59:35,495 --> 00:59:38,248
The only thing to do

367
00:59:40,855 --> 00:59:44,848
The excitement awaiting you was
supreme...

368
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:49,010
...meriting the utmost sacrifice

369
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:52,805
It's folly to say one owes
anything to one's mother

370
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:58,010
Must we be grateful for her having
pleasure with a man?

371
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:01,208
That should have been enough
reward for her

372
01:00:01,895 --> 01:00:05,683
Long ago, I was cursed with
a mother...

373
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:09,843
...who aroused the same feelings
you felt for yours

374
01:00:10,855 --> 01:00:14,325
As soon as I could, I sent her
to the next world

375
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:20,725
It was a profound pleasure when she
closed her eyes for the last time

376
01:00:25,895 --> 01:00:28,455
Why is that child crying?

377
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:34,489
Your words remind her of her mother

378
01:00:34,855 --> 01:00:38,643
Her mother died trying to protect her

379
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,563
Splendid!

380
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:44,169
It's your mother you're crying for?

381
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:47,209
Come here, let me console you

382
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,006
Come back to Papa's arms

383
01:00:55,015 --> 01:00:57,973
He'll sing you another lullaby

384
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:01,686
What an opportunity you offer me

385
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,606
Signora Maggi's story merits
immediate re-enactment

386
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,806
I beg you to have mercy on
my suffering

387
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:22,485
My mother died for me and
I'll never see her again

388
01:01:24,455 --> 01:01:26,093
Undress her immediately

389
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:36,327
Kill me! God will take pity on me!
Don't dishonour me!

390
01:01:36,935 --> 01:01:41,884
This howling is the most exciting
thing I've ever heard

391
01:01:42,695 --> 01:01:48,725
Kill me! Free me from this torment,
seeing and hearing such horrors!

392
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:52,571
You all heard her call on God

393
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:56,132
Your Excellency, enter her name
in the Penal Register...

394
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:58,970
...for a terrible punishment

395
01:01:59,655 --> 01:02:03,489
Do away with me, so that
I can be with my mother

396
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:10,165
You will be punished and deflowered
when we decide the time is ripe

397
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:18,690
Don't think your tears restrain my
desire; they make me more ruthless

398
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:59,763
Come here, my child, it's ready

399
01:03:00,135 --> 01:03:01,454
On your knees!

400
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:23,453
Go on!

401
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:26,973
Eat it

402
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:51,129
That stupid girl's making a scene
over such a delicacy

403
01:04:51,495 --> 01:04:56,250
A friend insisted that all the
excrement he ate every day...

404
01:04:56,615 --> 01:05:00,528
...come from a beggar woman, so it
would be more putrid and delicious

405
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:05,294
I found an old woman of seventy
for him

406
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:31,763
Spoiled food can provoke
excellent diarrhoea

407
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:38,165
The subject should eat hastily, at
odd hours, to overload the stomach

408
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:41,770
We must try that at once

409
01:05:47,815 --> 01:05:50,090
Dear President

410
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:56,088
I am eager to know how you
first met Signora Maggi

411
01:05:56,775 --> 01:06:02,168
She will tell you after His Honour
has married his Sergio

412
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:04,811
Then you'll laugh at my expense

413
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:07,485
I won't deprive you of that pleasure

414
01:06:07,975 --> 01:06:13,686
Today's story demands a revision
of our rules

415
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:17,525
If we wish to enjoy the fruit...

416
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,409
...of our stay within these walls...

417
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:25,849
...let us revise some of our rules

418
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:30,649
For example, we put containers in the
latrines to collect all excrement...

419
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:34,405
...so that nothing goes to waste

420
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:39,610
Let's follow Signora Maggi's example,
giving our dear President...

421
01:06:39,975 --> 01:06:44,253
...the joy of seeing his dream
come true

422
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:58,172
Good day, Signora Castelli

423
01:06:58,535 --> 01:07:01,493
I'm sorry, we'll be ready in a moment

424
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,125
I've come to make sure

425
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:06,970
The chamberpots, quick!

426
01:07:49,575 --> 01:07:51,406
You know the rules!

427
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,208
Tell me your name!

428
01:07:55,815 --> 01:07:59,524
I couldn't help it, with the muck
we're given to eat

429
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:01,125
Your name?

430
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:05,170
It's Doris, the most undisciplined
of our girls

431
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:15,285
She will be company for those
already listed here

432
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:40,088
-Whose is this?
-Mine. Help yourself

433
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:44,164
Is that how you obey our rules,
impertinent brat?

434
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:49,493
Show me this boy's arse

435
01:09:03,335 --> 01:09:09,046
You even dared to wipe yourself.
You'll get what you deserve

436
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:25,771
We're ready...

437
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:32,806
...but preparing this one meant that
I couldn't watch these rogues

438
01:09:36,615 --> 01:09:38,685
There is no evasion

439
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,086
Unless the German people fall...

440
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:45,364
...we are prepared for any
eventuality ...

441
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:50,013
...to save a human soul,
even in this part of Africa

442
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:04,326
We are happy to carry out
your every command

443
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:13,054
Those I considered the most
capable...

444
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:16,248
...were fed appropriately

445
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:22,649
Thus as this solemn wedding feast we
shall enjoy the greatest delicacy

446
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:27,772
Our girls abstained from relieving
themselves all day...

447
01:10:28,135 --> 01:10:31,286
...in compliance with your decree...

448
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:35,128
...that we produce this for you

449
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,692
Let the rite begin

450
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:43,130
Our guide restored the divine
character of monstrosity...

451
01:10:43,495 --> 01:10:48,250
...thanks to reiterated actions,
that is to say: rites

452
01:10:49,135 --> 01:10:53,367
No more intoxicating desire exists...

453
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:56,169
...endowing you with the vigour...

454
01:10:56,615 --> 01:10:59,448
...to meet the challenge awaiting you

455
01:11:01,415 --> 01:11:04,885
Eat, my exquisite bride

456
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:11,286
You must prepare for our night
of love

457
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:17,248
Nothing's worse than a breath
without odour

458
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:31,211
I can't do it

459
01:11:31,815 --> 01:11:33,771
Offer it to the Madonna

460
01:11:52,615 --> 01:11:54,173
Do this

461
01:11:56,775 --> 01:12:00,893
Say: "I can't eat rice with
my fingers like this"

462
01:12:02,975 --> 01:12:05,091
Then eat shit

463
01:12:27,775 --> 01:12:32,246
I refer, as you will have guessed...

464
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:36,733
...to our illustrious President

465
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:39,928
After having satisfied him...

466
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:44,732
...I was impressed by such special
tastes in one so young

467
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:51,489
Tastes that will become clearer later

468
01:12:54,455 --> 01:12:56,889
Liberated from my mother...

469
01:12:57,255 --> 01:13:01,771
...I found life rich in all
its delights

470
01:13:06,535 --> 01:13:12,246
One day Madam presented me to
the libertine in question

471
01:13:12,615 --> 01:13:16,733
His passion will strike you
as somewhat unusual

472
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:24,405
The scene took place in his house.
I was shown into a darkened room

473
01:13:26,055 --> 01:13:29,525
I saw a man lying on the bed...

474
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:33,686
...and a coffin in the middle
of the room

475
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:38,166
"You see before you...", he said...

476
01:13:38,855 --> 01:13:41,688
"...a man on his deathbed...

477
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:45,526
"...but he doesn't want to close
his eyes...

478
01:13:45,895 --> 01:13:51,288
"...without making a last homage to
the object of his adoration

479
01:13:51,655 --> 01:13:54,806
"I adore the behind

480
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:59,932
"Although I am dying, I wish to die
kissing one

481
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:05,045
"When life has left my body...

482
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:08,885
"...place me in the coffin...

483
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:13,363
"...wrap me in my shroud and
close the coffin lid

484
01:14:15,335 --> 01:14:19,453
"I insist that you observe my orders
to the letter

485
01:14:19,815 --> 01:14:25,845
"In this supreme moment with the
sole object of my lewd desire

486
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:29,369
"Come quickly!"

487
01:14:29,735 --> 01:14:32,886
He went on, his voice broken, sobbing

488
01:14:33,255 --> 01:14:38,010
"Hurry! I am at death's door"

489
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:43,130
So I went to him and showed him
my backside

490
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:46,965
"Oh, what a marvellous arse

491
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:55,926
"Having seen this, my life can end.
I've never seen one as alluring"

492
01:14:56,615 --> 01:15:01,370
He fondled it, opened it

493
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:07,129
He played with it, kissed it, just as
would the healthiest of men

494
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:13,845
He made me relieve myself of all
that was in my bowels

495
01:15:14,535 --> 01:15:17,368
I was not at all embarrassed

496
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:23,448
"Now it is the time for me to die.
The supreme moment has come"

497
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:30,486
As he said that, he gave
a profound sigh

498
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:47,126
Piss over me

499
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:57,369
I can't, it won't come

500
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:22,811
I've finished

501
01:16:31,015 --> 01:16:34,803
The limitation of love is that
you need an accomplice

502
01:16:35,495 --> 01:16:39,283
Your friend will know the
libertine's refinement...

503
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:43,443
...is being executioner and victim

504
01:16:46,495 --> 01:16:49,851
My sister knew an official
in the Controller's office

505
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:54,003
A little pig-like man,
with a disgusting face

506
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:57,529
A chamberpot was arranged...

507
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:02,013
...for two to sit on, back to back,
and relieve themselves simultaneously

508
01:17:03,335 --> 01:17:06,486
He stirred it with his fingers,
and swallowed it

509
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:10,245
My sister told me...

510
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:14,847
...he'd only to see her dirty arse
and he ejaculated

511
01:17:15,495 --> 01:17:18,646
Did your sister have a
pretty backside?

512
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,810
You must judge by this.
A famous painter...

513
01:17:23,175 --> 01:17:27,293
...was commissioned to paint a Venus
with a splendid backside

514
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:31,126
He selected her as his model
after many weeks...

515
01:17:31,495 --> 01:17:35,932
...looking at hundreds of behinds
throughout ltaly

516
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:39,770
How old was she then?

517
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,332
Fifteen, Duke

518
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:48,853
Why don't you arrange a competition
to find the nicest bottom here?

519
01:17:49,735 --> 01:17:53,523
I'll do that. I'm an expert

520
01:18:01,575 --> 01:18:05,932
Your Excellency, doesn't this
situation suggest anything to you?

521
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,524
It might

522
01:18:08,295 --> 01:18:13,688
-Aren't you ready?
-Just a moment

523
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:20,086
The act of the sodomite signifies
the death of the human species

524
01:18:20,455 --> 01:18:23,128
Ambiguously accepting social
standards while transgressing them

525
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:28,403
More monstrous than the act
of the sodomite...

526
01:18:29,095 --> 01:18:31,529
...is the act of the executioner

527
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:35,650
True, but the act of the sodomite
can be repeated again and again

528
01:18:36,775 --> 01:18:40,973
I think there is a way to repeat
the act of the executioner

529
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:56,172
Turn off the lights

530
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:04,286
Here is my masterpiece

531
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:13,373
I have a proposal to make

532
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:20,526
We have not yet decided on
the winner's prize...

533
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:23,928
...for the best bottom

534
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,935
Here is my proposal

535
01:19:27,255 --> 01:19:32,648
He or she whose bottom is
judged the best...

536
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:35,131
...will be killed immediately

537
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:39,053
Agreed

538
01:19:46,775 --> 01:19:51,530
This way we'll be impartial, not
knowing whose bottom we are viewing

539
01:19:51,895 --> 01:19:56,013
-A shrewd observation
-Thank you, Your Excellency

540
01:19:56,375 --> 01:20:00,812
For if we knew we were looking at
a boy rather than a girl...

541
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:04,008
...we might be influenced
in making our decision

542
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:07,208
We must be completely
free in our choice

543
01:20:08,855 --> 01:20:12,006
A clever trap I wish to avoid

544
01:20:13,335 --> 01:20:18,090
When one prefers men, it is difficult
to change one's perspective

545
01:20:18,775 --> 01:20:21,926
The difference between a boy and
a girl is enormous

546
01:20:22,615 --> 01:20:26,403
One cannot consider what is
obviously inferior

547
01:20:29,015 --> 01:20:32,803
But if we consider all the
stories we have heard...

548
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:37,930
...in certain cases a girl might be
preferable to a boy

549
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:41,768
Let us try to remain objective

550
01:20:42,455 --> 01:20:46,892
Look at the elasticity of
those buttocks

551
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:50,406
There can be no question here

552
01:20:50,775 --> 01:20:52,970
Allow me, Duke

553
01:20:53,335 --> 01:20:58,409
I don't wish to contradict, but may I
re-examine a most impressive one?

554
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,528
We'll be delighted to grant
your request

555
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:05,445
I don't think the heaviness of
these buttocks...

556
01:21:05,815 --> 01:21:10,206
...can be compared to the most
beautiful we have here

557
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:14,085
However, I will yield to the
opinion of the majority

558
01:21:14,455 --> 01:21:16,093
I vote for the Duke's candidate

559
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:20,485
My vote goes to the Duke's
candidate

560
01:21:21,175 --> 01:21:24,326
Dear President, three votes to one

561
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:26,572
I bow to the majority

562
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:32,646
But I request that my candidate
be reserved for me to deflower

563
01:21:33,015 --> 01:21:34,243
Granted

564
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:39,050
We'll reveal this mystery

565
01:21:57,975 --> 01:21:58,885
Fire!

566
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:09,363
You must be stupid to think that
death would be so easy

567
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:13,285
Don't you know we intend to kill you
a thousand times?

568
01:22:13,655 --> 01:22:18,046
To the end of eternity, if eternity
can have an end

569
01:22:19,095 --> 01:22:22,246
Once I had a very mysterious client

570
01:22:24,215 --> 01:22:27,685
His mania was closely related to...

571
01:22:28,055 --> 01:22:33,766
...the subject of Signora Castelli's
stories, for which I apologize

572
01:22:34,135 --> 01:22:36,854
The man wanted only women...

573
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:40,805
...who had been condemned to death

574
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:47,013
The closer they were to death,
the more he would pay

575
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:52,013
He would visit them when the
sentence had been pronounced

576
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:57,449
Thanks to his exalted social status,
enabling him to pay the price...

577
01:22:57,815 --> 01:23:00,648
...not a single one escaped him

578
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:04,931
He did not possess them casually

579
01:23:05,495 --> 01:23:09,932
He insisted on inspecting their rumps
and that they defecated before him

580
01:23:11,255 --> 01:23:16,648
He was convinced that the
tastiest faeces...

581
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:23,685
...were those of women who had just
heard the sentence of death

582
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:29,892
CIRCLE OF BLOOD

583
01:25:04,215 --> 01:25:06,490
Your Reverence, I am ready

584
01:25:07,095 --> 01:25:09,928
We want a marvellous wedding

585
01:25:10,295 --> 01:25:13,093
The President wishes to be first,
he is the most randy

586
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,646
You whoresons!

587
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:36,089
What is this, a mortuary?

588
01:25:36,535 --> 01:25:39,811
These parasites do nothing
for this festive day

589
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:43,333
Do anything you like.
Laugh, all of you

590
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:48,970
Go on, idiots, show how happy
you are

591
01:25:49,335 --> 01:25:51,895
Go on, laugh

592
01:25:54,575 --> 01:25:58,011
Why aren't you yelling forjoy?
Go on, sing!

593
01:26:05,575 --> 01:26:07,406
You two, what are you doing?

594
01:26:07,895 --> 01:26:10,728
Excellency, note their names

595
01:26:13,055 --> 01:26:17,765
If you like to whimper, we'll make
you, for your last few days

596
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:32,803
Shouldn't you have paid your bills,
Monsieur Royale?

597
01:26:33,175 --> 01:26:35,052
Of course, Monsieur Juju

598
01:26:35,415 --> 01:26:38,566
Shouldn't you also pay mine?

599
01:26:38,935 --> 01:26:40,812
Why so?

600
01:26:41,175 --> 01:26:44,008
Because two and two make four
and I'm broke

601
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,570
Earn some money

602
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:51,053
-How do I do that?
-Through manual labour

603
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,292
I don't know how

604
01:26:53,655 --> 01:26:56,806
Then become an actor

605
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:59,370
That's difficult

606
01:26:59,735 --> 01:27:04,365
Try to write then;
all you have to write...

607
01:27:04,855 --> 01:27:06,925
...is any old thing

608
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:18,889
Are you crazy?

609
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:26,169
I have a duty to perform;
I'll return later

610
01:30:26,775 --> 01:30:30,404
Your friend here is ready
whenever you are

611
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:15,124
-Please, may I speak to you?
-Of course, my dear

612
01:32:15,575 --> 01:32:16,690
What will you do to me?

613
01:32:17,175 --> 01:32:21,134
Talk about that tomorrow;
many things will be decided then

614
01:32:21,655 --> 01:32:25,443
I know a secret. Someone is
violating your law

615
01:32:25,815 --> 01:32:28,534
Graziella had a photograph
under her pillow

616
01:33:19,575 --> 01:33:20,894
Give me that photograph

617
01:33:41,095 --> 01:33:44,804
Spare me and I'll tell you
what Eva and Antoniska do

618
01:33:45,815 --> 01:33:47,692
They're breaking your laws

619
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:24,253
Don't kill me. I have secrets
to tell you

620
01:34:24,855 --> 01:34:26,891
Speak, dirty whore!

621
01:34:27,415 --> 01:34:29,804
Every night Ezio goes to the
black servant girl

622
01:34:30,615 --> 01:34:32,731
I can take you there

623
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:25,452
Queers!

624
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:28,213
You make me puke

625
01:37:15,575 --> 01:37:18,885
Those who are named will wear
a sky blue ribbon

626
01:37:19,255 --> 01:37:21,450
You can imagine what that means

627
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:26,331
Others, if they collaborate, are
reprieved. They will return to Salo

628
01:37:26,935 --> 01:37:29,210
What are you going to do to us?

629
01:37:29,815 --> 01:37:33,933
You'll soon know the gravity
of your crimes

630
01:37:48,535 --> 01:37:51,686
The main character...

631
01:37:52,055 --> 01:37:56,810
...figured in a number of
the previous stories

632
01:37:57,175 --> 01:38:00,963
He is forty, very powerfully built...

633
01:38:01,335 --> 01:38:03,849
...with a member like a stallion

634
01:38:04,855 --> 01:38:10,566
He is enormously rich,
very powerful, very cruel

635
01:38:11,895 --> 01:38:14,090
A heart of stone

636
01:38:15,415 --> 01:38:21,047
He owns a house near Milan, which
he uses exclusively for his pleasure

637
01:38:30,775 --> 01:38:34,450
At his parties, at least fifteen
young girls are present...

638
01:38:34,935 --> 01:38:37,449
...aged from fifteen to seventeen

639
01:38:37,815 --> 01:38:43,845
Those who are chosen must present
themsleves completely naked

640
01:38:44,215 --> 01:38:49,289
He touches them, caresses them,
examines them...

641
01:38:49,655 --> 01:38:54,092
...then makes them defecate into his
mouth, but he does not swallow it

642
01:38:57,015 --> 01:39:00,166
After these first rituals,
with fearsome gravity...

643
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:03,450
...he brands each girl
on the shoulder...

644
01:39:04,055 --> 01:39:07,013
...burning a number into
their tender flesh

645
01:39:08,215 --> 01:39:12,333
After these preliminaries,
he opens the window...

646
01:39:12,695 --> 01:39:18,725
...and places a girl standing in the
middle of the room, facing the window

647
01:39:20,695 --> 01:39:25,132
Then gives such a powerful kick
to her behind...

648
01:39:25,495 --> 01:39:29,283
...that the poor thing flies across
the room...

649
01:39:29,655 --> 01:39:34,206
...through the window and vanishes
into a dark cellar

650
01:39:44,695 --> 01:39:50,725
Our hero is familiar not only with
Nietzsche, but Huysmans as well

651
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:57,773
In the cellar, a masked executioner
with the devil's emblems...

652
01:39:58,135 --> 01:40:03,528
...presides gravely over the
horrible machines

653
01:40:03,895 --> 01:40:07,683
When all the girls are in
the cellar, our hero...

654
01:40:10,935 --> 01:40:16,851
...is highly aroused, having so many
contacts without once ejaculating

655
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:23,690
Naked, his huge member jutting
from his belly

656
01:40:26,615 --> 01:40:31,052
Now all the machines have begun
to function...

657
01:40:31,415 --> 01:40:37,445
...all tortures at once, with
terrifyingly loud screeching

658
01:40:41,695 --> 01:40:45,131
The first apparatus is a huge wheel
with razor blades...

659
01:40:45,495 --> 01:40:49,283
...to which is bound a girl
to be flayed alive

660
01:40:52,535 --> 01:40:56,972
Another has a live rat sewed
inside her vagina

661
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:33,014
Oh Lord, why hast thou foresaken us?

662
01:41:48,215 --> 01:41:51,048
A rationalperson...

663
01:41:51,735 --> 01:41:54,886
...is not content to kill
the same person

664
01:41:55,255 --> 01:42:00,329
He would recommend murdering
as many as possible

665
01:44:52,855 --> 01:44:54,732
Umberto, come here

666
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,213
Bravo, always ready

667
01:47:03,775 --> 01:47:07,529
What does a Bolshevik do when
he dives into the Red Sea?

668
01:47:08,535 --> 01:47:12,005
You don't know what a Bolshevik does?

669
01:47:12,695 --> 01:47:13,764
No, tell me

670
01:47:14,295 --> 01:47:15,614
He goes splash!

671
01:47:18,335 --> 01:47:22,647
Poetry Corner. Ezra Pound.
The Cantos

672
01:47:26,015 --> 01:47:28,654
Canto 99

673
01:47:30,655 --> 01:47:34,443
The whole tribe is from
one man's body

674
01:47:34,695 --> 01:47:39,086
What other way can you think of it?

675
01:47:39,695 --> 01:47:41,413
The surname and the nine arts

676
01:47:42,775 --> 01:47:45,209
The father's word is compassion

677
01:47:45,975 --> 01:47:48,170
The son's, devotion

678
01:47:54,695 --> 01:48:00,133
Small birds sing in chorus. Harmony
is in the proportion of branches

679
01:48:21,815 --> 01:48:27,845
The gay face of spring
is set before the world

680
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:41,286
The sharpness of winter
now flees defeated

681
01:48:50,935 --> 01:48:56,965
In various apparel Flora reigns

682
01:48:59,255 --> 01:49:02,372
And in the euphony of the woods...

683
01:49:02,775 --> 01:49:05,528
...she is hymned in song

684
01:50:55,095 --> 01:50:56,494
Can you dance?

685
01:50:58,215 --> 01:50:59,204
Let's try

686
01:51:30,295 --> 01:51:32,809
-What's your girlfriend's name?
-Margherita
