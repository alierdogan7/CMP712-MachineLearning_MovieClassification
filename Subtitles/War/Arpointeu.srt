Donkey three was your unit, right?

17
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,599
No, it's not possible.

18
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,105
My men are all dead!

19
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:29,409
Then how is that
they sent a transmission 3 days ago!

20
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,882
And it's the 3rd time this month!

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,780
Who the fuck sent
the transmissions then?

22
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,091
I swear, they're all dead!

23
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,791
I collected their tags myself.

24
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,199
With these hands!

25
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,107
Who did this to you? Viet Con?

26
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,681
There are no fucking Viet Con in R Point!

27
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:11,381
I watched all of them fucking die!

28
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,399

this is a paradise!

00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,407

00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,013
Lieutenant CHOI!

31
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,477
- Hello, how are you?
- Alright.

32
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,984
Damn, she's hot!

33
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,498
Sleep.

34
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,412
Don't shoot.

35
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,993
Private KIM!

36
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,802
Fuck, I saw this coming!

37
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,794
I'll take it.

38
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,001
It came earlier than I expected.

39
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,509
Investigation Division, yes sir!

40
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,310
He's here, sir.

41
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,781
Two damn decorations!

42
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,687
You're an excellent soldier CHOI.

43
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,886
And the only survivor of
the battle at Honbawoo...

44
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,795
I heard you're ill.

45
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,495
I'm fine now.
I'll be released in 2 days.

46
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,703
Have some tea.
It's Ho Chi Minh's favorite.

47
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,210
No, thank you, sir.

48
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,177
You never go to battle
without shedding some blood...

49
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,783
whether it's yours or the enemy's.

50
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:02,384
That's why no one likes
being in your platoon, right?

<i>Confidential</i>

52
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,595
This is a list of the men
who went missing 6 months ago.

53
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,714
This case requires
a competent leader like you.

54
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,987
I'd like to have my old platoon back.

55
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,193
According to us, yesterday's
incident never happened.

56
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,698
Is this an order?

57
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,798
Congratulations on
being back in the fight.

58
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,278
What the...! That's disgusting!

59
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,289
Move your hands!

60
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,498
He's clean.

61
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,503
What're you here for?

62
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,279
I traded my medical
certificate for 50 bucks.

63
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,479
Why?

64
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,089
50 bucks is enough to buy a cow.

65
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,890
And I want to buy my mom one.

66
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,591
A fucking cow.

67
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,799
Sergeant JANG, 18 years old?

68
00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:00,606
That means you were recruited at 16?

69
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,575
16?

70
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,979
Yes, sir.

71
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,485
The recruitment documents
were issued to my old brother...

72
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,183
And I used them to enlist,
without my family knowing.

73
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,190
He's a fucking kid?

74
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,594
He fooled us all?

75
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,098
You saying a fucking kid

76
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:27,002
like that's the same rank as me!

77
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,304
- What's going on?
- Can't go home until we get cleaned up.

78
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,608
What's the fucking big deal.
So we got syphilis?

79
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,878
My family's expecting to see me
at the port!

80
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,483
No need to give you a long speech.

81
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,886
Once again,

82
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,994
the region you're
assigned to is a non-combat zone.

83
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,394
- A fucking 'non-combat' zone!
- If you complete the mission...

84
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,991
You're going home on fucking "plane".

85
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,003
Remember, it' a plane, not a ship.

86
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,502
You'll have hot stewardesses
serving you juice, get it?

87
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,177
Sergeant PARK, I'm in!

88
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,183
Corporal BYUN!

89
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,789
Sergeant OH!

90
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,286
Double check all your gear!

91
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,796
- Attention!
- Attention!

92
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,503
Salute, sir,

93
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,900
- I'm Sergeant JIN!
- CHOI Tae-in, First Lieutenant!

94
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,401
These are the men, sir.

95
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,002
- Attention.
- That's alright. At ease.

96
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,772
At ease.

97
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,981
- When are we going?
- Just relax, man.

98
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:55,685
You know that bastard!

99
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,989
You mean, Sergeant JIN?

100
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,293
He's a cold blooded killer.
Been here for 3 years and...

101
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,994
I've seen a picture of him
holding a VC soldier's head cut off!

102
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:08,698
You dumb ass!
Everybody does that crap here!

103
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,003
Have you?

104
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,103
Damn right, was no big deal.
Nothing scares me!

105
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,483
Cut that fucking racket out!

106
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,688
Just a few days away
from going home too.

107
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,288
Fuck.

108
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,396
Pisses me off.

109
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:43,304
It's not looking good.
We got a moron and a psycopath!

110
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,003
We're fucking doomed!

111
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:55,782
I'll be back in a week!
Hear me!

112
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,091
You believe this fucking weather.

113
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,389
It's my first time on a ship!

114
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,091
You were a pen pusher, right?
No, then what missions...

115
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,977
How about a souvenir photo!

116
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,681
Sounds good!
Damn good idea!

117
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,686
You think you're here
on a picnic or something?

118
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:45,099
- No, sir.
- Why not? Let's do it.

119
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,507
Sure, it's damn good!

120
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,009
Just wait!

121
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:58,781
Here we go, one, two, three!

122
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,579
<i>R- POINT: Day 1</i>

123
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,699
These fucking mosquitoes!

124
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:54,102
Damn, I'm missing
the welcome home party at Pusan!

125
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,091
Cease fire!

126
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,390
Cease fire!

127
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,381
It's coming from 11:00.

128
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,298
Sergeant JANG,
get the fuck out of there!

129
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,096
- I can't.
- Move, son of a bitch!

130
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,305
Run like hell, on my count! 1, 2, 3!

131
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,574
1, 2...

132
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,597
Corporal JOH, give it to me!

133
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,407
Cover me!

134
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,799
These bastards have been dead for ages.

135
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,580
Search her.

136
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,898
What's this?

137
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,196
If you touch a dead person's things,
your fingers'll rot off.

138
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,404
I just had a look!

139
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,610
Take care of her.

140
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,185
You fucking baby!
You can't do it, can you?

141
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,191
Corporal LEE, finish her.

142
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,591
You pussy.
Don't get the balls, huh?

143
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,998
Let me do this.

144
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,297
Move out.

145
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,201
Sergeant JIN, take the lead.

146
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,299
This is where R-Point begins.

147
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,106
Let's take a break.

148
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,208
Break time

149
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,704
- We almost there?
- Yeah.

150
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,814
Give me a smoke then.

151
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,380
What? A gravestone!

152
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,684
What does... it say?

153
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,292
Hey, read it out aloud.

154
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,396
How weird! I don't like this.

155
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,296
There used to be a lake here.

156
00:18:54,433 --> 00:19:00,394
Cut the crap!
There's nothing but trees.

157
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,499
"Hundreds of years ago,
the Chinese killed Vietnamese

158
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,612
and dumped them into the lake."

159
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:12,581
"After that they filled the lake
and built a temple on it."

160
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,586
Bullshit! You lying son of a bitch!

161
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,180
That's why it's so foggy.

162
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,785
Wherever you go, I'll be there.

163
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,490
"If you have blood on your hands..."

164
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,906
I can't read the rest.

165
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,303
You're a fucking story teller.

166
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,604
No, he's right.

167
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,581
Let's go.

168
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,480
Let's go.

169
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,687
This shit's creepy!

170
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,591
What the...?
"bloody hand are"...what?

171
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,095
I've had blood on my hands, so what?

172
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,699
- Hey, Corporal LEE!
- What?

173
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,393
- Don't disrespect it.
- Don't be a pussy,

174
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,300
I ain't afraid of shit.

175
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,002
- Hey asshole, wait up!
- Hurry!

176
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,705
<i>"Can't go back!"</i>

177
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,101
Sergeant PARK!
You're in the military band, right?

178
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,102
Mr. Sex Machine PARK is
all dried up in Vietnam.

179
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,182
So you blow... the bugle or what?

180
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:55,980
You idiot! "the bugle"?

181
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,783
It's called a Saxophone!

182
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:03,293
If you play one of those,
you can't get it up, right?

183
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,791
What asshole said that?

184
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,495
My cock's got more power
than any of yours!

185
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:15,096
That's why all the hot bitches
wanna fuck me.

186
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,609
There isn't a single vocalist
in Korea I haven't screwed.

187
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,306
I'm the god father of the bitches!

188
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,579
You wanna stand up and
let the fuckers know we're here?

189
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,482
No, sir.

190
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,983
One, two, one, two...

191
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,689
Butterfly, come in.
Mole three has met Romeo, over.

192
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,594
Butterfly.

193
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,096
Hand it over when you get through.

194
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,700
Why are you cutting up your clothes?

195
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,512
No idea why I'm doing this!
Never been on a mission, right?

196
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,181
We believe we can survive
by doing this!

197
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,996
Sorry, sir.

198
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,496
What a nutcase.

199
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,605
What did you do
before coming to Vietnam?

200
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,606
It might freak you out.

201
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,679
- I washed corpses.
- No shit!

202
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,279
He means it.

203
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,289
Don't try to fuck with me!

204
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,394
His father's an undertaker.

205
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,487
You saw, him reading
Chinese characters well.

206
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,397
'Cause they use Chinese
characters a lot in that line,

207
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,104
Is he serious?

208
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,208
Yes, sir.

209
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,681
I got strange feeling.
Something's not right here.

210
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,385
What do you mean?

211
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:16,788
No sunshine, it's damp
with moisture, and foggy.

212
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,499
It's not a good place for graves.

213
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,596
It isn't good for people
living or dead, except maybe...

214
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,810
Except who?

215
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,680
Well, there must be some.

216
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,286
I'm asking you, "who"?

217
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,691
Ghosts.

218
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,793
Cut the crap, you son of a bitch!

219
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:02,397
I'm out of here.
How about you?

220
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,502
Hey, wait up!

221
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,586
Corporal JOH!

222
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:24,287
Wait up! You assholes!

223
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,402
Salute!

224
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:42,411
You scared the hell out of me,
you idiot!

225
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,589
Lieutenant,

226
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,193
It's working now.

227
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,908
Mole three, come in Butterfly.

228
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,379
Donkey Three has met Romeo.
We've reached the check point.

229
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,985
Our coordinates are D270W279

230
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,289
We are in section R5,

231
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,991
reporting at 06:30. And from 07:00...

232
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,289
Room one first floor, clear.

233
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,084
Basement, clear!

234
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,883
Fucking made in the USA.

235
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,594
It's a piece of shit, here.

236
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,499
What this...

237
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,907
- Come on!
- Hey, wait up!

238
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,675
Our mission is to find

239
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,683
their whereabouts,
dead or alive!

240
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:12,882
The surrounding area covering 3.5 km

241
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,185
from this spot is "R-Point".

242
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,489
This region is considered

243
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,997
to be "sacred" to the Vietnamese.

244
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:27,298
Remember, we only have 7 days
to complete our mission, and cleanly.

245
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,203
We'll move in 2 units.

246
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,105
What battalion did
the missing men belong to?

247
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,680
- It's fucking irrelevant to you!
- Battalion 53!

248
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,478
Battalion 5... 3?

249
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,585
You're from the 53rd, right.
You know them then?

250
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,183
Bullshit! I don't know
fuck all about them.

251
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,696
Today, Sergeant JIN's unit is
scouting R-5,

252
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,890
the rest of you search this area.

253
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,694
Move! The sooner

254
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,497
you find them the sooner
you go home.

255
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:06,201
It's been long enough for them
to turn into ghosts or something by now.

256
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,683
Damn!

257
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:41,806
We're basically
a bunch of chumps, right Sergeant OH?

258
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,177
Sergeant OH?

259
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,983
Sergeant OH!

260
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,586
Sergeant OH,

261
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,994
Where are you?

262
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,306
Sergeant OH!

263
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:15,404
This isn't funny, quit it!

264
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,805
Sergeant OH!
How many times I call...

265
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,504
You freaked me out!
Why didn't you answer me?

266
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,375
<i>Jung-Suk, wait for me</i>

267
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,184
Are you listening to me?

268
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,982
Quit messing with me!

269
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,095
I don't like this shit, sir!

270
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,700
Corporal LEE!

271
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,081
Let's take a break.

272
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,791
What are you eating?

273
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,998
What're you grubbing on?

274
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,400
You fucking brat!

275
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:25,601
Here, have all you want.
It's antibiotics you asshole.

276
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:31,375
Fuck you! For your information,
it's doesn't help.

277
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,878
What? Missing?

278
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:41,288
Give me the map.
What's your location?

279
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,994
Got it.

280
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,396
We're heading for R-6,
we'll meet up there!

281
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,702
Corporal JOH!

282
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,011
Corporal JOH!

283
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,680
Corporal JOH!

284
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:22,795
We're here to find the missing men
and one of us is missing? Shit!

285
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,712
It's so creepy!

286
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,388
What's this smell?

287
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,484
I almost shot you!

288
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,091
You came out of nowhere!

289
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,397
- Have you found him?
- Not yet, sir.

290
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,978
Lieutenant!

291
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,261
I'm telling the truth!

292
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,493
- You asshole!
- Sergeant JIN!

293
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,908
The Lieutenant saved
your ass, you're lucky.

294
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,480
Alright, we've got lights!

295
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,693
What?

296
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,697
"Jung-sook, wait for me"
is written on your helmet, right?

297
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,298
What'd you say?

298
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:43,003
Have you fucking lost it?

299
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,403
What's your problem?

300
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,173
What're you doing?

301
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,273
Cut the "Jung-sook" shit out!

302
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,181
I'm right, ain't I?

303
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,985
You son of a bitch!

304
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,492
What's going on?

305
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,606
Who are those bastards?

306
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,376
What? Yankees?

307
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,983
How come they're here this late?

308
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,087
Stay calm.

309
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,193
I'm Sergeant First Class Beck from C&E.

310
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,696
I'm Lieutenant CHOI.

311
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,801
Anyway, what made you
come up here at night?

312
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,394
We can only come up here at night,
Lieutenant.

313
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,600
We can't operate the chopper
in the day because of fog.

314
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,602
We usually come up here
every four days to check the batteries.

315
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,075
Is that your camp, Lieutenant?

316
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:06,486
Why? Is this building
your governmental property?

317
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,593
I ain't got nothing to do with
the mother fucking U. S government

318
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,490
Let me tell you guys something.

319
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,996
Keep your rusty dick beaters
off my shit in this room.

320
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,792
Don't worry.

321
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,299
What made you come up here?

322
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,908
We came up to look for my soldiers.

323
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,273
You gotta be shitting me... right?

324
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:36,375
We came to find our soldiers who've been
missing for the last six months.

325
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,890
You know it was a retreat for French soldiers.

326
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,084
Yeah, a retreat for French soldiers.

327
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,788
Fuck, a lot of French soldiers were
exterminated here.

328
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,292
It all happened so fast.

329
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,894
But I can sure as hell tell you one thing,
it wasn't the VC that did it.

330
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,404
Hell during that time the VCs didn't exist.

331
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,407
There's nothing alive here in R-point.

332
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,275
Neither ROK soldiers nor
VCs can survive here.

333
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,584
What do you mean by that?

334
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,686
You haven't heard the rumors
about this place?

335
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,481
What rumors?

336
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,584
Don't worry about it.

337
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,685
Hey, good bye guys!

338
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,796
Hey Sergeant, don't waste your time
on these fools.

339
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,592
- Goodbye, come again
- Let's go

340
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,999
Thanks for the beer.

341
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,001
Hey come on Sergeant,
let's go.

342
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,596
You know why my soldiers
are urging me?

343
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,611
They wanna make a bet
as soon as possible.

344
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,108
Bet?

345
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:41,184
That in four days when we
come back, you won't still be alive.

346
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,880
- What do you mean?
- I already told you. This is R-point.

347
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,890
No one can survive.
Let me make myself clear.

348
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:53,690
Don't touch my shit on the 2nd floor.

349
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:59,294
By the way, good luck.
You're gonna need it, Lieutenant.

350
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,183
Salute!

351
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,376
- Have a drink.
- No, thank You, sir.

352
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,683
- Sit down and drink.
- thank You, sir.

353
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,386
Hey, I found this, try and fix it.

354
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,495
- You think You can?
- Sure, sir.

355
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,600
You can?

356
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,202
Salute!

357
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,701
Is it working?

358
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,806
Local transmissions are fine,

359
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,408
but not with headquarters.

360
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,602
- Is the transmitter fine?
- Yes.

361
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,977
By the way, is a French
unit stationed nearby?

362
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,984
French army?

363
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,879
I got a transmission from Jacques...
A French army corporal

364
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:59,394
He said that he's in the army
with his twin brother Paul.

365
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,398
What the hell are you talking about?
We're the only ones in this area.

366
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,402
No, he said his unit
is stationed nearby and...

367
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,803
that he's dropping by sometime soon.

368
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,710
You speak French?

369
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,776
- No, sir.
- Are you trying to mess with Lieutenant?

370
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,474
Get some more sleep.

371
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,382
Watch it, kid.

372
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,783
Come here, you son of a bitch!

373
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,792
- What's with you?
- You asshole!

374
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,098
You were fucking lie, right?

375
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,396
About what?

376
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,597
About the helmet shit!

377
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,903
"Jung-sook, wait for me"?
Yeah, it was yours, right?

378
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,482
Who the fuck told you about that?

379
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,675
About that? About what?

380
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,186
How did you know
that bastard came to Vietnam?

381
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,988
Got no idea what you're talking about!

382
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,393
You sneaky shit.
How come you knew the helmet story?

383
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,991
What's with you?
I saw it myself!

384
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,003
Not more bullshit, you bitch!

385
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,801
No way, it's not possible.

386
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,380
Don't even think about
messing with me! Spit it out!

387
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,177
Are you fucking drunk? I've had
enough of this shit already!

388
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,481
Tell me the damn truth,
come on!

389
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:40,386
That helmet belongs to...
one of bastards missing here.

390
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,392
The ones we're here for.

391
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:49,896
How many more nights do we gotta get
through, if we survive tonight?

392
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,306
Five nights, sir.

393
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,606
No sweat!
We got shit to worry about!

394
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,772
Just 5 fucking nights?
I'm gonna make it for sure!

395
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,583
What's that?

396
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,486
Oh, the Ventures!

397
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,988
You fixed it?

398
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,403
Oh, baby, the Ventures!
Come on!

399
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,507
We're fucking dying!

400
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,294
Fuck!

401
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,082
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>

402
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,381
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>
<i>I don't...</i>

403
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:16,084
<i>No, No!</i>

404
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:35,308
Damn! I still got the goose bumps.

405
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,371
What the fuck was that anyway?

406
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,380
You think I got a clue?

407
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,077
Shit head!

408
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,087
What're you doing?

409
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:56,791
I got a question.
What's that stench you always got?

410
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,402
What the fuck are you talking about!

411
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:03,097
If I stink, you smell like shit!

412
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:09,108
- No, something's going on!
- What?

413
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,373
You're posted in the kitchen!

414
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,279
You've crossed the fucking line jerk.

415
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,979
You realize you're insulting he king of
dangerous missions in Vietnam?

416
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,087
- What a joke! Sergeant Cook?
- What?

417
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,093
This is some news!
Everybody's gotta know.

418
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,096
If you do,
I'll kill you asshole.

419
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:31,201
Oh, you will?
Alright, go ahead.

420
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,001
What? You scared?

421
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,798
Hey!

422
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,380
- Just do me a favor.
- What?

423
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
I'm begging you.

424
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,187
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>

425
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,892
<i>I don't</i>
<i>No, No!</i>

426
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,301
What is it you got there?

427
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,410
Damn, what's the problem?

428
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,275
- I'm asking you!
- My daughter's photo, so what?

429
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:22,181
- Let me see.
- You're such an asshole.

430
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:28,690
She's the most beautiful thing
in the world!

431
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,391
How is it that you've syphilis
with such a cute kid back home?

432
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,295
You fucking loser!

433
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:41,393
Watch your mouth, kid!

434
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:47,306
You'd have to have joined up
earlier if you wanna talk shit.

435
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,882
If you say one word, you're dead!

436
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,782
I'm not fucking joking, got it?

437
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,087
What's that?

438
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,792
Hey, Private JUNG!

439
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,193
Private JUNG!

440
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,894
That jerk doesn't show any respect!

441
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,193
<i>R- POINT: Day 2</i>

442
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,996
Kitchen duty, huh?

443
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,592
How come you know that shit?

444
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:50,102
We're sure lucky to have
you around!

445
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,707
Yes, sir.

446
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,709
Once a cook,
forever a cook.

447
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,973
Don't move,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

448
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,676
- Breakfast please.
- I'm hungry.

449
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,084
Sir, Private JUNG's missing!

450
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:10,286
He's supposed to be on duty
from 6:00, but...

451
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,793
- You should've reported it earlier.
- I'm doing now, sir!

452
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,397
Son of a bitch!

453
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,303
Fuck Sergeant JIN!
To hell with him!

454
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:33,974
Just 2 weeks away from being
discharged. I'm screwed!

455
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,784
Does it hurt?

456
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:48,995
Hey. Go and take
one more look around.

457
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,496
- You mean alone?
- I'm not in the mood right now.

458
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,905
I promise to hook you up
with a hot chick back in Seoul.

459
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,081
- You're not lying right?
- You got my fucking word...

460
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,884
- What's this?
- I believe you, all right?

461
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,085
Don't worry about it,
just do your job.

462
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:24,895
When I'm back in Seoul...
Leave to the sex machine PARK.

463
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,304
You're gonna hook me up
with a hot chick?

464
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,906
What's up?

465
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,692
- Viet cons are around.
- we getting through to headquarters yet?

466
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,391
Sorry, sir, not yet.

467
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,196
Lieutenant!

468
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:38,400
Our mission is to find the missing men.
Keep that in mind.

469
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,102
- Sergeant OH.
- Yes, sir!

470
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,406
You're curious, aren't you?

471
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,070
Yes, sir?

472
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,979
I want to have a look at
his face.

473
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,881
What... sir?

474
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,583
- Set up a booby trap, kid.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:39,091
Everything's fucked up,
around here.

476
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,204
What is?

477
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,206
Just do your job, corpse cleaner.

478
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,581
- Where was he from?
- You mean... Private JUNG?

479
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:11,798
When you were out scouting
with him... Did he say anything?

480
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:16,504
Was he in our unit?
I don't remember.

481
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,302
Which battalion did he belong to?

482
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:29,984
Hey, kid!
Give this to the Lieutenant.

483
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:36,183
Poor kid! Whatever happens,

484
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,784
- we're gonna get back alive!
- What the fuck?

485
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:46,291
Hey, you son of a bitch...
get me Captain PARK!

486
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,501
Make it quick asshole!

487
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,700
<i>- Captain PARK here!</i>
- Lieutenant CHOI, sir!

488
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,473
<i>Are you fucking with me?</i>

489
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,174
What do you mean, sir?

490
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,184
<i>Are you screwing this mission up?</i>

491
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:08,480
<i>Private JUNG's one of</i>
<i>the missing men!</i>

492
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,183
What?

493
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,990
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>have you fucking lost it!</i>

494
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,090
<i>Listen to me!</i>

495
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,795
<i>JUNG is one of the men</i>
<i>you're there to look for!</i>

496
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,701
I don't understand, sir.

497
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,001
<i>You fucking idiot...?</i>

498
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:31,171
<i>How many are in your unit now?</i>

499
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,774
We got one down, and 9 left, sir.

500
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,582
<i>You're fucking</i>
<i>out of your mind for sure.</i>

501
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,990
<i>You started the mission with 9,</i>
<i>got it?</i>

502
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,894
<i>I have the mission file in front of me</i>
<i>right now, you were 9 to start!</i>

503
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,593
<i>- You mean you picked up a ghost?</i>
- You're joking right?

504
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:58,902
<i>Do I sound like I'm fucking joking?</i>
<i>Give me Sergeant JIN!</i>

505
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:07,279
<i>Are you listening to me,</i>
<i>Lieutenant CHOI?</i>

506
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,686
It's bizarre, but...

507
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,989
I don't remember his face.

508
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,194
I mean Private JUNG.

509
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:26,999
He was with us, at the dock, right?

510
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,105
What?

511
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:35,610
He wasn't with us from the start...

512
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,680
but I remember
he was there at the beach.

513
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,480
You dumb ass,
what're you talking about?

514
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:49,490
He was with us
when we were taking the picture.

515
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:54,093
I don't remember
seeing him at the dock.

516
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:58,590
Good, I wanna be in it too.

517
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,101
Okay, one more time!

518
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,706
You take the it.

519
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,875
You know how to use
the camera?

520
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:14,279
Wind it.

521
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,890
Enough already, I don't
wanna hear any more!

522
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,996
Sergeant OH!

523
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,600
Did you get it yet?

524
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,301
Be patient,
I'll get it in a couple of days.

525
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,176
You take care of this.

526
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:56,377
Make sure you get it. You know
it's for my girl, Jung-sook.

527
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:02,583
I'm sick of your Jung-sook stories.

528
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:06,890
Aren't you going on a mission?

529
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,691
Hey, hurry up!

530
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,993
Take care.

531
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,289
See you soon!

532
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,791
<i>Jung-sook, wait for me.</i>

533
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,079
You think those assholes
can handle it on there own sir?

534
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,581
That's why I put you on the mission.

535
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,586
Do whatever it takes
to close the case clean.

536
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,996
<i>R- POINT: Day 3</i>

537
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:51,383
You knew the whole time, didn't you!

538
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,897
Cut it out!

539
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,900
Where're you going?

540
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,299
Going to shit, god damnit!

541
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,578
A lot of French soldiers were
exterminated here

542
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,981
It all happened so fast.

543
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,102
I got a transmission
from Jacques and...

544
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:12,696
<i>Paul and Jacques rest in</i>
<i>peace here.</i>

545
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,505
he said his twin brother Paul
is in the same army.

546
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,398
Don't touch it!

547
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,505
You like this camera,
don't you?

548
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,802
You got no idea how much
I paid for it?

549
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,707
It cost me 4 months salary.

550
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,874
But I know it's not yours.

551
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,986
You got it without getting
one drop of blood on your hands?

552
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,292
You mother fucker!

553
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,695
Who are you?

554
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,799
He's on the edge.

555
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,802
Oh, no!
You're dead, it can't be you!

556
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,400
I saw the photo.

557
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,409
Why didn't you tell them
he was one of the missing...

558
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,104
I don't care whether
he's fucking missing or not.

559
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,281
- Don't tell the men about it.
- What?

560
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,182
We need to get them back alive.

561
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,891
It's the booby trap!

562
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,394
- No...
- Sergeant OH!

563
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:59,501
Believe me,
I didn't do it on purpose.

564
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:03,009
He must have triggered the trap.

565
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,173
Hang on, Sergeant OH!

566
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:10,376
What happened?
Snap out of it!

567
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,381
Sergeant OH!

568
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:22,195
- Come on!
- Oh, please, don't kill me, I'm begging you.

569
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:28,099
I didn't mean to lie...
Forgive me!

570
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,999
What're you doing?

571
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,203
Save me!

572
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,077
I'm sorry!

573
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,694
Something's going on.

574
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:35,202
There's gotta be something
they're not telling us.

575
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,000
Ghosts!

576
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,977
R-point's fucking haunted!

577
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,980
You fucking idiot!
Fucking 'Ghosts'?

578
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,696
Look around!
Open your eyes.

579
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,697
You see any fucking ghosts?

580
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,594
You son of a bitch.

581
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,699
All you got to do is...

582
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:16,209
find the missing radio
operator's tags, got it!

583
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:25,279
Any of you say a word
about this ghost shit,

584
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,083
and you'll be thrown in jail.

585
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,995
What're you gonna do, sir?

586
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,404
Why don't we abort this mission?

587
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,305
You think they'll believe
this fucking story?

588
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:59,386
But we can't lie to
our men forever.

589
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,887
All we need is to find any clue
about the radio operator?

590
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,093
Sorry, but it doesn't
look like it's possible.

591
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,262
We'll scout this region
from the spot we arrived.

592
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,029
Alright, then.

593
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:19,597
We should split into two groups
instead of one.

594
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:25,778
Looks like we're all
on different pages,

595
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,679
some like playing ball
and some don't.

596
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,991
<i>R- POINT: Day 4</i>

597
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,476
Fall in.

598
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:07,285
Give a status report every 30 minutes.

599
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,483
Once again, today
we're covering R-5 and R-2.

600
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,389
Under no circumstances will you stray

601
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,396
from your designated zones, got it?

602
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,397
Yes, sir.

603
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,104
Break into 2 teams.

604
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,900
Yes, sir!

605
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:33,279
- You bugle player!
- Yes, sir!

606
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,384
- And you!
- Yes, sir.

607
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,383
Get in this line.

608
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,582
I want to be in your unit, sir!

609
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,492
I do, too, sir!

610
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,996
You fucking pussies.
You think this is a game?

611
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,199
I want one more asshole!

612
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,405
I'm ordering you, one more!

613
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,478
Enough.

614
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,978
Move out.

615
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,091
Isn't this the way we took before?

616
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:22,595
- Let's go to bamboo woods.
- Why, sir?

617
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,400
I need to check out something.

618
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:57,799
Sergeant JIN!

619
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,401
- This is R-7, sir.
- I know.

620
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:04,097
- But Lieutenant told us not to stray from...
- Shut up and come with me.

621
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,386
Sergeant JIN!

622
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,789
This must be the Lieutenant's.

623
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:48,177
Search this area, now!

624
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,985
What the hell are you doing?

625
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:02,891
You screwed us up, Lieutenant!

626
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:19,472
Corporal BYUN,
look around over here.

627
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,379
We don't have time, move!

628
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:28,183
What we need are tags
from one of the missing men.

629
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:37,990
Sergeant!

630
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,084
Why isn't the woods coming up?

631
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:02,281
We should've reached it by now.

632
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,388
What the hell's going on?

633
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,595
What does it say?

634
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,701
Hey Cook, you can read it, right?

635
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,703
You know?

636
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,799
"...can't go back"?

637
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:29,377
Who can't go back?

638
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:33,886
Lieutenant, is it true?

639
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,686
Does that thing really say
"...can't go back"

640
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,985
Mole three, come in
Mole one, do you copy?

641
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,892
Mole one, do you copy?

642
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,998
Mole three, come in Mole one,
come in.

643
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,293
Mole three, come in Mole one.

644
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,095
Mole three, Mole one, do you copy?

645
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,775
Sergeant JIN, Where're you going?

646
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:04,875
I'll be right back. Keep trying
to get the reach the Lieutenant.

647
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,379
Lieutenant!

648
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:40,179
Aren't these...
the Yankees we met?

649
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:45,983
What the hell's going on!

650
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:49,579
Then we met their fucking corpses?

651
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,784
Hey, Cook, tell me the truth.

652
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,488
Are these the fuckers we met?

653
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:01,799
Lieutenant, does that mean
we're fighting against ghosts?

654
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,700
Get me Sergeant JIN on the line!

655
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:07,297
- What're we gonna...?
- Send the transmission!

656
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,485
Mole one,
come in Mole three.

657
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,681
Mole three, do you copy?

658
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,087
It's dead.

659
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,693
Head back to base, on the double!

660
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:33,791
Sergeant JIN! Sergeant!

661
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,502
Sergeant JIN!

662
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:48,174
Where're you?

663
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,285
What the hell is this here for!

664
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,282
Which means...

665
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,892
He fell off here, damn!

666
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:01,985
Private JUNG gets his head chopped off
and now Sergeant OH's dead.

667
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,293
I'm sick of weird shit going on.
I'm not sticking around any more.

668
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:22,975
Does all this mean that
we can't get out of here, sir?

669
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,382
Tell me something.

670
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,386
What's the first thing
you wanna do when you get home?

671
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,388
I wanna...

672
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:36,897
Go on a picnic to the Royal
Palace with my wife and daughter.

673
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:40,399
I'm telling you,
it's going to happen.

674
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,595
Corporal JOH!

675
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:20,900
It's the missing men!

676
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,992
Corporal JOH...

677
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,277
Who's there?

678
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,182
You're... Sergeant OH?

679
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:51,589
Sergeant PARK?

680
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,992
<i>Donkey three, Butterfly come in.</i>

681
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:32,404
<i>Come in, Butterfly.</i>

682
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:40,579
<i>We're dying, do you copy?</i>

683
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,188
<i>Butterfly, do you copy?</i>

684
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,186
<i>This is Donkey three.</i>

685
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,596
<i>Come in, Butterfly.</i>

686
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:07,304
<i>We're getting massacred.</i>

687
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,381
<i>Butterfly, do you copy?</i>

688
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,186
<i>This is Donkey three!</i>

689
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,790
- Sergeant PARK?
- What?

690
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:29,294
Something's chasing us.

691
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,296
What?

692
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,406
I told you to cut
the bullshit out, asshole!

693
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,007
Corporal LEE!

694
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:48,674
I'm frightened that
OH is gonna kill me.

695
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,984
He blames me, I know it!

696
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,183
Cut the crap out,
you son of a bitch!

697
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:01,694
If you see something just shoot.

698
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:22,881
Cease fire!

699
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,680
You son of a bitch, it's us!

700
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,586
Lieutenant, are you all right?

701
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:48,301
What the hell are you doing?
Hey Cook, are you all right?

702
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:53,178
Hang on!
Do something, son of a bitch!

703
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:58,277
You think I can make it?

704
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,685
Yeah, don't worry.

705
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,586
Don't lie to my face, bitch!

706
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,689
No, you can't die.

707
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:18,199
Calm down. I'm not going to die.

708
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:25,876
I won't die before I go on
a picnic with my wife and daughter...

709
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:30,883
Get through this and I'll treat
you as my own older brother.

710
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:34,386
Please don't die,
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

711
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:40,190
You've finally grown up, kid.

712
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:54,205
Whatever happens...
make it back home.

713
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:04,982
- Sergeant MAH.
- Hey, Cook, get up!

714
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,982
Don't die on me!

715
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:22,795
I saw this coming.
You fucking nut!

716
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,403
Sergeant JANG!

717
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,572
Get off!

718
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,078
Look, I was right!

719
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:37,674
The ghost was coming after me.
What else was I supposed to do?

720
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:43,689
You killed him, and you're
trying to say it was a ghost?

721
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:48,194
Let me go of it.

722
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,798
I'm possessed with by
an evil spirit now!

723
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,779
Move out.

724
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:33,098
Mole three, come in Butterfly.

725
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:35,709
Butterfly...!

726
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,584
Give it up.

727
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:57,096
Tomorrow the Americans will be here,
so we can ask for help.

728
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,703
- Come with me.
- Lieutenant!

729
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:11,871
It's a waste of time.

730
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:23,290
What is?

731
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,491
What this?

732
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:36,595
Get this shit downstairs.

733
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:46,075
Then who were... those Americans?

734
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,479
They're not coming.

735
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,285
What do you mean?

736
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:57,084
You knew it and didn't
tell us the fucking truth.

737
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,386
Put your weapons down.

738
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:03,389
You were in on it, weren't you?
Kissing his ass!

739
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:09,397
Hurry up and arrest these
sons of bitches.

740
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,106
Get this equipment downstairs.

741
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:17,370
Don't try to fuck with us,

742
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:20,174
what good is this junk?

743
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,974
Put your weapon down.

744
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,185
If you come any closer, I'll fire.

745
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,894
If you wanna live, follow my orders.

746
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,998
Hurry!

747
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,099
<i>R- POINT: Day 5</i>

748
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:19,596
<i>Butterfly, come in, Mole three.</i>

749
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:25,475
<i>Do you copy? Come in, Mole three.</i>

750
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,081
Lieutenant, it's working.

751
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,084
Mole three, come in Butterfly.

752
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:34,086
Urgent. Send back up right away.

753
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,383
<i>What situation?</i>

754
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:40,984
We need back up!
Send a chopper to R-Point, right now!

755
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:46,590
<i>It's too dark. 05:50 am is</i>
<i>the earliest we can get to you.</i>

756
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:49,294
Cut the shit and
send a fucking chopper now!

757
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,997
We're losing time.

758
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,701
<i>Confirm, a chopper will be there</i>
<i>by 05:50...</i>

759
01:26:57,011 --> 01:27:01,175
Butterfly!

760
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,779
Do you copy! You son of a bitch!

761
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:13,587
You don't know
what the hell is going on here!

762
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:27,600
Listen carefully,
we'll make it out of here alive.

763
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,482
To your stations!

764
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,886
Open the goddamn door!

765
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,092
It's Sergeant JIN,
we should let him in!

766
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,498
No, don't open it!

767
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,203
No!

768
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,387
Sergeant, you're alive, sir!

769
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:39,573
We shouldn't have come here.

770
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:43,276
Your name and official rank.

771
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,287
What're you doing, sir?

772
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:52,681
You wanna play boss
until the end, huh!

773
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:57,587
Your last chance, name and rank!

774
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:05,003
Sergeant 1st Class
JIN Chang-rok, 8335107.

775
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:17,778
Are you fucking happy now, bastard?

776
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:32,296
Sergeant!

777
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:36,597
Please help me...
get back home alive.

778
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:42,198
I was the one that found the tags...

779
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:48,675
You promised to get me
on the airplane home, so...

780
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:52,284
You wanna live, huh?

781
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:56,982
I don't wanna die, I wanna live.

782
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,787
I wanna live.

783
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:04,990
I'm too fucking young to die!

784
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:11,301
What did I do to deserve this shit?

785
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,673
Step away from him!

786
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,673
Put your weapons down.

787
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,493
Corporal BYUN!

788
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:47,895
Lower your weapons.

789
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:07,181
Mole three, come in Butterfly.

790
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:08,788
Butterfly, do you copy?

791
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:13,587
Give it up!
The fucking thing's gone!

792
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,094
The chopper's on its way.

793
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,392
It's coming for sure.

794
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:38,278
Corporal LEE,
your name and rank!

795
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,192
I'm ordering you!

796
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:51,389
Corporal LEE Jae-pil,
8327602

797
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:53,998
And you!

798
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:58,595
Corporal JOH Byung-hoon,
8327603.

799
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:08,879
Sergeant JANG!

800
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,878
Wake up, come on!

801
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:22,988
Sergeant JANG Young-soo,
8123018.

802
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,483
They're coming.

803
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:27,786
They're coming, I told you!

804
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,692
Corporal BUYN, snap out of it!

805
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,992
Name and rank.

806
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:41,100
Lieutenant, they're coming.

807
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:47,378
I'm asking you for the last time.

808
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:57,784
Get down!

809
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:43,899
Sergeant JANG, hang on!

810
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:50,276
My eyes... I can't see.

811
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,580
Just hang on.

812
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:10,090
Corporal LEE!

813
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:17,102
Get yourself together!

814
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:21,504
Why are they doing this to us?
What did we do wrong?

815
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:25,078
We don't fucking deserve this!

816
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,171
We haven't done anything

817
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:33,480
to deserve this shit!

818
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:41,891
Do you really... mean it?

819
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:48,997
Oh, no!

820
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,271
Lieutenant!

821
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:35,878
Where are you, sir?

822
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:39,381
Lieutenant!

823
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,287
I lost my tags.

824
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:48,686
Without it,
my dead body can't be sent home.

825
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:52,788
Even my ashes won't make it home.

826
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:55,197
Just get a hold of yourself!

827
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,702
Just stay calm!

828
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:01,501
- I lost my tags.
- You're gonna make it.

829
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:06,570
Listen to me, we're
going to make it back alive.

830
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:10,775
You're just injured.
You'll be fine.

831
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:12,977
Why aren't you afraid?

832
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:19,889
Just believe me. We'll get back alive,
understand?

833
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:19,478
Lieutenant... where are you?

834
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:22,273
Sergeant JANG, take your rifle.

835
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,475
Take your weapon!

836
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:44,094
Aim it to the left.

837
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,598
More to the left.

838
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:08,385
Fire!

839
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:17,999
Fire, it's an order!

840
01:41:37,024 --> 01:41:38,992
Sir?

841
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:46,192
What's going on?
You're there right?

842
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:49,493
Lieutenant!

843
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:54,200
Answer me, are you there?

844
01:41:58,312 --> 01:42:01,975
Lieutenant,
you're still there, right?

845
01:42:03,217 --> 01:42:09,087
Oh, say something, please.

846
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:16,590
Lieutenant, answer me.

847
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:29,398
You're there, aren't you?

848
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:34,777
You're fooling around,
right sir?

849
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:49,490
I need to go back home
with the money I earned.

850
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:55,500
My mom's dying to see me!

851
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:03,205
But I'm a little scared.

852
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:07,171
I'm afraid my mom won't
recognize me

853
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:13,785
because I've changed so much.

854
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:23,995
Because I can't... see anything now.

855
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:31,293
My home's too far away.

856
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:44,380
Hey, Cook, take your angels
to the Royal Palace!

857
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:51,890
LEE, BYUN and JOH!

858
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:58,796
You bastards,
stop playing tricks on me!

859
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:05,503
Damn, it's time to go home,
right!

860
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:11,477
<i>We haven't spotted anyone,</i>
<i>except an injured soldier.</i>

861
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:14,877
<i>But he's completely lost it.</i>

862
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:18,075
<i>We've searched R-Point,</i>

863
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:21,779
<i>but the other 8 haven't been found.</i>

864
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:26,382
<i>We're heading back,</i>
<i>with the only survivor, Roger!</i>

865
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:48,070
<i>Mole three, come in, Butterfly.</i>

866
01:44:48,215 --> 01:44:51,184
<i>Come in, Butterfly, do you copy?</i>

867
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:55,986
<i>Butterfly, please come in.</i>
