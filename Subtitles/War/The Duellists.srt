HAS BEEN LAID AGAINST HER.

708
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:18,905
VERY WELL.

709
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:21,407
IF SHE'S GOOD AND BIDDABLE,
SHE'LL SETTLE DOWN.

710
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,412
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.

711
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:29,415
SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE HAS THAT MAGIC.

712
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:32,168
YOU ARE IN LOVE?

713
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,004
YES, I'M IN LOVE.

714
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:35,838
WELL, THEN...

715

717
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:51,487

GO AND PLAY BILLIARDS.

719
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:07,086
SURELY YOU WILL NOT TURN DOWN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BRIGADE.

720
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:11,591
THE EMPEROR IS OUR HOPE
AND STRENGTH.

721
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,881
WE BELONG TO HIM.

722
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:23,886
I HAVE ENTERTAINED
THE NOTION THAT...

723
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:25,772
I MAY BELONG TO MYSELF.

724
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:31,778
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT YOU
DO NOT LOVE THE EMPEROR.

725
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:34,280
BY WHOM?

726
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,783
BY GENERAL FERAUD.

727
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:39,736
HE KNOWS YOU WELL,
I BELIEVE.

728
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,238
GENERAL FERAUD HAS MADE
OCCASIONAL ATTEMPTS TO KILL ME.

729
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:45,541
THAT DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO CLAIM MY ACQUAINTANCE.

730
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,543
AND IT IS ALSO SAID
THAT HE FOUGHT YOU...

731
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,580
IN DEFENSE
OF THE EMPEROR'S HONOR.

732
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,381
THAT IS IMPERTINENT TRASH!

733
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,751
YOU HAVE MY ANSWER
TO MARSHALL GROUCHY.

734
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,969
I SHALL WRITE
TO CONFIRM IT AT ONCE.

735
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,088
GOOD DAY.

736
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,310
COLONEL, DO YOU SOMETIMES
MEET WITH GENERAL FERAUD?

737
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,679
NOW AND AGAIN.

738
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:08,181
ASK HIM WHAT THE HONOR
OF THE EMPEROR

739
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:09,982
HAS TO DO
WITH MADAME DE LIONNE?

740
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,518
MADAME DE LIONNE?

741
01:08:12,518 --> 01:08:15,404
I THINK THAT WAS
THE LADY'S NAME.

742
01:08:15,404 --> 01:08:16,906
HE SHOULD REMEMBER
BETTER THAN I.

743
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,416

744
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:51,274

745
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:54,026

OFF THAT TABLE.

749
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:06,122

750
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:08,958
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE EMPEROR.

751
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:12,411
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
THE GENERAL WAS SUGGESTING...

752
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:16,799
AN ILLICIT ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THE EMPEROR AND THIS WOMAN.

753
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,801
THEN WHAT WAS HE SUGGESTING?

754
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,553
WHAT?
OUT WITH IT.

755
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,924
SIR, I TOOK HIM RATHER
TO IMPLY THAT THIS LADY...

756
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:28,311
NOT THE EMPEROR, WAS THE PRIME
CAUSE OF YOUR QUARREL.

757
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,265
I HAVE CALLED HIM OUT NEAR
TO HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

758
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:33,266
THE CAVALRY KNOWS.

759
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:36,018
WOULD I HAVE DONE THAT
FOR SOME PETTY NONSENSE?

760
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:38,521
SHE WAS A LADY I HELD
IN HIGH ESTEEM.

761
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:40,356
HER SALON
WAS VERY WELL KNOWN IN...

762
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,775

763
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,030
YES, NOW I RECALL
SOMETHING ELSE.

764
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:51,784
HE SAID TO ME
IN A PUBLIC STREET--

765
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:54,170
I HAVE IT BURNT IN MY MIND.
HE SAID TO ME...

766
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,456
"FOR ALL THAT I CARE, THEY CAN
SPIT UPON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE."

767
01:09:58,841 --> 01:09:59,926
WHO WERE THEY?

768
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:00,927
THEY, THEY!

769
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,929
WHEN DID THE EMPEROR
NOT HAVE ENEMIES?

770
01:10:02,929 --> 01:10:05,431
D'HUBERT IS A TURNCOAT!
THAT IS A FACT!

771
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:08,434
I SAY MORE. I SAY HE NEVER
LOVED THE EMPEROR! NEVER!

772
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:15,107
HE SAW A FAIR DEAL
OF CAMPAIGNING.

773
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:19,478
WHEN YOU MEET HIM, TELL HIM
I WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF IT...

774
01:10:19,478 --> 01:10:22,481
AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.

775
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:26,369

AND TO THOSE THAT LOVE HIM.

BUT IN LESS THAN 100 DAYS,

777
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:33,125
NAPOLEON WAS DEFEATED.

778
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,544
AND I OFFER YOU
ANOTHER TOAST.

779
01:10:35,544 --> 01:10:38,547
LET US GIVE THANKS
FOR THE SAFE RETURN...

780
01:10:38,547 --> 01:10:42,051

LOUIS XVIII.

GOD SAVE THE KING.

782
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:46,555

A FIT AND PROPER PLACE FOR HIM.

786
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:02,071
COME, SIR.
YOU'RE A ROYALIST NOW...

787
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,990
LIKE THE REST OF US.

788
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,325
WHERE ELSE
WOULD YOU WISH HIM TO BE?

789
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,496
ONE CELEBRATION AT A TIME, SIR.
DON'T YOU THINK?

790
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:13,165
NO, I DO NOT.
THE BOY'S A ROYALIST.

791
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:15,785
AND I CAN GIVE YOU
MORE GOOD NEWS.

792
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:20,706
HE HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO ATTEND
UPON MARSHALL ST. CYR IN PARIS.

793
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:24,710
HE WILL HAVE A COMMAND
IN THE KING'S ARMY.

794
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,214
SO TELL US. WHAT FATE
WOULD YOU CHOOSE FOR THE OGRE?

795
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,686
I BELIEVE THE EMPEROR
CHOSE HIS OWN FATE.

796
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:35,855
IT WAS HIS HABIT TO DO SO.

797
01:11:37,723 --> 01:11:40,693
I LEARNED MY TRADE
IN HIS SERVICE,

798
01:11:40,693 --> 01:11:42,695
AS DID MARSHALL ST. CYR.

799
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:45,481
THE KING'S ARMY WILL HAVE
MORE REALISTS THAN ROYALISTS.

800
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:53,539
I HAVE JUST AGREED TO TERMS
WITH THIS LADY...

801
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,542

FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING.

GOOD DAY, COLONEL.

806
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:49,428
D'HUBERT, ISN'T IT?

807
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:51,213
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,652

YOU WERE A SLIPPERY FELLOW.

01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,628
