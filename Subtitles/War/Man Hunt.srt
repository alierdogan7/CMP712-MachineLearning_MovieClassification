Thank you.

You know, if you just walked up to
this house in a normal way, instead of, uh-

27
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,183
you would've been invited
to lunch by our führer.

28
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,711
I've anticipated the pleasure
of meeting you for years.

29
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,249
I'm afraid I don't know-

30
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,762
Like you, my dear Thorndike,
I had but one passion in life...

31
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,128
and that is the hunting of big game.

32
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,861
I'm convinced that I would've
become more famous even than yourself...

33
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,166
if I hadn't renounced it
in favor of politics.

34
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:10,263
Politics?

35
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,003
Yes, I, uh, find it a more exciting
field of action-

36
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,637
my branch of it.

37
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:19,477
You're surprised that
I know your name so well.

38
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:23,849
I was in Nairobi on my own safari the year
that all Kenya rang with your exploits.

39
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:27,049
So you see, it's quite natural that
I should know who you are.

40
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,786
Yes.

41
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,387
And also you've taken, uh...

42
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,488
my passport.

43
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,898
Nonetheless, my dear Thorndike,
I should've recognized you on sight-

44
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,733
a man whose brother was a guest
in this house only last September.

45
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,137
So you know my brother?

46
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:47,734
When Lord Risborough was sent here by
your prime minister on a mission of appeasement.

47
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,574
I found him a credulous simpleton.

48
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:59,113
Do you know, Thorndike, that this is
the most closely guarded house in the world?

49
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,248
Rather.

50
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,419
I would've staked my life
that no living thing...

51
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,827
could've entered this area
without being seen.

52
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,332
But then, of course,
we didn't count upon a creature...

53
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,732
that has learned to stalk
the most cunning animal...

54
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:14,930
that can catch scents
upon the wind...

55
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:19,374
that has mastered the trick of moving
through a forest as if he were transparent.

56
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:23,072
Look out there.
For 500 yards, not a tree, not a shrub.

57
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:27,810
A man running towards this house would
be cut down before he'd taken five steps.

58
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,215
And yet on that ledge above...

59
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,519
was a man with a precision rifle...

60
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,652
and a high degree of intelligence
and skill that is required to use it.

61
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,566
Your judgment of distance
is uncanny, Thorndike.

62
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:48,297
The sights were set at 550 yards,
only 10 feet short of the exact range.

63
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:50,465
I checked it.

64
00:10:54,945 --> 00:11:00,440
Obviously, my dear Thorndike,
such a man cannot be allowed to live.

65
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,949
Surely you don't think
I'm an assassin.

66
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,422
You were stopped
before you could shoot.

67
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,085
But I could have easily.

68
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,618
<i>Good heavens, man,</i>
<i>I never intended to shoot.</i>

69
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:16,791
I merely wanted to find out
if it were possible.

70
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,802
That was the excitement of it-
the danger, the fun.

71
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,169
It was that fellow jumping me
that made my gun go off.

72
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,333
You disappoint me, Thorndike.

73
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,476
I daresay I have been a bit thick...

74
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:33,141
but, well, from the way you talked
about hunting and all that...

75
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:36,014
I assumed you knew
it was a sporting stalk.

76
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,350
A what?

77
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:43,257
A sporting stalk. Stalking the game
you're after for the fun of it- not to kill.

78
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,787
Oh, I'm not begging off
from any consequences...

79
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,697
but you will permit me to doubt
your claims as a hunter of big game...

80
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,965
if you fail to understand the fascination
for a man who's hunted all commoner game...

81
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,268
of hunting the biggest game
on Earth.

82
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,604
That's it. Precisely.

83
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,702
The most dangerous
of all animals- man.

84
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,148
But you don't kill.
The sport is in the chase, not the kill.

85
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:10,186
I don't kill any longer,
not even small game.

86
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,120
<i>I know what I can do with a rifle.</i>

87
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,627
If I can stalk an animal and get within range,
the rest is a mathematical certainty.

88
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:20,663
And that's sheer cruelty,
and I don't like cruelty.

89
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,564
The real fun is matching my wits
against the instinct of an animal...

90
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,068
<i>that isn't going to let me</i>
<i>get near enough to shoot.</i>

91
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:30,038
Your conversation
fascinates me, Thorndike.

92
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:34,635
But this softness in your nature with
regard to the ultimate purpose of firearms...

93
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:39,808
betrays the weakness, the decadence,
not only of yourself but of your entire race.

94
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,977
Yes, you're symbolic
of the English race.

95
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,044
I'm beginning to think that
you're symbolic of yours.

96
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,886
We Nazis are finding a new life,
a new vitality for our people...

97
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,983
by returning to
the primitive virtues.

98
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,324
Such as going back
to the barbarism of decapitation?

99
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:55,728
We do not hesitate to destroy
in order to create a new world.

100
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,029
God help it.
I'm sorry for you.

101
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:01,366
And I for you, Thorndike-
you and your world.

What is it? A suicide note?

110
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:04,594
It is a confession that on
this 29th day ofJuly, 1939...

111
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,932
you have attempted to
assassinate our führer...

112
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:11,372
and that you have undertaken this crime
with the approval of your government.

113
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:15,768
I what?

114
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,609

- You still insist you had no intention to shoot?
- Of course.

117
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:27,580
I told you it was a sporting stalk.

118
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:31,491
- Then why didn't you leave your rifle behind?
- Uh-

119
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,155
I've asked myself that.

120
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:37,689
And I think the answer is that-

121
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:41,464
that it wouldn't have been sporting,
it wouldn't have been playing the game.

122
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:46,100
Nothing betrays the hypocrisy of the English
more than their use of"playing the game."

123
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,974
- One plays a game to win, Thorndike.
- Nonsense.

124
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,445
I don't expect you to understand.

125
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:54,540
Even pulling the trigger
on an empty gun was a-

126
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:56,882
oh, a kind of cheating with myself.

127
00:14:56,953 --> 00:15:00,980
- It-It didn't prove anything. I did, you know?
- Oh, naturally.

128
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:05,357
It had to be a loaded rifle
with my finger on the trigger...

129
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:08,397
with only my individual will,
my civilized conscience...

- between me and the extermination
of your strutting little Caesar.
- Thorndike!

131
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:16,235
I mean no insult, but how do you expect me
to describe a man who wants to play God...

132
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:19,070
and have everyone else in the world
run around and say, <i>"Heil Hitler"?</i>

133
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,310
- Thorndike, I warn you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

134
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,005
- Thorndike, I warn you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

You are in no position to refuse.

00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,799
That's for me to decide, isn't it?

139
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,243
You're thinking it is easy
to throw away your life.

140
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,873
Yes, it is.

141
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:04,216
But, uh, how well do you stand pain?

142
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:07,723
If you won't listen to me,
you'll have to talk it over with these men.

This is England. I'm home again.

- Huh?

It wasn't a woman, was it, sir?

348

- No.

466
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:28,913
How did you know about it?

467
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:33,426
Their embassy's been making polite
inquiries about you for nearly four weeks.

468
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:36,861
Lately, they've become
more persistent, more pointed.

469
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:40,094
Then not 10 minutes ago,
the foreign office telephoned...

470
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:44,365
that our agents in Berlin
say that you're secretly accused of-

471
00:50:44,438 --> 00:50:47,930
- of an attempt upon the life of their führer.
- Ah!

472
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:51,409
I told them, of course,
that the suggestion was fantastic...

473
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:54,209
that there was absolutely no basis
in fact for such an accusation...

474
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:57,808
that you couldn't possibly
be involved in any such affair.

475
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:01,044
That is the truth, isn't it?

476
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:04,090
Yes, Gerald.

477
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:08,117
Thank heaven. Then you'll go straight with me
to the embassy and clear the matter up at once.

478
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:10,959
- I'm afraid I can't.
- In heaven's name, why not?

479
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:15,365
Uh, sit down, Gerald.

480
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:23,877
Young woman, what is
your connection with Alan?

481
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:29,107
Alan.

482
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:31,174
Is that his name?

483
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,948
You-You don't know him?

484
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:36,285
Never laid me eyes on him
before tonight.

485
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:40,191
He's a bit of all right though
if you ask me. A real swell.

486
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:42,855
I say, what's this jam
he's got mixed up in?

487
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,457
- Are the rozzers after him?
- The-The-The what?

488
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:49,628
Rozzers!

489
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:53,104
Dicks! Coppers. Policemen.

490
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:56,108
Oh, yes, policemen.

491
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:58,838
Hmm?

492
00:51:58,913 --> 00:52:01,006
Hmm.

493
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:04,843
- Good, ain't it?
- Mmm.

494
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:09,985
But, Gerald, old boy, I did not sign
their faked-up confession.

495
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:12,821
But they won't need it
if they can get you back into Germany.

496
00:52:12,893 --> 00:52:15,555
- They've got to catch me first.
- Oh, but they-

497
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:18,564
- they know you're in London.
- In that case, I shall get out of England.

498
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:22,068
But that's impossible too.
You have no passport.

499
00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:26,163
Any effort to obtain a new one
would only involve the government.

500
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,176
Besides, every ship and plane
leaving the country will be watched.

501
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,303
What about Scotland Yard?

502
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,574
Within 24 hours, there'd
be a démarche on my desk...

503
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:37,139
asking for your arrest
and return to Berlin.

504
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:40,380
To refuse their ambassador,
that would be an unfriendly act.

505
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,446
We would have no choice
but to comply.

506
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,927
You know what would happen then?

507
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:52,056
You mean I might even have the honor
of having my head lobbed off...

508
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,396
by the first headsman of the Reich?

509
00:52:54,468 --> 00:52:58,598
I mean there would first
be a faked-up trial.

510
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:00,697
Not you...

511
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:04,403
but England would be convicted
before the world.

512
00:53:04,478 --> 00:53:07,447
And that would pave the way
for what they want-

513
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:09,539
war.

514
00:53:09,617 --> 00:53:12,586
Don't forget their Reichstag Fire Trial.

515
00:53:12,653 --> 00:53:17,681
You know their genius
for producing witnesses and documents...

516
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:20,727
to prove their enemies guilty
of what they intend to do.

517
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:25,891
In that case, I shall imitate their gestapo
and become invisible myself.

518
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:29,868
I shall vanish utterly, completely,
as if I were dead for as long as you wish.

519
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,928
I'll see no one- not even you.

520
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:34,736

00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,799
But you can, old boy,
by not worrying.

522
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:39,539
This whole thing will blow over
before long. It's bound to.

523
00:53:39,613 --> 00:53:41,740
In the meantime,
I give you my word of honor:

524
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:45,512
- There'll be no confession, no trial.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

Gerald, I've got one of
my dreadful headaches coming on.

00:53:49,857 --> 00:53:53,224
- I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
- Why, yes, of course, my dear.

527
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,488
I've left that young person
in the living room. Don't-

528
00:53:55,562 --> 00:53:58,554
Alice, I never thought you'd be
the first to throw up the sponge.

529
00:53:58,632 --> 00:54:01,226
- Come on. You've got to seeJerry at the door.
- No, I shan't.

530
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:04,759
- But after all, she's your guest, you know?
- I can't. I really can't.

531
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:06,965
Remember, she thinks you're a lady.

532
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:11,102
Surely you don't want to disillusion
anyone so young and trusting.

533
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:13,169
Ah.

534
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:20,950
Here. You looks like the gentleman
who asked me to have dinner with him...

535
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:23,649

I? Well, I'm not the gentleman, miss.

537
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:28,925
In fact, I'm not a gentleman at all.

You're the spittin' image of him then,
but you do act more scaredy like.

Well, I'll wait till I hear from you.

is calling on the telephone again.

- Who?
- Major Quive-Smith.

00:55:21,782 --> 00:55:25,309
- Quive-Smith?
- Yes. He called my office yesterday.

555
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:29,822
He said he was a neighbor of yours-
a retired military man from the west of England.

556
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,825
- What's he look like?
- Tall, good figure.

557
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:36,260
Rather formal. Talks about Kenya.
You know the type.

558
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,560
Talks about Kenya?
Does he wear a monocle?

559
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:40,657
That's the fellow, yes.

560
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:42,895
- Did he ask if I were here?
- Yes, sir, he did.

561
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:47,430

- <i>Yes, sir. You see, knowing he</i>

- Well, what should I tell him?

Tell him I've just left for the club.

01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:38,574
So you don't trust me, huh?

662
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:42,643
I always pay my debts.

663
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,314
<i>I propose to get you £500.</i>
<i>You may have more, if you want it.</i>

664
01:04:51,294 --> 01:04:53,489

665
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:59,067

do you mean?

666
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:03,071

667
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:06,905

My dearJerry, forgive me.

670
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,917
I might have known.

671
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:20,753
Every good soldier needs
a crest for his cap.

672
01:05:20,824 --> 01:05:23,952
And you shall have your pin
set with diamonds, if you wish.

673
01:05:24,027 --> 01:05:26,427

- Huh?

674
01:05:26,496 --> 01:05:28,589

- Good morning, <i>mein Herr.</i>
Good morning, <i>fräulein.</i>

677
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:53,782
What shall it be?

678
01:05:53,857 --> 01:05:58,317
Uh- Uh, you've got a, um-

679
01:05:58,395 --> 01:06:00,955
a pin, sort of a brooch,
in the window.

680
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:04,398
<i>Ja. Ja.</i> I show it to you.

681
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,560
It's a large heart.

682
01:06:06,636 --> 01:06:10,265
You know what? I don't want an heart.
It's too much like-

683
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,070
Like the one you lost.
That's what you want, isn't it?

684
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:17,603
So beautiful that piece of jewelry
and so fine a sentiment- the heart.

685
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:21,412
You see, <i>fräulein?</i> It's gold plate,
and the fine stones just like diamonds.

686
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:23,782
You know, I think
it's rather appropriate.

687
01:06:23,853 --> 01:06:26,947
- How much is this one?
- Ten shillings, <i>fräulein.</i>

688
01:06:27,023 --> 01:06:30,789
Very cheap. It costs you
two guineas on Regent Street.

689
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:34,455
You should have that and
put it in the gentleman's heart, no?

690
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:36,624
Is it real silver?

691
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,168
Better. It's chromium.

692
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:44,367
- Can I have it?
- Well, certainly, if you want to be heartless.

693
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:47,103
Good, good.
You make no mistake, <i>fräulein.</i>

694
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:51,671
A lifetime, I tell you.
You will have it still when you die.

695
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:55,206
- Go on. Take it.
- No. You've got to give it me.

696
01:06:55,285 --> 01:06:57,378
l- Oh.

697
01:06:59,422 --> 01:07:02,357
I present you with
this dangerous weapon, mademoiselle...

698
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:05,326
with my undying gratitude
and admiration.

699
01:07:05,395 --> 01:07:08,330

701
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,068
- There you are, sir.
- One pound, 20 shillings. I give you change.

702
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:21,338
No, keep it, keep it. There mustn't be
anything mercenary about this soldier's crest.

703
01:07:21,411 --> 01:07:25,438
- It's got to bring luck.
- <i>Danke. Danke. Danke, mein Herr.</i>

704
01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:31,986
I think that looks very nice.
Don't you? Huh? Shall we go?

Well, uh, it isn't

712
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,771
It was the best I could do. After all,
you phoned less than an hour ago.

713
01:09:04,848 --> 01:09:06,907
Well.

714
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:14,117
Well, uh, aren't you going to
ask any questions?

715
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,988
Only one.

716
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,790
Have you been abroad
in the employ of our government?

717
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:23,822
- No, on my own business.
- I beg you to let me talk to the police.

718
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,993
You don't realize
the power of your name.

719
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:29,368
That is precisely what makes
my disappearance necessary and urgent.

720
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,532
But, my dear chap, don't you realize-

721
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:35,009
If I get as far as Algiers,
I'll give those fellas a run for their money.

722
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:38,206
Africa is one continent I know
better than all their invisible men.

723
01:09:38,281 --> 01:09:41,216
- This the, uh, ooftish?
- That is the money, yes.

724
01:09:41,284 --> 01:09:43,377
If you don't mind,
we'll check the amount.

725
01:09:43,453 --> 01:09:45,546
No, no.
I'll just take £500.

726
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:48,523
And, uh, Saul, you can instruct her
how to deposit it.

727
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:51,389
- <i>Very good.</i>
- I don't want it.

728
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:53,952
- I won't take it!
- Oh, yes, you will.

729
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:56,624
I'm going to have my way
at least once with you.

730
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:59,190
I wouldn't know
what to do with all that money.

731
01:09:59,269 --> 01:10:01,362
- Mr. Farnsworthy will tell you.
- <i>Yes.</i>

732
01:10:01,437 --> 01:10:03,530
I won't take it.
You'll want it.

- Will you be quiet?
- No.

such a stubborn woman.

736

Jerry, this isn't
paying you for anything.

738
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:20,321
I can never do that.

Come on now. Frown. Frown.

740
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:28,154
You stubborn little monkey.
She won't do anything I ask her to.

741
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:30,324
- Yes, yes.
- Jerry-

742
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,096
The German embassy
telephoned here a few days ago.

743
01:10:33,169 --> 01:10:36,229
Their inquiry was pointedly casual.

744
01:10:36,306 --> 01:10:38,399
Anyone else ask for me?

745
01:10:38,474 --> 01:10:42,035
A friend of yours came in
to see me the other day...

746
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:44,602
to consult me about
some inconceivable tangle...

<i>under the Married Woman's</i>
<i>Property Act.</i>

748
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,551
He was continually referring to you.

01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:53,612
Was he, uh, English?

750
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,181
Too perfectly.

751
01:10:56,259 --> 01:10:59,626

754
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:09,234
I've just been taking
a look outside, sir.

755
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:12,103
The gentleman in the black hat
is still feeding the pigeons, sir.

756
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:16,271
And now he's been joined by the military-looking
gentleman who visited you last week.

757
01:11:16,346 --> 01:11:19,804
Captain Thorndike's friend,
the gentleman with the monocle.

758
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:22,715
- You see?
- Hmm.

759
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:25,185
- Thank you, Peale.
- <i>Not at all, sir.</i>

760
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:30,659
- Is there another way out of here?
- There's the back staircase.

761
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:32,820
Oh, good.

762
01:11:34,497 --> 01:11:36,658

the coroner brings in
a verdict of suicide-

767
01:11:48,978 --> 01:11:53,142
- Suicide?
- Don't you believe it, huh?

768
01:11:53,216 --> 01:11:55,514
- But don't attempt to reopen the case.
- All right.

769
01:11:55,585 --> 01:11:58,611
Bye, Jerry. You wait here for an hour
and go out the front way.

- Now see here. I've had enough of this.

771
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,917
Don't you see that your own safety
lies in keeping away from me?

772
01:12:04,994 --> 01:12:07,963
- Where you goin'?
- To the Underground, on my way to nowhere.

773
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:10,864
I'm goin' to the Underground too.
I gotta get home, haven't I?

774
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:14,596

- I will not.

- But if he puts your name on it-
- He won't.

824
01:20:00,033 --> 01:20:04,936
He'll address it to, uh-
to... your name.

825
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:07,098
Mr. Stokes.

826
01:20:07,173 --> 01:20:09,664
Mr. Stokes, care of the post office
at Lyme Regis.

827
01:20:09,743 --> 01:20:12,940
- Lyme Regis.
- Uh, have you got a pencil?
I'll write it down for you.

828
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:18,340
Over there in the basket. Lyme Regis.

829

Lyme Regis. That's it. Here now.

01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:27,053
Mr. D.F. - "F" is for "fool."

And remember: in three weeks.

836
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:45,077
You got that?

837
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,807
Well, come on now. Cheer up.

Not a step further.

Good-bye, Jerry, and thank you.

- Kiss me.
- Jerry.

01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,777
Won't you kiss me?

846

I'm sorry, sir.
If I was you, I'd step along.

869
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:29,801
Good afternoon, madam.
I think you may have a letter for me.

870
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:32,269
- What name, please?
- Stokes.

871
01:24:36,309 --> 01:24:38,368
- D.F. Stokes?
- <i>Yes.</i>

872
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,907
Come.
Go through them, please.

873
01:24:42,982 --> 01:24:45,883
Yes, sir. It's- It's in here.

874
01:24:48,888 --> 01:24:51,755
There's a parcel for you, too,
in the back room...

875

if you'll wait a minute, please.

876
01:24:54,394 --> 01:24:56,487
Just a minute.

<i>Thorndike!</i>

01:27:37,857 --> 01:27:41,122
You might as well be reasonable,
my dear fellow.

886
01:27:41,194 --> 01:27:45,722
I'm so glad you had the sense not to
break out while I was sealing you up.

887
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:49,598
- Now you cannot get out.
- You can't get in, you mean.

888
01:27:49,669 --> 01:27:53,833
[Chuckles]
I have no desire to enter a cave
after a trapped animal...

889
01:27:53,906 --> 01:27:56,636
even though I know
you have no weapons.

890
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:59,678
I admired your stone door
so much that I imitated it...

891
01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:02,613
by wedging another stone
on the outside.

892
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:05,173
You're sealed up, as in a grave.

It's no use, Thorndike.
No use at all.

Couldn't you have given me
a cleaner death than this?

<i>Don't be a fool.</i>
<i>I could have killed you an hour ago.</i>

897
01:28:47,226 --> 01:28:49,717
<i>My purpose was to trap you alive.</i>

- <i>You've been immensely helpful.</i>
- [Grunts]

- <i>Now you're being sensible.</i>

- <i>Have you got it?</i>
- <i>What is it?</i>

901
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:12,078
<i>It is the confession that,</i>
<i>with the approval of your government...</i>

902
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,244
<i>you sought to assassinate</i>
<i>our führer.</i>

Go to the devil!

01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:20,255

You're growing wearisome, Thorndike.

905
01:29:21,894 --> 01:29:23,987
Once more, I ask you to sign...

906
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:26,361
<i>and save us both</i>
<i>an unpleasant conclusion.</i>

907

<i>You also told me you no longer believed</i>
<i>in killing, yet you killed one of my men.</i>

Oh, I'm not blaming you in the least.

910
01:29:35,808 --> 01:29:39,904
I merely wish to point out
that a lie is relative...

911
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:42,072
<i>as is truth.</i>

912
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:46,278
I tell you, I did not intend
to shoot your bloody führer!

913
01:29:48,988 --> 01:29:51,513
I believe you.
I believe you're sincere.

914
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:53,957
I really do at last.

915
01:29:54,026 --> 01:29:56,620
You actually think you had
no intention to kill...

916
01:29:56,696 --> 01:30:00,257
<i>that it was all a "sporting stalk,"</i>
<i>as you call it.</i>

917
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:03,962
- It was!
- And yet every minute,
you were deceiving yourself.

918
01:30:04,036 --> 01:30:07,472
- And every hour since then,
you have lied to yourself.
- No!

919
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,566
<i>You've refused to face</i>
<i>your secret self, Thorndike.</i>

920

<i>From the moment you crossed the frontier,</i>
<i>you became an unconscious assassin.</i>

I'm going to show you to yourself
as you really are, Thorndike.

922
01:30:21,521 --> 01:30:25,252
I'm going to break through that
civilized English mask you were born with.

923
01:30:25,324 --> 01:30:28,623
I'm going to show you
what you really are and were-

924
01:30:28,694 --> 01:30:31,254
<i>an assassin.</i>

925
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:34,822
You fool!
You fanatical fool!

926
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,899
<i>A token for you, Thorndike.</i>

927
01:30:45,344 --> 01:30:47,744
<i>To make you see the truth.</i>

928
01:30:51,717 --> 01:30:54,242

929
01:30:57,023 --> 01:30:59,719
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

930
01:31:02,028 --> 01:31:04,963
Do you expect me
to lie to you, Thorndike?

931
01:31:05,031 --> 01:31:08,865
Do you expect me to tell you
that it was a sporting stalk?

932
01:31:08,935 --> 01:31:11,028
<i>No.</i>

933
01:31:11,103 --> 01:31:14,539
<i>I am honest with you</i>
<i>as you are not honest with me.</i>

934
01:31:14,607 --> 01:31:16,700
<i>She made your mistake, Thorndike.</i>

935
01:31:16,776 --> 01:31:18,971
<i>She flaunted obvious power.</i>

936

<i>She refused to tell us anything.</i>

937
01:31:23,616 --> 01:31:27,347
Do you know that if it hadn't been for that
postal address you so thoughtfully wrote down...

938
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,786
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I should have done.</i>

939
01:31:29,855 --> 01:31:33,313
If you've harmed that girl,
I swear I'll kill you somehow!

940
01:31:33,392 --> 01:31:36,452
I'll live to kill you
if it's the last thing I do!

941
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:41,557
You believed that the death of our sacred
führer would be no great loss to the world.

942
01:31:41,634 --> 01:31:46,662
Surely, then, the death of a girl like <i>that</i>
would be no loss at all.

943
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:50,300
She was found dead
in the street, Thorndike.

944
01:31:50,376 --> 01:31:53,402
The police reported that she, uh...

945
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:56,180
jumped to her death from a window.

946
01:31:56,313 --> 01:31:59,976
She had nothing to do with my actions!
She was innocent! Innocent!

947
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:03,486
Yes, just as innocent as our führer
was of any wrongdoing against you.

948
01:32:03,554 --> 01:32:07,285
No! He's guilty- guilty against me
and against humanity!

949
01:32:07,358 --> 01:32:10,088
Against every decent,
peaceful person in the world!

950
01:32:10,161 --> 01:32:12,652
He's guilty of hatred,
intolerance and murder!

951
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:16,063
- <i>And that is why you tried to kill him?</i>
- Yes, I intended to shoot!

952
01:32:16,133 --> 01:32:19,102
I didn't know what I was doing!
I didn't realize my purpose!

953
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,003
I wouldn't face the fact
that I can make myself the instrument...

954
01:32:22,072 --> 01:32:24,802
of all the pitiable, oppressed,
suffering people of the world!

955
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:27,673
I wonder why I put that shell in my gun.
Now I know!

956
01:32:27,745 --> 01:32:32,409
Yes, I intended to kill! I intended to
avenge the crimes of this monstrous tyrant!

957
01:32:32,483 --> 01:32:35,179
- I know it now!
- <i>And you were acting for your government?</i>

958
01:32:35,252 --> 01:32:38,415
- No, for myself!
- <i>But it was for the sake of your country, wasn't it?</i>

959
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:42,152
No, for mine, as well as others.
For your misguided people as well as my own!

960
01:32:42,226 --> 01:32:45,662
<i>Then even though your government knew</i>
<i>nothing about you, you were acting on their behalf.</i>

961
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:48,823
- <i>No!</i>
- You said you wouldn't sign lies.
I've proved them true.

962
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:53,233
- <i>You've admitted the whole thing.</i>
- [Sighs]

963
01:32:54,772 --> 01:32:57,104
I have a plane
waiting for me in Croydon.

964
01:32:57,174 --> 01:33:01,543
I must soon go. But when I go, it will be
with that document, signed by yourself.

965
01:33:01,612 --> 01:33:04,775
It may interest you to know
why that document is needed.

966
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:10,048
It will make interesting reading when
we publish the first German white paper.

967
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,213
What do you mean?

968
01:33:12,289 --> 01:33:16,191
- <i>My country has already marched into Poland.</i>
- I don't believe you.

969
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,558
Twenty divisions
crossed the frontier today.

970
01:33:18,629 --> 01:33:22,497
<i>If you're telling the truth, England</i>
<i>and France will be at war with you within a week!</i>

971
01:33:22,566 --> 01:33:24,693
You're commencing to rave.

972
01:33:24,768 --> 01:33:30,001
We shall take Poland, and no nation
in Europe will dare to raise a hand.

973
01:33:30,074 --> 01:33:34,067
We're on the march at last, Thorndike.

974
01:33:34,144 --> 01:33:36,237
Today, Europe.

975
01:33:36,313 --> 01:33:38,543
Tomorrow, the world.

976
01:33:49,793 --> 01:33:53,024
<i>Thorndike.</i>

977
01:33:53,097 --> 01:33:55,657
<i>Thorndike, why don't you answer me?</i>

978
01:33:55,733 --> 01:33:57,826
Uh, what?

979
01:33:57,902 --> 01:34:00,769
<i>I'm waiting for you to sign.</i>

980
01:34:00,838 --> 01:34:05,775
Uh- I've- I've got
to read it, haven't I?

981
01:34:05,843 --> 01:34:08,437
<i>Oh, certainly.</i>
<i>Take your time.</i>

982
01:34:26,497 --> 01:34:29,625
- Have you got a cigarette?
- <i>Yes. Certainly.</i>

983
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:37,136
<i>It's on the stick.</i>
<i>Pull it in.</i>

984
01:34:49,653 --> 01:34:51,712
<i>Have you read it?</i>

985
01:34:52,856 --> 01:34:55,620
I've got to think it over.

986
01:34:57,861 --> 01:35:00,352
I shall give you
15 minutes, Thorndike.

987
01:35:05,302 --> 01:35:09,568
<i>When the time is up, if you haven't</i>
<i>delivered that document to me properly signed...</i>

988
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,803
<i>I shall shut off your air</i>
<i>and go on my way.</i>

989
01:35:12,876 --> 01:35:15,344
<i>You may last a few hours...</i>

990
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:19,246
<i>but they will be most unpleasant.</i>

991
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:22,376
How do I know you'll let me out
after I've signed?

992
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:26,915
I shall remove the outside stone...

993
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:30,017
when you're ready to hand it out.

994
01:35:30,094 --> 01:35:32,824
<i>And then shoot me when I crawl out.</i>

995
01:35:34,064 --> 01:35:36,328
My gun is in its holster.

996
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,496
<i>You will have to take my word</i>
<i>as a fellow hunter for that.</i>

997
01:35:42,006 --> 01:35:44,372
<i>Thirteen minutes, Thorndike.</i>

998
01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:23,471
I've removed the barrier, Thorndike.

999
01:36:23,547 --> 01:36:25,606
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1000
01:36:28,252 --> 01:36:31,312
- <i>Do you hear me, Thorndike?</i>
- Yes, I hear you.

1001
01:36:31,388 --> 01:36:34,186
<i>Five minutes more.</i>

1002
01:36:34,258 --> 01:36:36,692
Have you removed the outside stone?

1003
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,888
<i>Open your side of the cave,</i>
<i>and you'll see.</i>

1004
01:36:56,013 --> 01:36:59,312
- <i>Are you satisfied?</i>
- Yes, I can see it's clear.

1005
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:05,050
Your time is nearly up, Thorndike.

1006
01:37:05,122 --> 01:37:07,215
Hand out the document.

1007
01:37:07,291 --> 01:37:11,125
You'll have to reach for it.

1008
01:37:11,195 --> 01:37:13,925
Hand it out through the venthole.

1009
01:37:20,003 --> 01:37:22,301
<i>Your time is up.</i>
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

1010
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:25,170
<i>And be sure it's signed.</i>

1011
01:37:42,126 --> 01:37:44,924
<i>There it is.</i>

1012
01:37:44,995 --> 01:37:47,088
Push it nearer.

1013
01:37:47,164 --> 01:37:50,031
I don't propose
to have my wrist seized.

1014
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:57,969
You can come out now, Thorndike.

1015
01:38:01,378 --> 01:38:05,337
Come on out, Thorndike.
You're free at last.

1016
01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:15,216
<i>[Gasps]</i>

1017
01:38:27,204 --> 01:38:29,570
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

1018
01:39:49,686 --> 01:39:53,178
You're like that little arrow on your hat-
straight and shining-

1019
01:39:53,257 --> 01:39:55,953
and that's the way
I'll always remember you.

1020
01:40:00,964 --> 01:40:05,264
<i>[Quive-Smith] Surely then the death of</i>
<i>a girl like</i> that <i>would be no loss at all.</i>

1021
01:40:05,335 --> 01:40:09,032
Ain't-Ain't I never gonna see you again?

1022
01:40:10,674 --> 01:40:13,507
Every good soldier
needs a crest for his hat.

1023
01:40:22,286 --> 01:40:25,414
- <i>[Plane Engine Starts]</i>
- Your course and objective
are clearly marked on this map.

1024
01:40:25,489 --> 01:40:27,548
- Yes, sir.
- Here.

1025
01:40:27,624 --> 01:40:29,819
You will make your reconnaissance
and return immediately.

1026
01:40:29,893 --> 01:40:32,657
- Right, sir.
- <i>All the best, old chap.</i>

1027
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:34,822
Thank you, sir.

1028
01:41:08,432 --> 01:41:10,957
We've just passed over into Germany.

1029
01:41:11,034 --> 01:41:13,832
Right.

1030
01:41:13,904 --> 01:41:16,270
- One of the men just bailed out!
- What? Who?

1031
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:18,331
- Thorndike.
- Thorndike?

1032
01:41:24,014 --> 01:41:27,711
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>And from now on, somewhere within Germany...</i>

1033
01:41:27,784 --> 01:41:31,015
<i>is a man with a precision rifle...</i>

1034
01:41:31,088 --> 01:41:35,718
<i>and the high degree of intelligence</i>
<i>and training that is required to use it.</i>

1035
01:41:37,027 --> 01:41:40,292
<i>It may be days, months...</i>

1036
01:41:40,364 --> 01:41:42,457
<i>or even years...</i>

1037
01:41:42,532 --> 01:41:45,797
<i>but this time</i>
<i>he clearly knows his purpose...</i>

1038
01:41:45,869 --> 01:41:49,270
<i>and, unflinching, faces his destiny.</i>
