00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:03,975
<i>After conferring with Major Hewlett,</i>

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,850
we have agreed to pardon
your husband on one condition.

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:10,075
<i>That he signs an agreement
not to challenge the attainder.</i>

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,050
So you found that dragoon
you've been hunting at long last?

8
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:19,075
<i>Oh, no, I recall.</i>

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,200
You came back from Long
Island empty-handed.

10
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:25,425
<i>Whilst enduring torture at
the hands of my rebel captors,</i>

11
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,400
<i>I managed to wheedle out the fact
that they hailed from Setauket itself.</i>

12
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:30,375
Setauket?

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,500
I'd like to conduct an inquiry

14
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,625
beginning with the family names

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,450
<i>of Tallmadge and Brewster.</i>

16
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,600
We were engaged, secretly,

17
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,075
before he decided that
honoring his father's agreement

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
was more important than his vow to me.

19
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,837
<i>(Seagulls calling)</i>

20
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:00,113

22
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,630
Yes?

23
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,869
I'm off to see Cook.

24
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:59,170
I just wanted to say good luck.

25
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,310
Uh, you...

26
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,344
you just missed a...

27
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,913
Oh.

28
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,748
I'll get it for you.

29
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,621
Selah will be glad to see you.

30
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,892
Will he?

31
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,563
The moment after I show him this pardon,

32
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:27,164
I have the grand privilege to inform him

33
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,834
that all we own is forfeit.

34
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:32,736
And the last of his estate is being
parceled off to the Royal Army by you.

35
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,971
His fields will be
seized with or without me,

36
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,807
but with me, we earn
the trust of the enemy.

37
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:41,310
At least he'll be spared the
pain of looking on Setauket again.

38
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:44,748
Maybe life will improve
for us in Connecticut.

39
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,518
Connecticut?

40
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:51,788
Selah has family there and he
can recover under their care.

41
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,891
There's nothing left for us on Long Island.

42
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,997
I can't help but think about how things
might have turned out differently.

43
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh.

44
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:07,036
Major Hewlett, he was determined

45
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,439
to make a disciplinary example
for what happened in the tavern...

46
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,107
I meant between us.

47
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,842
If you hadn't broken our engagement,

48
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,244
none of this would've happened.

49
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,712
- It wasn't that simple.
- It was.

50
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,247
- No. No.
- Yes, it was.

51
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,517
I had obligations to
my family, to my father.

52
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,785
A father you never agreed with.

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,622
Look, after my brother
died at those riots...

54
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:30,024
Your brother died fighting for the king.

55
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,094
If Thomas' fate wasn't
a clear sign from God

56
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,028
to make a break with your
family, I don't know what is.

57
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,964
- You know nothing about it.
- Then tell me what happened.

58
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:37,532
Tell me why you broke your promise.

59
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,235
This is likely the last
we're to see each other.

60
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,471
Tell me the truth.

61
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,508
The truth is some things
just aren't meant to be.

Samuel.

00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,386
Yeah, Ben's brother.

00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:17,428
Dead. He's dead.

Ooh.

82
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:41,852
These two seem to know each other.

83
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,255

side! From those trees!

Rearguard formation! Get him up!

00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,510
Get back, men! Get behind the wagon!

You four come with me.

Major Rogers,

94
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,293
you fired on an exchange
sanctioned under the flag of truce.

95
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,595
I am hunting a fugitive

96
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,697
who is masquerading as a soldier.

97
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,800
A man you just let slip to the other side.

98
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,469
You have overstepped your bounds.

99
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:36,071
I will be reporting this
incident to your superiors.

100
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:40,275
I'll leave the chinwagging in
your capable hands, then, Captain.

101
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,350
What do we do now?

102

(Sighs)

103
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,888
Now we are going to hunt down Mr. Strong

and that curious bearded bastard

105
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,292

106
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,194
But ain't that rebel land

107
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,330

Be sure to give your father
my best upon your return.

122

Oh, I shall indeed, but, uh, he also said

123
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,132
he expected me to return with a story.

124
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,401
- Did he, now?
- Well, he did.

125
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,802
He said, "Son, you're in York City,

126
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,271
the greatest port in the colonies.

127
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,773
Drink Spanish wine, eat
Scottish salmon and...

128
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,610
- Together: Sing the "Song of Solomon!"
- That's right.

129
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,679
I was hoping that you might show
me the best places for singing.

130
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,248
At my expense, of course,
and we'll celebrate our deal.

131
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:10,250
Yes, well, I recommend
you sample it all, my lad,

132
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,884
but I'm afraid you have
to sing solo tonight.

133
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,819
I have a previous engagement.

134
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,322
Passing up on free quim? Must be important.

135
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,958
Who said anything about passing up quim?

136
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,760
I see.

137
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,228
What sort of engagement is this?

138
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,564
Oh, a local chapter of a very old club.

139
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,033
- The Masons?
- No, much more fun.

140
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,502
No, tonight's dinner is
headed by Major John Andre

141
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,804
and he's a marvelous toastmaster.

142
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,205
Oh.

143
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,409
Of course, outsiders are rarely allowed.

144
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,346
But there are exceptions.

145
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:43,515
Especially if there's business to be done.

146
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,585
Business?

147
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,621
What, you just leave him here, then?

148
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,523
He's not Samuel Tallmadge.

149
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,358
He's not even a soldier.

150
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,026
No, he's Selah Strong.
I've known him all my life.

151
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,828
He's more Patriot than
you and I put together.

152
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,931
He's not on the list.

153
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:03,301
And he was released to
our care by the enemy

154
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,803
- with some theatrics to boot.
- Theatrics? (Chuckles)

155
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,306
He's calling your wound
theatrics. I'd knock him out.

156
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,441
I will not bring him into camp.

157
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,810
Go.

158
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,377
I can make it on my own.

159
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,379
You can barely stand on your own two feet.

160
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,816
All right, when you do get back to camp,

161
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,985
you find Major Tallmadge,
tell him you're a nob,

162
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,386
and then tell him "Genevieve."

163
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:26,190
All right? He'll know what I mean.

164
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:28,091
Come on, Strong.

165
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:31,561
You're stuck with me till we
get into friendly territory.

166
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,300
(Jordan grunting, gasping)

167
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,074
When you're on the march,

168
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,744
act as if you were sneaking up on a deer.

169
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:50,513
Or a lion.

170
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,215
You don't weight me down like a mule,

171
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,915
maybe I don't make so much noise.

172
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,384
Shh.

173
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:05,193
See your enemy first
before he sees you, boy.

174
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,667
My name is Jordan, not "boy."

175
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,170
What's your true name, boy?

176
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,873
The one they beat out of you?

177
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,608
(Quietly) Akinbode.

178
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:23,511
- Louder.
- Akinbode.

179
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:26,514
<i>Rogers: Good, and do you know who I am?</i>

180
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:30,451
I'm the one who's gonna
give you your name back

181
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,221
as soon as I stop hearing you breathe.

182
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,963
<i>(People chatting)</i>

183
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,805
<i>(Footsteps approaching)</i>

184
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,743
<i>Anna?</i>

185
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:01,915
What are you doing here? Where's Selah?

186
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,417
How did it go with Cook?

187
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,589
He refused to sign the
agreement, didn't he?

188
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:11,792
Where is he? I'll talk to...

189
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,593
First, tell me what happened.

190
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:23,102
I signed over the
cauliflower, so that's done.

191
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:25,871
And then you gained his trust?

192
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:28,774
What I gained was an invite

193
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,410
to a social affair at
Major John Andre's house.

194
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,712
I can't have either of you
two frustrating the scheme.

195
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:36,081
I won't. I want to go with you.

196
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,851
Where? To the dinner?

197
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:40,285
- Tonight?
- You're allowed a guest.

198
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,354
This is the same Major John Andre

199
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,490
whom I deciphered the
safe house letter from.

200
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:47,092
The same Major John Andre whom my
housemaid Abigail is now set under.

201
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,194
- Well...
- I have friends inside. If it's a supper...

202
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:51,730
Abigail will likely be getting
supplies at the market near his house.

203
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,432
- And does Selah know about this?
- Selah's dead.

204
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,970
He's been dead for two months.

205
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:02,173
I have nowhere to go. I am going with you.

206
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:13,117
- Anna, I am so sorry.
- To hell with sorrow.

207
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:16,287
It's revenge I'm after
and I'll see it done.

208
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,325
Listen to me.

209
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,562
While you are in this state, you
will likely give us both away.

210
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,631
That is why I can't take you.

211
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,332
They have taken everything from me.

212
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,800
I know.

213
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,836
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

214
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:35,106
We can talk about everything, all right?

215
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,741
But until then, you must
promise me that you'll wait here.

216
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:41,812
Promise me you'll wait.

217
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,319
(Selah coughing)

218
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,920
Just a bit further.

219
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,124
Can't. Need to rest.

220
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:58,094
All right, here. Sip and
stretch. Can't stop long.

221
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,566
Here.

222
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,070
So, this Genevieve...

223
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,272
is a tavern wench?

224
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,607
Aye, prettiest I've ever seen.

225
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,943
That's where we're headed...
Elizabeth Town Tavern.

226
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,011
Was she dark or fair?

227
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,379
She were both.

228
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,215
Like my Anna?

229
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,817
<i>(Clanging)</i>

230
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,920
<i>- Get down!
- (Gunshot)</i>

231
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,497
It's three against two.

232
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,499
In your shite condition, it's
more like three against one.

233
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,702
- Robert Rogers?
- Aye, I think so.

234
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,871
Give me a gun.

235
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:48,309
Well, the bright side,
if Rogers does kill us,

236
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:51,379
<i>at least Benny boy will be
still alive to murder him, huh?</i>

237
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,713
<i>(Caleb chuckles)</i>

238
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,822
- Captain Henry?
- Major.

239
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,357
What news of the prisoner exchange?

240
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,461
We were ambushed, sir. Queen's Rangers.

241
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:08,928
What?

242
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,697
My brother? Where's my brother?

243
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,764
They attempted to pose
another man in his stead, sir.

244
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,900
<i>Brewster vouched for
him, but I couldn't risk</i>

245
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,268
bringing an unknown prisoner back to camp.

246
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:18,670
What about Brewster? Where's Brewster?

247
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,706
He headed north, sir,
through neutral territory.

248
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,442
He said to tell you "Genevieve."

249
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:24,910
He was sure you'd understand what it meant.

250
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,645
Come on, boy.

251
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,818
(Chatter)

252
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:37,155
Three dozen to be sent directly to
the residence of Major John Andre.

253
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,823
Abigail.

254
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:40,758
Anna.

255
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,128
You're in New York?

256
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,895
- But why?
- Cicero's fine, Abby.

257
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,797
He's staying with
Aberdeen for a short spell

258
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,933
while I take care of
business here in the city.

259
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,868
Did you get my message about Simcoe?

260
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,004
I did and I thank you, but right now

261
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:55,406
I'm more concerned with the dinner
you're preparing for tonight.

262
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,541
- How did you know?
- I want you to help me get in.

263
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:00,244
You don't, trust me.

264
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,878
It's no place for a lady.

265
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:05,449
- Especially you.
- You let me determine that.

266
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:08,452
It's too dangerous for me.

267
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,256
You asked a favor of me once.

268
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,657
You asked me to care for your son.

269
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,626
I want that favor returned.

270
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,994
- You don't own me anymore.
- I own nothing anymore.

271
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,230
And you will get me into that
party whether you like it or not.

272
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,232
Madam, is this slave troubling you?

273
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,901
<i>If so, I'll see to it she's taken care of.</i>

274
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:30,005
No, we just had a simple misunderstanding.

275
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:33,409
But that's all been made clear.

276
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,044
Isn't that right?

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,109
Simcoe: Thank you for
sitting with me, Mr. Robeson.

278
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:45,012
Well, If I can be of aid, I will.

279
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,881
I've been charged by Major Hewlett

280
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,849
- with ferreting out a conspiracy in town.
- Conspiracy?

281
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:53,653
Tell me what you know about Benjamin
Tallmadge and Caleb Brewster.

282
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,755
Well, there's not much to tell, really.

283
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,190
Any associates? People in the town

284
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,558
they might've been in league with?

285
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:01,028
Well, there's Tallmadge's father.

286
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,795
He used to be the minister here.

287
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,431
And Brewster?

288
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:08,402
His father died of the
palsy a few years back.

289
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,970
Has a sister still alive with it

290
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,572
and an uncle he was very fond of.

291
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:16,175
What about that weasel
Woodhull, for example?

292
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,245
The one who got away with
the murder of Captain Joyce?

293
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,849
Ensign Clayton killed the captain.

294
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,153
<i>Do you really believe that one
of His Majesty's finest captains</i>

295
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,422
was done in by the regimental drummer?

296
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,364
If it's rebel sympathizers
you're looking for,

297
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:42,501
the petition for the New York
Convention is a good place to start.

298
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,237
Petition?

299
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,806
<i>(Men laughing)</i>

Here's someone you should meet.

315
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,977
Major Andre, may I
present Abraham Woodhull,

316
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,278
a trader from Long Island?

317
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,784
Major Andre. It's an
honor to meet you, sir.

318
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,685
Gird yourself for battle, Mr. Woodhull.

319
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,389
We plan to give Dionysus a
spirited contest for his crown.

320
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,057
They are, of course, ahead of us.

321
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,959
Each man is budgeted for
one bottle of champagne,

322
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,229
three bottles of wine during,
and one bottle of port after.

323
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,232
One's glass must always be full.

324
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,066
So you're our man on Long Island?

325
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,002
Oh, Woodhull. Abraham Woodhull.

326
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:55,005
<i>- Officer: Challenge!
- Men: Challenge!</i>

327
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,339
Colonel Cook.

328
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,573
Oh, don't dare to dream

329
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,842
you can outbumper me, young man.

330
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,378
Answer my challenge and
we'll bumper together.

331
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,513
Oh!

332
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,781
Who would you kill...

333
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:09,018
if there were no repercussions
and you could get away clean?

334
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,355
You, for positing a challenge
worthy of a first-rate tonker.

335
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,391
(Laughing)

336
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:18,092
Yeah, bumper!

Oh, oh!

(All cheer)

339
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,566
Now answer your own frivolous
thrust. Who would you kill?

340
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,302
George Washington, so we
can end this bloody war.

341
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,604

<i>won't hit his mark too soon.</i>

There's profit to be
made in this bloody war.

345
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,816
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

346
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,118
How can I be of assistance?

347
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:47,087
<i>The army needs fuel,</i>

348
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:50,957
and coal from Durham and South
Wales is too expensive to ship.

349
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,826
Cordwood will suffice,

350
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,628
and the orchards on Long
Island are a rich source.

351
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:58,765

532
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:48,385
I'm sorry about Sammy, Tall-boy. I am.

533
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,453
And I can't bring him back like I promised.

534
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,789
But I can help you get out of
these woods and back to camp.

535
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,229
<i>(Horse whinnies)</i>

536
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:03,299
Shite.

537
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:05,168
<i>Blake: Hold the line.</i>

538
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:08,537
Uh, about getting you back to camp...

539
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:13,842
Whoa. Whoa.

540
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:15,277
We know you're there.

541
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:18,447
<i>We followed the report of your guns.</i>

542
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:21,483
This standoff must cease and desist

543
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:24,119
by order of Major John Andre.

544
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:27,856
<i>Both parties must put aside their arms</i>

545
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,724
and come down!

546
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,326
<i>(Men shouting, laughing)</i>

547
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,076
<i>(Footsteps)</i>

548
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,615
(Whispering) Get out of here.

549
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,250
Weir is coming and...

550
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,059
(Panting) Now you'll take me?

551
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,728
Out of what, jealousy?

552
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,429
If you'd married me, none
of this would've happened.

553
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,764
Mm.

554
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,466
But you're afraid to act from your heart.

555
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,902
You're a coward who lives for caution,

556
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,737
afraid of your own shad...

557
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,475
Uh-oh.

558
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,678
Didn't expect I'd get you
back quite so soon, eh? Eh?

559
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,882
Don't worry, you can have a
taste of this bun if you like,

560
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,050
now that it's been buttered.

561
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,653
I will not be played for a fool.

562
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,626
- Now look what you've done.
- Where's the book?

563
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,162
(Chattering)

564
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:02,906
I want your backwater scab out of here now.

565
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:08,310
You can't possibly understand a word of it.

566
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:11,447
It's a code key, all
right? The same as ours.

567
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,749
Ben will be able to decipher it.

568
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:25,027
Abraham, wait.

569
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,729
What do you think you're doing?

570
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,098
You were gonna lay with him,
is that it? Is that your plan?

571
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:31,767
You would've spread your legs for...

572
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,802
I don't care what happens
to my body, not anymore.

573
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:36,337
Well, neither do I.

574
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:37,773
Is this man bothering you?

575
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:40,275
<i>(Abe scoffs) Me?</i>

576
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:42,509
I think that you'd find,
sir, that the bother was mine.

577
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:44,779
<i>All right? She's dry as dust.</i>

578
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:48,215
I suggest you chuck her back in
the trough with the rest of them.

579
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:51,552
There is a line, sir,
and you've crossed it.

580
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,956
Time for you to retire.

581
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:03,664
(Laughing)

582
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:06,968
Mr. Woodhull will be leaving us.

583
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,469
He can't leave yet. He
hasn't answered the challenge.

584
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,037
There is no challenge for him.

585
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,239
I've stopped that game.
I'll see myself out.

586
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:14,007
- The challenge must be answered!
- I'll see myself out.

587
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,909
- Please.
- The challenge must be answered.

588
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:18,178
Who would you kill? We demand your answer.

589
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,231
Ahem.

590
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,572
I would ki...

591
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,444
I would kill the man who killed my brother.

592
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,414
Well, I am piqued. Carry on.

593
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:56,882
All right.

594
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,852
You'll all remember the Liberty Pole riots

595
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:01,854
at the commons near King's
College about three years ago.

596
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:04,056
Sons of Liberty would erect their poles

597
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,825
and our men would tear
it down week in, week out.

598
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,796
- Like a game.
- I was a student of the law back then.

599
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,832
I had no time for games.

600
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,901
Until one night some drunken fool,

601
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:18,003
he climbed up the pole,

602
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:20,673
he put a Phrygian cap on the top.

603
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:24,043
<i>It was just another game,</i>

604
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:27,780
to be sure, a prank.

605
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:29,281
But that cap, that...

606
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,416
that ancient

607
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,819
Roman symbol of freedom,

608
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:38,823
that was a direct insult to our king.

609
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:41,459
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

610
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:43,828
It was a prank.

611
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:47,566
A prank turned a game into a riot,

612
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,101
a riot that my...

613
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:53,338
<i>- my brother Thomas...
- (Voices echoing)</i>

614
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:55,039
he came down to put it down.

615
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:59,244
He was a captain in the
king's militia back then.

616
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:06,017
And he was outnumbered
by the rioters that day.

617
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:13,592
I don't want the man who...

618
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,929
who ran him through or the...

619
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,434
the man who trampled him.

620
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,851
I want the...

621
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,120
the coward...

622
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,991
who put the hat on the pole.

623
00:37:49,962 --> 00:37:52,496
Because without him...

624
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,368
none of it would've happened, so...

625
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,509
<i>Officer: Well, that was bleak.</i>

626
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:08,078
(Laughing)

627
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:10,714
(Chatter resumes)

628
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:15,986
- I'm sorry, miss.
- (Gasps) My dress.

629
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,589
Let me get something to clean it.

630
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:28,532
Don't think twice about it, Abigail.

631
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:31,501
Let it go. Thank you, Abigail.

632
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:48,017
(Laughing, chattering)

633
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,098
The flag of truce is a symbol

634
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:57,769
that must be treated with the highest
honor and respect at all times,

635
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:02,307
not the least of which during a
sanctioned exchange of prisoners.

636
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:05,276
As representatives of His
Excellency, General George Washington,

637
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,912
we do concur and abide by this tradition.

638
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,915
That man is not who he pretends to be.

639
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,618
May I see your papers, sir?

640
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:29,266
Are you Samuel Tallmadge?

641
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,304
Yes, I am.

642
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:37,674
This man is my only brother,

643
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,843
<i>Captain Samuel Tallmadge,</i>

644
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,279
imprisoned on the Jersey
these past six months.

645
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,815
So confirmed.

646
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,218
I place these three
men under my protection,

647
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,254
and you, Major,

648
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,357
<i>have orders to report
to Major Andre at once.</i>

649
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,963
There is no place on this
continent that you can hide from me.

650
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,298
Oh, I won't be hiding.

651
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,570
Tallmadge.

652
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,406
One good hat deserves another.

653
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:17,179
- A petition?
- Yes.

654
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,848
A local is helping me track it down.

655
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,517
Judge Woodhull was looking for a petition,

656
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:25,621
<i>one that named Selah Strong as
a delegate to an illegal body.</i>

657
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:27,089
Selah Strong?

658
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:30,793
Even with this petition,

659
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:34,830
we would need more hard evidence
there are rebels in our midst.

660
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,599
See to it.

661
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:40,267
Quietly.

662
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,337
Of course, sir.

663
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,229
<i>Anna: You started the riots?</i>

664
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:12,433
Who else knows?

665
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:16,603
Just you.
