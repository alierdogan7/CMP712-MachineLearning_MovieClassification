1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,751
L"m Pernille Bech Christensen,
the editor.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,593
- Morten Søborg, cameraman.
- L"m Susanne Bier. L"m the director.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,670
This was added quite late
in the production process.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,997
Before we started shooting,
we discussed -

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,272
- whether we could find
a type of images -

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,677
- that didn"t simply
tell the story. Isn"t that right?

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,440
Yes.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,191
We talked about
things like split-screen.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,312
Pernille,
how did we start on this?

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,672
We tried split-screen,
but it was not a good idea.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,874
It made you schizophrenic.
And it was inaccurate.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,073
We wanted to decide
whom you should be watching.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,670
So we ditched that.
Then some time elapsed -

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,317
- during which we were busy
getting the structure in place.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,149
But we felt that there was
something missing.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,114
We took a break in the editing
for other reasons.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,997
During that period, a lot of work
went into finding material.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,670
Then we found out
that we wanted material -

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,873
- which wasn"t concrete
in scenic terms.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,236
All those sequences with eyes
and reeds and stuff.

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,752
There is a connection
to the story, -

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,637
- but they"re not necessarily
part of individual scenes.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,516
We talked about time lapse,
remember? We talked about flowers.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,109
You should explain
what time lapse is.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,998
It"s when you film a single image
every day for a week and play it -

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,629
- at normal speed.
So the pupa turns into a butterfly -

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,834
- in seconds.
The same with a flower.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,158
But we couldn"t find those at first.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,909
And now it seems like
a strange choice.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,157
Going back to the film, -

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,113
- perhaps we should talk
about the music for a bit.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,791
It"s really characteristic here.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,439
- It wasn"t easy.
- We kind of had the same debate.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,034
We wanted something with
a tone that was a bit different.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,153
Part of the film
takes place in Afghanistan.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,477
We wanted to incorporate
that into the music.

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,231
At the same time,
the film is based is Denmark, -

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,318
- so there also had to be
this Scandinavian...

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,672
We spent a lot of time trying to
make that connection.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,795
Ulrich and Nikolaj
are in their stride now.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,391
Maybe we should explain why
we chose two actors -

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,797
- who don"t look like each other
to play brothers -

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,629
- in a film called "Brothers".

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,317
I feel that there"s something
in their eyes that is similar.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,275
And their parents,
Bent Mejding and Solbjørg Højfeldt, -

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,916
- each resemble one of them.
That often happens in families.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,954
One child looks like one parent,
the other child resembles the other.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,118
That"s why we did it this way.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,552
Morten, would you like to say
something about shooting in cars?

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,233
Here it"s difficult to see
where the camera is.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,199
After some thought we altered
a longer car so it looked...

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,472
We put the front seats
where the backseat was -

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,672
- and the backseat in the boot.

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,271
So we turned an estate
into a small family saloon.

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,873
The car is being towed.
L"m where the wheel and pedals are.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,310
We took out the front seats.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,675
- I think it worked very well.
- The viewers won"t think about it.

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,718
If you know a lot about cars, you"ll
see that the doors look different.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,550
But you really get the feeling
that they are driving in their Polo.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,149
Maybe you should explain why?

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,157
Normally, you shoot this with
a camera fixed to the car outside.

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,152
Or the camera
is on a crane on the car -

63
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,717
- towing the one with the actors.

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,718
But this film is shot
with hand-held cameras.

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,869
We wanted to be close to the actors.

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,959
In the car with them.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,038
We wanted to preserve
this hand-held feel -

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,596
- and be able
to pan from one to the other.

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,952
The funny thing about a film
which is hand-held and...

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,359
...and has...

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,833
Not that it is a Dogma film,
but there is a certain Dogma look.

72
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,398
It took a lot of technical stuff
to keep the nearness of Dogma -

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,913
- but still be free from it.
Like in the car.

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,513
Here we"re in a house
up in Farum, -

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,269
- which we rented and redecorated.

76
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,116
In a Dogma film,
you find an actual house.

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,312
We could make it look
exactly the way we wanted.

78
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,593
That gives a certain freedom. But
also a compulsion to think about -

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,353
- what this family looks like
and how they live and so on.

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,590
Why did you choose this, rather
than building it on a soundstage?

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,794
Because of people
walking in and out and stuff.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,994
And the texture of a real house.
This house has three floors.

83
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,069
You can look out of the window.
The sense of reality is far better -

84
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,752
- than a studio set.
And you can let the scene go on -

85
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,511
- when they leave the room.

86
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Another thing we kept
from Dogma was...

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,157
We shot the scenes...

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,875
This scene starts
with someone ringing the door.

89
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,916
We follow them all the way in
until they"re seated at the table.

90
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:25,390
In a traditional shoot, it would be
divided into different positions.

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,229
Like you film the brothers
saying hello at the door -

92
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,994
- and their mother coming in.
It gives the acting a different flow.

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,196
The same goes for the sound.
We took care that every line -

94
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,589
- is in the same good quality,
even if the actor is off-camera.

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,388
So the mike is on them all the time,
so they have to keep acting.

96
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,111
This means that they have
microphones in their hair.

97
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,110
You can"t cover a whole scene
like this with a boom mike.

98
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,155
So they have mikes in their hair,
which annoyed them at times.

99
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,831
But they are necessary
if you want good sound -

100
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,955
- and if they are to go on acting -

101
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,311
- even though
they are not in a close-up.

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,511
This way of shooting, doing
a whole scene from start to finish, -

103
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,159
- gives you freedom... You don"t
have to decide about a scene -

104
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,194
- until you"re sure
you"re happy with it.

105
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,509
It"s possible to change the acting.
Whereas traditional shooting -

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,829
- would mean that you"d be
stuck with a certain beginning.

107
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,794
So they have to play
in a fixed direction -

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,879
- even though new ideas might
come up. We used this very often.

109
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,632
For example,
with the master shot.

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,674
We nearly always changed it
when the acting really buzzed.

111
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,477
Started with that, then try to get
closer and finishing with the same.

112
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,673
Maybe we should explain
the master shot.

113
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,032
In a traditional film,
you start with an establishing shot -

114
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,836
- with all the people in the scene,
then move in closer on individuals.

115
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,556
In a traditional film, you"re tied
down by this establishing shot.

116
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,754
We often do this wide shot
and then make close-ups.

117
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,839
Sometimes you don"t know
what a person feels...

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,034
Or rather, the director doesn"t
know what the actor should feel -

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,631
- until the close-ups. You can"t
really see it until you see the eyes.

120
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,994
Once we"ve seen that, we often
change the establishing shot.

121
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,035
And then it"s easy to do.
You can"t just change the order.

122
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,110
You have to be aware of all the
characters" physical relations -

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:23,000
- before shooting close-ups.
When you get the feeling right, -

124
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,675
- you can keep the physical pattern,
but with much stronger feelings.

125
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,116
But this presumes...
If you want that freedom, -

126
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,788
- it"s nearly always...

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,958
This scene was completely ad-lib.

128
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,951
Nearly all the light comes from lamps
you can tolerate in the frame.

129
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,759
Usually, you rig up the lights
and change it scene by scene.

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,112
This means you can"t go back
and change the establishing shot.

131
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,677
Here we are in Afghanistan,
which is actually Spain.

132
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,992
This is a closed airfield in Spain.

133
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,478
While we were shooting,
a plane suddenly came in.

134
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,828
- Yes. It tried to land.
- Putting us all in great danger.

135
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,030
So it wasn"t quite closed.

136
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,234
But it was interesting to have
this mix of Copenhagen -

137
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,834
- and something that was totally
different and deserted.

138
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,238
- And not safe.
- Copenhagen?

139
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,278
We cut back and forth to
pictures from Copenhagen -

140
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,870
- to create a mix of the two worlds.

141
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,554
Jens Peter Johansen. Hardly knows
how to wipe his own bottom.

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,836
Here we tried one of the interesting
things that happen in every film.

143
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,192
There are always scenes that
are meant to provide information -

144
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,475
- on certain people and actions.
You feel tied down by them -

145
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,356
- when writing the script,
and also when editing.

146
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,113
But as you go along, you realize how
much information you can take out.

147
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,393
And people still understand.
It gets you every time.

148
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,679
If you knew this in advance,
you could axe a lot of scenes, -

149
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,668
- which would make the producer
happy because he saves money.

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,192
But you can"t do that because you
only find out as you go along -

151
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,995
- what information can be discarded.

152
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,833
Here we had much more information
about his mission which we axed.

153
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,238
You just see that he"s arrived and
stuff. You don"t get to know much.

154
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,835
Here"s a helicopter that is not
there. It was computer-generated.

155
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,592
So I shot a non-existent helicopter.

156
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,712
This was shot at Værløse airbase.

157
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,913
Yes, in a real helicopter.

158
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,434
But the scenery was shot in Spain
without a helicopter.

159
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,997
It will crash in a moment.
Talk us through the technical stuff.

160
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,150
This explosion is just a flash and
smoke, and me shaking the camera.

161
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,558
This is the C.G. Helicopter
crashing, -

162
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,914
- but the explosion was made
by our special-effects people.

163
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,430
- In Spain?
- Yes.

164
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,953
So the smoke and the fire are real.
And the computer guys shot -

165
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,835
- debris falling into the water
and ripples and stones.

166
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,068
We spent half a day throwing
stones into the water and stuff...

167
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,592
Here"s a scene
which was in the script.

168
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,475
But the editor was sure
we didn"t have it.

169
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,789
She"s usually right,
but the director was happy -

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,675
- to discover
that it actually was that scene.

171
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,558
I could say something about
editing... No, l"d better not.

172
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,796
Go on.

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,996
In the old days, we used to cut
film which had more detail.

174
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,320
Now we edit on a computer.
We hadn"t spotted that -

175
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,988
- Connie"s breasts were visible.

176
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,990
She had a contract
dealing with nudity.

177
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,078
We were not allowed to show it.

178
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,956
But we almost didn"t see it
until we viewed the final film.

179
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,551
Then someone shouted: "Help!
What"s that in the bathtub?"

180
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,108
So we had to hide them
digitally under some water.

181
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,029
No one had seen it
when we were editing.

182
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,509
This scene just now had a very
long dialogue, which was cut too.

183
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,158
Because when two men
in uniform come -

184
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,477
- and she cries,
we understand what has happened.

185
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,797
On the other hand, you can"t
do it like that in a script, -

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,151
- so you do write a long scene,
which you shorten afterwards.

187
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,069
You know that when two men
in uniform ring the door, -

188
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,192
- it"s bad news.

189
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,757
And we"ve just seen
a plane crashing.

190
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,279
This is the scene where Nikolaj
Lie Kaas had really been drinking -

191
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,955
- before playing drunk. I don"t think
it came as a shock to anyone.

192
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,757
Actors use different tools to reach
a certain state.

193
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:35,469
It"s quite normal to want to feel
a little alcohol when playing drunk.

194
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,873
- He does a really good job.
- He really was drunk.

195
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,757
Well, he remembered his lines.
It wasn"t that bad.

196
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,952
- He didn"t make a single mistake.
- A car will come by in a moment.

197
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,598
I had arranged for that,
so you could see him.

198
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,075
He came up to me:

199
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,231
"Amazing! The same car keeps
driving by at the same time."

200
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,230
I played along. "Yes, it"s crazy.
Are you serious?"

201
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,911
He believed it. I told him the next
day that we had arranged it.

202
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,718
So he must have been a little drunk.

203
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,079
- She looks so damn great.
- Yes, it"s so annoying.

204
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,512
- And practically without makeup.
- It is without makeup.

205
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,396
We tried to find things where
she looks ugly, but we couldn"t.

206
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,836
- It"s so unfair.
- It is, in a way.

207
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,273
- She looks better on film.
- No, she looks great in real life.

208
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,190
Yes, but there"s something
on film that...

209
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,635
She can really carry a close-up.
We have to hand her that.

210
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,752
Here comes the car.

211
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,953
The advantage of working
with a hand-held camera is -

212
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,517
- that we can actually shoot
in such a small house.

213
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,110
In the traditional way it would
be nearly impossible to shoot.

214
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,436
- Isn"t it a terraced house?
- Yes.

215
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,954
When you work like that,
you can consistently choose -

216
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,630
- what benefits the story
and the characters the most.

217
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,355
If you let the parents
live in such a house, -

218
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,109
- you don"t have to choose
what is practical for the crew.

219
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,836
You normally end up with solutions
that are practical for the crew, -

220
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,956
- but not the best thing
for the story.

221
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,720
Michael"s dead.

222
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,593
I think the smaller, the better.

223
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,396
The narrower and lower it is,
the better.

224
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,309
It gives the images
a three-dimensional effect.

225
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,799
I think this is one of Anders Thomas"
most brilliant lines.

226
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,111
When she talks about Mozart and The
Beatles instead of expressing grief.

227
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,836
Anders Thomas can really be human
without being mawkish.

228
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,349
Here we discussed
for a long time -

229
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:06,352
- when to let the audience know
that he was alive.

230
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,111
Since it"s Ulrich Thomsen,
it"s kind of obvious -

231
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,437
- that he doesn"t die that soon.

232
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,996
We...

233
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,954
This scene went in and out
of the movie a few times.

234
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,277
It got back in because
we wanted to prolong the grief.

235
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,555
We wanted the audience
to realize -

236
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,230
- what it meant to the relatives.

237
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,231
You constantly have to weigh
the pros and cons -

238
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,152
- of taking the plot further, or
whether to focus on the characters, -

239
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,956
- so you"re with them
when you move on.

240
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,755
Here we made
a very distinctive choice -

241
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,428
- to let them feel their emotions -

242
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,034
- before we continued
with Ulrich Thomsen"s story.

243
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,199
Those children are so great.

244
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,914
They"re just...

245
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,715
Maybe you should talk about
how to get them to cry.

246
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,958
It varies. There are different
methods of getting them to cry.

247
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,679
You can use makeup
for their eyes and so on.

248
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,796
But that doesn"t work
if they don"t act it well.

249
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,872
In American films you often see fake
tears rolling down a child"s cheek, -

250
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,231
- and you don"t feel anything.

251
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,637
But these girls
really dug into their roles.

252
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,071
Here we made
a really beautiful scene.

253
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,753
We had been cutting to Ulrich
being found and driven to the camp -

254
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,353
- in a Godfather-like way.
So it switches back and forth.

255
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,677
It was very beautiful, -

256
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,911
- but it was sacrificed
for the sake of the story.

257
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,432
And it was the right thing to do.
But it was tough.

258
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,350
That day, the editor and the director
had a major falling-out.

259
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,313
It was difficult to do.

260
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,512
But it was a bit too much format.

261
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,398
It makes you puke when
you hear this "kill you, darling".

262
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,038
It"s so damn annoying.
But in a way it is true.

263
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,713
Because sometimes you have to
sacrifice something you like -

264
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,359
- to take the story further
or to outline the characters more.

265
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,519
Sometimes you have to discard
something for the sake of the whole.

266
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,191
It would be distracting to know
here that he was alive.

267
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,598
It would ruin the dialogue.

268
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,518
Because the other part kept
coming in.

269
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,678
I can"t feel it.

270
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,759
Don"t you think l"d feel it
if he was dead?

271
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,915
This line, of course, fits nicely
with the fact that we know by now -

272
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,190
- that he is alive.

273
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
Here"s one of my
favourite scenes.

274
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,749
There has been some criticism
of the parents.

275
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,554
Bent Mejding
and Solbjørg Højfeldt.

276
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,880
I think they played fantastically.
People felt they were clichéd.

277
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,914
It is not the way they act,
but the way they are written.

278
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,910
I think that"s unfair, too.
They"re terrific.

279
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,714
Seeing how
little space they get, -

280
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,836
- they create an image
I think is very recognizable.

281
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,909
I think this scene
is absolutely superb.

282
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,954
Do you understand? Do you?

283
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,676
And the minor parts
have to be forceful.

284
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,316
- Let"s go, for Christ"s sake.
- Give me the keys. L"ll drive.

285
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,715
Give me the fucking keys!

286
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,516
I think he"s touching
and very funny, too.

287
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,954
- But not in this particular scene.
- Yes, he is. "Move over."

288
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,157
"Daddy sits here."
That"s funny.

289
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,509
The reeds again.

290
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,999
This is in Spain.

291
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,309
We alternate between them
driving home while he is found.

292
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,833
So we still alternate between Denmark
and Spain, like we did on the bus.

293
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,989
- Denmark and Afghanistan.
- We did say it was Spain.

294
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,192
It was a pleasure to work
with these English actors.

295
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,278
Yes, they were really good.

296
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,554
And I think they enjoyed it, because
they"re used to more rigid methods.

297
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,357
It stimulated them that
things were so flexible -

298
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,279
- and that the camera
was so flexible.

299
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,075
And the chance to play something
else than a doctor or a lawyer.

300
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,272
One of them said
the only calls he got were -

301
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,711
- for minor parts
as a doctor or a lawyer in TV-series.

302
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,550
If you"re an Indian or look ethnic,
you"re always in a hospital -

303
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,959
- as a doctor or lawyer.
That"s what they said.

304
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,312
So I think they really had fun
playing the bad guys.

305
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,513
It was a gigantic project
to build this camp.

306
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,751
We were terrified that it wouldn"t
work, that it would look bogus.

307
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,911
We had all sorts of military
and ethnic experts -

308
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,673
- to keep us from making mistakes.

309
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,711
We suddenly had our permit
for the first location withdrawn.

310
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,435
So after we"d started filming in
Denmark, the set designer had to -

311
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,108
- go back to Spain
to find a new location.

312
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,314
- The house was there.
- Yes, with a couple of changes.

313
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,956
This room didn"t exist,
and there wasn"t much of a roof.

314
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,357
So they made some changes.

315
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,076
But again,
we started with a location.

316
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,273
We didn"t build it on a sound stage.

317
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,157
Then we couldn"t have followed him
into the room and improvised.

318
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,272
Everything would have been settled:
"You look out there."

319
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,517
"In two months,
we will shoot what you see."

320
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,510
We discussed whether those
palm trees belonged in Afghanistan.

321
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,315
They have palm trees.
Maybe not as high, but they do.

322
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,718
- Kurt said so.
- We believe Kurt.

323
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,915
But it"s not that important
for the story where it is.

324
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,794
This is another scene that...

325
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,120
I love scenes like this, where she
irons his shirt although he"s dead.

326
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,515
I don"t know why.

327
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,159
It just has something very simple
about it that"s really beautiful.

328
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,749
But quite unrealistic.

329
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,112
Not many living men
get their shirts ironed.

330
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,350
Well, okay...

331
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,797
Here"s more parallel action.
We use that a lot.

332
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,599
It"s a balancing act to keep
so many balls in the air.

333
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,553
We had quite a few screenings
along the way -

334
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,914
- where opinions differed on
when to go to which story.

335
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,275
It"s a balancing act.
You can"t make everyone happy.

336
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,794
In the end we decided that
we had to be happy with it.

337
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,313
Some felt we should stay with
Connie and Nikolaj longer -

338
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,992
- before going back to...
Ulrich again.

339
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,754
There were many different versions.

340
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,428
But we ended up simplifying it.

341
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,111
We started by cutting
back and forth many times, -

342
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,031
- but we reduced it more and more.
And we watched other films too, -

343
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,153
- such as "The Deer Hunter"
and "The Godfather".

344
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,033
They are our role models.

345
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,992
The DVD also had a commentary.

346
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,275
And they actually had
the same issues in both films.

347
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,873
There had been much more
cross-cutting at first.

348
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,390
You might say that...

349
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,230
It"s interesting to have
parallel progress.

350
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,197
Cross-cutting works really well
in thrillers, -

351
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,350
- where the story is really driven
by the plot in both locations.

352
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,157
When the story is about emotion,
too much alternation...

353
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,999
It"s the same in novels.

354
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,115
You never get pause with the
characters and their emotions.

355
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,518
So you sort of lose interest.
That was our dilemma.

356
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,192
We talked about abrasive
cutting between scenes.

357
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,558
They"re still there,
only a lot fewer.

358
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,916
Here we are in a car at night, which
entails many interesting things.

359
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,671
Let"s not forget our stuntman,
who waited until 4 in the morning -

360
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,238
- only to be edited out.
She was supposed to hit a cyclist.

361
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,273
Evil, evil editor.

362
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,589
Many films have big scenes -

363
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,917
- which were very important
during filming, -

364
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,193
- but end up being edited out.

365
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,997
That"s because film
is an organic process, -

366
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,715
- which develops its own truth
at different moments.

367
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,630
Lots of important things
just don"t work.

368
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,879
Or rather,
the focus shifts to something else.

369
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,555
I don"t think it"s that bad,
the stuff we end up cutting out.

370
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,871
Actually,
we use most of our material.

371
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,471
On this one we didn"t cut out nearly
as much as on "Open Hearts".

372
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,071
We really cut a lot on that one.
The script was too long as well.

373
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,114
It"s one page per minute average.
I can"t remember the number, -

374
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,440
- but we knew it was too long. But
it was difficult to say in advance:

375
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,394
"Should this scene stay in
ahead of this one?"

376
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,391
Here the girls can flip pancakes
in a big way. They loved that.

377
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,195
- And Nikolaj has a hangover.
- A real hangover?

378
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,915
No. But he did it very well.

379
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,669
It"s tough to get little girls
who are flipping pancakes -

380
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,228
- to stand in the same spot
when they say their lines.

381
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,955
- And making them say it.
- No, they were fantastic.

382
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,118
Yes, they were.

383
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,869
When we read the scene
we thought: "Oh dear."

384
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,074
But it was a positive surprise
when we shot it.

385
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,515
Granddad!

386
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,631
Hi.

387
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,436
Come on, girls.
Granddad"s waiting.

388
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,234
We also put the kitchen
in the place where we wanted it.

389
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,470
- It"s not actually there at all.
- We moved it to a better spot.

390
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,915
We put up a kitchen there.
I think it was in their TV-lounge.

391
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,632
We did it because their kitchen
was far from the story.

392
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,992
This kitchen is very central,
and it can be seen from above -

393
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,078
- and from the side.

394
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,034
I completely forgot about this.

395
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,835
Sometimes when the actors turn up in
the morning in their own clothes, -

396
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,479
- I get annoyed. Because Nicolaj
should be Jannik, not himself.

397
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,151
It"s the same with places
in the film.

398
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,957
And with deleted scenes.
Sometimes you totally forget -

399
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,792
- that they were there at all. Once
they"re on the cutting room floor, -

400
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,390
- they disappear from memory.

401
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,632
Don"t be like your mother!
What"s done is done.

402
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,790
It"s no good crying over spilt milk.
I just want to be left in peace!

403
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,675
I don"t want to listen
to any more crap!

404
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,270
I think this is great, too.

405
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,549
And I love these double shots
with both characters, -

406
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,469
- so you don"t have to cut
to see the other one"s emotion.

407
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,630
- It"s a pleasure to edit this.
- It"s due to the way they act too.

408
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,960
Usually, people just stand there
and look at each other.

409
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,199
It"s great to see them
looking away.

410
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,430
I mean, you can"t look at someone
all the time while talking to them.

411
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,677
When you have a flexible
and moving camera, -

412
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,668
- you get much more natural
body language.

413
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,876
I also think the actors feel more
responsible for being present.

414
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:00,269
They can"t lean on not having
to do anything for a while.

415
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,032
But it"s hard on them. Those dinner
scenes really wore some people out.

416
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,994
We shot them 12-14 times.

417
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,320
Let"s talk about the film"s
only purely comical scene.

418
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,709
This scene was much longer.
I fought until the very end -

419
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,631
- to keep it long.
I knew it wasn"t possible, -

420
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,355
- but as a director, you do get
fed up with watching your own stuff.

421
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:38,591
It"s really nice to have a funny
scene, so you really try to keep it.

422
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,828
- And it really is funny.
- But it was very long.

423
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,079
You ruined my pants!
Aren"t you a bit of a moron?

424
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,114
- What"s going on?
- I spilled paint on him.

425
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,754
Where"s the toilet?

426
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,035
Again, how do you balance
this comic relief with the narrative?

427
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,473
You can only do it by maintaining
the dramatic red thread.

428
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,389
Keeping the scene relevant
because...

429
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,394
Here she gives
Michael"s clothes away, -

430
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,993
- where she still ironed them earlier
because she thought he was alive.

431
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,478
Now she accepts that
he won"t be coming back.

432
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,353
This means that... like...

433
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,157
...you can accept a funny scene.
There is great pain beneath.

434
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,873
Here Nikolaj sees it too.

435
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,313
That Sarah is giving
Michael"s clothes away.

436
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,752
It sort of confirms
that Michael is gone.

437
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,516
Why don"t you take everything?

438
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,429
After this scene
we edited out quite a lot.

439
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,757
There was a complicated sequence
where he left, then called, -

440
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,317
- then she called and he came back.
We made it simpler -

441
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,231
- by cutting to them
sitting by the fireplace.

442
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,115
It"s coming in a moment.

443
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,599
So he actually never left.

444
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,228
Here we changed things around.
The scene after this one -

445
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,433
- was originally before this.
It was where he arrived.

446
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,633
It"s the same thing again.

447
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,277
When you read a written script
you have to make sure -

448
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,870
- you and everyone else
is clear on what"s going on.

449
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,315
Then when you actually look into
someone"s eyes, it says so much.

450
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,640
It means you can do without a lot of
lines and other information.

451
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:24,235
That"s great, because you
really are inside the story.

452
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,757
I still get...
It"s really funny to see -

453
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,913
- how much is possible.
What a broad framework you have.

454
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,319
But here was something
that could not be done.

455
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,832
This story starts with
the two brothers in the car -

456
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,112
- and Michael telling Jannik -

457
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,791
- that he has to apologize
to the girl at the bank.

458
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,675
At some point
we wanted to take that out, -

459
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,555
- but then this scene
wouldn"t make sense.

460
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,629
It was important for the
understanding of Jannik"s character.

461
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,517
That when his brother died,
a lot of things happened to him.

462
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,319
This little, rebellious
and destructive boy he had been -

463
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,471
- becomes irrelevant. He wants
to be constructive and caring.

464
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,753
But if we took out one small scene, -

465
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,191
- a lot of things about his character
wouldn"t be clear.

466
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,439
So it"s a very fine line.

467
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,512
Yes, it is.

468
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,598
This is the arrival scene
turned into a farewell scene.

469
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,912
There are many close-ups
in this film, and I just love it.

470
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,155
You made
some great close-ups, Morten.

471
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,713
This was another example of...

472
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,436
You need some scenes
to show the passing of time.

473
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,479
Again...

474
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,478
There"s a sensuality about the
characters, which isn"t informative -

475
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,070
- but...

476
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,070
You might say that the whole process
from the script -

477
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,072
- to the filming process is
about sensualising the story.

478
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,636
This can be done in different ways.

479
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,116
The more...

480
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:44,238
The more sensual it becomes,
the more you can empathize.

481
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,678
- Isn"t it also the body language?
- That"s the same thing.

482
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,910
You can cut out
the explanatory lines.

483
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:04,355
A look, or two people avoiding
eye contact, says so much.

484
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,158
Like when these two
don"t look at each other.

485
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,593
- A bicycle!
- It was the girls" idea.

486
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,678
- Isn"t it lovely?
- It"s beautiful.

487
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,873
It"s got a little giraffe.

488
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,830
Here Connie used a bit of a funny
accent when she said bicycle.

489
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,670
We wondered if we could dub that,
because the girls are shouting.

490
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,476
But we could. We were
a bit worried about the girls, -

491
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,391
- but they did a great job.
You can"t see that it"s been dubbed.

492
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,991
When we"re talking
about music and what have you...

493
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
Here again...

494
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,717
Traditionally you turn up
the music when people kiss.

495
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,553
But I think we learned from Dogma.
It has a kind of nakedness -

496
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,438
- that makes it more moving than
when you pile on all sorts of things.

497
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,474
Here we practically
removed the sound.

498
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,229
Only the intimate sounds remain.

499
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,673
So you enter their space or whatever.

500
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,113
Here we cut a really nice scene
that we can discuss later.

501
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,198
Shall we do that later?

502
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,793
Here Nikolaj trips.
He"s just so good at that.

503
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,559
In this image we see the advantage of
using a real house instead of a set.

504
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,788
This was shot while the kitchen
was redecorated.

505
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,233
If you look carefully,
you can see spatters of paint.

506
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,309
- Luckily, people don"t.
- We made it a bit dark on purpose.

507
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,675
We did.

508
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,998
I think this next scene is so cute.

509
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,638
This is really a
romantic comedy scene.

510
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,433
Here we have two people
insisting that...

511
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,474
...there"s nothing going on
between them.

512
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,753
While their eyes are
telling a different story.

513
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,717
Especially Nikolaj"s.
He can"t help looking at her -

514
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,118
- even though he"s saying
"Yes, that"s right."

515
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,838
"Lt"s absolutely platonic. It"s just
because we miss my brother."

516
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,512
I always thought you were a bastard.

517
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,590
Well, I always thought you were
a boring, petit bourgeois dyke.

518
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,869
I would really like
to be able to come here.

519
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,195
You can come any time you want.
You can have a key.

520
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,873
Often... l"m thinking of how
the editing process used to be.

521
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,473
We cut away from a scene earlier
and cut into scenes later.

522
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,673
The decision on where to do it...

523
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:39,468
You have to feel that after you"ve
put the whole structure together.

524
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,276
That"s why we have a beginning
and an ending to every scene.

525
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,792
- They come through the door...
- Even though it"s not in the script.

526
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,639
Yes, we always do that.

527
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,435
And there is exactly
the number you need.

528
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,156
Even though you only do it in 8%% %
of the film, you have to do it, -

529
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,993
- because it"s fatal
when it"s not there.

530
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,911
It"s good for the actors as well
to start a little bit earlier.

531
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,674
Here we have
Ulrich"s fantastic blue eyes.

532
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,750
They"re quite shocking in real
life, too. But here in the sun...

533
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,838
- Are they genuine?
- Yes.

534
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,034
Apart from a little extra colour.

535
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,951
They"re absolutely fantastic
when you face him.

536
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,749
Here we do montage again,
which was great -

537
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,511
- after having edited Dogma films.
It was marvellous.

538
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,191
Not that I missed it.
It was just nice to do.

539
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,036
Another example of Susanne
as an action director.

540
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,994
- Oh, well.
- You developed a taste for it.

541
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,237
Yes, it was fun.

542
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:29,038
We had a group of English actors
to play Afghans -

543
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,835
- and some Arabs.

544
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,799
In the Taleban camps
both groups are present, -

545
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,269
- and they speak both languages.
Pashtun and Arabic.

546
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,396
People asked why they don"t speak
Afghanistan"s main language.

547
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,479
That"s because they speak
both languages in the camps.

548
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,431
It was interesting with those
actors in that they felt...

549
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,472
They represented their
most macabre side.

550
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:20,439
They thought it was interesting
and perhaps a little bit frightening.

551
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,797
And we had the military with us
at all times.

552
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,629
Special officers from...

553
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,435
From the special forces.

554
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,031
So everything they do is accurate.

555
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,234
You shouldn"t fabricate too much.

556
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,195
It has to be credible.

557
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,918
We got very competent
assistance in that respect.

558
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,750
And it was fun, wasn"t it, Morten?
We learned a lot.

559
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,838
Like, this was not scripted. But when
military people show you the ropes -

560
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:17,717
- it becomes nicely concrete...

561
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,272
In the script,
it"s not explained what he does.

562
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,635
And in the script they spoke English.

563
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,235
We changed that.

564
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,637
It felt more alienating
that they spoke a language -

565
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:51,073
- our characters didn"t understand.
We put in an interpreter.

566
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,909
It felt much more authentic.

567
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,830
He translated the things that
were significant for the story.

568
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,320
Release the gyro,
you hear a high-pitched tone.

569
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,273
You elevate.

570
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,235
And sometimes he doesn"t translate.
It has to work both ways.

571
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,557
It"s a stressful scene to shoot,
taking place in the sunset.

572
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,830
The sun sets quickly out there,
so we had to hurry.

573
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,308
We got it at the last moment.

574
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,433
Here we tried to blur time -

575
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:46,318
- and make intangible
how many days they"ve been there.

576
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,310
By cutting "discontinuously".

577
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,670
But, Morten, we could say
that whole thing in Spain...

578
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,557
We had five days for something
that should take nine days to film.

579
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,039
So I felt we were fighting against
the setting sun constantly.

580
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,109
That"s why there aren"t many
pictures of the scenery.

581
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,074
What there is we did
in ten minutes, on a day -

582
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,195
- when we had finished
before the sun went down.

583
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,157
We used the same shot,
graded differently.

584
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,356
But it was lucky
that you managed it.

585
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,870
It works. And it was a lovely day.

586
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,833
I must say that...

587
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,036
The whole Spain thing was...
We kept our fingers crossed.

588
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,074
And we were so relieved
when we were done.

589
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:00,879
It was like jumping
off the deep end -

590
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,913
- and hoping for the best.

591
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,033
What we had to do was so difficult,
and we had so little time.

592
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,511
Wasn"t there something about Paw
coming in at the last minute -

593
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,759
- because the original actor was ill?

594
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,317
- Yes.
- He had an eye infection.

595
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,877
We were an actor short
the day we were scheduled to start.

596
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,791
So Paw Henriksen was flown in.
Luckily, he had time...

597
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,232
Quite brilliant that he could
take over like that.

598
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,435
Sometimes I feel that things -

599
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,909
- that are the biggest gamble
and most fragmented -

600
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,192
- turn out better.

601
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,597
When you have plenty of time, -

602
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:04,114
- there"s a kind of slackness.
I like that kind of adrenalin rush -

603
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,836
- when you simply can"t afford
mistakes. It"s exciting.

604
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,636
To live he must be of use.
He"s of no use.

605
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,353
Now you can"t imagine
it being any other way.

606
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,355
It was quite revolting
to do this scene, right?

607
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,870
- I thought it was fun to do.
- I believe you.

608
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,959
- But I felt...
- This is how it should be.

609
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:44,271
I thought it was fun to do, too,
but it was revolting as well.

610
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,677
I can always tell by looking
at my assistant, Michael.

611
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,795
When he starts to get queasy,
it"s good.

612
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:00,832
It looks different through a camera,
but he"s watching with his own eyes.

613
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,555
So he"s a pretty good yardstick.

614
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:10,392
I seldom feel affected when I edit,
but this was unpleasant to do.

615
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,197
And the sound.
Every time we got to it...

616
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:23,078
It"s funny. When you"ve been editing
footage for a period of time -

617
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,149
- and then have public screenings,
it starts to leave you a little cold.

618
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,511
But every time I was
at a public screening -

619
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,917
- I left the room here.
I just had to pop to the toilet.

620
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,079
There"s something
about this scene...

621
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,717
It"s hardest on the cameraman.

622
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:50,155
Like here. The place where there
is the most power -

623
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,593
- automatically sucks in the camera.
So I don"t think...

624
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,635
People, who film real people
being shot, just do it too.

625
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,753
It"s something else
when you see it through a camera.

626
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,829
At first we had a lot of effects here
like two simultaneous images -

627
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,999
- and a jump in frames
and all that.

628
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:20,036
We discovered that it got most
intense by keeping it clean.

629
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,468
I was just a bit worried about
Ulrich swinging that iron rod -

630
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,390
- because here it"s a real one.
And l"m quite close.

631
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,469
We had a real iron rod
and a foam rubber one.

632
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,119
Some shots were done with the
fake one, others with the real rod.

633
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,069
We had a few stunt experts
to help us make it look violent -

634
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,628
- and at the same time ensure that
nobody got hurt. But we really...

635
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:07,073
- Because Ulrich really let rip.
- Yes, he did.

636
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,150
I remember we discussed that it
had to be certain that he was dead -

637
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,510
- before you left.

638
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:21,192
I was worried that you might choose
a solution that left any doubt -

639
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,631
- whether he was dead or not.

640
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,353
I remember you said, "He has
to be killed good and proper."

641
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,870
- I did.
- And he was.
