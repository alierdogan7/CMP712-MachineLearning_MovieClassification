Mike, we're not going home.

705
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:03,497
What are you talking about?

706
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:06,133
The lab's 200 miles inland.

707
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,135
You saw the news footage.

708
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,670
We'll fight our way in there
if we have to.

709
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:11,138
And then what?

710
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,140
Generators run out
in a couple weeks,

711
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:15,542
maybe the civilian population
tries to overrun it.

712
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,044
There's too many variables.

713
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,679
So, what do we do?
We stay on the ship?

714
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:21,048
- Dr. Scott says she has
what she needs right here. - Dr. Scott.

715
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:22,349
We have standing orders

716
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,051
from the President
of the United States.

717
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:25,552
From five days ago.

718
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:27,588
In the absence
of a command structure,

719
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:30,324
I decide what's in the best
interest of our mission.

720
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,060
And we have enough food here
to last us what, a week?

721
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:34,161
How much fuel?

722
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:35,395
We'll find what we need.

723
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,464
- We'll die out there.
- No. We will not.

724
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,066
Tom, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

725
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,135
But it's not gonna work.
People want to get home.

726
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:44,571
And who exactly gets to go home

727
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:49,676
when we have 80 biohazard suits
for 216 people?

728
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,780
We draw lots.

729
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,650
I can't think like that, Mike.

730
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,285
It'll at least
give people a chance

731
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,187
to get back to their families,
to say goodbye.

732
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,656
I'm not letting anybody
on this ship give up.

733
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,024
That's not your call.
You don't get to play God.

734
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:06,827
I'm still the Captain
of this ship.

735
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:09,229
Now, I've laid out our mission.

736
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:12,666
I expect you to fall in line.

737
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:24,745
Rios:
Captain's on the bridge.

738
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:39,092
Left full rudder.
All engines ahead flank.

739
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
Sir?

740
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,364
Left full rudder.

741
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,400
All engines ahead flank.

742
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:50,370
Aye, aye.
Left full rudder.

743
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:51,772
All engines ahead flank.

744
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,640
Left full rudder.
All engines ahead flank, aye.

745
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:15,562
This is the Captain speaking.

746
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:18,532
<i>We have no contact with home,</i>

747
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,400
<i>and I have good reason</i>
<i>to believe</i>

748
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:23,270
<i>that the American government</i>
<i>is no longer functioning.</i>

749
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:26,707
The country we all hoped we were
coming back to no longer exists.

750
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:29,243
<i>We left these shores</i>
<i>four months ago</i>

751
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:31,545
<i>as members</i>
<i>of the United States Navy.</i>

752
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:34,281
<i>But now we are more than that.</i>

753
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,950
<i>Now our duty</i>
<i>is to the entire world.</i>

754
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:41,755
On board this ship
is the hope...

755
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,192
for our futures,
for our families,

756
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,427
and for all of humanity,

757
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,796
because in that lab
in our helo bay

758
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:52,532
<i>are the ingredients for a cure.</i>

759
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,901
And this is the safest place
on Earth

760
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:57,471
for our scientists
to do their work--

761
00:42:57,505 --> 00:42:59,873
<i>on a $3 billion</i>
<i>piece of machinery</i>

762
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:03,677
<i>protected by 216 sailors</i>
<i>in the US Navy.</i>

763
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:06,780
Our mission now is simple.

764
00:43:06,814 --> 00:43:09,549
We do whatever it takes
to stay alive at sea

765
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:11,285
until they find that cure.

766
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,720
<i>There's an unmanned</i>
<i>food and fuel station</i>

767
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:15,255
<i>outside Guantanamo Bay.</i>

768
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:17,724
<i>For the moment,</i>
<i>that is our destination.</i>

769
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:26,199
We've lost so much already.

770
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:29,269
But this is the most courageous
and resilient crew

771
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:32,205
with whom I have ever
been privileged to serve.

772
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,742
<i>We will come through this</i>
<i>together,</i>

773
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,279
<i>and we will prevail.</i>

774
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:42,416
Carry on.

775
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,766
Attention on deck.

776
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,740
Lieutenant Granderson,

777
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,742
permission to salute
the Captain.

778
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,645
Permission granted.

779
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,015
Hand salute!

780
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,302
