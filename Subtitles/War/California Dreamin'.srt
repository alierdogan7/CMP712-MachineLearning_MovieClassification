00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,037
On 25 August '06 director Cristian
Nemescu was killed in a car crash.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,550
You are about to watch his movie
just the way it looked at the time.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,994
In memory of Cristian Nemescu
(1979-2006)

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,031
MEDlAPRO PlCTURES presents

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,037
A film produced with the support
of the National Film Centre

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,118
May 1944

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,118
The British and American armies

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,515
are still engaged
in bombing Romania.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,474
Their aim is to undermine
the government's determination

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,074
to remain
the ally of Germany.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,789
The number of casualties
among the military,

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,639
and especially
among the civilians, is increasing.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,795
Cut it out.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,956
We are hereby urging
the population to strictly follow

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,119
the rules of civil
defense in case of bombing.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,548
Upon the first warning signs,
take immediate refuge in shelters.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,194
- C'mon! C'mon, already!
- C'mon, already!

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,271
- But where's Grandpa?
- We forgot Grandpa.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,594
Attention! Do not panic!

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,958
Don't waste your time
trying to locate valuable items

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,913
that you might want to save
from destruction.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,038
Yes, sugar pie, it's not that
I don't want to come home,

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,435
we've had this conversation before.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,750
There are days when I just
have more work to do.

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,390
Come on,
I'm not having an affair...

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,636
Hold on just a second,
there's a call on the other line.

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,392
Wait. No,
don't call me back later.

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,239
Hold on, I'll get Luiza to
pick it up. Yes, Luiza's here.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,470
Come on, honey... here we go again
with why she's here.

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,910
She's here because she's got work
to do. Wait, there's another call.

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,435
These raids, the first after
April 6, put the Podgorica leaders,

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,710
who enjoy Western support,
in a tight spot.

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,515
They have to face the increasingly
numerous anti-NA TO demonstrations.

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,752
Luiza! Come on, what are you
doing? The phone's ringing.

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,472
Talk to you later.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,951
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
office of the State Secretary.

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,038
The Yugoslav Federation was
bombed again, yesterday.

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,910
Wait, don't put her on the phone.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,554
Yes.

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,638
How's my little princess?
Now, I just talked to mommy

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,149
and she told me
you haven't finished your milk...

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,272
Ok, put mommy back on the phone.

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,235
Look, something urgent has
come up, I have to go.

44
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,918
I'll call you later, ok?
Bye.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,191
- What?
- NATO's calling.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,558
So, what am I supposed to do?
Have them call the minister.

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,955
Well, they said he's gone,
he's already left.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,831
May 1999

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,550

directed by

58
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,359
Fall in line!

59
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,278
C'mon!

60
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,439
C'mon, already!

61
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,955
Ready to go?

62
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,036
These guys are stalling with
their bloody engine.

63
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,559
Some uniforms you got...

64
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,875
Fit us like gloves.
They're for special ops.

65
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,275
Can't feel the cold, can't feel
the heat in 'em. NATO standards.

66
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,471
Marian! Come here!

67
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,272
Tell the American commander
you'll be doing the translating.

68
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,951
He wants to take a look around.

69
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,278
- You're the boss.
- Me, me...

70
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,392
He has a deadline.

71
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,229
And we have to go quickly.

72
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,390
Let's attach the engine
to the wagon and get it over with.

73
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,835
He wants it done fast.
He is in a hurry.

74
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,996
- He's asking you nicely.
- Marching band!

75
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,479
The Yugoslavian news agency
reported that NATO missiles have hit

76
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,752
Bosnian and Croatian refugee camps
in Marcici, south Belgrade.

77
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,356
The Serbian press claims
that the bombing

78
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,638
has damaged yet another bridge
across the Danube.

79
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,398
- Hello!
- H i! You came to pick Monica up?

80
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,278
- I'm giving her a ride to school.
- Your father bought you this car?

81
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,795
Yeah. You like it?
It's the coupe model...

82
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,037
I'm thinking of running for mayor
myself, if the money's so good...

83
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,430
Let me go see if she's up.

84
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,913
What do you want?

85
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,072
Your prince is here.

86
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,353
Yeah!

87
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,032
Morning, sir.

88
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,515
Spit it out.

89
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,835
Boss, the 9:30 freight train is
on its way.

90
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,748
Help yourself to some chicken,
my daughter's not eating.

91
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,638
- You got the items list?
- Got it.

92
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,278
Morning, miss.

93
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,789
Come!

94
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,119
- How's it going, princess?
- Tell me what you're doing here.

95
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,510
I thought we'd agreed we weren't
going to see each other anymore.

96
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,194
Hold on, I thought you re kidding
or playing me, stuff like that...

97
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,993
Baby, come on, I was crystal clear.
That's it. It's over.

98
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,071
Es finito, comprende?

99
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,155
So aren't you at least going
to tell me what happened?

100
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,074
Nothing happened.
That's the whole point.

101
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,879
You changed the spokes
on the car's wheels, eh?

102
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,399
That's it for today.

103
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,077
Take good care of the parcels.

104
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,632
Boss, on the 2 o'clock train we've
got 1 0 boxes of 3.5 ball bearings.

105
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,239
We're selling those at 500 a pop.

106
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,635
1 0 boxes of tractor ball bearings,
say we send those to Galati.

107
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,274
I took PVC, double glazings,
wire and some other stuff in bulks

108
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,072
I reckoned we'd sell those
on the local market.

109
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,749
On the 8 o'clock freight train
we've got 1 0 cases of beer,

110
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,155
wine, soda and stuff,

111
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,032
we'll sell those through
Gelu's supermarket.

112
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,109
And so on... cigarettes, we've got
2, 4, 6 times 5 cars... 30 boxes.

113
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,115
Take out more. They won't
catch us, the goddamn asses.

114
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,193
And don't go selling them to Gelu,
he pays after selling the stuff.

115
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,835
It's ok, I've got a new deal
all set. Next?

116
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,474
Right. Paint, cement... 1 00 each.

117
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,837
Spare Dacia parts from the
8 o'clock freight train.

118
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,639
And then there's the fertilizer
on the Valcea freight train.

119
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,236
- I promised the mayor 20 sacks.
- I see...

120
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm guessing it all adds up
to about 40 million.

121
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,317
This is the one for the factory.

122
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,515
- For the factory, huh?
- Yeah.

123
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,553
Well, aren't they closing the damn
thing down? So I can buy it.

124
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,639
Come on. Take a decent share
from every car.

125
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,398
We'll record them as losses

126
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,996
Man, these gypsies are killing us.
They emptied half a car again.

127
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,473
And I'm the one who always gets
the blame...

128
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,478
I'll catch them! I'll teach them
a lesson to stop stealing.

129
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,470
Isn't anyone going to answer
that phone?

130
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,478
- Capalnita station.
- Constanta station calling.

131
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,198
I'd like to speak to the shift
supervisor, please.

132
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,153
- Speaking.
- Yes? Hello!

133
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,793
A train carrying NATO equipment
will pass through your station.

134
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,071
It's guarded by American soldiers.

135
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,152
- Yes, I understand.
- It's been granted free passage.

136
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,112
Listen carefully!

137
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,994
Don't make any problems!
They have government approval.

138
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,072
Don't make any problems!

139
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,631
I'd like to feel your hot skin
under my lips. I love you.

140
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,950
It's me. Listen, a train
with Americans is on its way.

141
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,391
I don't know, just about now.
In, like, fifteen minutes.

142
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,478
Okay, man. I got it. Thanks.

143
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,276
Hey, guys, listen up!
Gather round.

144
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,038
Tell all the guys to come to work.

145
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,553
We're going on immediate strike.

146
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,079
Yeah! Great!

147
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,112
Doiaru wants to put us
out of work

148
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,037
so he can buy the factory
real cheap.

149
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,993
The time has finally come
to make ourselves heard!

150
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,237
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Victor, come over here.

151
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,559
By the power vested in me...
Excuse me. Yes.

152
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,830
Hello, sir.
You've got yourself a problem.

153
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,117
A train with Americans will pass
and the word is out.

154
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,109
Good thing you called me. Yes.
I'll be right there.

155
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,918
By the power vested in me, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

156
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,031
Come on, sign here. I have to go.

157
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,438
Kiss the wife.

158
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,836
Cut it out!

159
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,794
Here!

160
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,076
Come on, guys! Come on!

161
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,591
We're not going home till somebody
hears us. Come on, move it.

162
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,229
Trifan, you're in charge of
holding that banner up and across.

163
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,033
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!

164
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,473
Come on, Trifan!

165
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,598
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!

166
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,676
STRlKE

167
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,590
Give us our money!
We want our money!

168
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,070
What's going on here, folks?
Are you out of your minds?

169
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,119
We're picketing,
we've gone on immediate strike.

170
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,032
On the railroad tracks?

171
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,990
Listen, guys, a train with
Americans is on its way.

172
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,314
You want us to make fools
of ourselves?

173
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,396
We know. That's why we're doin' it.
Maybe somebody will hear us out.

174
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,478
So what if Doiaru hears you?

175
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,592
The investor bailed out cause
Doiaru looted the factory trains.

176
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,675
We've filed for bankruptcy and you
ain't doing squat about it, Mayor!

177
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,399
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!

178
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,919
Boss...

179
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,151
A train with Americans is headed
our way.

180
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,878
Some big shots or something.

181
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,114
Carrying NATO military equipment.

182
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,232
Bucharest has granted them
free passage.

183
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,428
Maybe, but I'm the boss here.
Have them stop for a check-up.

184
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,430
Folks, people are going to hear
bad things about us.

185
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,956
Clear the railroad tracks and I'll
buy all the oil in your factory.

186
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,031
God bless you, Mr. Mayor!

187
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,990
We'll not sell ourselves so cheap!
We're going all the way, brothers!

188
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,874
All the way! Thieves!
Thieves! Thieves!

189
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,313
Give us our money!

190
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,151
You know what? You're free
to do whatever you want.

191
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,396
That's why we've got
democracy, right?

192
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,869
Good afternoon. Dorel Mateescu.
Doiaru. Railroad station master.

193
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,638
What's your freight
car carrying?

194
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,157
Well... it's American military cargo.

195
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,637
Headed for Kosovo.
It's a NATO car.

196
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,473
And its content is top secret.

197
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,597
- I want to see your papers.
- Well, don't you get it?

198
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,876
It's military cargo.

199
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,877
We've got approval from high up,
from the Government.

200
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,791
No, you're the one who doesn't get
it. I have regulations to observe.

201
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,116
Without proper paperwork
I can't let you pass.

202
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,228
The officer would like to know
if there's a problem.

203
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,478
... and those pricks in Bucharest.
This is my station.

204
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,556
Without them, you re not passing!
Enough said. Put them on track 2!

205
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,191
What's going on here?

206
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,518
Check out what s happening!

207
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,750
Mister, what do you think
you're doing?

208
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,555
You hang around here, I'm going
upstairs to take care of business.

209
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,280
Day One - The Train

210
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,432
Day One - The Train

211
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,033
So, how long have you had
your bags packed?

212
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,352
So, had you got on that train, you
would've gone to Craiova? Pitesti?

213
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,319
Couldn't I have just as well asked
Petre to take you there?

214
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,953
If only your mother were alive
to see you today...

215
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,314
What, you think it's got nothing
to do with that? It has, dammit!

216
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,832
If she hadn't died when you were
born she could've told you herself.

217
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,119
I don't even know how you could
think of such a thing!

218
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,228
What, I don't take
good care of you?

219
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,552
Everything you've got here
in this room...

220
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,831
Tape recorder, clothes, records,
whims Who gave you those, dammit?

221
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,232
Sometimes when I look at you,
I can swear it's her that I see.

222
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,914
Well, maybe that's just it.

223
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,068
You women are all alike.

224
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,798
I can understand why you'd want
to leave this shit hole of a village.

225
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,671
Start studying! Maybe next fall
you'll go to college, in the city!

226
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,791
What the hell!

227
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,191
You're smart. You're beautiful.

228
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,957
I'm going to end up alone anyway,
but that's just the way it is.

229
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,790
Shouldn't you be in school
right now?

230
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,750
- Yeah, I should.
- I'll have Petre drop you off.

231
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,236
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

232
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,877
What are we gonna do, man?
Go home?

233
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,309
No way! We're going
to carry on with the strike.

234
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,353
Screw me, we do that every day.

235
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,911
Okay, Mitroi...

236
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,958
Heard the news? The Americans
have come to our village.

237
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,238
- Go on, sonny-boy...
- The Americans are in our village.

238
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,476
- Well, how... Where? How?
- They're at the railroad station.

239
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,397
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah! Go see for yourselves.

240
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,351
Have you heard?

241
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,314
The Americans...
Yes, here, in our village.

242
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,831
- The Americans...
- I saw the Americans...

243
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,875
- Does the mayor know about it?
- Well, of course he does!

244
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,029
Did everybody see a new episode
of "Esmeralda" last night?

245
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,758
- Yes!
- Okay.

246
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,917
Today we're going to study two
verbs: "quiero" and "trabajar".

247
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,555
Let's read out loud, come on!

248
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,554
Quiero ir al teatro,
pero no tengo tiempo.

249
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,159
Write down the translation:

250
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,111
"l want to go to the theatre,
but I don't have the time."

251
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,472
Who would like to conjugate
"trabajar"?

252
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,474
So many of you?
You want me to call someone out?

253
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,119
Go ahead, Despina.

254
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,110
Trabajo, trabajas, trabaja,
trabajamos, trabajais, trabajan.

255
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,716
Good... Now, using the same
inflection,

256
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,872
Iet's try "quiero".
Who wants to give it a go? You!

257
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,395
Quiere... quiero...

258
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,109
No, no. Neagu, you try!

259
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,714
I yearn for the blossom of your
breasts. Your beauty makes me ache.

260
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,110
Stop! Attention everybody!

261
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,836
"Es" is the inflection
for the second person, singular.

262
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,510
For the first person, we use
the inflection "o".

263
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,189
Everybody look at the blackboard,
please! The correct conjugation is...

264
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,151
- American soldiers in our village!
- Young guys?

265
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,475
I don't know, but we gotta go
take a look after class.

266
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,113
Yo quiero means "l love you"

267
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,512
then we have:
tu quieres, el, ella quiere,

268
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,954
nosotros queremos, vosotros quereis,
ellos, ellas quieren

269
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,276
They say a train with Americans
has arrived!

270
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,436
So, if you say "quiero bailar"
it means "l want to dance".

271
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,637
"Quiero irme a casa",
"l want to go home".

272
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,799
And now, attention!

273
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,517
To say "l love you", add,
like in Romanian, the pronoun "te".

274
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,319
As you know from the movies,
"yo te quiero" means "l love you".

275
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,071
Don't forget to watch
the 395th episode of "Esmeralda"!

276
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,714
- Tonight!
- Wait, I wanna tell you something!

277
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,879
So. Ladies, young ladies
and, well, the rest of you,

278
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,355
to celebrate the
end of this boredom,

279
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,832
or, as the great scholar Gogu
would call it, "the 1 2th grade",

280
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,554
I'm inviting you all to a great
party, the day after tomorrow.

281
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,716
There are going to be chicks,
booze, cool music, all that stuff.

282
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,071
So everyone's invited to my
uncle's, in the city!

283
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,356
Everyone!

284
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,635
Listen, aren't you guys
together anymore?

285
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,958
He was starting to piss me off.

286
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,991
Going on and on
with "Baby, you're so fine".

287
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,152
That sort of crap.

288
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,595
None of them is good enough
for you anymore, huh?

289
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,673
- Hey! Where's the boss?
- Hello, Mayor.

290
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,195
Hello. Where's the boss of
the Americans?

291
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,677
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

292
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,639
I wanna talk to their boss.
I'm the mayor.

293
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,873
Here he is.

294
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,788
It's okay, it's okay,
I'll do the translating.

295
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,799
- Tell the colonel that...
- It's "captain".

296
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,832
Tell the captain that we're very
happy to invite him

297
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,235
and the rest of the
wonderful guests...

298
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,116
... to celebrate the anniversary
of our village, tomorrow evening.

299
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,115
- Tomorrow night, you told him?
- Yeah, I told him.

300
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,550
- Mr. Mayor!
- Oh, hi.

301
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,552
Long time no see
in these here parts.

302
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,910
Well, what can I do, I'm so damn
busy. You can see for yourself.

303
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,835
I gotta... The stuff I asked you
about, those sacks of cement...

304
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,314
- How's that going?
- Oh, it's been taken care of.

305
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,317
I just need some guys to come by
later on, to go pick up the sacks.

306
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,118
Praise the Lord.
What's that I heard?

307
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,636
The radio guy said you wanted
to buy the factory...

308
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,079
What's up with that?

309
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,873
My daughter's all grown up now.
She needs a nice dowry, you see?

310
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,549
Good for you. If she and Paul
are getting along well...

311
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,077
Let's get together one day,
talk things over.

312
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,040
Listen up, we're having a meeting
at the village hall in an hour.

313
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,230
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.
- It's the village anniversary.

314
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,909
- Wasn't that a month ago?
- So what if it was?

315
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,830
Girl, that guy is so cute!

316
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,429
Now, who keeps texting you, girl?

317
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,396
Aww, girl!

318
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,355
He kind of looks like
Ricky Martin, doesn't he?

319
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,152
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

320
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,510
You can. Good afternoon.

321
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,716
Dear fellow villagers,
as you well know

322
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,270
or as you may have heard...
or seen...

323
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,956
a train carrying American soldiers
arrived in our village today.

324
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,398
Apparently, from what Mr. Doiaru
has told me,

325
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,869
there are some paperwork issues
in Bucharest...

326
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,320
None of our business, anyway.
So till the papers get sorted out,

327
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,871
it is our duty, both as citizens
and as good Christians,

328
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:07,720
as God fearing people... to warmly
welcome our guests from overseas.

329
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,591
As far as village affairs go,

330
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,871
the arrival of the Americans
can only do us good.

331
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,076
Because, if we get publicity,

332
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,953
we will draw new investors
to our village.

333
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,430
Yeah, so Doiaru
can rip them off, too!

334
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,195
Not to mention that our guests

335
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,358
are potential investors too.

336
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,997
We will welcome them into our pubs
and our hotels.

337
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,917
And we'll all benefit from this.

338
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,828
I'm hereby announcing
the anniversary

339
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,476
of our village's 1 00th year,
tomorrow evening.

340
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,079
Didn't we do that, already?

341
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,316
I know we've done that already,
but we're going to do it again.

342
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,237
There's going to be barbecue, beer,

343
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,311
everything it takes to make sure
it comes out nice.

344
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,156
And he keeps staring at her.

345
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,756
So she's gulping down the food
and at some point the guy goes,

346
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,434
"Ma'am, you eat like a sow."
And she goes...

347
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,998
Yes, honey.

348
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,708
Okay, I'll call you back later.
Something important has come up.

349
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,712
- When did this come in?
- Just now.

350
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,914
- So, what do they want from me?
- Haven't got a clue.

351
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,273
Well, send it over to Defense.
See, it says here "urgent".

352
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,515
Okay.

353
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,310
And don't forget
to call the NATO guys.

354
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,759
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,230
Tell them it's all going
to be taken care of.

356
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,679
Okay.

357
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,596
The Ministry of National Defense
It's not our problem.
It's for the Ministry of Transportation.

358
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,830
The Ministry of Transportation
Yeah, we'll clear it up, but...

359
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,916
I don't think it's going to make
it there today.

360
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,554
But it'll be there tomorrow. Yes.
Good day, sir.

361
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,149
Claudia, change the header,
so that I can sign it. Quickly!

362
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,589
The Board of the Romanian
Railway Company

363
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,638
- There's no more room!
- Go! Go!

364
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,080
Day Two - The Village

365
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,914
Day Two - The Village

366
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,351
And that's the story of the first
black man I ever saw.

367
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,879
I was but a boy back then,

368
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,834
but I'll never forget
how the simple countryman,

369
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:18,238
the Romanian peasant, welcomed
this stranger warmly.

370
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,637
And we are all capable of such
deeds, us Romanians.

371
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,796
Mr. Mayor, what happened
with the black guy?

372
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,996
Well, you see, kids...

373
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,032
At first, people didn't even
realize he was American.

374
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,232
Because we know that black people
live in Africa.

375
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,829
Only afterwards did we find out
that America's full of blacks.

376
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,194
But in those days,

377
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,035
people didn't fear differences
in appearance, so to speak.

378
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,073
They offered the poor man shelter
for two weeks.

379
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,350
Until we chased the Germans away.

380
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,315
But, meanwhile, the poor guy died

381
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,918
because he was badly injured
and we didn't know how to cure him.

382
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,476
Okay. Now let's talk a bit about
the history of the United States.

383
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,798
Or, for short, America.
Or, even shorter, the USA.

384
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,559
The country's capital
is located in Washington.

385
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,193
But that's not the largest city,
you know.

386
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,478
The largest cities are LA,
New York...

387
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,429
and so on.

388
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:28,596
The country is made up of states.
Such as Texas, California...

389
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,554
Anyway, just like our country
is made up of counties.

390
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,189
Such as llfov, lalomita, Vaslui,
Bacau and so on.

391
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,634
The country's economy relies on...

392
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,076
... seduction.
It's all about seduction.

393
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,998
Sure, it also depends
on what you wear.

394
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,470
A short skirt and a big cleavage
will always draw all eyes to you.

395
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,713
That's where intelligence comes in.

396
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,797
Namely, your demeanor.
My advice is that you be...

397
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,396
...open, but without giving
in to their first offer.

398
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,556
This is the time for us to
speak up, without fear,

399
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,839
to tell them what we really want
and who we are.

400
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,552
That's right!

401
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,673
I want us to hold a civilized
protest tonight, at the mayor's party

402
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,436
Now, you're all going
to bring banners.

403
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,950
We're going to write down
clearly what we want.

404
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:30,391
That is, "Give us our money!".
"You thieves!", "We want to work!"

405
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,109
"We're hungry!"... and so on.

406
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,917
Good morning, dear listeners
of this wonderful community.

407
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,950
To honor the event that all of you
have certainly heard about,

408
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,598
we re kicking off a program of
musical bonding, so to speak,

409
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,956
with Romanian music

410
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,759
and sweet
American songs for the soul,

411
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,354
meant to bring us a bit of warmth,

412
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,517
not that it's not hot enough.

413
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,389
What I mean is the warmth
in our hearts and souls.

414
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,878
Right... On the other hand,
a well-informed citizen

415
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,239
was kind enough to inform us
this whole village anniversary,

416
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,994
which is actually made up,
is closely connected

417
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,350
to our mayor's wish to raise

418
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,553
some money for the local budget.

419
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,190
They say that the budget has been
depleted of some massive sums.

420
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,158
Moving on, I have here a list
of musical requests.

421
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,077
I will begin reading them now.

422
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,433
Mihai.

423
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,593
Monica.

424
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,990
- lonescu.
- I noticed you like Monica.

425
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,673
You don't stand a chance.

426
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,115
For sure. She's only gone steady
with the coolest guys around.

427
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,918
She got bored of them all.

428
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,277
She was with Alex, the metal-head.
He was one of them angry rockers.

429
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,996
Then Mihai, the guy who graduated
last year... my sister's crush.

430
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,472
Anyway, he went off to college
in Bucharest. The end.

431
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,470
She dumped that guy ages ago. And
yesterday she cut Paul loose.

432
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,196
- Come on, you pick him!
- I'm not picking that geek!

433
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,069
We reshuffle the teams
and I'll pick him, man.

434
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,279
Dude, check out your team!
You take him! Andrei!

435
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,554
Move it! You're on his team.
We're taking the other one.

436
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,394
Ok? Come on,
you've got a killer team.

437
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,437
- Move it!
- Come on, pass it!

438
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,672
You passed it to this dweeb?!
He can't even move his feet?!

439
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,837
And he's playing in his PJ s, too!

440
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,437
C'mon girls! Put everywhere!

441
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,159
Yo, Mihai! Get it over with
those lights, already, will you?

442
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,076
Well, those lights...

443
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,108
Don't touch!
Leave them like this!

444
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,599
Bless you!

445
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,555
Doiaru, you should really take
something for your allergy.

446
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,677
Dear Vasile, I've got something
I wanna ask of you.

447
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,430
Anything, Mr. Doiaru.
I've got it covered. Go ahead.

448
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,793
Well, there's this gang of gypsies,
they really get my goat!

449
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,398
Everyday they're out stealing from
freight trains. There,by the turn.

450
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,115
You could have your men guard them.
They get so bored anyway.

451
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,389
I got it. Listen, Doiaru,
we've known each other for ages.

452
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,708
What's with these Americans?

453
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,672
I'm not saying it's a bad thing,
but...

454
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,475
The mayor is out throwing
parties and all...

455
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,555
Well if they don't have the papers
what am I supposed to do about it?

456
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,309
Just because they're American
they think they can outsmart us?

457
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,829
Like we're Romanians, so we're
all morons, or what?

458
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,271
They have to obey the law.
Hey, Stelica! Watch it!

459
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,831
- Boss! Boss!
- What's up?

460
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,792
- This is 1-7.
- I know, man. Go ahead.

461
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,116
Hold on, it's for me.
Go ahead! What's up?

462
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,474
The mayor is calling you over
to put up road blocks.

463
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,278
Come on, man. I started
the barbecue. You comin'?

464
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,919
Of course I am.

465
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,831
I'll see you at the party.

466
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,236
Vasile, you're not gonna forget
about that thing we discussed, ok?

467
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,839
Of course not,
didn't I tell you already?

468
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,159
He wants to know if those customs
papers have arrived.

469
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,876
No, nothing's come in.

470
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,277
Tell the man I don't take bribe.

471
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,838
What, you think
if we're in Romania

472
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,235
you can buy us out just like that?
Third world country, right?

473
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,833
Yo, Marin, you're so snazzy, girl!

474
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,356
Hey, suck my dick!

475
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,468
Yes!

476
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,392
I came to take the Americans
to the party.

477
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

478
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,672
Hold on, I'll go tell them.

479
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,435
Good evening! Please, Captain...

480
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,476
He's father Nicolae!

481
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,598
My deputy!

482
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,514
- Soda, Mayor?
- Oh, give me a break!

483
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:19,032
Where are you? Here you go!
C'mon!

484
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,592
Leave me alone!

485
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,355
- Mr. Mayor, God bless you!
- God bless!

486
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,309
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

487
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,309
honorable community officials,
dear fellow villagers

488
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,509
I have the utmost pleasure
and honor

489
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,116
to bid you all welcome to the
anniversary of our village...

490
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,278
This year, we are privileged
to have among us

491
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,159
a few distinguished guests
from abroad,

492
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,034
who have come all the way
from the United States of America!

493
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,359
This being said,
let's have some Romanian fun!

494
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,949
Change the station already,
I've had enough of this asshole!

495
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,950
You tell me, how can anyone
not hate these Americans?

496
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,754
Hello.

497
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,309
Yes. No...
I can't hear you.

498
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,156
Hello? I can't hear you.
Speak up, please!

499
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,271
- Yes... Hello.
- Who's there?

500
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,351
Yes, yes, hello, Minister.

501
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,797
Yes, yes, hello, Minister.

502
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,872
Yes, they're right here with us.
We're at a party.

503
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,078
Yes, yes...

504
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,918
No...

505
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,110
That's not up to me, sir.

506
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,957
Well, see...

507
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,353
The station is administered by
the Romanian Railway Company.

508
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,189
And the man in charge of the
station is Mr. Doiaru.

509
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,599
Yes, but I promise you
that I'll make sure

510
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:42,311
their stay here will be hassle-free.

511
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,716
Good bye!

512
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,591
I just got a call from the Minister.

513
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,869
Good evening!

514
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,755
