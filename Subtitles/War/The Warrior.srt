1
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,679
End his pain.

2
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,818
Cut a lock of his hair.

3
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,045
On our return to Korea,

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,153
I will return it to his family...

5
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,165
1375 AD
457 years after the founding of Korea,

6
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,073
Their 31st King, Gongmin,
was assassinated

7
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,942
by Hong Yoon and Choi Man-saeng.
He was replaced by King Woo.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,983
In China, chaos ensued after
Chu Yu an-chang founded

9
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,449
the Ming Empire in Nanjing,

10
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,720
forcing the Won Empire

11
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,229
from its century-old rulership of the land

12
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:43,266
directly to the north of the Great Wall of China.

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,422
Ahn Sung Ki

14
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,095
Jung Woo Sung

15
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,131
Joo Jin Mo

16
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,104
Ziyi Zhang

17
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,942
Rong Guang Yu

18
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,049
Lee Doo Il / Park Yong Woo

19
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,984
Park Jung Hark / Yu Hae Jin

20
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,116
Jung Suk Yong / Han Young Mok

21
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,229
Special Performance Song Jae Ho

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,967
Stop!

23
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,012
They say the castle is too disordered...

24
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,907
they will lead us to
the temporary reception hall.

25
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,064
This place is huge.

26
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,736
This place doesn't look like a
reception hall. Something's wrong...

27
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,041
General, settle yourself.

28
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,553
I am General Choi Jung of Yongho's troop,
the protectors of the Korea's envoys.

29
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,325
Where are Ming's officials to greet us?

30
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,837
Drop your weapons now!

31
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,941
Koreans murdered our diplomatic envoy...

32
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,570
...then kept dispatching spies...

33
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,514
Now, you send us a military
masquarading as envoys?

34
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,719
You will pay for it!
Tie them up!

35
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,454
Relax, don't panic.

36
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,963
Stay back.

37
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,434
Throw your weapons away!
Those who disobey will die!

38
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,277
General Choi!

39
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,478
No, don't.

40
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,673
My duty is to protect the envoys.

41
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,874
General Choi!

42
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,881
Everyone, follow his orders.

43
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,005
General...

44
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,572
...we are almost to the exile.

45
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,778
I'm sorry I allowed this to happen.

46
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,583
It's my fault...

47
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,455
No, this is where our destiny lies.

48
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,457
Exile is better than being in prison

49
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,128
that suffocating prison...no, this is better.

50
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,692
But here it's...

51
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,699
just too hot..

52
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,265
Hello

53
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,693
We are from Korea

54
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,066
We were sent to exile...

55
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,736
Are you a Mongol general

56
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,639
From Cokotemure's cavalry?

57
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:21,258
Now's not the time.

58
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,469
We don't have any grudges against Korea.

59
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:46,420
Ming's dogs, however, will die.

60
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,632
We leave you to your own fate.
Move out!

61
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:29,528
General, including the Ambassador
we have 12 casualties.

62
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,534
Among the 23 survivors, five are severely injured.

63
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,999
Have everyone gather their belongings.

64
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,808
Should we prepare to
set up camp here?

65
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,773
Since the ambassador is dead,
there isn't a point of continuing with the envoy.

66
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,681
That's absurd.

67
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,953
If we leave, Ming's troops
will hunt us down.

68
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,927
- We'll explain to them what happened.
- Do you want to be kept in exile?

69
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,357
We should not leave.

70
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,664
We have to abide by Ming's orders.
We are the representatives of our country.

71
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:07,295
We do not carry any official letter or flag.
How can we prove ourselves?

72
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,106
Besides, Ming's troops will likely
blame us for the murders.

73
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,075
General, we caught some horses!

74
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,944
There were two!

75
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,879
If we stay here we will die.

76
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,020
- Get ready to leave, immediately!
- Yes sir!

77
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,548
We're surrounded by
an endless desert

78
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,187
Where could we go?

79
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,825
Back to Korea!

80
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,638
General, three are missing
all the others are injured.

81
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,946
Let's find food and water first.

82
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,661
We're going to die
if we stay here!

83
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:40,125
- Grab him, he's losing it.
- Let me go, let me go!

84
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,767
We are leaving.

85
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,297
General, we should look for the missing first.

86
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,640
This trip is too hard for me.

87
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:02,448
I always wanted to be buried by my home.

88
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,623
Are you in much pain?

89
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,826
Can't we rest here for a while?

90
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,426
No.

91
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:20,564
Even if we make it to Shandong
we will still need a boat

92
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,571
I'll take care of it.

93
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,236
Get up.

94
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,905
What?

95
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,544
Yeesol!

96
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,222
General, please forgive him...

97
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,662
he is a foolish one...
he only cares for my well-being.

98
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,099
He is a slave of the vice-ambassador.

99
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,757
This is the Great Wall.

100
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,163
To the east Ming and Yuan are at battle.

101
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,062
Below over here are
where Ming's troops are based.

102
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,888
Avoid the village, avoid his troops.

103
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,504
We must eliminate any chance to meet anyone.

104
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,110
General, if we head north
we will confront Yuan's troops.

105
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,614
What about here in the middle?

106
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,187
It's impossible.

107
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,924
By day the sun scorches the desert.

108
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,524
It will take at least twenty days to cross.

109
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,596
Our remaining food and water
will last us only 6 days.

110
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,629
We must pass through.

111
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,197
We will cross within ten days

112
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,674
If necessary we will eat once a day
and walk during night.

113
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,572
In that case, the southern desert is better.
We can gain three or four days.

114
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,044
Whose territory is that?

115
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,451
It is abandoned land.
No one has been able to conquer it.

116
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,754
However, my concern is the vice-ambassador

117
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,623
- He is already exhausted.
- Everyone here is!

118
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,428
Everyone is suffering, he
should be no different.

119
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,964
Get your ass up.

120
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,334
Slow us down and
you will die.

121
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,512
That son of a bitch.

122
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,480
He is going to kill us all.

123
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,793
Did you call for me?

124
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:42,030
My body can't go on. It is
useless to me now.

125
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,139
Take care of the group.

126
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,474
I hope you all safely return home...

127
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,776
I see.

128
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,888
I have one last request...

129
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,153
This man here...

130
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,861
I relinquish my title on this slave.

131
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:15,739
He is now a free man.
Treat him accordingly.

132
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,306
Please get some rest.

133
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,471
Hey you, stop there!

134
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,111
He stole food while standing guard.

135
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,314
I'm sorry sir.

136
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,387
Please forgive me!

137
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,720
There is no mercy for those in battle,

138
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,388
The same goes for those who steal.

139
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,459
Give them twenty floggings each

140
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:56,046
We only eat one piece a day, yet
we are equal to your troops!

141
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,853
Give me the floggings instead of him!

142
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:09,856
Agreed.

143
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,462
You will receive the floggings for both.

144
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,601
Watch carefully!

145
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,347
You'd served in many battles with my father.

146
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,693
Would he be proud of me?

147
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,100
Times were not as difficult
then as they are now.

148
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,000
But I am sure you will do well, sir.

149
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,467
Will we make it safely to Shandong?

150
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,314
Even if we return to Korea,
people will ridicule us all.

151
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,789
I failed to protect the envoys.
I failed to enter the castle of Nanjing.

152
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,557
This is for you,

153
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,658
Make use of it when you need it.

154
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,593
Take it.

155
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,093
Dying is better than this hell.

156
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,103
The vice-ambassador is gone.

157
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,619
Stop him and see what he carries.

158
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,162
The vice-ambassador has passed away!

159
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,467
Bury the body.
The horse will belong to Yongho's troops.

160
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,682
You may bury him yourself,
but we will take the horse.

161
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,557
General!

162
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,180
We're saved!

163
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,200
Good afternoon.

164
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,000
Please give us water and food.

165
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:58,239
Who the hell are you?

166
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,179
What should we do?
Should I tell them that we are Korea's envoys?

167
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,991
Don't, they're not
going to believe us anyway.

168
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:13,390
If you want to eat,
you'll have to pay for it.

169
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,567
- What are they saying?
- Do something. We're starving.

170
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,897
- Say something...
- Relax!

171
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,836
I can't bare this.

172
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,402
Move one more step
and I will kill you.

173
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,308
Are you from Korea?

174
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,317
Monk, are you also from Korea?

175
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,457
Serve food to these people.
I will pay for it.

176
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,131
You have my thanks.
I am General Choi Jung.

177
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,263
My Buddhist name is Jisan.
I am glad to have company on the way home.

178
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,000
You, thief!
Get your hands off my property!

179
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,081
Mongolian soldiers!

180
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:03,934
Sir...

181
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,315
Why do you carry a Mongolian sword?

182
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,483
General!

183
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,126
A few days ago, we passed the battlefields

184
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,035
Only the dead lay there.

185
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,209
- Are you a Buddhist monk?
- Yes

186
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,446
Can you hold a ceremony for my dead warriors?

187
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,814
That can be done.

188
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,155
Do you have the names of the dead?

189
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,555
All my men were brave warriors.

190
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,359
Just write 'The Sons of the Blue Wolf'.

191
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,834
Treat the injured first.

192
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,346
The General is coming.

193
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,389
Please, eat.

194
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,023
Will you keep refusing food?

195
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,613
Did you hear that?
He called her 'Princess'...

196
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,222
"Help me"

197
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,345
My friend, what do you want for it?

198
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:51,732
Shit! Who left this filthy thing here?

199
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,298
You brought this shit here, didn't you?

200
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,874
Get rid of it, right now!

201
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,328
Don't kill him!

202
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,075
He's formidable with that spear.

203
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,058
Where are you from?

204
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,521
Don't move.

205
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,867
They might kill us all.

206
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,336
He has the eyes of a lion.

207
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,173
Take him with us.

208
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:48,270
- General, he killed five of my men!
- You'll receive ten horses.

209
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:48,275
 

210
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:21,681
You left this world too soon in
this unknown land. May God bless you.

211
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:28,354
If you insist on travelling this path,
I will join you.

212
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,691
No need for that.

213
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,454
I am familiar with these locations,
I might be of help to you.

214
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,865
We're finished, shall we leave now?

215
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,550
No, we will wait.

216
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,342
Yuan's troops will pass through here.

217
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,076
We will save the Princess.

218
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,313
I thought we were headed
back to Korea sir?

219
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,287
That was my intention until yesterday.

220
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,986
However, we are the diplomatic envoys

221
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:06,054
Saving her will allow us to
enter the castle of Nanjing.

222
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,656
We could return home
triumphantly after that.

223
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,870
A foolish plan! Yuan's troops
are the strongest in the region.

224
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,334
Please reconsider General.

225
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,269
I made up my mind last night.

226
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,305
Let us try...

227
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:18,637
Daejung!

228
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,844
We have to save Yeesol as well.

229
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,613
We will attack from both sides.
Hall of us will attack from the rear.

230
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,149
The others will ambush them from the front.

231
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,421
- Now go.
- Wait! They're coming through now!

232
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,958
We will attack them all together!

233
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,023
General, we don't have any chance to win.

234
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,602
We can do it...

235
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,398
General!

236
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,641
Everyone hide!

237
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,229
Daejung!

238
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,208
Now is our chance!

239
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,605
Attack the horses first!

240
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,232
Save the Princess!

241
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:59,356
- Sir, wait...
- Damn it get away!

242
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,931
Fucking idiot!

243
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,955
I am General Choi Jung,
protector of Korea's envoys.

244
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,952
Get up.

245
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,392
I am Princess Buyong.

246
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,069
Funny, what are envoys doing in
the middle of the desert.

247
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:40,035
What is a Princess doing in the
middle of the desert, your highness.

248
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,741
Take me to the castle of Nanjing
as soon as possible.

249
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,748
Escort me there safely and
the emperor will award you greatly.

250
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,649
Your safety is assured with us.

251
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,322
Your highness,

252
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,025
board the carriage without any worries.

253
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,095
It is a total victory sir.

254
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,650
Are you okay?

255
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,506
You said you're an interpreter, right?

256
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:26,013
I am Park Jumyung...
I haven't entered an official post yet.

257
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,200
- but I'm hoping to soon...
- Deliver my words

258
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,553
to that man in black.

259
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,695
Hey, the princess wants you
to guard her carriage.

260
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,673
Sir, the princess wants
that man to guard her carriage.

261
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,876
I have a mission for you.

262
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,447
Guard the princess's carriage.

263
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,451
I want to see where
my master's grave.

264
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,390
You can talk?
Hey, he can talk!

265
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,771
I am ordering you again,
guard the carriage

266
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,270
I am a free man now.
I will do as I please.

267
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,647
General, don't be upset.

268
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,685
I don't need a slave who forgot his place.

269
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,984
But the vice-ambassador set him free, sir.

270
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,794
He was out of mind on the brink of death.

271
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,687
Once a slave, forever a slave.
That is the law of Korea.

272
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,140
Stop it!

273
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,155
Leave the bastard here.

274
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,421
Everyone, mount your horses.

275
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,166
General, there is one girl who survived.

276
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,634
She is a Chinese slut. Leave her behind.

277
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,003
General, mercy is the virtue of a great man.

278
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,641
This is none of your concern.
All decisions will be mine.

279
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,885
Take all with us.

280
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,547
General!

281
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,722
General!

282
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,356
The General is coming!

283
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,668
Honorable Cookoo

284
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,239
I lost the Ming Princess...

285
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,977
Soldiers from Korea took her.

286
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,949
Lay him down at my tent.

287
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,159
Princess,

288
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,332
it may be below you, but please eat this.

289
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,582
I didn't have time to
say this before...

290
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,800
...thank you.

291
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,800
Please get some rest, your highness.

292
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,794
I'm Yooran

293
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,193
Yooran?

294
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,271
Doesn't that mean 'the dancing orchid'?

295
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,406
That is the most beautiful name
I've ever heard.

296
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,636
I am Park Jumyung

297
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,112
You have cute eyes.

298
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,079
Wicked little man...

299
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:52,115
you have nothing else on your mind

300
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,356
but to flirt with a woman.

301
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,184
What responsibilities do I carry?

302
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,728
I am just an interpreter.

303
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:03,397
Don't you understand?
Those trivial readings are in vain...

304
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,328
What?

305
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:11,698
You Budhists ruined our country and
accumulated all the wealth...

306
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,741
How dare you speak of Confucius
as trivial readings.

307
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,537
Only fools believe Confucious is the best.

308
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,978
Hope for a joyous world
lies in every teaching.

309
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,449
Confucius's words are spread
throughout the world.

310
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,353
Open you eyes.

311
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,622
The first time I made a love
was under the full moon

312
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,666
She was sixteen, I was eighteen.

313
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,232
Every evening we met on the hills...

314
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,900
Then one day, she became pregnant...

315
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,800
...and we got married.
Five days later I left to join this trip.

316
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,999
Was it a boy or a girl?

317
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,542
When I left, she was eight months pregnant.
She might be in labor now...

318
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:04,618
I miss her so much.

319
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,196
Is he alright?

320
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,964
Get some sleep. I will take care of him.

321
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:25,275
He will recover tomorrow your highness.

322
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,449
Where were you headed to?

323
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,421
To Korea, your highness.

324
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,027
The General's troops and yours
don't seem to get along well.

325
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:46,034
In this kind of long journey
many things might happen.

326
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,905
Take good care of him.

327
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,632
I will, your highness.

328
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,885
Do not worry about the vice-ambassador.

329
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,693
He was buried in a place of open sunshine.

330
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,699
Do you have any family at home?

331
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,931
I am alone.

332
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,000
From now on, you aren't alone.

333
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,000
We'll get through this together.

334
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:35,008
 

335
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,795
Ming will search every corner
for the Princess...

336
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,828
...we must head north.

337
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,236
Everyone get out,
I have to talk with Rambulhwa

338
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,240
Do me a favor..

339
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,244
Anything...name it.

340
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:19,561
Ming kidnapped my sister.
I want their Princess in revenge.

341
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,728
Bring her to me.

342
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,163
Why did you help me?

343
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,400
Especially after the Emperor
sent you to exile.

344
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,170
Personal concerns and public duty
are two different things.

345
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,537
If you help us see the Emperor,

346
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,014
I can resolve the
misunderstanding about our envoys.

347
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,490
What is the name of that man behind us?

348
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,154
He is a just slave, your highness.

349
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,029
I asked you for his name.

350
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,068
They're coming!

351
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,811
They're after us!

352
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,284
Where are they now?

353
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,245
They're moving really fast, sir.

354
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,946
- How many?
- Over a hundred, sir.

355
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:52,949
 

356
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,622
We don't have much time.
We must leave at once.

357
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,922
Escape to where?

358
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,457
We'll throw them off with the carriage.

359
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,094
Good idea sir.

360
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,067
Who will lead the carriage?

361
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,808
I will.

362
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,171
Give me two soldiers from Yongho's troop.

363
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,000
No, we can't sacrifice you
or other warriors...

364
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,661
No, but I'm the interpreter.

365
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,259
And I never drove a carriage before...

366
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,138
He is too young, sir.

367
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,537
It has been decided.

368
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,238
Why is it always the Joojin soldiers?

369
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,507
Why do you keep quiet captain?

370
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,946
He doesn't even know his child!

371
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,949
Someone has to drive the carriage.

372
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:03,959
Put that boy on the carriage.

373
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,962
Captain Daejung!

374
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,895
We'll make them think
the princess is in the carriage.

375
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:34,585
Wear this.

376
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,095
Please help me!

377
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,000
- You can help me, can't you?
- I'm sorry...

378
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,446
Let me go with you.

379
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,667
Make a detour on the mountain,
you'll see the Hwangho River...

380
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,972
We will wait for you there.

381
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,614
Please take this...return it to
my master's family.

382
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,950
No...we will meet you there.

383
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,444
Take care of Dansaeng.

384
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,285
Protect the Princess...

385
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,924
Take this for good luck,
I'll retreive it when you return.

386
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,531
Be careful...

387
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,033
Stop!

388
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,732
We will walk from here.

389
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,802
Keep the horses close together.

390
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,535
What if Dansaeng doesn't come back?

391
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,501
They aren't that stupid.
They'll come after us sooner or later.

392
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,468
I'll be right behind you.

393
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,452
The Princess isn't in that carriage.

394
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,924
There can't be only
one soldier guarding her.

395
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,190
They are heading for the mountain.

396
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,500
Once they make it past the mountains
it will be impossible for us to track them.

397
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,768
They'll eventually try
to cross the Hwangho River.

398
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,204
Burn the village and
the ferry beyond the mountain.

399
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,709
Make sure nobody crosses that river.

400
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,008
Yes sir!

401
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,204
What about them?

402
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,207
Follow and kill.

403
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,990
Hurry! Let's go!

404
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,395
Stupid horse!

405
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,064
It's the Mongolian soldiers!

406
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,036
Dansaeng!

407
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,479
Throw that robe away and run...Now!

408
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:23,983
Go, now! Hurry, run!

409
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,187
Go! Run!

410
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,366
Yeosol!

411
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,409
I'm sorry...

412
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,342
Get up.

413
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,589
I served two years up north,

414
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,429
and two years to fighting the Japanese...

415
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,699
Altogether that's four years in the military.

416
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,098
When I got back, all
that was left was rat shit in the kitchen.

417
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:00,239
Shit! So I went to the head officer

418
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,742
and hit him on the head, bang!

419
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,749
So did they force you to choose
between imprisonment or military service?

420
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,618
How did you know that?

421
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,078
It's obvious

422
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,517
Don't go back at all.

423
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,950
I heard that there is
a Korean village in Beijing

424
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,255
I will go back no matter what

425
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,164
My wife is waiting for me

426
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,428
Guess your wife is pretty attractive?

427
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,604
She's like a fat bear...

428
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,804
Yet, for me, she is the prettiest in the world.

429
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,013
What about you?

430
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,215
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not married, yet...

431
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,414
I see.

432
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,116
What happened?

433
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,023
As we expected...

434
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:56,624
Sir, come.

435
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,566
Even if it's freezing we can't
give any signals to the Mongolians.

436
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,904
I'm sorry your highness,
I didn't mean to wake you.

437
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:19,144
I had a dream...

438
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,689
I was already in the Royal Palace.

439
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,329
Once we cross the Hwangho River,
we will escort you to the castle of Nanjing.

440
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,727
Daejung tells me that
we're headed to Shandong.

441
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:35,198
Believe me. I will keep my word,
your highness.

442
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,437
Has the carriage returned yet?

443
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:46,806
I am sure it will, your highness.

444
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:20,480
They aren't here, sir.

445
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,542
Divide the soldiers into smaller groups
and search the area.

446
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,678
What about the people?

447
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,883
Kill them as they have seen us.

448
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,535
I see no one at the ferry.

449
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,545
Double check to make sure.

450
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,172
Why aren't we going down?

451
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,680
First let's move through the valley.

452
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:57,952
Ha-il

453
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,520
Go check.

454
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:27,311
What is it?

455
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:32,380
The enemy is hiding near the ferry.

456
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:35,953
They'll kill anyone who tries to cross the river.

457
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,317
It seems that we have to give up
Dungju as well as Nanjing

458
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:07,948
What the...

459
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,455
I'm sorry, I didn't mean

460
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,725
to bring them here.

461
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,694
They just followed me from the ferry.

462
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,562
Now Yuan's troops will find us
at any moment.

463
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,498
We have to make them leave then!

464
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,175
Stop!

465
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,346
Stop it!

466
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,780
Don't you know what 'stop' means?

467
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:47,352
I never thought I would
see you here, your highness...

468
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,928
I have something
to discuss with both of you.

469
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,468
Let us cross the river when a night falls.

470
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,401
It is too far to Dungju.

471
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:06,409
It'd be better to go to Balhae Bay
and find a ferry boat there.

472
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,217
Are you saying that we
should cross the sea in a ferry boat?

473
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,648
If you can pass the Yuan cavalry,
feel free to go alone.

474
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:17,087
After crossing the river, what if
the General insists

475
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,193
on escorting the Princess to the
castle of Nanjing?

476
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,057
Are you crazy? We have to return to Korea!

477
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,158
The Princess has brought us all problems...

478
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,960
Besides, now it seems we have to take
all those people along as well.

479
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,167
We have a good news.

480
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,937
In five days we will head towards a fortress
on the coast where Ming's troops are based.

481
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,806
If we escort the Princess and her people there...

482
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,750
she will arrange for us a boat
to take us home to Korea.

483
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,012
Let's accept her offer.

484
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:50,285
Let us wait for the carriage first.

485
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:52,689
Do you think they are coming back alive?

486
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,261
We can't get to Koyro without the boat...

487
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,165
and with Ming's troops, we'll be safe.

488
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,268
Also, the Ming Emperor would
know that we saved her...

489
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,695
Yuan's troops will never give
up on the Princess.

490
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,273
True, but we do need the boat...

491
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,977
I will follow your opinion, General...

492
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,377
Good.

493
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:12,809
Get up.

494
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:13,743
But..

495
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,781
we will wait for the carriage
to return first.

496
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,853
We are in agreement, your highness.

497
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:27,355
I don't need pity.

498
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:32,697
It is not the time for pity.

499
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,401
Prepare to leave.

500
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,304
The Joojin troops stay here.

501
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,735
We will leave when Yeosol and Dansaeng return.

502
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,905
You've been in the military long enough to know

503
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:51,818
what the result of disobeying
a General's orders are...

504
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,956
General...

505
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,925
we should wait
until the evening passes.

506
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,770
Dansaeng's returned!

507
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,345
You're alive.

508
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:20,509
You alright?
Are you ok?

509
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,484
I've been waiting for you.

510
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,690
Welcome back.

511
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,992
It's stained with blood.

512
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,027
I am glad you returned alive...

513
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:12,367
I did not wish to award a slave
such an honorable death.

514
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,262
The noble tend to have useless thoughts.

515
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,714
Shouldn't we arrange a horse
for the princess?

516
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,046
She is not the princess of Korea.

517
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,688
The princess demands to ride in a palanquin!
It's out of the question.

518
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,094
Get a thick piece of word, now.

519
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:43,690
It is foolish.

520
01:06:59,048 --> 01:06:59,537
Daejung

521
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,666
Let's carry it.

522
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,158
But Captain...

523
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,265
Why should we carry that thing?

524
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:22,563
Someone has to carry it.

525
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:23,661
Hurry

526
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,340
My soles are as cracked as a turtle shell!

527
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,737
We don't have much time.

528
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,140
Shit.

529
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,046
I'll carry it.

530
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:10,307
~ the morning mountain home,
the white bird sings a song ~

531
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:15,483
~ I want to hear the song,
wish to go back home~

532
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,891
Quiet! Yuan's troops
are right behind us.

533
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:20,120
I'm sorry.

534
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,523
Your voice is louder than hers, monk.

535
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,891
She's just trying to comfort the children,
why are you so picky?

536
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,361
Aren't you worried about the children?

537
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,172
You're pretty thoughtful for one
who plays around with a prostitute.

538
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,070
If Yuan's troop catches us,
those children are the first victims.

539
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,808
And you'll be the first one who runs off.

540
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:39,571
What?

541
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,479
What do you know about me?

542
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,278
Silly fool.

543
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,323
Look at yourself...

544
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,431
We've walked all day,
but have only covered 12 kilometers.

545
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,069
At this rate it will
take us more than twenty days

546
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,140
I don't understand why we
have to do this at all!

547
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,971
How can a young man like
yourself have no one to wait for?

548
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,451
I don't have anyone. Really...

549
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,983
Any girl have your heart at least?

550
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:56,448
HA-Il, you miss your wife too, don't you?

551
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,721
He's still a bachelor.

552
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,862
How many times have I told you?

553
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,866
You haven't sex with a girl, right?

554
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,662
Why haven't you gotten married?

555
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,236
I took the wrong pills when I was young.

556
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,034
Yeah, he's still a child.

557
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,111
Would you like to try this?

558
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:23,075
No

559
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,662
Hey, hey...

560
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,833
Hey Granny! Come back!

561
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,669
She's a distracted old lady

562
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,139
She has been out of her mind
since her son was killed at the ferry.

563
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,706
How could we care for an old one like her?

564
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,938
Bring her here. She is also one of my people.

565
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,380
Who are you? Let me go

566
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,851
I'll carry her on my back.

567
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,892
Tens of soldiers are coming to this way, sir.

568
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,329
Did they find us?

569
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:16,532
I am afraid so.

570
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,533
Let's just take the princess.

571
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,810
If we take the others along, we'll all die.

572
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,272
He's right...
We'll just take the Princess and Yooran.

573
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,181
We must keep our promise to the Princess

574
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,584
We bring all of them along.

575
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,581
Yuan's cavalry are faster than the wind.

576
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,793
Even the hunter cares for the animal.
