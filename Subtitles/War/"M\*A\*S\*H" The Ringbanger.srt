1
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,798
[B.J.] Let's say, in the next war, the
generals strip down to their B.V.D.'s...

2
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:20,302
and have at it with baseball bats
while the rest of us stay home.

3
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,034
[Frank]
That is so like you, Hunnicutt.
Not a patriotic bone in your body.

4
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:27,236
No wonder the man flunked anatomy.
He thinks there are patriotic bones.

5
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,506
- Four-oh silk.
- We only have three-oh.

6
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,172
I'll take three-oh,
and you'll owe me one.

7
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,682
You just don't understand people
wanting to fight for their country.

8
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,049
Sure I do,
but it isn't my country.

9
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,749
Don't you realize that if we weren't
here, the Commies would overrun
the whole darn place?

10
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,291
[B.J.] Serve 'em right.
The weather stinks, and the food's lousy.

11
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,554
And the room service
leaves a lot to be desired.

12
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,619
- [Hawkeye] Sponge.
- [Nurse] Sponge.

13
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:49,757
Those Commies think they can run the
world. Let's see 'em try to run Newark.

14
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,394
- In two weeks, they'd end up
in the trunk of a Buick.
- [Laughing]

15
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,233
- Sir, there's a Colonel Bidwell
to see you.
- Tell him I'm busy.

16
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:58,775
He said, if you said you were busy,
I was to say it's urgent.

17
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:01,538
You can tell him to take
a flying leap...

18
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:04,445
- I'll be out when I'm finished.
- That's what I told him.

19
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,949
- Colonel Potter?
- Right.

20
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,181
I'm Colonel Bidwell, "l" Corps
Operations Officer.

21
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,781
- What can I do for you?
- Who's your best doctor?

22
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:17,986
- Why do you wanna know?
- Will you answer the question, please?

23
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,792
We have several good men.

24
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:25,233
- Do you have one who's outstanding?
- Yes, we do.

25
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:30,740
- What's his name, Colonel?
- Our best man is Captain
Benjamin Franklin Pierce.

26
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,106
- I'll take him.
- For what?

27
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:36,738
Personal physician to General Theodore
A. Korshak, "l" Corps Commander.

28
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:40,750
- Korshak? "Tamer of the Tiger Tank"?
- None other.

29
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:42,911
- Pierce isn't your man.
- He is if he's the best.

30
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,615
If General Korshak were being
carried in on a stretcher...

31
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,680
I'd say Pierce
is the fella you want.

32
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,783
But a personal physician?
No, sirree.

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,953
- Why not?
- Because Pierce is a maverick...

34
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:55,897
from the top of his unshorn head
to the tips of his uncut toenails.

35
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,333
- You're saying he's not G.I.
- He isn't even housebroken.

36
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:02,395
I appreciate your candor,
but I still want to meet him.

37
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,442
Whatever you say.
He's in O.R. Right now.

38
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,500
Nurse.

39
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:12,242
Listen, Bidwell. A lot of men are alive
today because Pierce works here.

40
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:16,582
- I don't wanna lose him.
- Are you suggesting the general
settle for second best?

41
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:19,417
Are you suggesting <i>we</i> should?

42
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,357
[B.J.] You ever get the feeling
there's a war going on?

43
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,884
There's always a war going on. War is
the world's favorite spectator sport.

44
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:29,023
- Give me some more skin sutures.
- Everybody knows war is hell.

45
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,930
Remember, you heard it here last.

46
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,526
War isn't hell.
War is war, and hell is hell.

47
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,765
And of the two,
war is a lot worse.

48
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:38,967
- How do you figure that, Hawkeye?
- Easy, Father.

49
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:41,170
Tell me, who goes to hell?

50
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:43,975
- Sinners, I believe.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

51
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,380
There are no innocent
bystanders in hell.

52
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,011
But war is chockfull of them...
little kids, cripples, old ladies.

53
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:54,456
<i>Except for a few of the brass,</i>
<i>almost everybody involved</i>
<i>is an innocent bystander.</i>

54
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,494
Well, I'm not. I'm here because
my country needs me.

55
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,621
How do you know it wasn't
just some excuse to ship you
8,000 miles from home?

56
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:03,461
The Korean War was invented so your
parents wouldn't come looking for you.

57
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,525
[Frank]
You're a pair of sickos!

58
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,228
I'm not getting a pulse.

59
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,497
No.

60
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,744
- No pulse.
- Amanda! Adrenaline! Bag 'im!

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,845
<i>Gloria! Bicarb!</i>

62
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:27,117
Where's the adrenaline?

63
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,182
Into the I.V. Tubing.

64
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:35,495
Come on! Come on, damn it!

65
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,996
I'm gonna go inside.
Give me a knife. Rib spreader!

66
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,063
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on.

67
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:51,136
Come on. Live, damn it. Live.

68
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,376
Don't let the bastard win.

69
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,918
I'm getting a pulse.

70
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,220
<i>It's getting better.</i>

71
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:10,664
All right. Let's close up.
Chest tube.

72
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,827
- Pressure's coming up.
- [B.J.] Nice goin', Hawk.

73
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:15,633
- Klinger.
- Get the new sutures going.

74
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:19,107
- Congratulations, son.
- I guess it just wasn't his turn.

75
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:22,202
That's right. If it had been his turn,
you would've worked on him.

76
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,104
[Klinger]
Comin' through!

77
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,480
- Hey, do me a big favor, will ya, pal?
- What, Doctor?

78
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,281
- Move it or get it amputated.
- I beg your pardon?

79
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:33,346
Don't beg.
Just get your butt outta here.

80
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:36,221
Give me the scissors.
You keep loading those sutures.

81
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,888
- Seen enough, Colonel?
- A little hot-tempered, isn't he?

82
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,454
Yes, and this is one
of his cooler days.

83
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,335
Well, I told you Pierce wasn't
the man you were looking for.

84
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,435
Fine doctor, but undisciplined.

85
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:57,639
I should add he hates brass.

86
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:00,114
I'll include that in my report
to the general.

87
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,948
According to Pierce, the only
medical attention generals require...

88
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,113
is a daily high colonic.

89
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,089
Incredible.

90
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,058
Have a good trip back.
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

91
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,288
- Listen, Potter.
- Yes, Colonel?

92
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:16,298
In the operating room,
when Pierce was trying to save
that man's life, he said...

93
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,426
"Don't let the bastard win."
Who was he talking about?

94
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:23,803
Death. When it comes to death,
Pierce is a sore loser.

95
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:27,275
It's a part of life, part of war.
And we're soldiers.

96
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,335
Maybe we are, but Pierce isn't.

97
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,904
He's just humoring us
by wearing that uniform.

98
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:35,782
He's one doctor who'll never be
nonchalant where death is concerned.

99
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,843
He'll always take it personally.

100
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,355
He could crack up
with that attitude.

101
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:43,120
You're right. He's a good man
to stay away from.

102
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,889
- Colonel.
- Sayonara.

103
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,068
Sometimes I get the feeling
we're only a bunch of mechanics.

104
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,130
- Mechanics?
- Sure.

105
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,369
Doctors fix people up,
so they can go on living.

106
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:02,935
We fix them up, so they can
go back and get killed.

107
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,243
We're running a body-and-fender shop
at a demolition derby.

108
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:08,614
Well, I'm not a mechanic.
I'm a surgeon and a gentleman.

109
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,676
He uses the right fork
and the wrong knife.

110
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,052
When his patient dies, he always says
"Excuse me" before leaving the table.

111
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,114
There's nothing wrong
with manners.

112
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,251
We all heard how Pierce talked
to that visiting colonel.

113
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,625
He gave the 4077 th a black eye.

114
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,687
You gave it a black armband.

115
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,893
That man was a general's aide.
Where would we be without leadership?

116
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:27,095
I'd be in the backseat
of a '46 DeSoto...

117
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,161
"schnuggling" with Wanda Lamperski.

118
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,230
[Chuckles]

119
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:37,141
- Hi, Radar.
- Hey, Mulligan.
I hear you're going home.

120
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,205
Yeah. I finally got my points.

121
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:41,843
First stop Seoul, and then
I'm Bitter Creek bound.

122
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,284
- You're what?
- Bitter Creek.

123
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:47,346
- A small town in Wyoming.
That's where I'm from.
- Oh.

124
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,083
I just wanted
to tell you good-bye.

125
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,595
Hey, gee, thanks, Mulligan.
Good luck to you.

126
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:58,228
There is something
I'd like you to do for me...

127
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,361
something I'd like you
to take care of.

128
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,428
Yeah? Go ahead, sit down.

129
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:09,278
- What is it?
- Well, it's, uh, very precious...

130
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,247
and, uh... very beautiful.

131
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:14,341
Is it a bird or somethin'?

132
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:16,716
Nah, it's a girl.

133
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:20,212
A girl?

134
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,318
- You mean, a girl?
- That's right.

135
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:27,557
Look, Radar, you're a real nice,
gentle guy, and l...

136
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,622
I want you to be her friend.

137
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,691
Yeah?

138
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:34,794
Well, her name's Mai Ping.
I've told her all about you.

139
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:37,931
She's waiting for you
over at Rosie's Bar.

140
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,999
Oh, boy.

141
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,336
A real girl.

142
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,246
Mai Ping, this is Radar.

143
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,315
- Uh, O'Reilly.
- Radar O'Reilly.

144
00:08:56,393 --> 00:09:00,295
<i>Actually, my name is Walter,</i>
<i>but only my mother calls me that.</i>

145
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,530
Treat her nice, okay?

146
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,592
Good-bye, Mai Ping.

147
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,441
Please sit down, Walter.

148
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,501
Okay. Thank you.

149
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:21,073
Oh, would you like a drink?

150
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,381
They serve a nice
grape Nehi here.

151
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,512
Oh, no, thank you.

152
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:32,321
- Are you from Korea?
- Oh, yes. I am Korean.

153
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:37,222
- And you?
- I'm just here for the war.

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,463
It's a pretty country,
except where it's bombed.

155
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,233
Mmm.

156
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:46,400
You have any hobbies?
You like sports?

157
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:49,468
Mmm, no, I don't.

158
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:56,178
- Uh, would you like to take a walk?
- Yes.

159
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,744
Shall I show you my hut?

160
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:03,088
Your what? Your hut? Now?

161
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,857
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

162
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,136
- Oh, can I help you?
- Mmm.

163
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:18,273
[Cooing]

164
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:24,007
- Hey, there's a baby in your basket.
- Yes, there is.

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,015
- Is he your brother?
- He's my son.

166
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,347
<i>Lee Chin.</i>

167
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,751
- Lee Chin Mulligan?
- Yes.

168
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,791
Ah, that's nice.

169
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,962
- [Baby Cooing]
- Thank you.

170
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,178
Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,726
Have you ever really
considered the foot?

172
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,792
Yeah, but I prefer girls.

173
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,804
Look at it. The foot is
an incredible thing.

174
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:24,568
- What's so hot about a foot?
- You can stand on 'em.
You can walk on 'em.

175
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,649
You can kick people
in the tush with 'em.

176
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,841
You sold me.
I'll take a pair in my size.

177
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,478
There are none in your size.

178
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:34,546
- Ah, welcome to our hovel.
- It's not much, but it's
close to where we live.

179
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:37,320
- And only minutes to the nearest war.
- I'm glad you like it here.

180
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,328
- I nearly lost Hawkeye today.
- In a poker game?

181
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:43,923
I'd never throw you into the pot
unless I had at least two pair.

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,161
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Ever hear of General Korshak?

183
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,829
Is he related to "General Chaos"?

184
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:52,567
Same guy. General Ted Korshak
sent that colonel up here.

185
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,667
- That bozo in the O.R.?
- <i>Yep.</i>

186
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,178
Looking for a personal physician
for the general.

187
00:11:57,246 --> 00:12:00,272
- Why?
- <i>Prestige. Found out</i>
<i>some other three-star...</i>

188
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,113
had his own doctor and decided
he couldn't live without one.

189
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,517
Actually, for the doctor,
it's easy duty.

190
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,614
You eat well, hotel beds,
and the hours aren't bad.

191
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:12,627
- So the colonel was
lookin' me over, huh?
- Yep.

192
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,960
- And I blew my big chance.
- It was the way you acted in O.R.

193
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:18,933
He thought you were crude,
rude and unmilitary.

194
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,437
- A triple threat.
- And I wasn't even wearing my swim fins.

195
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,769
You were absolutely disgraceful...

196
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,206
and I think I'll buy you a drink.

197
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,904
[Bidwell]
You're not gonna like him, General.

198
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:32,106
- Gave you a lot of static, huh?
- Yes, sir.

199
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:36,982
- Downright insolent. A real hardnose.
- That makes two of us.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,992
- Hi, Radar.
- Oh, hi, Klinger. How's it goin'?

201
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,334
Marvelous. I love peeling
these little fellas.

202
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:59,841
- I'm considering it as a career.
- Oh, that's neat.

203
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,742
- Hey, Radar. There's a new
invention just came out.
- Yeah?

204
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:05,406
It's really catching on.
It's called the bag.

205
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:10,919
Thanks. Listen, Klinger,
this isn't for me, you know?

206
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,955
What do I care who they're for,
as long as I don't have to peel 'em?

207
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:17,220
- Oh.
- <i>Take a couple more while we got 'em.</i>

208
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,454
<i>Little kids need eggs.</i>

209
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:21,928
Oh. Thanks a lot, Klinger.

210
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,797
- How do you like bein' a father?
- Oh, I'm not the father.

211
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,895
- I'm sort of the foster uncle.
- <i>[Eggshells Cracking]</i>

212
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:34,408
Do kids like 'em scrambled?

213
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:37,241
How's it feel to be
a family man, Radar?

214
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,838
- I worry a lot.
- What about?

215
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:42,509
About the baby.
Geez, how's he gonna get along?

216
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:46,681
I mean, he's so, uh...
He's so small and little.

217
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:50,055
Whenever I'm not with him, I worry.
And when I'm there, I worry even more.

218
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:52,856
- You're a good father, Radar.
- I'm not the father.

219
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,761
I know.
You're still a good father.

220
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,822
Thanks.

221
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,028
- What's it like being the real thing?
- You worry a lot.

222
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:05,130
Geez. I get antsy if even a day goes by,
and I don't see little Lee Chin.

223
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:09,143
And I'm just his uncle. I mean,
I'm not really his uncle, of course.

224
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:12,203
- Are you and Mai Ping...
- What?

225
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:16,217
- Nothin'.
- Oh, no, nothin' like that.
We're just friends.

226
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,412
I envy you.

227
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,081
- Really?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:23,990
Gee, and you a doctor
and an officer.

229
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,994
You got a family, Radar.
Take my word for it.

230
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,292
It's better than
either of those things.

231
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:32,061
Well, I really appreciate you coming
along to give the baby a checkup.

232
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:36,070
- No problem.
- You know, sometimes he cries.
What do you think that is?

233
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,197
You think he's just hungry
or something?

234
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:40,970
Could be, pal.
There's a lot of it goin' around.

235
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,887
This way, General.

236
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:05,491
Mildred, just another 14 months
and 11 days till retirement.

237
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,373
- Ah! General.
- At ease, Colonel.

238
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,840
- Thank you, sir.
- General Korshak, Colonel Potter.

239
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,537
Pleased to meet you, General.
Is there anything I can do for you?

240
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,672
- Well, you could put me
out of my misery.
- I beg your pardon?

241
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:23,149
- I'm parched.
- Oh, certainly.

242
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,483
[Chuckles]

243
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:31,021
- Colonel?
- Thanks.

244
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:36,531
- Mmm. Good scotch.
- Thank you, General.
Is that all you wanted?

245
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,033
Sit down, Colonel.

246
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:43,401
You have a tough guy
on your staff here, name of Pierce.

247
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:46,441
Bidwell tells me he's a piece
of real live ammo.

248
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,500
Did the colonel tell you
he hates generals...

249
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,171
more than watered gin
and earaches put together?

250
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:55,741
Me too. Never met one yet
that was worth his weight in Spam.

251
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,446
If Pierce wants an argument, he's gonna
have to do a lot better than that.

252
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:02,150
- I think he can, General. Oh.
- Just what the doctor ordered.

253
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,552
I'd like to meet
my new personal physician.

254
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,755
Now.

255
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,629
[Cooing]

256
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:18,036
- Is he okay?
- Fit as a fiddle and ready for love.

257
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:22,373
- What?
- Lee Chin is just fine.

258
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,641
Thank you.
Would you like some tea?

259
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,648
No, thanks.
I've gotta get back.

260
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:31,152
The army's a lot like the A.M. A...
both frown on house calls.

261
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:34,612
- Here we are.
- Here we go.

262
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,215
Oh, what a big boy.

263
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,284
- Hey, B.J.
- Mm-hmm?

264
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:42,023
I really appreciate this.
This was swell of ya.

265
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:45,555
No problem, Radar.
You have a beautiful family.

266
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:48,068
Bye.

267
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,697
He's very healthy.

268
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,134
- Walter.
- Hmm?

269
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,839
He looks like you.

270
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,712
- You think so?
- Oh, yes.

271
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:03,945
He's very handsome.

272
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:10,090
Well, maybe the eyes.

273
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:13,622
I hear you're a real pistol, Doc.

274
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,687
Only when I'm loaded.

275
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,994
I'm not much of a doctor
once you get to know me.

276
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,831
- According to Potter, you're the best.
- Well, the colonel drinks.

277
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:23,633
Only in groups of one or more.

278
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:25,640
What's your medical
background, Captain?

279
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,701
Typical. I had all
the childhood diseases.
Mumps, measles, colic... you name it.

280
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,645
- You <i>are</i> insolent.
- Well.

281
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,774
<i>Seriously, where'd you study?</i>

282
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,081
I never studied seriously.
If I hadn't cheated on the final exam...

283
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,815
and been a personal friend of the
cadavers, I never would've graduated.

284
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:45,155
- And that was high school.
- This guy kills me.

285
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,286
What higher praise
for a physician?

286
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,196
I want this man.

287
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:53,257
Uh, General, I'd really rather not
be your personal physician...

288
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:56,065
or your court jester, or whatever
it is you're shopping for.

289
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,005
Do you realize what an opportunity
I'm offering you, Captain?

290
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:02,009
Sure. The moon, the stars, your
high school letterman's sweater.

291
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,341
Same deal I offered
Nurse Baker last night.

292
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:08,907
Pierce, I have enough ribbons
and medals to... to cover that wall.

293
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,316
Well, bring 'em around.
It'll liven up the place.

294
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:14,083
I'm not movin'
those pictures.

295
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:17,250
Ribbons and medals don't mean
a thing. These are a different matter.

296
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:20,727
- These you have to go out
and get for yourself.
- You mean, they don't deliver?

297
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:23,560
You don't get them
by taking "no" for an answer.

298
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,930
- You see this?
- What?

299
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:30,164
There's supposed to be
a medical insignia there, a caduceus.

300
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,434
I probably dropped it
in a patient.

301
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,999
You know how I got that?
I mean, if it was there.

302
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:38,342
- By working your butt off?
- That's right.

303
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:40,405
So as long as I have
to be in Korea...

304
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,679
why don't you let me do what
I was trained to do... be a doctor.

305
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,550
Okay. Let's see you in action.

306
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,613
[Air Hissing]

307
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:55,493
- How is it, Doc?
- It's awfully high.
You almost rang the bell.

308
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:59,728
- Blame it on the major.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.

309
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,827
I wonder whether
you know my fiance...

310
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,963
Lieutenant Colonel
Donald Penobscott.

311
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,735
He's stationed in Tokyo.
He's a great admirer of yours, General.

312
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:12,270
- I know a Penobscott...
no neck, one eyebrow.
- That's him!

313
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:14,281
- One eyebrow?
- Mmm.

314
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,874
- Over which eye.
- Both.

315
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:19,113
Oh, yeah. Cro-Magnon.

316
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,588
- It's very sexy.
- Come on, General.

317
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:23,648
We'll take some dirty pictures
of your lungs.

318
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:29,229
- You're really somethin'.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

319
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,289
<i>[Baby Coos]</i>

320
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,369
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mulligan.

321
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:41,935
Oh.

322
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,672
I got to Seoul. I was practically
on the plane when...

323
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:47,409
when I realized I couldn't leave you
and the baby.

324
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:50,775
I love you, Mai Ping.

325
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:53,447
I love you, Mulligan.

326
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,185
<i>I guess we can go to Bitter Creek</i>
<i>together, huh?</i>

327
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:03,891
[Sighs]
Bitter Creek sounds nice.

328
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,457
[Both Laughing]

329
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,772
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh...
everything, Radar.

330
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:18,870
Oh, heck.

331
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:22,110
It wasn't everything. I just
took care of the baby. That's all.

332
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:24,277
He's a terrific baby.

333
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:27,379
I didn't, uh... There we go.

334
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:30,084
Oh, hey, listen. I borrowed
your slippers. They're...

335
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,150
They're really nice.
I enjoyed them.

336
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:36,857
Um, I guess I don't have to put these on.
Colonel Potter needs me. I'm sure.

337
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,423
I knew you were coming back.
I think that's terrific.

338
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,526
Um... I gotta fill out
the monthly report.

339
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:43,594
Walter.

340
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,375
Thanks.

341
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:53,437
[Coos]

342
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,911
Bye.

343
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:04,086
Okay, okay. I'll do
anything you say...

344
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,754
except give up my stogies
and my scotch.

345
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,458
- Then I might as well sign on
as your personal physician.
- Good.

346
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,898
- As long as I can come back
here after the funeral.
- What funeral?

347
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:15,801
Yours. You're looking for
a doctor to keep you alive...

348
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,862
and you're doing everything
you can to kill yourself.

349
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,931
I'm in pretty good shape
for a man my age.

350
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,806
- You are if you're 103.
- Not funny, Pierce.

351
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:25,403
The stroke that's headed
your way is a lulu.

352
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,711
It could come today,
tomorrow or next Tuesday.

353
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:32,550
- Or never, right?
- Wrong. Six months at the outside.

354
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:33,755
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor. See?

355
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:36,485
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor. See?

356
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,356
You got high blood pressure,
General. You drink, you smoke.

357
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,452
You're 20 pounds overweight
without the medals.

358
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,657
<i>There are two ways</i>
<i>you can avoid a stroke.</i>

359
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,600
One... go to Tokyo,
check into a hospital,
start taking care of yourself.

360
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,638
- Two?
- Sit on a land mine.

361
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:53,538
If you're trying to scare me,
young man, you're not succeeding.

362
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,633
<i>Look, you're lucky.</i>
<i>You have a choice.</i>

363
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,940
Unlike the other guys who come
through here, it's up to you...

364
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,980
whether you live or die.

365
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,209
Can't do it, Pierce.
I've got a war to fight.

366
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,649
Okay. Your next foxhole
will be six feet deep.

367
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,710
You really lay it on
with a shovel, don't you?

368
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,779
- I'm not kidding!
- Neither am I.

369
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,848
Start packing.
You'll get your orders.

370
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,120
- Driver.
- Wait a second.

371
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:15,458
No, no. Hold it!
Wait a minute! Hold it!

372
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,658
- All right. Hold it.
- Look, General...

373
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,167
if you take my advice, you can
live to be an old Korshak.

374
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,602
But you don't need me hanging
around counting your calories...

375
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:26,105
<i>and putting out your cigar</i>
<i>and listening to your liver hiccup.</i>

376
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:28,165
There are a lot of boys
who come through this place...

377
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,905
whose lives I can save
if I'm here.

378
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:35,109
You guys always say the men come first.
Well, do they or don't they?

379
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,677
They do.

380
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:43,656
All right, Pierce.
You stay here and do your job.

381
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:46,853
I'll do mine.
I can take orders too.

382
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:49,522
Good. I'll have a corned beef
on rye with mustard.

383
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:51,588
[Laughing]
You're right.

384
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,930
The kid is a pistol.
Let's go. Come on.

385
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:01,973
Don't forget the ribbons
for the wall!

386
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:10,806
Is it true, Colonel?
General Korshak is still in the market
for a personal physician?

387
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:12,876
- That's right, Burns.
- I'm perfect for the job.

388
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,888
- I'd like your recommendation.
- You've got it.

389
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:16,150
- And mine.
- And mine.

390
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,250
- The motion's carried.
- [Giggling]

391
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:23,161
I'd appreciate it, sir, if you'd
send a letter to the general
outlining my qualifications.

392
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,358
- Good idea.
- <i>[Drawer Opens]</i>

393
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:31,427
- What are they?
- I have a thriving practice
back in Fort Wayne.

394
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:33,633
They're thriving
'cause Frank's not there.

395
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,575
- And a splendid war record.
- Should you mention the time...

396
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:39,875
- he dropped his bubble gum
in the patient?
- Bubble gum. Good.

397
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:42,712
Or the time he sneezed and performed
an accidental appendectomy.

398
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:46,049
- Fainted in O.R. 27 times.
- Threw up in post-op 12.

399
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,918
- Overslept 48.
- Colonel, you're not
writing all that down?

400
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,981
I'm getting it all.
It may help.

401
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,823
- The hysterectomy on that sergeant.
- Boy, was he sore about that.

402
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:56,193
- Colonel! I...
- Oh, let's not forget Major Houlihan.

403
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:58,357
Oh, Major Houlihan.
We shouldn't forget...
