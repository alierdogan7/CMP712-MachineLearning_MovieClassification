00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,264
He's eyeing the laptop.

176
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,267
Got to be curious
after what I just dumped on him.

177
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,602
Here he goes.

178
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,733
What the hell is he...

179
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,236
What is that?

180
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:39,741
Nobody frisked him?

181
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:40,792
He was unarmed.

182
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,243
Can we get a better look at the monitor?

183
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,661
Alisha: I'll change angles, sir.

184
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,338
Can you zoom?

185
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,341
Sean: <i>It isn't a question
of what we've lost,</i>

186
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,311
<i>it's a question of what we've been given...</i>

187
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:01,763
That's Ramsey.

188
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:05,817
<i>And that is a chance...
A chance to start again.</i>

189
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:09,353
<i>A chance to renew the human
spirit with our valiance,</i>

190
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:12,240
<i>a chance to reclaim the world.</i>

191
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,693
<i>This is our calling,</i>

192
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:23,117
<i>and if you are watching this,
know that we are calling you.</i>

193
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,872
[Exhales deeply]

194
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:36,245
Sean: <i>And you must prepare yourself
for the task ahead.</i>

195
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,613
<i>There will be doubters...</i>

196
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,448
We have to figure out
what else is on that drive.

197
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,216
We walk in there and ask him for it,

198
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:42,818
he'll know we've been surveilling him.

199
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,169
He'll clam up completely.

200
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:46,338
When you're trying to break
an Al-Qaeda operative,

201
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,041
you don't let him keep messages
from Bin Laden in his pocket.

202
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,342
We take away the computer.

203
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,211
We prevent him from accessing the messages.

204
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,463
Look at that man. He's a lost cause.

205
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,131
We don't know that, sir... Not yet.

206
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,883
Right, and while we're trying
to figure that out,

207
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,602
we're sitting here burning fuel,
hiding behind this island,

208
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:03,022
wondering what the sub is up to,
what its plans are.

209
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:04,556
We have to find out how they communicate.

210
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:07,476
We have to find out
how Ramsey sent those messages

211
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:09,395
across the country all the way from Europe.

212
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:12,981
I appreciate what you're trying to do, sir,

213
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,983
but getting intel out of this man

214
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,319
has to be priority number one.

215
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,707
<i>But you, Jeffrey,</i>

216
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,126
<i>you were put on the earth for this,</i>

217
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:26,328
- [door opens]
- <i>To fight the forces of...</i>

218
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,496
[beep]

219
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,061
Coffee?

220
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:44,646
I'm just fine. Thanks.

221
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,791
You wanted to talk.

222
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:16,044
Sending your X.O. In here
first... that some kind of game?

223
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:20,549
I was in the combat center,
monitoring Sean Ramsey's sub.

224
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,384
Well, I imagine they'll be coming from me.

225
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:25,304
Then what... they're gonna blow us out
of the water if we don't release you?

226
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,638
Something like that.

227
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,524
So, they're in the habit
of using their missiles?

228
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:30,526
You're talking about the labs.

229
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:34,446
- The labs, our scientists...
- Your X.O. Tried to sell me on that.

230
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,315
You think we manufactured that video?

231
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,901
You went to great lengths
to bring me on this ship.

232
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:41,737
Doctoring a video would not be
particularly difficult.

233
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,706
According to Sean,
you're the chosen, right?

234
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,743
I would think a ship carrying the cure,

235
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,796
labs trying to manufacture
that cure, well...

236
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,550
...that would be the greatest
threat possible to him.

237
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,718
We are strong because of our strength.

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,087
We don't need to destroy anyone else.

239
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,472
So, you believe we have the cure?

240
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:03,308
- I believe you<i> think</i> you do.
- And you've seen our instructions

241
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,677
from the President,
the Secretary of the Navy?

242
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,514
I've seen them. They're from months ago.
They're obsolete.

243
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:12,100
Well, that leaves me in a bit of a bind.

244
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:16,355
We have standing orders from
the previous administration...

245
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:19,575
Orders that are consistent
with national protocols...

246
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:24,246
And then we have<i> you,</i> the new President,

247
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,165
issuing orders that don't seem to be

248
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,783
in the national interest at all.

249
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:31,286
The national interest is saving
what's left of this country.

250
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:34,790
Sean Ramsey and our movement give the
country the best chance at that.

251
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,708
Convince me.

252
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,380
Tell me how it all happened...

253
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:43,382
How you came to this point,

254
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:47,135
why you're so sure of what you believe.

255
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,356
Is he trying to turn him or get the intel?

256
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,108
<i>Come on, Mr. President.</i>

257
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,395
You want off this ship,

258
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:58,730
you're gonna have to convince me.

259
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:09,875
<i>The outbreak had just started in Earnest,</i>

260
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,460
in the South.

261
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:15,797
'Course, that was before anyone
knew how bad it would become.

262
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,968
The President sent me down to Tallahassee

263
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,138
to create quarantine areas
and organize safe zones.

264
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,425
It was only supposed to be
for a week or so, but then...

265
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:30,312
Things started spiraling
out of control very quickly.

266
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,598
It was untenable
for me to leave the region.

267
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Within a month, the entire
country was enveloped.

268
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,986
I can't begin to imagine.

269
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:40,239
No. You can't.

270
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,408
And your family?

271
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,194
They were with me.

272
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,913
But not immune?

273
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:50,999
Safe zones were created
to protect the people.

274
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,702
But there wasn't a reliable test
for the virus,

275
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:56,955
and early symptoms were very subtle.
We couldn't stop it.

276
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:59,708
And how did you discover
that you were immune?

277
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,877
We were in one of
the safe zones I created...

278
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,263
Doak Stadium, where
the Seminoles used to play?

279
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:08,016
- Sure.
- Well, when you look around

280
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:11,887
and you see 20,000 people dead
and only a handful alive,

281
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,357
you start to get the feeling
that maybe you're special,

282
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,893
except not in any way you'd<i> want</i> to be...

283
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:21,613
Not when your children are
bleeding out of their eyeballs.

284
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,901
And Sean?

285
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,986
How did you find your way to him?

286
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,738
I only wanted to die.

287
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
For three weeks, I walked around

288
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,909
exposing myself to anyone who was sick.

289
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,545
I thought maybe that there was
a different strain,

290
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,047
maybe there was some other way
that I could catch it.

291
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,752
One day, I stumbled upon
a group of survivors.

292
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,837
Except they weren't acting
like everybody else.

293
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,091
They didn't have that rabid look
in their eyes...

294
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,393
The desperation, the loss.

295
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:55,897
They had a sense of purpose, unity...

296
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,599
Hope, even.

297
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:00,152
And I learned they were all immune

298
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:02,404
and that I was one of them.

299
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:05,991
And I slept for the first time in weeks.

300
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:08,110
I held food down,

301
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:09,828
<i>and I started to see</i>

302
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,831
<i>that there's more
than loss and desperation...</i>

303
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,667
That there's a future,
a way to start again.

304
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,538
They showed me how
the movement began in Europe...

305
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,291
That from the ashes, they were once
again building a civilization.

306
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:24,626
And I realized,

307
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:27,963
if I'm the surviving member of the
Cabinet, if I'm the President,

308
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:30,799
I can be a part of making it happen<i> here.</i>

309
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,018
Because one thing was clear...

310
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,887
Sean Ramsey may not be what we asked for,

311
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:38,390
but he was what was given to us,

312
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:41,526
and his vision is what's saving the world.

313
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:45,313
And what exactly is his vision?

314
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,483
Immunes remain together, united.

315
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,318
Create a new line of the human race,

316
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,237
strong enough to withstand any plague.

317
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,822
A master race?

318
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,490
Yeah, well, that's
a pretty antiquated view of it.

319
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,042
That's what it is.

320
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,044
I know it sounds cutthroat,
but there's a deep logic to it.

321
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,495
And that is...?

322
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:03,331
Non-immunes will eventually
bring down the rest of you

323
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,885
if you co-mingle, if you procreate?

324
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,970
How many of you
are even left on this planet?

325
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,473
How spread out are you? We
have to protect ourselves...

326
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:15,330
The people strong enough to survive. That's
Darwin. That's the Law of the Jungle.

327
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,311
That's biblical.

328
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,847
<i>Some people around here</i>
<i>feel that</i> this<i> is the Ark.</i>

329
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,732
Because you have the cure?

330
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,935
How long do you think it will last
before the virus mutates again?

331
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,020
The virus is stabilized.

332
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,772
Who do you think you're talking to?

333
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,907
I had access to
the top government scientists.

334
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:31,276
I saw the virus mutate
five, six times a month.

335
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,412
That was August.

336
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,613
It's stabilized now.

337
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,415
- Says who?
- Says<i> our</i> scientist.

338
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,833
Dr. Scott?

339
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:39,618
Most people think she's a quack.

340
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,503
She is<i> not</i> a quack.

341
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,422
Well...

342
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,373
Sean's scientists say something different.

343
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,125
I'm not sure why I should believe yours.

344
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,845
Even if they're right...

345
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:53,181
What makes you think you won't
fall prey to the next strand?

346
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:56,435
Or the next polio or smallpox or swine flu?

347
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,386
Because they've tested our blood.

348
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:00,555
We have certain antibodies, proteins,

349
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,058
- coagulates that make us...
- What?

350
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,194
Invincible?

351
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:09,781
Best equipped
to carry the torch for humanity.

352
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:12,400
It's a responsibility,
and we don't take it lightly.

353
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,903
- Responsibility?
<i>- That's right... responsibility.</i>

354
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:16,621
This is going off the rails.

355
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,206
I don't know, sir.

356
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,742
And if I were to let you go,
send you back to the Ramseys,

357
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,577
what would your game plan be then?

358
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,247
You already heard...
I'm going to New Orleans.

359
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:27,466
I did hear that. What I don't know is why.

360
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,668
Okay, okay.

361
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,921
<i>After Katrina, the government swore
</i> we'd never let it happen again.

362
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,973
It has the largest
pumping station on the planet,

363
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,093
plus a 2-mile wall
that can seal off the channel,

364
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:40,595
plus huge stores of food, medicine,

365
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,932
an independent hydroelectric
grid, lots of boats.

366
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:46,935
It's best place
to start rebuilding the country.

367
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:52,824
And the people surviving there,

368
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:55,577
the ones who aren't immune...

369
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,696
What will the Ramseys do with them?

370
00:17:57,698 --> 00:18:00,282
- "Do with them"?
- I have to imagine it's pretty hard

371
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:02,417
to start a master race
of naturally immune demigods

372
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,421
with all those pesky non-immune
survivors hanging around.

373
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,823
We'll create our own societies.

374
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,326
Yours will die out on their own.

375
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:14,245
- That what he said?
- That's what will happen.

376
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:17,549
- So no killing?
- No... no killing,

377
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,418
despite what you think
you heard on that tape.

378
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,805
How do you know Sean won't go
to New Orleans without you?

379
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,307
- He wouldn't.
- How do you know?

380
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,343
You just met the guy three days ago.

381
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,261
Because we've been planning this
for months.

382
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:33,148
- He came to America for<i> me.</i>
- For months?

383
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,483
How? How'd you communicate?

384
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,068
You don't really think
I'm gonna tell you that?

385
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,520
I'm not against you, Mr. President.

386
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:40,522
I'm just trying to figure out
how all of this evolved.

387
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:43,775
American immunes need an American
to lead them. That's how.

388
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,111
- That's what he tells you, isn't it?
- That's right. It's true.

389
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:48,029
Well, then, maybe you can tell me

390
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,832
why our sonar operators
are picking up Ramsey's sub

391
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,618
heading West...
To New Orleans... as we speak.

392
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,688
- That's not... That's impossible.
- When Sean knows we're hiding behind this island.

393
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:03,928
Why is that impossible, Mr. President?

394
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,597
Great bluff.

395
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,549
<i>That's not what I said.</i>

396
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,184
<i>I think it was.</i>

397
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:13,104
Why is it impossible?

398
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,939
You think you can manipulate me.

399
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,358
I'm just trying to talk to you, sir.

400
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,778
I'm sure even prisoners on this ship

401
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,980
have a right to their own quarters.

402
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:24,399
You're not a prisoner.

403
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:26,451
Well...

404
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:28,736
Then I can go now?

405
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:42,138
That sub's got to be wounded from its dive
down into the Canyon during our assault.

406
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,641
That's why Michener said it's
impossible they were on the move.

407
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,227
They must be sitting
off the Coast of Jacksonville

408
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,812
trying to repair it,

409
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,765
which is why they haven't been
chasing us all this time.

410
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,334
So, what do we figure,
from a dive like that?

411
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:58,904
Could be hull damage,
sound matting, propellers.

412
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,522
Maybe it's beyond repair.

413
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:01,974
Maybe they'll be parked there for good.

414
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:03,442
Well, if they can't maneuver...

415
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,311
We don't know that,
and we can't count on it.

416
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:10,149
We push them, figure out
exactly what their damage is.

417
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:11,567
They'll be prepared now.

418
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:14,319
As likely to give me bullshit as the truth.

419
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,822
So we stay here behind the island

420
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,323
or we poke our beaks out?

421
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,627
Bring us out at quiet one...
South-Southeast,

422
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:24,329
at least 20 miles between us and the coast.

423
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:26,832
Aye-aye.

424
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,635
Helm, steady course 1-7-0.

425
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:33,005
All engines, head 2/3 and 12 knots.

426
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:36,508
I took a cruise by the mess decks.

427
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,343
Pretty hot topic of conversation

428
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,346
why the President
hasn't made an appearance.

429
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,350
I said he was being briefed.

430
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,987
That story won't hold after morning.

431
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:51,073
Agreed, sir.

432
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:54,026
I think I blew it.

433
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:56,161
Trapping him like that.

434
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,413
Got the intel.

435
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:01,617
Might've lost the man.

436
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,702
The Ramseys offered a narrative

437
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:06,038
that made his tragedy
something he could live with.

438
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,958
You've got to gain his trust, sir.

439
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,795
Then you'll need a new narrative
that's stronger than theirs.

440
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,562
I wasn't trying to manipulate you,

441
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:34,233
but I did need to know where that sub was.

442
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:37,319
Now I know it's damaged
and sitting on the coast.

443
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:41,406
Which means we have the advantage.

444
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,575
We'll be headed to New Orleans ourselves,

445
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:46,628
and we're gonna get there
ahead of your friends.

446
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,581
We'll lie in wait for them there,

447
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,134
and we<i> will</i> take them out.

448
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,341
[Inhales deeply]

449
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:02,094
You should know, sir...

450
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,648
...I've given everything for my country...

451
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:13,855
...to serve a mission I didn't ask for.

452
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:19,494
And I'd be sitting safely in a cabin in the
woods in Virginia with my family right now

453
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,748
if I hadn't stayed with this ship.
Instead...

454
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:27,169
...I lost my wife...

455
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:30,789
...to the virus.

456
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:35,344
Didn't even get a chance
to hold her hand...

457
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:38,297
Or say goodbye.

458
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,300
My children did.

459
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:43,685
They watched her die...

460
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:51,059
...wondering where<i> I</i> was.

461
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:55,230
I found them in an extermination camp...

462
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,318
In a stadium, like the one you were in.

463
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:06,708
Had I shown up an hour later,
they'd be dead.

464
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,129
An hour earlier, I might've
been able to save my wife.

465
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:14,216
Now they're holed up in a ghost town

466
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,301
with my father...

467
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:20,756
68 years old...

468
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,424
A heart condition.

469
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:24,843
If something happens to him

470
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:28,313
and I'm out here
in the middle of the ocean...

471
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:38,607
I understand why you'd be
looking for meaning...

472
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:44,363
...wanting all of this
to somehow be fate...

473
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:47,449
Or destiny...

474
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,534
For it all not to just be...

475
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:53,372
Terrible, tragic...

476
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,209
...and random.

477
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,047
[Sighs]

478
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,683
I do understand.

479
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:18,897
I held my son's hand.

480
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:27,489
Watched him slip away.

481
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:31,338
His breath so labored at the end...

482
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,842
The wheezing, his lungs...

483
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,499
He was in agony.

484
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:41,002
I thought there could be nothing worse.

485
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,363
And then...

486
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:46,448
My daughters...

487
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,084
My wife...

488
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:52,347
Knowing what was coming...

489
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,484
That was the most unbearable thing of all.

490
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:02,023
And he wouldn't even
have been there if I...

491
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,642
If what?

492
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,173
If what, sir?

493
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,454
[Knock on door]

494
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:16,788
[Door opens]

495
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,292
Very sorry to disturb you, sir, but
there's something you need to hear.

496
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:34,473
It's a looping message
on a Major FM frequency.

00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,913
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

699
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:38,585
[Zipper closes]

700
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,837
[Door opens]

701
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,927
[Sighs]

702
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,262
To children.

703
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:52,231
Mr. President?

704
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,150
I need you to know something.

705
00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:58,571
Everything you and I spoke about
in Dr. Scott's lab...

706
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:01,608
And I mean<i> everything...</i>

707
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,276
Stays between us.

708
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:06,829
What matters now is the future

709
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:09,499
and that you're here with us.

710
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:12,118
[Inhales deeply]

711
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,371
Let me show you to your new quarters.

712
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,020
Mr. President.

713
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:32,939
Mr. President.

714
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:34,273
Mr. President.

715
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:35,475
As you were.

716
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:37,644
Interior communications
and closed circuit phone

717
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:38,978
all set up, sir.

718
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,530
This room is now operationally capable.

719
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:41,814
Thank you, gentlemen.

720
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:43,066
Well done.

721
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:47,403
You can finish that up later.

722
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:49,155
Yes, sir.

723
00:40:07,342 --> 00:40:10,643
Looks like our toner cartridges
are fading a bit.

724
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:12,845
But it does the job, I think.

725
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,564
It does.

726
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:18,768
Brought a few of my shirts
and pants for you.

727
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,103
On the bed there.

728
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:24,774
Yeah, this one fits pretty well.

729
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:26,859
And the sleeves are long enough.

730
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:31,531
We'll have you come out and
officially meet the crew later today.

731
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:35,702
Just... Shake some hands, say hello.

732
00:40:35,704 --> 00:40:36,586
Of course.

733
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:39,005
That would, uh...

734
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:41,090
That would be good.

735
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:47,346
Anything else we can do for you, sir?

736
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:53,853
I'm grateful to you, Captain.

737
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:58,307
I think just about anyone else
would've given up on me.

738
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:40,826
