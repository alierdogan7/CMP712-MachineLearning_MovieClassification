00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,173
I would understand if you
killed me right now, but...

182
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,205
[Coughs]

183
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,541
If you would give me the chance,

184
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:35,647
sir, I feel much happier
here with you and your crew

185
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:39,107
than with this lunatic criminal.

186
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,106
I ask you now for political asylum.

187
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,106
I will give you anything
you need that could help you,

188
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,831
any information, I-I promise.

189
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,322
Chandler: You believe him?

190
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,934
What he's been saying squares with

191
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,567
what Burk and Green saw
aboard <i>Solace,</i>

192
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,848
and what I saw from the bridge wing,

193
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,129
but I just want more on that sub.

194
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,395
And we got our second
string A.S.W. Evaluator.

195
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,418
- Mason can handle it.
- Oh.

196
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:05,432
He knows the equipment. He
just doesn't have the hours.

197
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,558
Jenkins spent his entire career
training for that one job.

198
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,672
It was all he did all day long.

199
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:11,723
Mason: All stations,

200
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:13,788
sonar holds new passive contact, uh,

201
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,247
approximate bearing 2-3-5.

202
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,647
[Paper rustles]

203
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,312
Sir, I'm hearing something now.

204
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,663
It appears to be on the
edge of the convergence zone,

205
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:24,715
but every couple minutes
I hear the faintest... Hum.

206
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,086
What's the bearing?

207
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,442
I believe it's between

208
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,841
2-3-0 and 2-3-5 relative, sir.

209
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,532
Is it the sub?

210
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,541
I don't know, sir, but
it's running very quiet.

211
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:38,666
Well, anything that
quiet has gotta be a sub.

212
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,792
I agree, sir, but something this quiet...

213
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,348
It... it must be a type 2-1-4.

214
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,082
Juan Carlos said it was
an <i>Astute</i> class.

215
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,698
I suppose that that's possible, sir,

216
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,323
If it were fitted with
the new sound matting.

217
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,375
That would make it <i>Ajax</i>
or <i>Achilles,</i>sir.

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,614
<i>Ajax</i> was still being fitted.

219
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,309
Then it's <i>Achilles,</i>sir.

220
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,413
Where's it headed?

221
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,183
I'm sorry, sir, I can't
tell. It's just too far out.

222
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,224
Gator!

223
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,649
We don't have a heading yet, sir.

224
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:13,066
- Commander.
- Sean: What is it?

225
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,356
It's, uh, a ship traveling south.

226
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,578
Pitifully slow. 12
knots. It's not very big.

227
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,675
Could be a-a freighter or a small tanker.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,614
It's underpowered. You
could barely hear its engine.

229
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,034
- Are you having me on?
- No.

230
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,151
Ain't no freighters doing
business during an apocalypse.

231
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,589
That ship ain't going slow
'cause it's underpowered.

232
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,352
It's going slow so's to be quiet.

233
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,577
12 knots's standard speed for a destroyer

234
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,886
traveling at quiet level one.

235
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,175
That ain't no freighter.

236
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,745
That there's the destroyer, mate.

237
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,532
Calculate range and intercept.

238
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,823
Calculating range, aye.

239
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,446
Arm torpedoes.

240
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,246
Arming torpedoes, aye.

241
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57,338
[Sonar pinging steadily]

242
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,907
It's shallow where she is.

243
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:02,198
I think I'm getting some kick

244
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:03,658
from her prop off the sea bottom.

245
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,857
How shallow?

246
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,049
A guess, sir.

247
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,330
I-I'd say 400 feet or less.

248
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,022
Anybody else out there?

249
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,000
I mean, I've got some biologics,
maybe 8, 10 miles south.

250
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,959
Porpoises, maybe. Probably dolphins.

251
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:21,068
Gate, if you follow
the bearing 2-3-5 out,

252
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,496
where does it get that shallow?

253
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,744
Uh, North end of the Bahama Bank,

254
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:25,885
west of the islands, sir.

255
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,142
That fit with what you're getting?

256
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,142
Yes, sir. That would put
them roughly 50 miles out,

257
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,712
and based on, uh, how much
louder they're getting, sir,

258
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,460
I'd say they're heading... 0-7-5.

259
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,041
Ballpark C.P.A.?

260
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,041
Closest point of approach would be, um...

261
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:44,588
We're near collision course now, sir.

262
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,087
[Radio chatter]

263
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,321
We don't know if he's seen us yet.

264
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,387
[Beeps]

265
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,512
Bridge, captain.

266
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,168
<i>Try 20 degrees starboard.</i>

267
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,087
20 degrees starboard, aye.

268
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,579
See if he's paying attention.

269
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:08,387
[Whirring]

270
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,932
[Sonar pinging steadily]

271
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:47,072
They're turning, too, sir.
They're turning to intercept.

272
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,275
Ned: You see that?

273
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,781
They're turning 'cause they see us.

274
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,539
They're running. That's them. I know.

275
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:56,735
What are you waitin' for?!

276
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,626
Mind your P's and Q's, Ned.

277
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,892
Sir, if he's an <i>Astute</i>
class, he's carrying a Spearfish,

278
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,422
which means we're already in his range.

279
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:04,847
I am aware of that.

280
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,705
How long until we can hit him?

281
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:10,821
At the rate we're closing,
almost another half hour.

282
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,821
Are you expecting him to fire, sir?

283
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:15,622
Not if he wants the cure.

284
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,821
We don't want anything from him.

285
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:19,013
We could fire first once we're in range.

286
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:21,321
The instant we fire, we
give up our exact position.

287
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:24,622
I know, sir, but what's the alternative?

288
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,847
I'm working on it.

289
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,847
We'll be in their fire range
in less than 30 minutes.

290
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:35,247
Get your finger out! Come on!

291
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,308
Well, you heard him.

292
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,930
Let's blow their asses out the water.

293
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,322
We need to get closer so as
we can pick up Juan Carlos.

294
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,655
What? For all we know, Juan Carlos is dead.

295
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,773
The way he was shot up,

296
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,383
how's he supposed to
get off the ship anyway?

297
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:48,382
He'll find a way.

298
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,373
We don't even know if he's loyal!

299
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,023
He could be sellin' us out,

300
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,245
begging and groveling as we speak.

301
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,993
It's not a question of loyalty, Ned.

302
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:01,594
He's a believer, same as the rest of us.

303
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:05,960
Your sub is closing on
us. What do they want?

304
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,960
What do you mean? For the cure.
Are they gonna offer us a deal?

305
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,660
No, no. They thought the
cure was on <i>Solace.</i>

306
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,513
When... when we didn't find
it, the commander's brother,

307
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:18,511
he became certain that
the cure was just a rumor.

308
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:22,138
As far as they know, this is
just a floating warship, sir.

309
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,511
[Coughs] So then why
are they comin' for us?

310
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:27,737
[Breathes heavily] I don't know.

311
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:29,336
It must be for revenge,

312
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,047
for his men you killed on <i>Solace.</i>

313
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,972
Not to rescue you?

314
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,020
They don't care about me.

315
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:36,845
He cares enough to avenge his other men.

316
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,210
You got the better of him.

317
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:42,210
Now he needs to fix that.

318
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,611
[Coughing]

319
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:47,611
He's in range, hasn't fired
yet. What do you make of that?

320
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,878
He knows you have countermeasures.

321
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,451
He wants to make sure he's
close enough to hit you.

322
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,774
Uh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll
be within <i>our</i> range.

323
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,074
The insane fear nothing.

324
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,117
Sir, I have been cooperative. Have I not?

325
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,717
- I...
- [Handcuff clinks]

326
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,942
May I make one request, please?

327
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,963
I speak to you as one sailor to another.

328
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,618
I am a man of honor.

329
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,064
If they engage you, if
they want to sink you...

330
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,657
and they most certainly will... [Coughs]

331
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:22,263
I don't wanna drown like
this, handcuffed to a bed.

332
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,915
I swear to you,

333
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,486
I won't jeopardize the safety of your ship.

334
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:28,585
Take me outside.

335
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,330
Above decks, please.

336
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:34,592
I will tell you everything I know

337
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,505
about every single member of that crew.

338
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,063
[Coughs]

339
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,486
Slattery: If they wanted to negotiate,

340
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,305
they're well within
range to reach out to us.

341
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,305
Their bridge to bridge. Morse code, even.

342
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,696
They're gonna try to sink us.

343
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,305
We go to quiet two.

344
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:51,384
Turn southeast toward
the North Bahama Bank.

345
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,850
Even at dead slow,

346
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,976
we may lose them just long
enough to get behind the shoal.

347
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,387
If he chases us in the blind,

348
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,985
we send our helo, drop a few
torpedoes down their throats.

349
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,978
Yeah, if he knows we've
slowed, he might just fire.

350
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,087
At 4 knots, we'll have almost
no maneuverability to evade.

351
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,287
You got a better move?

352
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,626
Yeah, we fire first, take
our chances at a dogfight.

353
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,525
You'd bet on me.

354
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,666
Against a sub with Spearfish?

355
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,662
Bet on you so far.

356
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:27,314
[Radio chatter]

[Indistinct conversations]

358
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,217
Alert all hands.

359
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,090
We're going to quiet two.

360
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:42,186
[Indistinct conversations continue]

361
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,986
Yes, sir.

362
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,406
All stations T.A.O.
We're going to quiet two.

363
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:59,750
O.O.D. Helmsman, drop to 4 knots.

364
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:02,546
[Beeping]

365
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,947
All engines ahead one-third for 4 knots.

366
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:08,247
[Whirring slows]

367
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,947
Emcon Alpha set throughout the ship.

368
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:28,915
[Beeps]

369
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,321
Now hear this...

370
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,494
<i>This is the last 1mc
message for a while.</i>

371
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,708
<i>As of this moment,</i>

372
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,099
we're going to quiet two,

373
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,907
all personnel, quiet two.

374
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:42,607
[Clanks, whirring slows]

375
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:43,999
<i>You all know your jobs.</i>

376
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:46,506
<i>We've drilled this
drill a hundred times.</i>

377
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:50,566
<i>But a footstep could
give away our position.</i>

378
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,306
This one's for real. Lock it down.

379
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:56,406
<i>Ahead slow.</i>

380
00:17:56,431 --> 00:18:00,006
<i>Silence, fore and aft.</i>

381
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,806
Chung: No talking or moving, okay?

382
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,107
Don't talk, don't move
until further orders.

383
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,607
Tight as a drum, guys.

384
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:12,006
Nothing moves.

385
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,607
Not even you. Down.

386
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,607
- There you go. Just like Frankie taught you.
- [Whimpers]

387
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,911
[Whispers] Stay.

[Taps keys]

389
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,264
I told you. I told you!
Look, what did I say?

390
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:53,064
Now look at that. Nothing
there! Silent ship! Gone!

391
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,864
We should've taken the
shot! Now look at us!

392
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,023
We should bloody well fire
off a dozen their ways.

393
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:04,677
What? And hit 'em with dumb luck?

394
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,177
And if we miss, what then?

395
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,730
They killed seven of my men!

396
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:11,856
Your men?<i>Your</i> men?

397
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,081
How far to the Bahama
Bank, the North Shore?

398
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:22,909
- 40 miles out, sir.
- Make a course, 0-3-0.

399
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:24,500
Man: Right, 0-3-0.

400
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,409
If he's going behind the island,

401
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,634
- we'll meet him on the far side.
- Aye, sir.

402
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,639
Patience, brother. Patience.

403
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:35,094
His time will come.

404
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,538
[Mouths words]

00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:36,927
[Exhales softly]

406
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:45,026
- Sean: Is he back here, then?
- Man: Yes, sir. Hard at work.

407
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,791
So, what'd you find?

408
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:52,061
Well, the hospital ship was
the right place, as I thought.

409
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:56,250
But it's a real pity that
your men had to run away

410
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,075
before we got what we need.

411
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:02,676
You are very fortunate
that I am here, you know?

412
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,851
The Americans were preparing seriously

413
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:06,351
for a delivery of the cure.

414
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:07,551
We'll handle that.

415
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,950
Yeah? What do you mean?

416
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,763
[Coffeepot clatters]

417
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:16,024
- We're gonna sink that Yankee ship.
- [Chuckles]

418
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,648
How?

419
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:21,024
Without a ship, their plans just collapse.

420
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,492
What? No, I... that's...

421
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,923
You said so yourself.

422
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,391
Their captain is smart and dangerous,

423
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,091
so he won't surrender,
but he can't beat me,

424
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:32,192
not in the open sea.

425
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:34,591
His ship sinks.

426
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,891
Hey, fret not.

427
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,249
There'll be survivors.

428
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:43,591
Maybe even that precious doctor of yours.

429
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,591
If she's as important as you say,

430
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:49,591
they'll put her on the first lifeboat.

431
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:53,413
Uh, yeah, I suppose that's
true, but it's so risky.

432
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:55,814
Not with my man on that ship.

433
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:59,413
Special operator first class.

434
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:03,540
That ship goes down,
he'll find a way off it.

435
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:07,400
Make no mistake, we'll have what we need.

436
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,487
Sir, are we allowed to
talk? [Inhales deeply]

437
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:14,987
Yeah, sound dissipates in the air.

438
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:17,087

[Sniffs, exhales]

440
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:24,886

yes? Running more quiet?

[Sneezes, coughs]

442
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,686

- I know you smoke.

452
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,766

What more do you want to know?

455
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,865
What's our range?

456
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,639
[Sonar pinging steadily]

457
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,697
I put them...

458
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,467
Just inside 40 miles, sir.

459
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,524
Gator: Sir, they've turned North.

460
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,666
They're moving to the same
side of the bank as we are.

461
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,065
Must've figured we were trying
to put the shoal between us.

462
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,558
Sir, we won't get any of
the bank between us now

463
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,857
unless we increase our speed.

464
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:29,256
Sir, if we increase our
speed, they'll hear us.

465
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,745
Just a few more minutes.

466
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,456
And how did you all avoid being infected?

467
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,456
[Coughing]

468
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,756
I've told you so much information already.

469
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,157
Please, give me some water.

470
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:47,902
- [Breathing heavily]
- Come on.

471
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:53,130

[Gagging]

474
00:23:56,321 --> 00:24:00,195
What's going on with
you? What are you doing?

475
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,596
There must've been something inside him.

476
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,096
That's why he's bleeding.

477
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:05,902
- [Continues gagging]
- That's why he was holding his chest.

478
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:09,441
That's why he wanted up
on deck. Must be a beacon.

479
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,425
- What do you got in there, huh? A little homing device?
- [Groaning]

480
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,716
Is that what that is?!

481
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,974
There's nothing you can do about it now.

482
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,927
My people know exactly where you are.

483
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:19,230
Oh, they're <i>your</i>
people now? Is that right?

484
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:21,656
Yeah. My people.

485
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:25,930
We have already taken Europe, all of it.

486
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:28,930
The people like me.

487
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,535
[Gasps]

488
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,630
On my ship, they all... Like me.

489
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,556
[Gags] All... Like me.

490
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,130

491
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:42,731
<i>Sobreviveremos.</i> [Gasps]

[Gasping, speaking Spanish]

493
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,473
No! [Groans]

494
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,774
[Grunting]

495
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:09,666
- What's going on here?
- [Whooshing]

496
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:12,339
- [Groans]
- Rios: You're right.

497
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:13,998
There's something there.
It's causing damage.

498
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:15,910
We have to open him up.
You're the most qualified.

499
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,479
- What? Here?
- Can't take him below decks,

500
00:25:18,504 --> 00:25:20,363
not while he's thrashing around like that.

501
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,933
- Sedating him.
- Aah!

502
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,667
- Shh! Quiet!
- I'm not in the habit of operating on somebody

503
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,403
who's clearly resistant to help.

504
00:25:26,428 --> 00:25:28,428
I'm not even sure that it's legal!

505
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:30,720
Legal? According to who?

506
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:33,786
He could've been broadcasting
to an enemy sub this whole time.

507
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:36,603
Blood pressure's dropping.
Pulse is 125 and weak.

508
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:37,861
He's bleeding internally now.

509
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,552
Well, looks like he's gonna die anyway.

510
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,477
Why we wasting our time
trying to cut it out of him?

511
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,738
We should just throw him overboard.

512
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:44,362
That certainly would be the
most expedient thing to do.

513
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,902
All right, all right, I will do it.

514
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,529
- Where's the equipment?
- I'll get it.

515
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:52,828
Rachel: Let's move him. Need some help.

516
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:03,125
[Mouths words]

517
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,934
Rios: Do you see it?

518
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,086
Rachel: Not yet.

519
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:40,740
It's an incredibly large bleed.

520
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:43,186
We don't have time to blood type him.

521
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:46,590
We have a universal blood donor on board?

522
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,597
Somebody with O-Negative blood?

523
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,600
Hell, he can have my damn kidney

524
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,258
if it'll get that thing
out of there any quicker.

525
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,049
Give me a needle.

526
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,109

- Gotta be coming from the sub.
- Those missiles are headed

702
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,405
toward the same coordinates
I just pulled up.

703
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,334
- They're bombing the labs.
- Son of a bitch.

704
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,839
- T.A.O., calculate a target to intercept.
- Calculating, sir.

705
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:25,793
Fire SM-3s to intercept. Where
is that sub? Is it in range?

706
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:27,543
- It's too far, sir.
- Damn it.

707
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:30,154
Batteries release on
every target you got now!

708
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,238
Yes, sir. Batteries release on all tracks.

709
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:35,676
Birds away, track 2-5-7-1,
2-5-7-2, 2-5-7-3.

710
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,279
Slattery: Granderson, we
gotta get a message to the lab.

711
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:38,575
We gotta get those people out of there.

712
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,737
[Missiles whooshing]

713
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:49,372
Get out now.

714
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,558
The lab you are will be under
missile attack within minutes.

715
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,339
If you are hearing the sound of my voice

716
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:55,925
and are located in any of
the labs listed on the CDC...

717
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,889
If you are hearing me, get away
from the entire complex now!

718
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,680
All staff, I want all staff 2 miles

719
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:02,005
from your building immediately.

720
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,196
All missiles now out of range, sir.

721
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,887
How many we get?

722
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:08,095
I have confirmation on...

723
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:12,720
Two were in range, sir. We got them both.

724
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,395
Out of how many?

725
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,496
We logged 26.

726
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:22,496
Virtually all of them were
out of range before we fired.

727
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:34,553
I had him for a few
moments, but he slipped back.

728
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:37,446
I tried everything I could.

729
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,975
Why would they want to
destroy all the labs?

730
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,917
It doesn't make any sense.

731
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,276
[Takes off gloves]

732
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:48,668
Unless already have the vaccine.

733
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,288
Maybe that's how they "conquered" Europe.

734
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,617
Is that possible?

735
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:55,617
I don't see how anyone could
have the primordial besides me.

736
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,743
Europe was decimated.

737
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:00,450
It was one of the hottest
zones thanks to Niels.

738
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:03,453
But yes.

739
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,166
I suppose it's possible.

740
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,702
Slattery: He never asked for the cure.

741
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:10,768
I figured it was 'cause he knew

742
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,767
he was never getting off the ship.

743
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,567
Maybe he'd already gotten
it. Maybe they all had.

744
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:20,131
He kept saying,

745
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:23,267
"everyone on my ship is like me."

746
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:35,329
<i>The seals think it was a
Tomahawk missile or a bomb.</i>

747
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,720
<i>We didn't see it, but we heard it.</i>

748
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,221
<i>It was really, really loud, dad.</i>

749
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:40,036
<i>Grandpa said it was
just over the horizon.</i>

750
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:41,536
<i>Yeah. Who's doing this, daddy?</i>

751
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:44,235
There are people who want to stop us.

752
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,636
I know that's hard to believe,

753
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:50,235
but looks like I'm gonna be gone
a lot longer than we thought.

754
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,317
<i>Do you think that we
need to move away?</i>

755
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:55,976
<i>Kelly thought that maybe
it was a good idea.</i>

756
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:58,485
<i>Yes, hi.</i>

757
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,735
<i>Do you think we need
to move further inland?</i>

758
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,768
As far as we can tell, you're safe there.

759
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:05,661
These people wanted the labs. That's...

760
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:07,819
Looks like it's all they wanted.

761
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:08,843
<i>Why?</i>

762
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,335
We don't know.

763
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,756
<i>Tommy, we're okay.</i>

764
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,991
<i>Kelly: Come with me, kids.</i>

765
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:16,404
<i>Yeah.</i>

766
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,982
<i>If there's any more action close by,</i>

767
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,908
<i>I'll make the call to evacuate.</i>

768
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:24,833
<i>And we'll keep you informed.</i>

769
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:25,982
Thanks, dad.

770
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:30,009
<i>Tom... You gotta take
these people out.</i>

771
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,434
I know it.

772
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:35,282
<i>Well, then... Get back to it.</i>

773
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,353
<i>We got it covered here.</i>

774
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,744
Yes, sir.

775
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,102
[Knock on door]

776
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,397
- [Taps key]
- Come on in.

777
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:52,681
No response yet on the
roll call for the labs.

778
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,189
It's possible they lost their comms, but...

779
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:58,889
I know. I know why they bombed the labs.

780
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:01,519
And why they're trying
to destroy <i>Solace.</i>

781
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:04,228
It's not, in fact, because
they were vaccinated.

782
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:06,086
Quite the opposite.

783
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:10,300
I just tested Juan Carlos's blood.

784
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:14,087
It turns out that he's naturally immune.

785
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,261
None of the mercs on
<i>Solace</i> were C.B.R.

786
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,183
Is it possible they're all immune?

787
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,641
Everyone's like him?

788
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,565
I cross-referenced his
blood against Bertrise's.

789
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,213
Natural immunity,

790
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,344
as it turns out,

791
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,991
is a tad more common
than I initially thought.

792
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:39,057
Anywhere between 1% and 5%
of the global population.

793
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:43,857
That's how they took Europe.

794
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:49,647
Now their mission is to destroy
the cure wherever it exists,

795
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:52,252
on a nuclear-powered sub

796
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:56,670
that <i>never</i> runs out of fuel.

797
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,756
Yes, but we had the flash drive.

798
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,357
How the hell did they
know where those labs were?

799
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:07,256
You are all so fortunate
now that I'm here, yeah?

800
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,956
Don't you agree?

801
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,081
Admit it.

802
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,456
You listen to me,

803
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:17,756
and you have victories
too plentiful to count.

804
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,557
Yeah?

805
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,857
Now the <i>James.</i>

806
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:24,956
No, Bruv.

807
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:31,256
Now we take America.
