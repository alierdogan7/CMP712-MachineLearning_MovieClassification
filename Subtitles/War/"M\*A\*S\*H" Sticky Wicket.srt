00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,026
No, sir, it's Major Burns. He was due back
from "R" and "R" at 2400 hours.

3
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,428
I sent out the daily report
and said he was back.

4
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,432
You've been here all night?

5
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,560
- At 0400 hours, I had to go to the latrine.
- You took the scenic route.

6
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,764
- Yes, sir.
- Check his tent? He could have come in...

7
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,864
while you were sitting
with Batman and Robin.

8
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,842
- No, I checked.
- It's not like Burns.

9
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,675
He's a lousy surgeon,
a pain in the butt...

10

however, he's always on time.

11

- I know. That's why I'm worried.
- Relax. Cigar?

12
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,149
- Won't it stunt my growth?
- What do you got to lose?

13
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:39,156
Is it habit forming?

14
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:42,386
No. I've been smoking
five cigars a day for 45 years.

15
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,396

- Scrambled eggs. Would you like a glass?

27
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:27,539
- You got a straw?
- Just ran out.

28

- Where's Major Burns?
- Not back from leave yet.

36
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,525
It was very thoughtful of you two
to arrange for his "R" and "R."

37
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,600
It was that or go bonkers.

wept into his pillow?

His pillow, his pants, everything.

41

- I've never seen a man fall apart like that.
- Plucky chap, though.

42
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,739
He did stand up
at her wedding as best man.

43
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,281
Because we held him up.

44
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:14,683
You know, l-I've never
wanted to bring this up before...

45
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:19,087
but I have a suspicion
that Major Burns and Major Houlihan...

46
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,058
were somewhat attached.

47
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:28,465
They knew each other

00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:45,235
- Tell him we're desperate for a surgeon.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:48,609
- I'll be in O.R. If my legs get me that far.
- I think you're tired, Colonel.

166
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,944
You know, Radar, you should
have gone to medical school.

167
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,018
- Hello, Tokyo.
- Hello, Tokyo.

00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:10,864
- And the game.
- Damn cribbage!

173
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,769
Ah, Colonel, for a brief moment,
you thought you had me...

174
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,535
but I scooted away.

175
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,474
What's the damage, Winchester?

176
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,876
Well, in round figures...

177
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,282
you owe me $672.11.

178
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:29,286
- [Phone Ringing]
- Colonel, I want to thank you...

179
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,982
- for teaching me this game.
- Colonel?

<i>[Beeping Over P.A.]</i>

181
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:39,922
Colonel Baldwin here. Yes?

182
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,967
I told you not to call me
when I'm in conference.

183
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:46,868
Oh, yeah, that's Potter's outfit.
What do they want?

184
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:49,873
<i>How long do they need?</i>

185
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:52,739
- No, it's impossible.
- <i>[Winchester Chuckling]</i>

186
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,643
Colonel, made a small error.

187
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:59,843
You owe me $672.17.

188
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,351
It's possible.

00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,389
<i>[Beeping Over P.A.]</i>

190
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,425
Care to put your head
in the noose again?

191
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:11,690
I'd love to,
but you won't have time.

192
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,858
For the next 48 hours, you belong
to a MASH unit that's short a man.

193
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,029
MASH? That's one of those traveling
medicine shows, isn't it?

194
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,538
Right. Grab the next flight
to Seoul...

195
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,269
and get out to Colonel Potter
at the 4077 th.

196
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:28,039
Why send your best doctor
into a war zone?

197
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,740
Relax. It's just like two days here...

198

<i>except for the artillery</i>
<i>and the snakes.</i>

199
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:39,621
- Better get moving, Winchester.
- Surely you jest.

200
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,750
Surely you go.

201
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,760
We got a new surgeon on the way.

202
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:47,161
- A Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
- [Potter] I knew a Winchester.

203
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,791
- [B.J.] I knew an Emerson.
- [Radar] I got an Uncle Charles.

204
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:52,132
[Hawkeye] Well, at least we won't be
working with a stranger.

205
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,137
[Metal Clangs]

206
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:01,679
Corporal Klinger?
X rays on Brophy.

208
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,516
- You certainly move fast, Klinger.
- Basic delicatessen training.

209
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,181
Put your finger on that artery.
Scalpel.

210
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,684
- Major Houlihan!
- <i>[B.J.] Look who's here.</i>

211
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,694
<i>[Mulcahy]</i>
<i>What a pleasant surprise.</i>

212
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:21,232
- Uh-oh, Lulu's back in town.
- Keep working. Keep working.

213
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,858
I'll take over, Baker.
You look exhausted.

214
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,063
Mrs. Penobscott, it's a pleasure to have
your finger in my work again.

215
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,072
How come you're
back here so early?

216
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:31,301
Shouldn't you be wearing out
your Do Not Disturb sign?

217
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,870
- <i>Heard you were busy. More sponges!</i>
- Major, heard you were back.

218
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,074
Baker, get back in here
and help the colonel.

219
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:40,777
- Now I know you're back.
- Tell us about your honeymoon.

220
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,013
Just the dirty stuff.

221
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,715
Captains, please.
Mrs. Penobscott's feelings.

222
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,758
That's what
we want to hear about.

223
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:50,225
Private Picetti...
X ray hot off the press.

224
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,390
Gloryosky, Sandy.
Do I behold the ravishing Mrs. Penobscott?

225
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,467
Yes, Klinger,
I'm back. So get moving.

226
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,559
Yes, Major Houlihan.

227
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,230
Never heard of anybody
coming home early from a honeymoon.

228
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,366
They had to throw a bucket of water
on me and the missus.

229
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,172
Did you have a good time?
Clamp.

230
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,747
Clamp.
We need more suction.

231
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:12,408
If you don't wanna tell us about
your honeymoon, I understand.

232
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:15,486
- I appreciate that.
- But I hope you took pictures.

233
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,623
You know, Private,
if you are very careful...

234
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,717
you can hit every pothole
along the way.

235
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:25,228
Sorry, sir,
but I've only got two hands.

236
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,390
Yes, I noticed that.
I'm a doctor.

237
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,965
How much more of this
must my kidneys endure?

238
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:36,563
About 20 miles, sir.

239
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,643
Wonderful.

240
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:45,476
- What's happening?
- The enemy, sir. Mortars.

241
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,610
The enemy? Here?
Good God!

242
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,419
Turn right! Right!
Left! Left!

243
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,083
- Follow me, sir.
- Where?

244
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,423
- Take cover.
- When do they stop?

245
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,520
- When they hit something.
- Very comforting.

246
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,656
Hit the dirt!

<i>[Explosions In Distance]</i>

00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,094
Good Lord, what do we do now?

249
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:11,232
Sit tight, hold your breath
and pray if you got 'em.

250
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:15,803
- What about the jeep?
- Don't worry about it, sir. It's paid for.

251
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,808
Better stay put, Major.

252
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,426
Now we can go.

253
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,932
- How?
- A.T.

254
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:38,559
A.T.?

255
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,366
Alternate transportation.

00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:44,874
You're on your own now, sir.
I'm going back to headquarters.

257
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,910
Good luck to you.

258
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,484
Extra, "extrey," read all about it.

U.S. Enters war in Korea.

- Get your latest news right here.
- Excuse me.

261
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,452
It's a little shack
in the compound marked "latrine."

262
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:05,462
- Immediate seating in the mezzanine.
- It isn't that.

263
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:07,498
- I want to ask you something.
- Go.

264
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:10,033
Are you a guy, or a hairy broad
with a deep voice?

265
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,797
I'm all man, Clyde.
The clothes are a dodge.

266
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,997
- A what?
- If I keep wearing women's clothes...

267
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,598
maybe they'll give me
a Section Eight and send me home.

268
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,701
- Oh. How long you been at this?
- Two years, April 22.

269
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:23,280
- Oh, it's not just a dodge.
- What do you mean?

270
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,748
If you've been dressing like this
for two years, you are a Section Eight.

271
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,218
- That's what I keep telling 'em.
- Let me tell 'em.

272
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:33,018
I'm a lawyer. Captain Schaeffer.
Adjutant General Branch.

273
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,753
I'm telling you.
I can get you a discharge.

- Oh, Captain, my Captain.

00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,204
Set me free and for the rest of your life,
I'll bring you belly dancers...

their navels
stuffed with chopped liver.

278
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,307
120 over 80, Sergeant.
You're perfect.

279
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,706
Hey, listen, Doc.

280
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:54,972
I'm sure there's something
inside that you missed, huh?

281
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,241
It hurts... right about here.

282
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,476
Comes with the territory.
That's our canned corned beef.

283
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,280
But, Doc,
I don't wanna go back.

284
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:06,551
I can't say as I blame you.
Would you like to talk to Father Mulcahy?

Okay, but I'm an atheist.

286
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,695
- Really?
- Swear to God.

287
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:17,858
Uh, let's check
Private Leland's chart.

288
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,669
How you feeling, Dr. Berman?

289
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,107
Critical.

290
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:29,647
I know you've got a chest tube in,
and the lung's re-expanded.

291
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:34,117
I repaired the laceration of the ventricle,
so there's a weak area in the myocardium.

292
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,653
In other words,
a ventricular aneurysm.

293
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:38,689
- Yeah, it looks that way.
- <i>So...</i>

294
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,657
it's "Good night, Nurse."

295
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,228
You just rest and stabilize.

296
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,264
And, if necessary,
we'll tackle the aneurysm.

297
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,692
You doctors are all alike.

- Yeah.

00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,579
- Gonna try it?
- None of us have ever seen that operation.

301
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:09,017
- What are you gonna do?
- I think I'll hide in the woods till the war is over.

- [Phone Ringing]
- I got it! You got it!

I know I've got it.
Potter here.

304
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:17,691
Yeah, Sergeant.
Oh, not Burns again.

305
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:21,562
He was on this bus,
and he sat down next to a Red Cross lady.

306
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,998
Tried to bite off her buttons.

307
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,071
He kept hollering, "Margaret! Mar..."
Is that his wife?

308
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,233
No, just a well-built ship that crossed
his wake. Have you got him locked up?

309
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,779
Well, not exactly, sir.
You see, the lady screamed...

310
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,475
and the bus stopped,
and he jumped out the window.

311
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,542
Look, Sergeant, do me a favor.
When you finally lasso him...

312
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,851
put him in a padded stall.

313
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:09,476
<i>For your trouble</i>...
<i>Put this toward some shock absorbers.</i>

314

- You staring at me, Corporal?
- Oh, no, sir.

315
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,925
No, I'm sorry, sir. It's just we don't get
too many strangers around here standing up.

316
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,368
Charming place.

317
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,338
An inflamed boil
on the buttocks of the world.

318
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,809
What is that odor?

319
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,903
Uh, north wind, cesspool.
East wind, latrine.

320
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:46,450
- The wind is from the south.
- Oh, that's the kitchen.

321
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,312
Sir, are you the doctor
we've been waiting for?

322
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:54,654
That's quite likely.

- Of course.

325
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,234
Where will I find
your commanding officer?

326
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,001
Uh, in his
commanding office.

327
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,008
Uh, this way.

328
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,906
- Ooh, I'm sorry, sir. Do you mind?
- [Clattering]

329
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,952
Not at all.

330
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,622
- Skoal.
- Anita Ekberg.

331
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,592
- Ingrid Bergman.
- Sonja "Heinie."

332
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:34,159
- Sir, this is Major Charles Emerson, uh...
- Winchester.

333
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,597
- Winchester.
- Radar, don't talk with your hands full.

334
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,862
- Welcome to MASH 4077, Doctor.
- Yup.

335
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,870
Drs. Pierce, Hunnicutt.

336
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,337
- Hawkeye.
- Doctor.

337
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,771
- B.J.
- Doctor.

338
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,639
Major, you have no idea
how glad we are to see you.

339
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:50,272
This is our first break in 36 hours.
Have a snort.

340
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,476
- Thank you. No.
- Got your papers, Winchester?

341
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:57,988
- Gee, what swell gloves.
- Calf.

342
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,182
Oh.

343
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,816
- Where you from, Charlie?
- Charles.

344
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:06,920
- Oh.
- We're pretty informal up here. We get very close.

345
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:09,694
I don't intend to be here
long enough to get chummy.

346
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,826
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- I'll join you.

347
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:13,836
Impressive, Doctor.

348
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:18,204
Harvard Med. Massachusetts General.
What were you doing in Tokyo?

349
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,209
Demonstrating
new surgical techniques.

350
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,542
- Up here, it's strictly meatball surgery.
- Patch 'em up and get 'em out.

351
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:26,014
[Snorts]
That's rather primitive, isn't it?

352
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:29,553
We've got a 98%
survival rate, cowboy.

353
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,886
- Charles.
- No offense intended, Colonel.

354
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,119
Offense accepted, Major.
And you can...

355
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,218
Look. We're all a little tired.

356
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,729
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot.

357
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,732
Colonel, I'm going
to eat now, sir.

358
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,302
- What are they having, Radar?
- Breaded Spam cutlets.

359
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,895
- Every meal an adventure.
- Do the officers eat similar rations?

360
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,532
Yep. We're all just
one big, unhappy family.

361
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:53,543
- Don't we have a choice?
- Two.

362
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,170
Rosie's bar across the road
or starvation.

363
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,181
Duncan Hines
recommends the latter.

364
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,945
Colonel, Dr. Berman is going into heart failure.
He can hardly breathe.

365
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,179
- Let's go.
- [B.J.] Ventricular aneurysm.

366
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,620
- Why the panic?
- Can you do anything about it?

367
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,657
- I've done at least a dozen.
- Successfully?

368
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,659
No offense intended, Major.

369
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,857
- Offense accepted.
- Let's hang out your shingle, Major.

370
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,936
<i>[Winchester]</i>
<i>More light on the heart.</i>

371
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,308
[Winchester]
That light flickers.

372
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,310
[Hawkeye]
You gotta synchronize your blinks.

373
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,937
- [Potter] It's our number two generator.
- Switch to number one.

374
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,948
Number one was stolen
by some locals.

375
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,950
It's now a taxicab in Pukch'ang.

376
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,749
- More suction.
- [Margaret] Suction.

377
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,017
Thank you.

378
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,218
There's your aneurysm.

379
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:46,229
Now, the main difficulty
here, gentlemen...

380
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:50,233
is that the aneurysm
may have a clot in it.

381
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,803
<i>If you don't do this</i>
<i>very carefully...</i>

382
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:55,099
it could break off
and go to the brain.

383
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,436
Then it's "Good-bye, Charlie."

384
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,136
- Sorry. Charles.
- So that's how you do this.

385
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,577
- You oversew the aneurysm.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,580
Good work, Remington.

387
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:07,617
- Winchester.
- Oh, uh...

388
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,279
- Still with us, Hunnicutt.
- 100 over 70.

389
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:13,448
- Beautiful, Doctor.
- [Winchester] Voila.

390
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,527
- Ready to close.
- [Potter] Fine work, Doctor.

391
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,563
[Winchester] Considering the circumstances,
I would say extraordinary.

392
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:23,057
[Hawkeye] Major Winchester, sir,
may I ask a question?

393
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:27,434
- You may.
- Could I stop by sometime for a cup of ego?

394
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,066
Wasn't that wonderful?
Such marvelous technique.

395
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:34,634
The whole family has gifted hands.
Mother's a concert pianist.

396
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:37,476
My dad can get an olive
out of the bottom of a jar with one finger.

397
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:39,709
- And leave the pimento behind.
- Oh, yeah.

398
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,548
Frontline humor, I suppose.
Crude and boorish.

399
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,351
You gotta admit though,
these jokers'll make you laugh.

400
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:48,584
Colonel, sir, I got Major Burns
on the telephone.

401
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,253
- He's calling from Seoul.
- About time.

402
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,990
You coming, Margaret?
It's an obscene phone call.

403
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:57,067
- Crude and boorish.
- Crude and Boorish. A great act.

404
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,160
- He plucked chickens.
- And she jumped through an awning.

405
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:04,241
Yeah, I understand, Sergeant.
Thank you. Put him on.

406
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:08,301
Burns? Not so fast.

407
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,973
Yeah? Yeah.

408
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,982
Uh-huh. You are?

409
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,984
- What's up?
- I should have listened on my own phone.

410
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,986
Opportunity missed
is an opportunity lost.

411
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,181
- Ralph Waldo Emerson.
- Writer of note.

412
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,054
- Writers of notes get famous?
- Please, I'm on long distance!

413
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,685
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay, Burns.

414
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,629
I'll take care of it.
Right, Major.

415
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:31,793
Right. The same to you.
[Chuckling]

416
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:34,428
- What's the latest on Burns?
- This one's a doozy.

417
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,770
He saw an officer and a blonde
walking down the main drag.

418
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,775
- And in his state...
- Bombed?

419
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,278
Boiled. Mistook them for
Penobscott and Houlihan.

420
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,817
Well, this couple went into a public bath,
stripped down, got in the water.

421
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,045
A man and a lady
in the same water?

422
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:51,621
- Baptists.
- Oh.

423
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,884
Frank jumps in with them,
still in uniform.

424
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,892
Wow!

425
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,292
Grabbed the woman
and started crying.

426
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,854
Suddenly, he realizes
he's in the water with the wrong couple.

427
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,198
Mrs. Kester
hollered bloody murder.

428
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:09,762
Wait a minute.
You mean Brigadier General and Mrs. Kester?

429
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:11,774
In the buff.

430
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:16,341
They're holding Burns
for psychiatric observation.

431
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:18,472
Perfect!

432
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:24,049
And then...
hang onto your skivvies...

433
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:26,146
he's being transferred
out of here.

434
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,282
- Transferred?
- Out of here?

435
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:31,260
You... Frank is being transferred?
You mean for good?

436
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,455
- That's right.
- Holy cow.

437
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:36,624
They can't do that to us. There's so much more
we wanted to say to the fink.

438
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:38,099
And all of it rotten.

439
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:41,137
You realize this reduces
the enemy to just North Korea.

440
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:43,639
This calls for a toast.
You too, Radar.

441
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:45,641
- Special occasion.
- Thank you, sir.

442
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,938
A toast.
What shall it be?

443
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:50,139
- Something tender.
- Something sentimental.

444
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,773
Right.

445
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:55,079
Good-bye, ferret face.

446
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:03,189
[All Laughing, Whooping]

447
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,899
- Let's put it over here.
- Okay.

448
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:14,699
- What does he got in here?
- I don't know.

449
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,070
[Sighs]
Ain't this the final kick in the butt?

450
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,302
We pack so Major Bonkers
can get outta here.

451
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,346
Not an easy task.
Each object holds such unpleasant memories.

452
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:26,178
The laundry.
One pair of shorts, perfect condition.

453
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,184
Mine.

454
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:32,746
- One pair of shorts, holes, buttons missing.
- Frank's.

455
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:35,382
One pair of socks,
perfect condition... mine.

456
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,393
You're pretty quick
with the socks, fella.

457
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,020
- One pair of socks, holes... Frank's.
- Frank's.

458
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,725
- This is gonna be easier than I thought.
- Matter of having a system.

459
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,734
- [Knocking]
- <i>Entre</i>z- <i>vous.</i>

460
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,667
Colonel Potter said
you were packing Frank's things.

461
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:48,671
There's something of mine
I'd like back.

462
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:50,673
I don't think
that's possible.

463
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:53,801
- Margaret, please. We packed so carefully.
- I'll bet.

464
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:56,971
- May one ask what it is you're looking for?
- It's personal.

465
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,743
- The torn shorts are right on top.
- I'll slap you.

466
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,945
- Bully.
- Ah, here it is.

467
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:04,954
- [Gasps]
- This is none of your business.

468
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,956
- What is it?
- A picture of Margaret in a bikini.

469
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,082
- Let me see.
- No.

470
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,318
- Give you a nickel.
- No.

471
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:11,418
- Show you where the horse bit me.
- Not interested.

472
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,293
- Oh, come on. How does she look?
- Beautiful. A goddess.

473
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,993
- Really?
- Oh! Yum! Yum! Yum!

474
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,661
- You're spitting on it.
- I'm gonna faint.

475
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,671
Margaret, put it back.
It'll keep him crazy.

476
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,673
Why torture him?
Frank wasn't all that bad.

477
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,776
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.

478
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,801
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.

479
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:31,244
In some ways,
Donald is no Frank Burns.

480
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,283
- Uh, Margaret...
- Margaret, wait a second.

481
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,682
- Would you care to elaborate on that?
- No, I wouldn't.

482
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,950
Margaret. Look, if you've got something
you want to get off your chest...

483
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,183
- I promise you it won't go beyond this tent.
- Oh!

484
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,658
No, thank you.
I'd sooner tell Walter Winchell.

485
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:47,128
- Might make you feel better.
- Why should I trust you two?

486
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,131
Because we're all you've got.

487
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,360
Because we care.

488
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:53,835
- Come on, Margaret. Have a drink.
- Come on. Sit down.

489
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,907
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.
But sit down. You look upset.

490
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:00,000
- Have a drink.
- What'll it be, gin or gin?

491
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,674
- How's that?
- [Gasps]

492
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:09,514
- [Chuckles]
- Terrible. Thank you.

493
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,555
- Something went wrong, didn't it, Margaret?
- Your word of honor?

494
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:14,591
- Sure.
- What about him?

495
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:17,627
- Him too.
- Well...

496
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,787
the first two days were perfect.

497
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:23,162
Then after that, it was like being
on a honeymoon with my old auntie.

498
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,098
What happened between
the second and third day?

499
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:28,639
Nothing. We were having
a wonderful time... tennis, shopping.

500
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:31,207
A lovely party that evening
at General Weiskopf's.

501
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:33,971
- Lyle was a charming host.
- Lyle?

502
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:36,137
General Weiskopf.
He's an old friend.

503
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,977
We stayed up and talked
and laughed until 3:00 in the morning.

504
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,983
Was the groom in the room?

505
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,985
Sure. He was
right there listening.

506
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,351
What happened after the party?

507
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:50,086
- Nothing.
- As in "nothing"?

508
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:54,562
He stopped talking.
He stopped smiling.

509
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:58,726
He stopped... everything.

510
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:01,270
As in "everything"?

511
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,101
Well, Margaret,
don't you think that's it?

512
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,238
- What?
- <i>That's probably it.</i>

513
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:13,647
Donald was competing
with your whole past.

514
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,446
Some guys can't take
that pressure.

515
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,612
The male libido can be
a very fragile thing.

516
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,284
Oh, poor Donald.

517
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:24,327
Oh, he'll get over it.
It happens all the time.

518
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:26,919
Frank never had that problem.

519
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:30,194
- Frank didn't need it. He had every other one.
- Oh, I know. I know.

520
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:34,328
Frank Burns was a little too
"by the book" for you guys, but...

521
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:39,466
I personally have some very
fond memories of our friendship.

522
00:28:39,577 --> 00:28:42,410
That dirty rat!

523
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:46,779
My alarm clock.
He said the bellboy took it. That fink!

524
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:49,079
<i>[B.J.] Margaret, remember</i>
<i>the fond memories.</i>

525
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,316
Oh, I'll give him a fond memory.

526
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,551
Bottoms up, Frank.

527
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,595
Schaeffer, this is
none of your business.

528
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,597
Colonel, please,
you're shouting at my lawyer.

529
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,894
You are holding
a legitimate Section Eight here.

530
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,731
- Lay it on him, mouthpiece.
- A guy hanging onto a dodge this long...

531
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:08,862
is a legit psychotic, believe me.

532
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:10,873
Look, Captain, it doesn't matter.

533
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,569
Teddy Roosevelt
had a transvestite in his outfit.

534
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:16,340
Rode sidesaddle
up San Juan Hill.

535
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:19,382
- Is that true, Captain?
- Could be.

536
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:21,678
- They all wore such big hats.
- We're sunk.

537
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:25,517
Oh, no, we're not. I'm preparing
my client's brief for General Phelps.

538
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:27,523
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- And, you, as my client...

539
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,991
do not talk to this man
unless I am present.

540
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,654
- Sir, phone call from Tokyo General.
- Got it.

541
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,788
Come on, Klinger.
You and your lawyer, take a hike.

542
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,595
Colonel, I am going to convene
a formal hearing on this.

543
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:41,695
Good. Klinger, I suggest you wear
your black sheath with pearls.

544
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:45,298
Basic black before 5:00? Really.

545
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,639
Potter here.

546
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,578
Yes, of course
I still need a new surgeon.

547
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:53,411
Who? MacKenzie?

548
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:57,578
Look, Baldwin. I've seen that clown's 201 file.
He's a boozer.

549
00:29:57,688 --> 00:30:00,782
Chief engineer
on the Red-nose Express.

550
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,553
Martinelli?
I've seen his surgery.

551
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:07,757
Let me give you a tip. Sew his fingers
together and make him a psychiatrist.

552
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:10,163
What about Winchester?

553
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,235
Yeah, I know he's temporary.

554
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:15,169
Make him permanent
and it's a deal.

555
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,172
Good.

556
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,902
Oh, really?
I'll remember that.

557
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:22,878
- Radar, are you there?
- I was, sir, but now I'm in here, sir.

558
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,744
- Where's Winchester?
- He's getting ready to leave.

559
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,875
- I wanna talk to him pronto.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,545
- And bring me back a Snickers bar.
- With nuts?

561
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:32,555
- No.
- Milky Way.

562
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:34,557
Damn partial.

563
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,559
Here we are,
for your refreshment pleasure...

564
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:40,859
before we present the ravishing
Boom Boom Goldfarb and a trained owl...

565
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,526
synthetic ice cream,
synthetic sherbet, synthetic spumoni.

566
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:49,095
Each and every cup contains
a $5,000 pair of Swiss binoculars.

567
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:52,141
Hey. This offer
limited time only.

568
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:54,143
Time's up.

569
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,611
Watch it, Mac.
Who wants melting ice cream?

570
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,614
But, Father,
I don't want to go back anymore.

571
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:02,413
- Son, we all feel fear. It's quite natural.
- But, Father...

572
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,421
Without fear, one would stand in traffic
and get run over.

573
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,390
It's nature's way
of protecting your life.

574
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,586
Father, it's not my life
that I'm concerned about.

575
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,965
Excuse me?

576
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,934
I killed three people.

577
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:20,936
I saw their eyes.

578
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:25,674
Father, I just don't
wanna kill anymore.

579
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:36,112
- Pierce?
- Chuck?

580
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,953
- Well, you're leaving. What's in a name?
- How're you feeling?

581
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:43,856
Dr. Berman, this is Dr. Winchester.
He saved your life.

582
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:47,954
Thank you.
I thought I was a goner.

583
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:50,033
Yes, I can understand that.

584
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,103
[Chuckles]
I think I've just been insulted.

585
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:56,196
Very observant.
Blood pressure?

586
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,537
140 over 80.

587
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:01,110
I can't believe it.

588
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:04,807
Dr. Pierce tells me
that your technique was extraordinary.

589
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,509
To him, perhaps.

590
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:10,610
Well, I'm on my way.
Good luck, Dr. Berman.

591
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,485
- You're not on staff here?
- Oh-ho, no.

592
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:17,049
This was just a stopover
in a stagnant backwater of the war.

593
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:19,857
- Gentlemen.
- Ta.

594
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,165
- I don't think he likes it here.
- I wonder why.

595
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,170
This time of year, we offer
so much more than Monte Carlo...

596
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:32,333
ringworm, shingles, dysentery...
and at decent prices.

Is this the best you've got?

601
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,187
I got some private stock,
but it'll cost you a nickel more.

602
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:52,785
Oh, let's splurge.

603
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,957
Wow. We don't get
too many guys like you in here.

604
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:58,330
Yes, I'm painfully aware of that.

605
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,335
Make it two...
one for me, one for yourself.

606
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:04,032
What? I wouldn't drink that.
I have a stomach and a family to think of.

607
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,843
Oh, I found... I found him.
Major Winchester.

608
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,505
Uh, don't go away, sir.
The colonel wants to see you.

609
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,514
Colonel, I found
Major Winchester.

610
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,982
Well, I hope he's succinct.
My jeep will be here momentarily.

611
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:17,019
- I do hate long good-byes.
- I found him.

612
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,555
- Oh, Winchester.
- Can we hurry this up?

613
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,057
I checked the O.R., the Mess Tent,
the latrine, everywhere.

614
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,593
And then I come in here,
the Officers Club, and here he was.

615
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:26,595
He was here. His gear was here.
And then I was...

616
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:29,860
- Radar. Radar. Type that up in triplicate.
- Yes, sir. I found him.

617
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,703
Well, it's very kind
of you to see me off.

618
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,774
I would ask you to join me in a farewell drink,
but there just isn't time.

619
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,775
Oh, we'll have plenty of time.

620
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,777
- Oh?
- I've got some good news, Major.

621
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:45,144
You're assigned to us permanently.

622
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:48,685
- Impossible.
- Orders are cut. It's final.

623
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:50,981
No!

624
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,556
No. Colonel Baldwin assured me
this is just temporary.

625
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,592
Is this the same Colonel Baldwin
who owes you $600?

626
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:59,060
- [Laughs] Yes.
- Need I say more?

627
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,597
You mean to tell me
that I have to stay here...

628
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:04,327
just because somebody
owes me $672.17?

629
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:06,335
- That's ridiculous.
- Of course it's ridiculous.

630
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:09,600
- You're staying because I need you.
- And if I refuse?

631
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:12,403
You'll be making gravel at Leavenworth.

- Good.

- <i>Comprendo.</i>
- Good.

00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:20,909
Well, Major Winchester,
I can't tell you...

649
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:17,462
- Road apples, Private.
- Uh, Captain, Colonel.

650
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:21,032
- Private, Corporal.
- Private?

651
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:24,603
Well, tsk, caught again.

652
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:26,615
Hold it. Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I thought...

653
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:28,617
Button it. Button it.

654
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,210
- Let him talk.
- You're my lawyer.

655
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,847
Your lawyer is a buck private,
and he's no lawyer.

656
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,983
I beg your...
How's that?

657
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,857
According to his captain,
a real captain...

658
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:42,421
Schaeffer here has been bucking
for a Section Eight longer than you have.

659
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:45,127
- A loony?
- Busted twice...

660
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:49,171
done four months in the slammer,
has impersonated a doctor...

661
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,298
<i>a bombardier,</i>
<i>a tank commander...</i>

662
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:54,275
- even a chaplain.
- A chaplain.

663
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:56,710
At this very moment
somewhere in America...

664
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:59,612
25 couples are living in sin.

665
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:02,481
You shyster! Why'd you lie to me,
get my hopes up?

666
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:04,611
I thought you'd understand.
You're my own kind.

667
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:06,622
- [Whistles]
- They gonna send me home?

668
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:08,624
- I doubt it.
- I feel like crying.

669
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:12,184
Let it all out, stud.
He's all yours, boys.

670
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,925
Well, hang in there, Klinger.

671
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:21,063
I was an M.P. Once too.

672
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:24,663
Don't feel bad, son. Guy's a real pro.
You'll make it someday.

673
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:27,801
- You think so, sir?
- Absolutely. Never say die.

674
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:30,311
You're a real inspiration, sir.

675
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:35,117
Sir? Sir, Major Burns
is on the phone.

676
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:37,585
- He says he wants to talk to you and B.J.
- I'm busy.

677
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,815
He says it's the last time
he'll ever talk to you.

678
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:42,289
I can't pass that up.
Take care, Doc.

679
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:45,829
B.J. Hey, thanks, Hawkeye.

680
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:49,729
Don't go around condemning yourself.
Always get two doctors' opinions.

681
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,735
What's that you said, Charles?

682
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,601
How we doing?
Oh, we're doing fine. Thank you.

683
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:58,607
How you doing?

684
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,870
Oh, really?
Well, you'll get used to it.

685
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,542
- He'll talk your ear off.
- Seems a bit cold.

686
00:37:05,649 --> 00:37:09,050
He's got great hands.
Can hit to right field, but no heart.

687
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:11,644
- You'll soften him up.
- I doubt it.

688
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,418
He takes two arrogant pills
after every meal. Let's go.

689
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,960
Yes, Frank, yes.

690
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,963
We packed everything.

691
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:22,965
He wants to know
if we folded his underwear.

692
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,967
And we ironed your pleats.

693
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:27,299
What? He wants to talk to you.

694
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:30,305
Yes, Frank.

695
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:34,242
You what?

696
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,442
Uh, Frank, we both
think that's wonderful.

697
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:44,953
Yeah. Frank, we're proud
to have known you.

698
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:50,558
Yeah. Best of luck
in your future, Frank.

699
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:52,561
Bye, Frank.

700
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:00,159
Hey, come on!
I'm responsible for that!

701
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,068
You seem a trifle irked.

702
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,073
The army,
in its infinite wisdom...

703
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:07,234
has not only cleared
Frank of the charges...

704
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:11,246
they have assigned him
to a veterans hospital in Indiana...

705
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:14,044
and promoted him
to lieutenant colonel.

706
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,888
- Oh, no, no, no no!
- I was just gonna complain to my congressman.

707
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:23,016
Yeah? No, no!

708
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,097
Hello? Hello?

709
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:27,927
Hello? Hello?

710
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:30,465
Ah! O'Reilly,
just the man I want to see.

711
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,593
- Me?
- Is there anyone else in this room?

712
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:35,899
- No.
- Then it must be you.

713
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:38,600
- Get me Tokyo General Hospital.
- On the phone?

714
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,700
No, open the window and yell.

715
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:44,872
Take that bag of phone and do whatever
voodoo you do and get me Colonel Baldwin.

716
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:47,610
That won't do you any good, sir.
You're staying.

717
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:50,846
You pusillanimous little squirt.
Don't you dare to tell me I'm staying!

718
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,151
- You get on that phone!
- But I can't, it's...

719
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:56,783
- No buts. You start cranking.
- Yes, sir.

720
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:58,794
I'm cranking.
I am. I'm cranking.

721
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,456
But it's broken. Somebody madder
than you got to it first.

722
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:06,832
Corporal, I assure you.
Nobody in Korea is madder than me.

723
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,633
I'll take your word for it, sir.

724
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,231
- Corporal, fix the phone!
- Fix it. Okay.

725
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:15,038
- I don't care how. What I care is when.
- No, I'll fix it.

726
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,045
- And the when is now.
- Yes, okay. Right.

727
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,672
Because if you don't,
I am going to...

728
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:22,752
Winchester, you're not
going anywhere.

729
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,089
Colonel, l...
[Clears Throat]

730
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:31,355
I think I should tell you
that my father knows Harry Truman.

731
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:34,487
He doesn't like him,
but he knows him.

732
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:37,032
Fine. You have Dad call Harry...

733
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:40,695
then Harry'll call me,
and maybe we'll work something out.

734
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:44,205
In the meantime, vamoose.

735
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,109
All right, Colonel,
I am... vamoosing.

736
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:51,340
[Mutters]

737
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:55,349
But know this.

738
00:39:55,452 --> 00:39:57,977
You can cut me off
from the civilized world.

739
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:01,546
You can incarcerate me
with two moronic cell mates.

740
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:04,559
You can torture me
with your thrice-daily swill.

741
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:08,427
But you cannot break
the spirit of a Winchester.

742
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,762
My voice shall be heard
from this wilderness...

743
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,600
and I shall be delivered
from this fetid and festering sewer.

744
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:22,471
I think he's getting
the hang of this place.

745
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:30,418
Ah!

746
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:33,389
Over there.

747
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:38,260
Oh. Hello.

748
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:40,660
- Oh. Hello.
- How are you?

749
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,824
- Who's this?
- Dollar a day.

750
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,993
Funny name for a Korean.

751
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:48,833
Oh, goody, you found it.

752
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,271
[Chuckles]

753
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:55,345
You actually wear that?

754
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:57,913
Sure. When I'm
operating on pilots.

755
00:40:58,015 --> 00:41:01,007
- Contact.
- Contact. [Sputters]

756
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,812
Keep the air force
on your side of the room.

757
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,821
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

758
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,256
<i>All those with body lice,</i>
<i>report for dusting at 1330 hours.</i>

759
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,160
<i>Dysentery at 1420 hours.</i>
<i>Toe fungus at 1500.</i>

760
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,994
Good Lord, what sort
of a pesthole have I fallen into?

761
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,330
You'll get used to it.
The pests grow on you.

762
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:23,497
E-E-Easy! A little to the left.
Now you got it.

763
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,940
- Where do you want this, Doc?
- In Tokyo, actually.

764
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:29,604
Tempo, Doc.
I got a lice appointment.

765
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:33,205
- Set it down anywhere.
- Over here.

766
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,881
Thank you much. Dismissed.

767
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:40,787
- Nice hat, Klinger. New?
- For tea dancing.

768
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:46,526
Who is that... creature?

769
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,726
Corporal Klinger... first man
to kill a caribou with a beaded purse.

770
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:54,634
- Finish!
- You have not done the corners.

771
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:58,367
- Finish!
- You haven't made my bed.

772
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,965
Finish.

773
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:11,778
Why me? Why me?

774
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:14,823
Practically chief of thoracic surgery
at Boston General...

775
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:18,656
in this godforsaken... dump.

00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:22,892
<i>Me. A man who can hum all four parts</i>
<i>of the Schubert string quartets...</i>

- Well, that's the army.

778
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,836
- You know, supply and demand.
- That's why you were picked.

779
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:31,908
Just yesterday we were saying
we were short a Spinoza man.

780
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,705
- I'm a leg man, myself.
- And very funny.

781
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:38,474
Remind me to slap my knee.

782
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:42,575
<i>[Man Over P.A.] Attention, all personnel.</i>
<i>MASH 8063 is overloaded.</i>

- Are you speaking to me?
- What's taking you so long?

787
00:42:58,268 --> 00:43:01,169
In this camp, cleanliness
is next to impossible.

788
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:03,762
You have to kill the germs.
Don't hang around for the funeral.

789
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:06,604
Look how high he's scrubbing.
Maybe he's going to operate in evening gloves.

790
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,871
Gentlemen, I do
one thing at a time.

791
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:11,743
I do it very well,
and then I move on.

792
00:43:11,848 --> 00:43:13,873
Can you doctors wiggle
your collective keister?

793
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:17,647
I've got three tables facing the war.
One of them is a tricky bowel resection.

794
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:21,656
B.J. Or I will take it.
Dr. Pasteur is still pasteurizing himself.

795
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:24,522
Well, uh, maybe we'd better
wait and let him do it.

796
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:27,290
It's kind of complicated.
As soon as you can, Winchester.

797
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,365
- All right.
- What's so great about him?

798
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:32,799
I do one thing at a time.
I do it very well...

799
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,303
and then I move on.

800
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,305
Gentlemen, please...

801
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,307
pay close attention
to this bowel resection.

802
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,242
I don't want to have to
show it to you twice.

803
00:43:43,346 --> 00:43:45,541
[Chuckles]

804
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:49,050
I'm not gonna play second scalpel
to this garbanzo for the rest of the war.

805
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:51,985
Why don't we avoid the Christmas rush
and start hating him now?

806
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:59,053
- [Hawkeye] Done.
- [Nurse] Klinger!

807
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:01,892
Take him to post-op.
Leave in the I.V.

808
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:03,989
This kid's running up
an awful big tab.

809
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,728
[Hawkeye]
He's on Diners Club.

810
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,237
I'll take this guy.
Let me see that X ray, please.

811
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:15,202
Shattered patella.
Put him to sleep.

812
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:18,279
We're kind of
falling behind, Colonel.

813
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,281
- Winchester.
- Oh, really?

814
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:23,079
- Can I help?
- Is there a prayer for my varicose veins?

815
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:25,950
Well, there's a mailman's prayer
that might be effective.

816
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:29,492
Really sell it, Padre.
Next patient.

817
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:32,221
We're two up on you, Winchester.
Shift into high gear.

818
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:34,524
I refuse to rush
through a bowel resection.

819
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,531
This is the rush hour, Major.

820
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,624
Better get in the fast lane. Sponge.

821
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:41,499
For your information,
I'm doing meticulous work.

822
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,869
Neatness don't count
in meatball surgery.

823
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:46,169
Is harassment
standard operating procedure?

824
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:48,744
Page 26 of the surgeon songbook.

825
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:51,712
Another ambulance just pulled in.
Eleven wounded.

826
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,079
Really bad. Holy Moly.

827
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:56,846
- Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
- More?

828
00:44:56,953 --> 00:44:59,547
Why do people always wait
till the last minute to get shot?

829
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:03,387
- [Grunts]
- Major, we can't spend two hours
on a bowel resection.

830
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,222
Charles, move on!

831
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,489
I'm moving on as fast as I can.

832
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:09,588
[B.J.] I'm finished here, Charlie.
Let me show you.

833
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:11,599
You show me?
Certainly not.

834
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:15,034
- [Margaret] Doctor, we do have shortcuts.
- Shortcuts are sloppy surgery.

835
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:18,665
- <i>More suction.</i>
- Doctor, if we can't control the bleeding,
we're gonna lose him.

836
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:21,209
- B.J., take over. Winchester, watch him.
- [B.J.] Move it.

837
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:23,541
- Now see here.
- Wounded egos come later. For now, just watch.

838
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:25,547
- Two big clamps.
- [Klinger] Another customer.

839
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:28,117
[Hawkeye] I'll take him.
Give him a magazine. I'll be right there.

840
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:30,550
When you're in a hurry, cut the mesentery
between two big clamps...

841
00:45:30,654 --> 00:45:33,122
- and forget daintiness.
- Throw in a layer of catgut...

842
00:45:33,223 --> 00:45:35,123
and interrupted silk
in the serosa.

843
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:37,625
Maybe eight sutures
on the anterior side.

844
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:40,355
Mucosa to mucosa,
muscularis to muscularis.

845
00:45:40,463 --> 00:45:43,523
- Serosa to serosa.
- And Natchez to Mobile.

846
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:47,967
- It'll leak.
- No, it won't, and it'll only take 20 minutes.

847
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:50,039
Klinger, let me see
that X ray again.

848
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,077
It's me again.
Klinger had to, uh, uh...

849
00:45:55,178 --> 00:45:58,306
Oh, to be in the latrine,
now that spring is here.

850
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:03,642
<i>[Jet Passes Overhead]</i>

851
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,272
[Groans]

852
00:46:28,478 --> 00:46:32,812
Winchester, don't feel so bad.
You'll catch on.

853
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,350
I felt like an intern in there.

854
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:37,579
Everybody does in the beginning.

855
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:39,587
First thousand patients
are the hardest.

856
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:41,748
Second day, it gets easier.

857
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,460
I don't...

858
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:49,427
I don't think
I can adjust to this.

859
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:51,432
Look. We know
you're a good surgeon.

860
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:55,300
Even though some good surgeons
wash out under these conditions, you won't.

861
00:46:55,405 --> 00:46:57,498
- <i>You're gonna make it.</i>
- Sure you will.

862
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,802
[Yawns]
We're not any better than you.

863
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:03,037
It's just that by sheer repetition,
we've gotten fast.

864
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:08,412
Well...

865
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:10,418
you may be right.

866
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:14,455
If you people did it,
I certainly can.

867
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:21,222
Way to go, Charlie.

868
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:24,061
Come on over to my office.
We'll have a couple of belts.

869
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:27,068
Thank you, no.

870
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,968
If you don't mind, uh...

871
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:32,200
I'd rather be alone.

872
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:41,213
That is not a happy person.

873
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:44,845
Would you rather have Burns?

874
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:47,889
- He was more fun to be cruel to.
- Do me a favor.

875
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:52,985
No practical jokes, no horsing around
until he gets broken in. Okay?

876
00:47:53,096 --> 00:47:57,192
I wish you told us that
before we put the snake in his bed.

877
00:48:06,142 --> 00:48:11,671
## [Classical: Mozart]

878
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:22,554
[B.J.] Hey, we got us
a new record player.

879
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:25,150
Please, Beej, Mozart.

880
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,286
Have you no respect
for classical music?

881
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:30,059
Are you kidding?
I got the "William Tell Overture"...

882
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:32,498
- by Spike Jones.
- Oh.

883
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:35,162
#<i>#[Continues]</i>

884
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:50,417
[Yells]

885
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,552
Clever. Very clever.

886
00:49:00,463 --> 00:49:03,660
Please... Mozart.
