Prepare to join your bitch whore

No!

1425

Look at me! Look at me!
No. No.

1426
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,240
- I want you to see me when you die.
- No.

1427
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,280
Don't kill me, please.
Please don't kill me.

1428
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,880
I want you to hurt.

1429
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,760
This is going to hurt
for all the pain you've given me.

1430
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,720
For all the pain
you've given my family!

You go with my people.

Don't kill me.
Don't, don't, don't.

1434
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,160
I beg you.
This is for Tessa.

Do you feel that?

Alberto.

1444
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,200
The emperor's horse.

1445
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,240
I can see it's his horse.

1446
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,960
Where is he?

1447
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,920
I don't know.
He must be here, somewhere around.

1448
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:14,120
Rest assured.
I want to see his body.

1449
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,280
Barbarossa's dead.

1450

Give me that dagger.

Nothing.

Nothing will give you Eleonora back.

But if she were here,
she'd like to see you happy.
