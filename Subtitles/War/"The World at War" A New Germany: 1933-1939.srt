1
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:54,311
For this road,
in one day of Summer of 1944,

2
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,711
the soldiers had arrived.

3
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,611
Not deferred payment nobody here now.

4
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:09,311
They had been only some hours.

5
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:15,811
When they had left, the community that
it lives a thousand years here, had perished.

6
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:23,411
We are in Oradour-sur-Glane,
in France.

7
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,711
In the day where the soldiers had arrived,
the people was congregated.

8
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,611
The men had been taken
for garages and granaries.

9
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,811
The women and the children
they had been led by this road

10
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:41,711
e lead for this church.

11
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:47,311
Here, they had heard the detonations,
when the men had been fusilladed.

12
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,811
Later, they had also been deceased.

13
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:58,211
Weeks later, many of that
they had also killed them had been died.

14
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,911
. in combat.

15
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:08,111
Oradour never was reconstructed.
Its ruins are a memorial.

16
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:15,711
Its capital punishment represents
of thousand of others in the Poland,

17
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,011
in Russia, the Birmânia, China.

18
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:22,611
. in a world in war.

19
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:32,211
The World in War

20
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:44,411
New Germany 1933 - 1939

21
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:25,811
Germany, 1933.

22
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:31,011
An enormous and blind enthusiasm
it fulls the streets.

23
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:36,611
National-Socialism gains the power,
in a country tortured over the unemployment,

24
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:41,111
amargurado for the loss of territory,
demoralized for the weakness politics.

25
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:44,311
Perhaps either the new start.

26
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:53,911
The majority considers the nazistas
a little obsessive nonsenses and,

27
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,711
but perhaps the time of the thought
it has finished.

28
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,011
Adolf Hitler did not take the power.

29
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,011
They had offered it, when its
to be able of vote was in decline.

30
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:12,811
The politicians who had made of Hitler
chancellor had said:we contract "it".

31
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,711
The main figure of them was
the old president von Hindenburg.

32
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,711
The socialist Communists and
they had tried to face Hitler with calm:

33
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,211
"This will not last", had said.

34
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,011
The anti-nazistas conservatives
if they tranquilizaram with the fact

35
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:32,911
of that its old leader of the war,
Hindenburg, still state head,

36
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,611
to be known by
to disdain the mediocre handle.

37
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,811
Number 9082, Paul von Hindenburg.

38
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,611
Already it is?

39
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,811
With false solemnity,
Hitler and its sequidores

40
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,311
they had directed it foot to the cerimónia
of the opening of the parlamento.

41
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:13,211
The force of the party was constructed
from the revolutionary violence.

42
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,911
They had never imagined that they could
to arrive legally at the power.

43
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,811
When the old building of
Reichstag caught fire mysteriously,

44
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:24,811
Hitler grasped the chance stops
to suspend all the civil freedoms.

45
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:27,411
Its followers badly
they could believe its luck.

46
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:36,311
The old Hindenburg, symbol
of an apparent continuity,

47
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:39,011
she was still president, when they
they had transformed the government into being able,

48
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,911
with acts of pretense legality.

49
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:46,311
In March, when the Reichstag allowed that Hitler governed without Parliament,

50
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:49,011
Hindenburg did not make commentaries.

51
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:56,111
The legal chancellor adopted
the paper of the legal dictator.

52
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,211
Hitler proclaimed new Germany.

53
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,111
E had the intention of
that it lasted a thousand years.

54
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,611
New Germany started to surround
its enemies:Communists,

55
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:32,611
socialist, inopportune journalists,
members of the house of representatives of the Reichstag.

56
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:39,711
In the concentration camp
of Orienburg, to the north of Berlin,

57
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:42,511
the conditions, the principle, were
but hard but not brutais.

58
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:51,411
At this time, the fields were managed
for the Sections of Assault, the SA.

59
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,511
They maltreated more
of what they assassinated.

60
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:12,111
Since the beginning, Hitler advanced
with the campaign against the Jews.

61
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:16,311
As SA had organized boycotting
to the pertaining store the Jews.

62
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,611
The true reason was
to encourage the German people

63
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,311
to think and to act
in way anti-semitic.

64
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,211
The exterior world was horrified.

65
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,211
But those existed,
including Jewish Germans,

66
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,811
that they thought that the campaign
anti-semitic was workmanship of extremistas,

67
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:38,011
something with that Hitler would finish,
as soon as more was felt safe.

68
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,411
It would also go to give itself
a cultural revolution.

69
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:47,811
The German culture would be purged
of it stains Jewish and bolchevista.

70
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:01,711
The books had been played to the flames.

71
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:05,911
Many of they had played that them
they were pupils and professors.

72
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:09,911
E to the measure that fagulhas went up,
the intellectuals ran away,

73
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,911
writers and scientists,

74
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,511
to offer its talentos
to the Europe Occidental person and America.

75
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:22,011
One hundred years before, Heine,
German poet of Jewish ancestry,

76
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,911
whose books were now
played to the flames, it informs:

77
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:30,111
"Where if they burn books,
they will finish if burning people."

78
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,811
Some of most zealous
followers of Hitler

79
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,911
they had found new ways
to show loyalty.

80
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,611
They had been married or they come back if to marry
under the rules of the nazista ritual.

81
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:57,311
The nazistas had the support
bulk of the unemployeds,

82
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,111
but less of
organized workers.

83
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:03,511
The left section of the party

84
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,611
it wanted to initiate a movement
of workers in the plants.

85
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,511
But Hitler followed
a simpler route.

86
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:12,411
It granted to the unions the holiday
of the Day of the Worker as they wanted.

87
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,111
In the following day, it abolished the unions.

88
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:19,711
The followers of nazism were
basically of the middle class.

89
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,411
Storekeepers ruined for the depression,

90
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,311
employees who had lost
its savings,

91
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:27,211
excuídos craftsmen
for the production in mass.

92
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,211
These were the adoradores of Hitler.

93
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:50,911
Of this army of ruined they made
part agriculturists and peasants.

94
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,911
Hitler signs up them
during the Depression.

95
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:58,211
Now it said that its blood to them
alone e was the treasure of Germany.

96
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:03,711
It approved laws granting to them
ownership of its lands. E gave bread to them.

97
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:25,011
The Treated one to Versailles in 1919 reduces the German territory drastically.

98
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:31,411
They had lost the Alsácia,
Lorena and the Sarre.

99
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:34,711
The east of the Prússia was isolated
for the new Polish state;

100
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,911
the Silésia divided in two;

101
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:40,411
Danzig, a city
of Liga of the Nations.

102
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,011
For the patriots,

103
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:49,311
Germany would not be free
while Versailles lasted.

104
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:54,211
Hitler seemed to be the rescuer foreseen in monuments in the border:

105
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:59,711
"German, never they forget
what hatred stole the blind you.

106
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:06,211
They wait the hour that will avenge
the bloody crime of the border."

107
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:19,211
Except, it had who admired
the way as Germany if defended.

108
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,411
In America, we had many reports against its new government

109
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:26,611
e, many times, had caused
hasty demonstrations.

110
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,411
Now, I can say voces
that the American people, today,

111
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:32,711
it knows that these histories are
false and they do not have bedding.

112
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:36,411
I find that it has a new vitality
here in Germany,

113
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,511
with its great leader and chancellor,
Adolf Hitler, that I admire very.

114
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,311
New Germany will construct for you

115
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,011
optimum centered government
of the current world.

116
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:51,811
New Germany was a set
of different interests and hurts,

117
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:54,411
kept together for the belt
of the Socialist National Party.

118
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,911
E the buckle of the belt was Hitler.

119
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:05,311
The well most precious one in the Land

120
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,411
he is our people.

121
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,111
E for this people,

122
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:13,911
e with this people,

123
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:17,011
we will battle and fight,

124
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:20,111
e never we will fraquejaremos,

125
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,511
we will never tire in them,

126
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,711
we will never vacilaremos,

127
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:27,611
we will never despair.

128
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:33,411
Alive our movement!
Alive our people!

129
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:39,111
In the truth, it was the only party
that it promised to take off us of the abyss.

130
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,811
E the main idea

131
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:47,511
it was that alone it would be possible

132
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:52,111
if we created a nation
with team spirit,

133
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:57,811
with solidarity, and all
making the same effort,

134
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:02,311
instead of fighting due
the small differences of opinion,

135
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:07,011
to the external politics and the social politics, and there for ahead.

136
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:15,411
What it promised?
Work and bread for the masses,

137
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:20,011
the millions of workers
unemployeds and with hunger.

138
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,711
Today, in our prosperous society,

139
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,711
work and bread already not
they mean nothing,

140
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:30,211
but, at the time, they were
a basic necessity

141
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,111
e this promise, that not
it would make any direction today,

142
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:38,111
at the time it seemed
the promise of the Paradise.

143
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,911
Everything this became the ideal land
a prophet to say:

144
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,511
"Levaei them it the Engaged Land.

145
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:51,911
Livraei them of the evil"

146
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,411
Who wants that said this,
it would be greeted with enthusiasm.

147
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,811
Clearly that it had who said:
"This is a false prophet",

148
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,911
but who could know
if certain or they were made a mistake?

149
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,011
At the time, nobody wise person.

150
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:25,311
Christmas of 1933:
one year of the Reich de Hitler.

151
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,711
"Peace in the Land -
Good will between the men."

152
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,611
The concentration camps
they were full,

153
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,711
the Parliament was only
one appears decorative;

154
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,211
the political parties
e the abolished unions;

155
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,611
the Jews are of the public services;

156
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:44,611
the strangled free press;
the destroyed personal freedoms.

157
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,511
Germany lived in a permanent one
emergency state.

158
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:05,811
The state of Adolf Hitler
he was sovereign, exactly Almighty.

159
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,711
But it still felt itself threatened.

160
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:20,511
It feared its old rivals
conservatives. The army feared.

161
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:25,511
E also the sections of its party
that still they were revolutionary,

162
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,111
as the leaders
of the Sections of Assault.

163
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:31,511
also the army hated the SA.

164
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:38,211
Hitler saw as to conciliate the generals
e to clean its way.

165
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:45,011
The head of the SA was one of its
old comrades, Ernst Röhm.

166
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:50,611
In 30 of June of 1934
Röhm was imprisoned.

167
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,011
. and died.

168
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,811
The commanders of the SA.
e more than one hundred others

169
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,011
they had been removed of its beds
e also died.

170
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,111
The murder blew up
for all Germany.

171
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:06,511
The assassins were
new force in Germany,

172
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,811
the SS, the bodyguards
of Hitler,

173
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,811
they became its now
private agreement of terror.

174
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:18,611
Goering gave a conference
in the Ministry of the Propaganda.

175
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,911
Goebbels was Minister of the Propaganda,

176
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:27,011
but it had been with Hitler,
therefore Goering detestava it

177
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,011
e could have grasped the chance
of if exempting of it, being in Berlin.

178
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,711
Goering gave the conference
for the foreign press.

179
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:40,111
Before this, the communication was
cut for the foreign countries.

180
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,611
Goering entered and said:

181
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:49,911
"I know that vocês they like histories", it used the word in English.

182
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,711
"Therefore I have one
good history for vocês."

183
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:58,811
E described as in
previous night and in this morning

184
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:04,511
it and Hitler had acted
against not conforming forces,

185
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,911
as much of the Right as of the Left,

186
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:14,211
that Röhm had been fusilladed
e one second jammed revolution.

187
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:20,311
It also made a obscure reference
to the general von Schleicher,

188
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:25,011
that it had preceded Hitler
as German chancellor.

189
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:30,411
Later it left the room, came back
passed some seconds and it said:

190
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:35,111
"They had said me that I was not clearly
how much to the general von Schleicher.

191
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:38,511
The general von Schleicher was died
this morning, when it resisted the arrest."

192
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:44,811
30 of June of 1934
it was one day very important,

193
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,011
because one became obvious

194
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:51,011
that this government, while government,

195
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,911
if it became an assassin.

196
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:57,411
They had killed
a great number of people

197
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:02,611
without them to take the court.
Simply they had killed them.

198
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:10,811
E not only enemy right-handers of Hitler
at the moment,

199
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,611
not only Röhm, the head of the SA,

200
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:19,411
but also other people
that they considered ackward.

201
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:22,611
E had made it at the same time.

202
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:34,211
In this Summer,
another rival disappeared.

203
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:39,911
President Hindenburg
he died in 2 of August.

204
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:47,511
While it still breathed,
Hitler abolished the president position,

205
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:52,611
proclaiming Führer and chancellor,
head of state and government.

206
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:04,211
E before its body esfriarr,
Hitler commands usurped it of the army.

207
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:08,011
The Armed Forces had paraded
to make a new oath.

208
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,211
When old they swore
loyalty to the Constitution,

209
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:15,611
now they were committed to Hitler,
personally, for the name.

210
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,811
Interest, for God.

211
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,511
e for this sacred empire.

212
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:31,511
that I will obey the Führer
of the empire and German people

213
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:38,211
Adolf Hitler.

214
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:44,711
For the officers German, an oath was almost physically real.

215
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:49,211
Hitler them had enclosed.

216
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:54,911
Now they could not disobeys it,
without disobeying to the Native land.

217
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:56,311
Interest.

218
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,311
Interest for God.

219
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,111
Interest for Adolf Hitler!

220
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:05,911
Adolf Hitler.

221
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,611
Hitler continued in front.

222
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,611
In the same month, the Germans
they had had that to go to the ballot boxes

223
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:23,911
to approve its ascension to
to be able state and governmental.

224
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:29,211
Now, the management for the threat,
propaganda, fake and fraud

225
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:31,111
it was functioning wonderfully.

226
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,911
Hitler obtained 90% of "Ya".

227
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,411
Four million had still voted "Nein".

228
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:46,911
Hitler proclaimed:

229
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:52,111
"In next a thousand years it will not have
another revolution in Germany."

230
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:00,511
The nazistas had nailed the doctrine
of the community of the people,

231
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:03,711
of if learning to be German
ones with the others.

232
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,811
The aid of Winter, the main collection of street for charity, was a symbol.

233
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:15,011
E the leaders of the party revealed
comrades of the people for the cameras.

234
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:19,111
Goering revealed:

235
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:23,111
a hero of the war, a man
that he laughs and he appreciated the life,

236
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,511
that it believed to be one
moderadora force in the party.

237
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:30,011
Josef Goebbels, the small one
Minister of the Propaganda,

238
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:32,811
to who they called
"dwarfed poisonous".

239
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:36,711
Its severity was feared,
but respected.

240
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:47,511
The right arm of Hitler, Rudolf Hess:
one appears intriguer for the masses.

241
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:53,011
The way of the nazistas to govern age
to be distant, but not to seem it.

242
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:57,511
All the classrooms were encouraged
to have the same meals:

243
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,711
the soldier, the head,
the workers, the banker.

244
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:06,711
The party believed the community,
but the industrials continued rich.

245
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:10,411
They had financed the nazistas, when
if it became probable that earned,

246
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:14,511
e now its orders were submitted it
without great sadnesses.

247
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,211
The businesses were
improving quickly.

248
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,811
The economy was improving
when the nazistas had arrived at the power.

249
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:26,111
But they had been with the credits,
speeding up the recovery

250
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,411
with an enormous program of workmanships
public for the unemployeds.

251
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,811
Other countries, where the unemployment
of the masses it persisted,

252
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,511
they observed Germany with envy.

253
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,611
Only one minute,
ladies and gentlemen.

254
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:44,611
Here it is something that must know.

255
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:50,711
1933 - 11,55 employed million.

256
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,511
1936 - 15,70 employed million.

257
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:01,411
lsto is workmanship of the Führer!
It is everything what they need to know.

258
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,511
The unemployeds
they had constructed the auto-road,

259
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:12,311
the first one of the world, joining
still villager Germany.

260
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:16,311
The auto-roads were also
for the personal pleasure,

261
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:19,211
inside of the facista notion
of the "force for the joy".

262
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:22,911
E had been presented not in such a way
as a transport system,

263
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,311
but as the triumph
of the national will,

264
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,811
on to other famous projects,
as new Berlin of the Führer.

265
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:53,111
Full of elegance and health,

266
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:57,011
confident and cliente
of its obligation and task,

267
00:24:57,511 --> 00:25:00,311
thus they are the happy young
of our great age.

268
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,111
These are members
of the "Faith and Beauty",

269
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:08,911
predecessor
of Liga of the Young Germans,

270
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:12,911
feminine equivalent of
Hitlerista youth. E for measures there.

271
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,711
All the young
they learned songs of the party,

272
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:18,811
they practiced exercise,
they danced and they belonged to the group.

273
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,911
Every year,
the agriculturists and its families

274
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,811
they were congregated in Bückeberg with
Führer, at the time of the harvest.

275
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:41,411
In 1936, the ones that waited
its leader arrived at a million.

276
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:50,311
It was been slow. It always arrived
been slow; it increased the tension.

277
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:35,311
Later it arrived, leaving
the enthusiasm to overflow.

278
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:37,411
When passing in direction to the tribune,

279
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:40,211
the masses could see it
of close and until touching to it.

280
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:44,011
Deliberately, the women
they were placed in the first lines.

281
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,711
When it went up the hillside,

282
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:53,611
it did not perceive as the people
they could cry out in such a way.

283
00:26:55,811 --> 00:27:00,411
But when it arrived at our group,
also I fell under its witchcraft,

284
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:03,911
e I cried out Heil as all people.

285
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:08,011
But later, when
it was very close,

286
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:13,811
greeting to the right and left,
pressing the hands and speaking,

287
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:16,111
e also pressed my hand,

288
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:23,611
I noticed that all immediately
to its side they were in silence.

289
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:29,211
In first the 10 minutes
it was not a good orator.

290
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:34,111
It started to heat
e to try to find words.

291
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:40,611
But, in the end, he was one
excellent communicator.

292
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:47,911
It. does not know the word in English. commanded its public

293
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:57,911
e all the atmosphere if
it became each histérica time.

294
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,011
He was interrupted,

295
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:07,111
to follow the almost all the phrases,
for great applauses

296
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:10,911
e the women cried out.

297
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:19,211
It was as a ceremony
religious in mass.

298
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:24,511
I heard the speech

299
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:31,011
e I felt the atmosphere
each excited time more in the hall

300
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:37,511
e, per some seconds,
I had the sensation, a time or another one:

301
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:45,111
"That penalty I not to be able to partilhar
the belief of these thousands of people,

302
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:49,111
to be alone, to be against everything this."

303
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:54,811
He was funny. I thought:"It is saying besteiras that already I know,

304
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,911
the besteiras that always said."

305
00:28:57,411 --> 00:29:03,511
Exactly thus, it felt
that it had to be wonderful

306
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:08,711
to jump for the way
of the multitude in polvorosa

307
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:13,911
e to be part
of that they believed.

308
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:31,811
One lady of our city
it was Berlin,

309
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:35,311
to an anniversary party
of Adolf Hitler.

310
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:40,211
When it arrived, said us:
"The Führer pressed me it hand".

311
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:45,111
From then on, it was as one
saint in our city.

312
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:09,411
The private life of Hitler was transferred
in the Baviera, Berchtesgaden.

313
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:12,911
These images are of
films caretakers of Eva Braun,

314
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,911
the discrete young that
it was with it until a death.

315
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:19,811
The Berghof came the elect ones,
to take tea and to argue tactical.

316
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:24,411
Some a little bashful;
genuinely close others.

317
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:32,111
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler

318
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:38,111
It is the luminous Edelweiss

319
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:45,311
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler

320
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,611
It is the luminous Edelweiss

321
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:08,711
In exactly particular, Hitler it the same had that to be that if vendia the public.

322
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:12,411
Adolf with the children;

323
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,711
Adolf with the dogs;

324
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:19,911
Adolf with a lens;

325
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,211
Adolf with friends.

326
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,511
Taking a walk, as a good one
Bavarian bourgeois, to the sunday.

327
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:47,811
In this close circle,

328
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:53,211
Eva Braun was the natural woman,
healthful, happy with its body.

329
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:24,111
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler

330
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:29,011
It is the luminous Edelweiss

331
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:35,911
In Berghof, it had bodyguard
good-tempered and friendly;

332
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:37,711
the other colds.

333
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:41,511
Heinrich Himmler, gentleman of the SS,

334
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:45,411
it came with Heydrich, its
terrible and beautiful lieutenant.

335
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,811
In formal occasions,
they appeared the guards of the SS.

336
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:00,111
They were the reality of the great tyranny
centered in distant Berlin.

337
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,811
Briefly, its hands would be
red with the blood of millions.

338
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:08,511
For this reality, Hitler
the beach chair would leave,

339
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:11,711
the parties and the loving one.

340
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,111
The car waited
in the end of the stairs.

341
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:29,411
If Germany again wanted to be
fort, had that to rearm itself.

342
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:35,211
A people scared for the war had
that to come back to make familiar itself to weapons,

343
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:37,911
to touch to them,

344
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,711
to play with the soldiers.

345
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:02,011
Germany had that to train pilots.

346
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:05,411
The Treated one to Versailles forbids
Germany to have an Air Force,

347
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,911
therefore the league of the sports
aerial it used gliders

348
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:11,511
to train men, still civil
officially, for the future Luftwaffe.

349
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:20,511
E the army increased for beyond
of the limits taxes for Versailles,

350
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:22,311
from the moment in
that Hitler if became chancellor.

351
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:26,011
In secret, it tripled
its force in two years.

352
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,511
Any foreign military attaché
he could see what he was happening.

353
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,811
But the world nothing made of decisive

354
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:49,311
e, in March of 1935,
Germany announced the conscription,

355
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:52,511
an army of peace time
of half million of men.

356
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:00,611
The new tanks had appeared.

357
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:13,011
The first squadrons
of the Luftwaffe they had flied.

358
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:24,111
The new German navy
it came the way.

359
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:34,211
Hitler kept the haunted Europe.

360
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:39,811
Proclaiming extinct Versailles,
it considered an armament limit.

361
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,411
Great-Britain, the first democracy to make a pact with the nazistas,

362
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,111
it signed a naval agreement.

363
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,111
Hitler was tranquilizou.

364
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:50,711
It could be safe to turn itself
for the hated borders.

365
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:55,511
One has left of the Treat one to Versailles
already it had been insult.

366
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:59,011
In January of 1935,
the territory of the Sarre,

367
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:02,811
the small region of coalmines
that she had been German before 1918,

368
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:08,011
it voted in mass, and under supervision
the International, to come back to Germany.

369
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:19,611
To the side, the Renânia remained
a demilitarized zone.

370
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,611
Without any dispute,
it was part of Germany,

371
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:26,411
but to recoup it would be to defy
the allies, above all France.

372
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:32,711
The troops had passed the bridges of the Reno
in 7 of March of 1936.

373
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:36,711
In secret, the commanders
they were ready if to remove

374
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,711
case France showed fight signals.

375
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:40,611
But these signals had not come.

376
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:47,611
Colony, in the Renânia, and Germany
they had expressed its relief and joy.

377
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,611
Part of the German honor
she had been recouped.

378
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:54,011
Hitler had risky and profit.

379
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:58,711
Two years later, Austria,
place of birth of Hitler,

380
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,811
she was ready to be annexed.

381
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:06,111
The Austrian nazistas fought for
Anschluss, union with Germany.

382
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:10,411
To hinder elections on
independence, Hitler annexed it.

383
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:21,011
The German troops had been greeted
for multitudes in she would histeria.

384
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:25,111
Vienna saw a terror against the Jews,
that nor Germany had seen.

385
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,711
Austria became a province.

386
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,411
The neighbors of Germany,
consternados, little firm

387
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,711
e little prepared,
one more time it swims had made.

388
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:45,111
The Tchecoslováquia
it was not a German province,

389
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:46,611
but an independent nation,

390
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,411
allied of Great-Britain,
of France and the Soviet Union.

391
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:54,211
In its border to the north
they lived the German Sudetas.

392
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:58,211
Hitler stirred up this minority,
that never it is part of Germany,

393
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,911
to demand the union with the Reich.

394
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,911
The Europe was prepared for the war.

395
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:07,011
But although the Tchecoslováquia
to be ready to fight,

396
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:09,011
Great-Britain and France had yielded.

397
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:13,811
In Munique, September of 1938,
Chamberlain, for Great-Britain,

398
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,511
Mussolini of the ltália

399
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:21,611
e Daladier of France
they had signed, with Hitler,

400
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:24,411
the treated one that it removed the region
of the Sudetas of the Tchecoslováquia,

401
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,711
leaving it incomplete and abandoning.

402
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,411
The Germans had crossed the border,

403
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:46,511
received as liberating
for the population sudeta.

404
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,911
In house, the generals German
that they opposed the Hitler,

405
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:54,511
to the wait that one disfigures
in the Tchecoslováquia

406
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,411
it finished with its prestige,

407
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:58,911
they had given up its conspiracies,
despaired.

408
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:21,911
Hitler joined it the troops in the field
e made plans for the future.

409
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,811
The region of the Sudetas
easily it was digested.

410
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,811
The remaining portion could be obtained
quickly.

411
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:36,611
The territories diminished Czechs e
the Eslováquia was abandoned.

412
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:40,111
It attacked in 15 of March of 1939.

413
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:47,711
The German troops had entered in Plague
in the same day, without resistance.

414
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:54,011
The last democracy
in the Central Europe it disappeared.

415
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,911
The Czechs never more
they would trust the Ocidente.

416
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:03,111
The Ocidente already did not trust Hitler

417
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:07,511
e was uncovered, finally,
that it would only withhold it to the force.

418
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:20,211
In Berlin, more
greetings, more veneration.

419
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,311
However, what they thought
the ones greeted that it?

420
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:28,711
Few wanted conquest wars,
or they dreamed, as Hitler,

421
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:32,211
with a German empire,
of the Urais until the Atlantic o.

422
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:37,511
The majority thought that it was
recouping what they had stolen to them

423
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,811
e restoring, not destroying,
the order and the unit of the Europe.

424
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:59,611
For these multitudes, the capacity
politics of Hitler never would fail.

425
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,311
Others, that had been in
house in this night,

426
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:05,511
they feared that was entered in war,
what it could destroy Germany.

427
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:09,411
But now they did not see hope
in one it raises against Hitler.

428
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:11,811
They had been with the moral question:

429
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:16,411
"It must be resisted a tyranny
without success hope?"

430
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:22,911
First, I find that it is difficult
to take the decision

431
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:26,511
of that if it must make something
against the government.

432
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:32,011
First of everything, it is very rare.

433
00:41:32,311 --> 00:41:39,011
Later, if he is extremely dangerous,
as it is in a dictatorship,

434
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:44,211
still more it is complicated, because
all people likes its life.

435
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:52,811
Everything what it happened in them, when
we lived in Germany, was gradual.

436
00:41:53,811 --> 00:42:00,511
It was perhaps part in the way as
Hitler managed these subjects.

437
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:06,711
The drop arrived us drop, as
an anesthetic, could be said.

438
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:14,511
When something only specific E that it
it made reached in them personally

439
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:20,311
he is that we we discovered,
of truth, what it was transferred.

440
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:23,311
In mine case in particular,

441
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:27,211
I can say that me
it reached personally

442
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:31,711
when the Jewish doctor
of my children,

443
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,411
that it had been always,
it came in our house.

444
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:40,911
He was a busy man very, but
more time seemed to have each time.

445
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:47,111
I remember that a night came
e was with my very sick son.

446
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:51,911
Of morning, the child was better
e, when it went even so,

447
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:57,711
he asked to me if I wanted that
it continued to see the children.

448
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,611
I was tired and said:
"My God, because not?

449
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:06,611
E it said me that the clinic stops
children who start in Hamburg

450
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,911
it went to be destruida. went to be dismissed

451
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,911
e that received letters
threatening that they said

452
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:16,311
that if it put the hands in
Aryan children, would have problems.

453
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:24,611
In November of 1938, a Jew
he killed a German diplomat in Paris.

454
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:27,511
The nazistas leaders
they had organized a retaliation.

455
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:32,211
Synagogs had been burnt and store
Jewish pilhadas in Germany.

456
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:39,711
In this "Night of Crystal", call
thus for the glass broken in the gutters,

457
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:43,511
thousands of Jews had been taken
for the concentration camps.

458
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,511
A terrible night!

459
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:54,111
It wants to know as was that night?

460
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:56,911
If it wants to know, I I say to it.

461
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:01,911
We were ranks all together,
they had beaten them, they given them murros,

462
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:05,711
e had made them to be of foot, in lines,
to be counted.

463
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,411
Because he had been welded,
I did not find this very difficult,

464
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:17,111
but to who it is not tacked
as it had, they beat to them soon.

465
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:24,211
E worse was when somebody grasped
a strong man great e.

466
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:30,411
It said:"He does not grasp me". "What?
I cannot grasp? "and they had beaten to it.

467
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:38,811
This man soon was grasped
for three people, of the SS.

468
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,811
They had brought a block.

469
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,611
It had moored it and
commander of the field said:

470
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:50,911
"The Israel Jew, or the Idzic Jew,
I do not obtain to remember to me,

471
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:53,611
it was sentenced the 25 chicotadas."

472
00:44:56,811 --> 00:45:02,411
It came an enormous man, of the SS,
with a whip and it beat to it.

473
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:09,811
First, the man alone moaned
a little, but later cried out:"They stop"

474
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:13,211
The commander said:
"What it wants to say with "They stop"?

475
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,611
We go to start denovo".

476
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:20,311
But after more three chicotadas,
the blood gushed out,

477
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,211
they had stopped and they rubbed salt in the wounds,
or pepper, I do not remember.

478
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:29,411
The man was taken dragged.
Never more the vi.

479
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:38,711
Clearly that in 1938, when
the synagogs were catching fire,

480
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:40,611
all we knew what it was transferred.

481
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,611
I remember that my brother-in-law,
husband of my Lena sister,

482
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:47,811
Owner of house when she left
in the morning after.

483
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:53,211
Kristallnacht, Reichs Kristallnacht,
Crystal night, as vocês says,

484
00:45:55,311 --> 00:45:57,611
it was of train
for the office in the center

485
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:01,311
e enters the stations of Savignyplatz
e Zoologischer Garten

486
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:05,611
it had a synagog
e it saw that it was catching fire.

487
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:09,211
It murmured "Kulturschande",

488
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:14,311
that it is an insult for the culture,
our culture must have shame.

489
00:46:15,111 --> 00:46:21,611
Soon the man of the front turned itself
e showed the Parteiabzeichen,

490
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:27,811
card of the party, and showed to it
the wallet of the Gestapo.

491
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:35,411
E it had that to show documents,
to give the address, and was commanded it

492
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:38,811
that it was to the office of the party
in the following day, to the 9 of the morning.

493
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:50,711
April of 1939:

494
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:54,411
the Wehrmacht is prepared
to celebrate the 50 years of Hitler.

495
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:59,311
It waits one "day of the habitual Führer"
- a beautiful day.

496
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:15,411
The Führer crosses Berlin, passes
under the Vestibule of Brandenburgo

497
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:18,111
e goes down the Siegesallee,
the avenue of the victories.

498
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:41,311
The army, of both the sides,
it increased seven times in four years.

499
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:54,511
Between the 51 divisions
of the Wehrmacht

500
00:47:55,011 --> 00:47:59,011
they are the new tanks,
the instrument of the Blitzkrieg.

501
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:16,911
Although the appearances,
the High Command not yet is certain

502
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,411
that this army this soon
for the war. still.

503
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,611
Hitler is ready
for showing the opposite to them.

504
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:46,911
The word in each colloquy
diplomatics in this Summer was Danzig.

505
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:50,511
The Free City, with its population
mixing of Germans and Poles,

506
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,211
she had been separate of Germany

507
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:55,511
e been under the responsibility of
a commissioner of Liga of the Nations.

508
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:02,211
Danzig and the east of the Prússia
they were separate of the Reich

509
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:05,911
for a band of Polish territory
- the Corridor.

510
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:12,111
Hitler demanded the devolution of Danzig
e access to the Prússia for the Corridor.

511
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,211
The Poland refused.

512
00:49:14,611 --> 00:49:19,311
In March of 1939, Great-Britain e
France had guaranteed the borders to it.

513
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:24,911
In August, Great-Britain promised
to fight if the Poland was attacked.

514
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:30,211
One more time, myths on
the persecution of a German minority

515
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:33,111
they had been used to defend
an intervention armed.

516
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:37,311
Refugee German counted
histories of the Polish brutality.

517
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,411
Later, I caught the stand of the baby

518
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:43,611
e we cross the border
with the children.

519
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:46,511
The nazista propaganda
it filmed them until a exhaustion

520
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:49,111
for Atualidades of the Cinema
during July and August.

521
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:54,911
The plan of Hitler was to make
to disappear the Poland of the map.

522
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:58,311
But this could mean war
with the Soviet Union

523
00:49:58,511 --> 00:49:59,811
e it was not ready for this.

524
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,011
The Minister of the Foreign affairses
Ribbentrop flied for Moscow,

525
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:06,611
in 23 of August, to sign
the pact full brother-Soviet.

526
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:09,511
The destination of the Poland was stamped.

527
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:18,011
The new alliance haunted
the Ocidente surpreso.

528
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:24,411
Germany was rejoiced.

529
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:31,411
The conclusion of the pact reached
strong the politics of the isolation.

530
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,011
The Minister of the Businesses
Foreigners, Lord Halifax, explained:

531
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:39,311
They must have read the reports on
agreement between Russia and Germany,

532
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:41,411
that it surprised the world.

533
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:45,711
As the life of all the nations
it depends, in last analysis,

534
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:48,411
of the mutual respect of the rights,

535
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:53,711
e of the confidence of that each one
its life can live as wants,

536
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:55,911
I really wait.

537
00:50:56,311 --> 00:50:58,011
This exactly, Lord Halifax.

538
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:02,411
The German people also
he wants to live the life to its way!

539
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:07,411
. that it cannot be portraied,
the reason can still prevail.

540
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:11,211
The Atualidades German had tried
to show distracted Great-Britain,

541
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,811
still without certezas.

542
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:16,111
The first-minister Chamberlain
Downing Street leaves.

543
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:26,111
The English diplomacy
it developed frantic efforts

544
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:28,911
to perpetuate the injustice.

545
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:33,911
A young German left England
for its country.

546
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:38,611
I had namorada
with who he wanted to marry

547
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:43,411
e said:
"I go to risk to go me it for house."

548
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:50,311
When I arrived the Colony,
I read first periodicals German

549
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:54,111
e knew soon

550
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:59,311
that it had a great danger
of a war.

551
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:04,711
The tone of the German press
he was completely histérico

552
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:10,611
e I thought that he was a crazy one.

553
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:14,211
It had come to house
at that moment.

554
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:19,711
For all the Europe, the soldiers
in the reserve they had received a telegram.

555
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:22,211
In the last hours of peace,

556
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:26,911
the soldiers had dressed the uniforms
with a tired smile.

557
