And your point is?

310
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,337
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

I'm a real dragon!

I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

334
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,022
Did... Did I mention that
I was the great stone dragon?

335

I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man

Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

347
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,154
After this great stone,
Humpty-Dumpty mess,

348
00:24:56,228 --> 00:25:00,562
I'd have to bring her home with
a medal to get back in the temple.

349
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,759
That's it!
I'll make Mulan a war hero.

350

They'll be begging me
to come back to work.

That's the master plan.

00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,211
What you mean, "a loser"?

359
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,880
How 'bout I pop
one of your antennas off?

360
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,549
- Then who's the loser?
- [Chirps]

361
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,918
[Screeching]

362
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:43,731
[Whinnying]

363
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,680
[Both groan]

364
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,519
Lmperial scouts.

365
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,028
Shan-Yu.

366
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:16,205
[Screeches]

367
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:21,667
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.

368
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,111
[Huns laughing]

369
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,206
The emperor will stop you.

370
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,775
Stop me? He invited me.

371
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:31,548
- [Grunts]
- [Groans]

372
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:35,113
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

373
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,717
Well, I'm here to play his game.

374
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:43,599
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

375
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,065
I'm ready.

376
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,605
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

377
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,269
One.

378
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,517
Okay, okay, how about this?

379
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,985
[Coughs, speaks in deep voice]
Excuse me.

380
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,215
Where do I sign in?

381
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,385
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one, too.

382
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,690
They're very manly and... tough.

383
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:14,389
[Neighing]

384
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,695
I'm working on it!

385
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,794
Oh. Who am I fooling?

386
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:25,069
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

387
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,975
Did I hear someone
ask for a miracle?

388
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,569
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

389
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,842
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

390
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,317
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

391
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,549
For I have been sent
by your ancestors

392
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,183
to guide you through
your masquerade.

393
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,386
If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

394
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,761
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,

395
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,199
the penalty is death!

396
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,668
Who are you?

397
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,297
Who am I? Who am I?

398
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:59,865
I am the guardian of lost souls.

399
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,571
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,

400
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,137
the indestructible Mushu.

401
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,541
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

402
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,584
[Groans]

403
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:18,721
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

404
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,525
Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard.

405
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,226
I don't do that tongue thing.

406
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,269
You're, um...

407
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,600
Intimidating?
Awe-inspiring?

408
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,934
- Tiny.
- Of course.

409
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,065
I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

410
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,873
If I was my real size, your cow
here would die of fright.

411
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,905
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

412
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:44,750
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!

413
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,986
All right, that's it! Dishonor!

414
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,049
Dishonor on your whole family.

415
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,184
Make a note of this.

416
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,821
Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis...

417
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,195
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

418
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:59,531
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

419
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:03,039
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.

420
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,540
We clear on that?
All right.

421
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,874
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

422
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,379
- Let's move it, heifer.
- [Snorts]

423
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:11,581

[Men chattering]

425
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,448
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

426
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,786
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

427
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,261
Two, three. Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

428
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,034
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- They're disgusting.

429
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,469
No, they're men. You have to
act like them, so pay attention.

430
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:39,770
Look.
This tattoo will protect me from harm.

431
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:41,936
Hmm.

432
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,639
- [Groans]
- [Laughing]

433
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:46,181
I hope you can get your money back!

434
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,410
I don't think I can do this.

435
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,147
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

436
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,315
- [Snorting]
- What are you lookin' at?

437
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:57,155
Punch him.
It's how men say hello.

438
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,128
Oh, Yao, you've made a friend.

439
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,665
Good. Slap him on the behind.
They like that.

440
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,997
Whoa-ho-ho!

441
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

442
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,640
- Yao, relax and chant with me.
- [Growling]

443
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,044

- [Gibberish]
- Feel better?

446
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:28,251
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't worth my time.

447
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,350
- Chicken boy.
- [Screaming] Chicken boy?

448
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,691
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!

449
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:35,356
[Growls]

450
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:39,301
Oh. Sorry, Ling.

451
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,837
Hey!

452
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,169
Whoa! You're dead!

453
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:49,839
Oh, there he goes!

454
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,110
- [Clattering]
- [Chicken clucking]

455
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,725

[Men groaning]

457
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,665
[Mulan] Hey, guys.

458
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,999
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

459
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,971
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

460
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,737
and stop Shan-Yu before
he destroys this village.

461
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,108
Excellent strategy, sir.

462
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,377
I do love surprises. [chuckling]

463
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,714
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

464
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,346
When Chi Fu
believes you're ready,

465
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:34,652
you will join us, Captain.

466
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,692
Captain?

467
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,753
[Gasps] This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

468
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,821
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

469
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,764
Number one in his class,

470
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,132
extensive knowledge
of training techniques,

471
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,967
an impressive military lineage.

472
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,803
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

473
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:57,245
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean... [clears throat]

474
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,213
- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.

475
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:03,878
We'll toast China's victory
at the imperial city.

476
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:07,218
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

477
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,418
And I won't leave anything out.

478
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,193
Captain Li Shang.

479
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,324
Hmm. [chuckles]

480
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,233
Leader of China's finest troops.

481
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,602
No. The greatest troops of all time.
[Chuckles]

482

[Moaning]

484
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,981
Most impressive.

485
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:41,854
- [Whinnies]
- Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

486
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:51,196
Good luck, Father.

[Yelling, fighting continue]

489
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,934
Day one.

490
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,672
Soldiers!

491
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,613
[Together] He started it!

492
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,085
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

493
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,185
Sorry. Uh...

494
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:23,096
[clears throat] I mean, uh...
sorry you had to see that.

495
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,135
But you know how it is when
you get those manly urges

496
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:28,170
and you just gotta kill something,

497
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:31,867
[groans] Fix things, cook outdoors...

498
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,638
- What's your name?
- [Stammering]

499
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:39,307
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

500
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:43,716
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name, too.

501
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:46,584
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

502
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,625
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

503
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:52,490
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

504
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,587
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit.

505
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,097
Ha, ha. I kill myself.

506
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,689
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

507
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,359
- No.
- Then what is it?

508
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:01,130
Ping was my best friend growin' up.

509
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,570
- It's Ping.
- Ping?

510
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,733
Of course, Ping did steal my...

511
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,140
Yes, my name is Ping.

512
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,839
Let me see
your conscription notice.

513
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:16,181
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

514
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,244
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.
[Chuckles]

515

[Snorting]

516
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:28,763
I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

517
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,129
[Chuckling]

518
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,533
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

519
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:38,506
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

520
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,564
[Men groan]

521
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,110
And tomorrow, the real work begins.

522
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:45,011
[Growls]

523
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,244
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

524
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,095
[Chirping]

525
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,067

[Ringing]

527
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,832
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty.

528
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,206
- Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
- [Moans]

529
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:20,314
[Mushu] Get your clothes on.
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.

530
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:24,979
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

531
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,614
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

532
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,952
- Am I late?
- No time to talk.

533
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,426
It's your first day of training.
Listen to your teacher and no fightin'.

534
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,963
Play nice, unless one of the other kids
wanna fight.

535
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,056
Then you have to kick
the other kid's butt.

536
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,158
I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

537
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:43,228
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Let's see your war face.

538
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,638
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

539
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,369
Come on! Scare me, girl.

540
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,434
- [Growls]
- Yeah!

541
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:53,004
That's my tough-lookin' warrior.
Get out there and make me proud.

[Muffled shouting]

546
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,186
Wait! You forgot your sword.

547
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,025
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

Order. People, order.

551
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,473
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

552
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,010
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny!

554
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,543
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

555
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,212
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

556
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:34,984
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

557
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,151
- [Men shouting]
- [Li Shang] Soldiers!

558
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,766
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

559
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,693
Anyone who acts otherwise

560
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,762
will answer to me.

561
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,775
Ooh. Tough guy.

562
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:54,935
Yao.

563
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:04,279
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

[Knuckles cracking]

565
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,316
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,

566
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,792
and I'll do it with my shirt on.

567
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,560
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.

568
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,367
This represents discipline,

569
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:27,508
and this represents strength.

570
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:32,105
You need both to reach the arrow.

Ha! They would not last
a minute against the Huns!

693
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,077
They completed their training.

694
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:49,515
Those boys are no more fit
to be soldiers

695
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,382
than you are to be captain.

696
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:53,978
Once the general reads my report,

697
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:56,684
your troops will never see battle.

698
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,748
Oh, no, you don't!

699
00:44:57,826 --> 00:45:00,454

00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,391
Ping! What's wrong?

00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:35,296
[Grunting]

875
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:39,865
He's wounded! Get help!

876
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:42,930
- [Chattering]
- Ping.

877
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:44,999
Hold on.

878
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:46,942
Hold on.

[Whispering]

880
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,739
I can explain.

881
01:00:18,977 --> 01:00:21,445
[Gasping] So it's true!

882
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:23,845
[Mulan] Shang!

883
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:26,748
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

884
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:29,252
- A woman!
- [Gasping]

885
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,381
- [Grunting]
- Treacherous snake!

886
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,857
My name is Mulan.

887
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:38,453
- I did it to save my father.
- High treason!

888
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,555
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

889
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,793
Ultimate dishonor!

890
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:46,531
It was the only way.
Please, believe me.

891
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,836
[Scoffs] Captain?

892
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:56,577
- [Neighing]
- [Gasps]

893
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,116
Restrain him!

894
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,319
- [Together] No!
- You know the law.

895
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:19,069
A life for a life.

896
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,435
My debt is repaid.

897
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:26,834
- Move out!
- But you can't just...

898
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:29,779
I said move out.

899
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,602

[Chirping, chittering]

902
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,675
I was this close.

903
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,984
This close to impressin' the ancestors,

904
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:13,752
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

905
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,352
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.

906
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,166
Hi.

907
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,261
I should never have left home.

908
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,432
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.

909
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:32,602
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors

910
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:36,408
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...

911
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,415
you gotta learn
to let these things go.

912
01:02:38,483 --> 01:02:40,542
[Crying]

913
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,179
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

914
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,246
Maybe what I really wanted

915
01:02:45,323 --> 01:02:48,087
was to prove I could do things right.

916
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,960
So when I looked in the mirror,

917
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,521
I'd see someone worthwhile.

918
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:58,796
But I was wrong.

919
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:02,436
I see nothing.

920
01:03:11,516 --> 01:03:14,542
That's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

921
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:18,020
[Spits] Let me shine this up for ya.

922
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,252
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

923
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:28,794
The truth is, we're both frauds.

924
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,927
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

925
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,733
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

926
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,774
I risked your life to help myself.

927
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:39,709
At least you had good intentions.

928
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:42,906
[Soft chirping]

929
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,541
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

930
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,518
- You lied to me?
- [Chirping]

931
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:50,782
And what are you, a sheep?

932
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,847
- [Grumbles]
- Ah!

933
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:56,018
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

934
01:03:58,029 --> 01:03:59,519
Let's go home.

935
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:02,931
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

936
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:07,028
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

937
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:10,734
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

938
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:15,011
I promise.

- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

951
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:45,701
They popped out of the snow!
Like daisies!

952
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,898

- Shang!
- Mulan?

960
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,223
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

961
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,953
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

962
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:49,656
I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

963
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:51,326
Why should I?

964

- [Whinnying]
- Why else would I come back?

965
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:02,342
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

966
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:14,416

I know they're here. Yah!

- Now where are you going?

968
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:27,397
To find someone
who will believe me.

My children,

Huh? I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

- Mushu.
- You're a girl again, remember?

980
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:33,136
Your Majesty,

981
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:36,833
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

- On the roof!
- Look!

1052
01:14:15,046 --> 01:14:17,014
[Gasping]

1053
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:28,116
It looks like you're out of ideas.

1054
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:32,520
Not quite.

1055
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,895
Ready, Mushu?

1056
01:14:34,966 --> 01:14:38,402
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

1057
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:40,960
[Growling]

1058
01:14:47,512 --> 01:14:50,481
Huh? [gasps]

1059
01:14:50,548 --> 01:14:52,778
[Screams]

1060
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,182
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.

1061
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:08,464
[Grunting]

1062
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:13,933
[Laughing]

1063
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:17,133
- You are a lucky bug.
- [Squeaking]

1064
01:15:19,177 --> 01:15:21,975
[Crowd cheering]

1065
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:26,878
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

1066
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:29,579
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

1067
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:32,020
What a mess!
Stand aside!

1068
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:35,286
That creature's not worth protecting.

1069
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,350
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

1070
01:15:37,428 --> 01:15:40,522
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

1071
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:43,692
That is enough.

1072
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:51,436
Your Majesty, I can explain.

1073
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:03,017
I've heard a great deal about you,
Fa Mulan.

1074
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,379
You stole your father's armor,

1075
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,687
ran away from home,

1076
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,852
impersonated a soldier,

1077
01:16:10,928 --> 01:16:13,294
deceived your commanding officer,

1078
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:17,630
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace...

1079
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:19,465
and...

1080
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:22,665
you have saved us all.

1081
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,040
Ah! Ooh!

1082
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:53,126
[Mushu sniffles]

1083
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:57,573
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

1084
01:16:57,642 --> 01:16:59,542
You have a tissue?

1085
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:05,338
- Chi Fu.
- Your Excellency?

1086
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:08,749
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

1087
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:11,344
Member... what?
[Stammering] But...

1088
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:16,121
There are no council positions open,
Your Majesty.

1089
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:18,991
Very well.
You can have his job.

1090
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,827
What? I... Oh.

1091
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:27,027
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

1092
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:29,834
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

1093
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:32,205
Then... take this,

1094
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:36,906
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

1095
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:39,040
And this,

1096
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:44,520
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

1097
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:49,756
[Emperor chuckles]

1098
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:52,921
Is she allowed to do that?

1099
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,072
[Crying]

1100
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:09,974
Um... you...

1101
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:12,572
You fight good.

1102
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,517
Oh. Thank you.

1103
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,084
[Groans]

1104
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:26,758
Khan, let's go home.

1105
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:30,699
[Crowd cheers]

1106
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:33,960
[Clears throat]

1107
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:37,496
The flower that blooms in adversity

1108
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:41,204
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

1109
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:42,267
Sir?

1110
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:46,305
You don't meet a girl
like that every dynasty.

1111
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:18,809
Mulan!

1112
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:22,614
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

1113
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:26,886
And the crest of the emperor.

1114
01:19:28,225 --> 01:19:31,752
They're gifts,
to honor the Fa family.

1115
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:43,537
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

1116
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:47,275
I've missed you so.

1117
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,574
I've missed you, too, Baba.

1118
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,618
- [Sighs]
- Great. She brings a sword.

1119
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:01,317
If you ask me, she should've
brought home a man.

1120
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:02,381
Excuse me.

1121
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,826
Does Fa Mulan live here?

1122
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:08,629
Thank you.

1123
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,135
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war!

1124
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:17,563
Honorable Fa Zhou, I...
Mulan!

1125
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,940
Uh... you forgot your helmet.

1126
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:24,037
W-well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?

1127
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,775
I mean...

1128
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,182
Would you like to stay for dinner?

1129
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:31,688
[Grandmother] Would you
like to stay forever?

1130
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:33,746
Dinner would be great.

1131
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,856
Come on.
Who did a good job?

1132
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,330
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

1133
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,995
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

1134
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,871
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1135
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,273
Take it, Cri-Kee!

1136
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:00,544
[Whooping]

1137
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:03,746
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

1138
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,652
[Mushu]
Call out for egg rolls!

1139
01:21:10,728 --> 01:21:14,425
- [Yelping]
- Guardians.

1140
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,157
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.

1141
01:21:19,703 --> 01:21:21,796
[Barking]

1142
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:25,308
- [Clucking]
- [Great Ancestor] Mushu!
