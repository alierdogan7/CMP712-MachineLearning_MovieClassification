there'd be a thousand of us. In the
end, he couldn't even manage 30.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,320
Not the most glorious episode
in military history, I'd say.

Do you think
we'll be hanged or shot?

Mind you, in Carrington's case,
it might be neither.

I'm all for hanging. It's quieter.

I thought you'd retired.

102

Oh, not quite the case. Resigned.

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,760

take too kindly to an ex-detective

Let's get straight to the point,
then.

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,840
You want to talk to me about
my client, James Devereaux.

114
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,040
Well, not so much about him as
the unit he belonged to in Germany.

115
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320

That's right.

116
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,560
How much do you know about them?
Not as much as we'd like to.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,360
A meeting with your client
could prove enormously helpful.
How much do you know?

118
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,280
It was just a propaganda exercise,
really, wasn't it?

121
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,920

with Union Jacks, send them off
to fight against the Russians.

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,760
My client was picked up in Dresden,
what was left of it.

123
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,600
For a few months he was missing,
believed dead, then the Russians
handed him over.

124
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,280
I may as well tell you now...

125
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,920
..it's almost certain he'll hang.

126
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,440

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,800

of State for India. (CHUCKLES)
The whole lot of them.

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,880
They're only getting what they
deserve. I think you'd agree.

130
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,560
There are those who think that
a series of trials, treason trials,

131
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,240
could be counterproductive. And
you've been asked to look into it.

132
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,400
Well, I could try
to arrange a meeting,

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,720
but, I should warn you now, it may
be a complete waste of time.

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,640
He refuses to talk to me.
Not a word.

135
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
Perhaps he feels
you've given up on him.

136
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,080
He's given up on himself.
It's almost as if he wants to die.

137
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,680
Well, far be it for me
to stand in the way of the police
or the intelligence services.

138
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll see what I can do.

139
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Thank you.

140
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,760
He...he did join the Nazis,
Mr Foyle.

141
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
He's admitted to it.

142
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
And for what it's worth,

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,960
I'd try to defend him
if he'd let me, but he won't.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,840
There's really nothing more
I can do.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
Right.

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,120
She's upstairs, sir.

147
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,080
Sir.

148
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,440
Ah. She's been strangled, sir,
with a nylon stocking.

149
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,880
I bet you she'd been saving it up
for after the war.

150
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,880
Does she have a name?
Agnes Lyttleton.

151
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,960
She rents the room from
a Mrs Ramsay. She's downstairs.

152
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,480
Who found her?
She did. Mrs Ramsay.

153
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
So, what do you think, sir?

154
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,760
Boyfriend comes home, finds her
canoodling with some Yank?

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,640
It wouldn't be the first time.

156
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,320
I can't believe such a thing
could happen in my home.
I just can't believe it.

157
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
When did you know
something was wrong?

158
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,280
Well, this morning.

159
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,200
She didn't come down for breakfast
and...I thought she'd overslept.

160
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
Were you here last night?

161
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,320
No. I was playing bridge
with some friends.

162
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
I didn't arrive home
until about ten o'clock.

163
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,400
I was here,
in the house last night,

164
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,280
and all the time she was...

165
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
You want some more tea?
No.

166
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
No, thank you.

167
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,040
(Thank you...)

168
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,640
Erm...did she have a job?
Did she work here in Brighton?

169
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,440
Just outside.

170
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,160
White Friars. I'm sure you know it.
The family estate of the Devereaux.

171
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,120
Did she have any friends?
Or any visitors?

172
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,000
She did have a friend. Erm...

173
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,400
Sylvie, I think her name was,
a stablegirl.

174
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,160
And there was a young man, but he
was a prisoner of war in Germany.

175
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,680
He wrote to her regularly, though.
Oh.

176
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
Most of the prisoners of the German
camps have returned home now.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
He hasn't been here?
No.

178
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,560
Miss Lyttleton would have asked me
first. She was that sort of girl.
Very considerate.

179
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Mrs Ramsay...

180
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
What can you tell me about this?

181
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,280
Isn't that the frame
from her...her bedroom?

182
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
It is, yes.

183
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,240
But...the photograph is missing.

184
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you know who the photograph
was of? Did you see it?

185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
It wasn't my habit to enter
her room, but I did glimpse it.

186
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,680
A young man in uniform. I can't
tell you much more than that.

187
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,560
Where do you think it's gone?

188
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
Cor! Quite a place, sir.

189
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,520
It certainly is.
To live somewhere like this,

190
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,600
you wouldn't even know
there's been a war.

191
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,720
Dreadful thing to have happened,
and I'm very sorry to hear it.

192
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,800
Agnes was a very pleasant girl.

193
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,080
I can't imagine
anyone would want to hurt her.

194
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm afraid I can't help you,
Detective Inspector.

195
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,680
I engaged Miss Lyttleton
nine months ago, to help me
with a project I'm working on.

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,400
What is that, sir?
A history of the Devereaux family.

197
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,840
It required a considerable amount
of research. Been here long, sir?

198
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,280
We were given this land
by William the Conqueror.

199
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Miss Lyttleton worked here
for six hours a day.

200
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,360
Excellent shorthand,
very diligent. Apart from that,
I know nothing about her at all.

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,000
What about her family or friends?

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,920
Mr Milner, she was my secretary,
not my confidante.

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,880
And, apart from that, I have
absolutely nothing more to say.

204
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,920
Jane?

205
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,280
Please excuse me, gentlemen.

206
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,320
Detective Inspector!

207
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm very sorry, the way
my husband spoke to you just now.

208
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,480
He didn't mean to be rude,
but you've come
at a very difficult time.

209
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,760
He has a son...
who's in a great deal of trouble.

210
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,720
Please don't ask me to explain,
but you have no idea
how ill it's made him.

211
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,160
And if he spoke off-handedly,
I can only apologise on his behalf.

212
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,120
"HE has a son..." I take it that
he's not your son, Mrs Devereaux?

213
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,400
No. I'm Charles's second wife.

214
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,120
He lost his first wife, Caroline,
almost 20 years ago.

215
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,600
And Agnes Lyttleton?

216
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm afraid I can't tell you much
about her. We hardly spoke.

217
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,960
She was living with
our housekeeper, Mrs Ramsay.

218
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Mrs Ramsay works here?
She used to. She's retired.

219
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,560
Miss Lyttleton had always lived in
Brighton, at least for the last few
years, but her house was bombed.

220
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,120
She needed somewhere to live, so
we recommended her to Mrs Ramsay.

221
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

The name's Foyle.
Did they tell you who I am?

227
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,840
I understand
you were reluctant to see me.
Thank you for agreeing anyway.

Ah, I see.

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,800
Did they tell you why I'm here?

231
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,560
You're a policeman. You want to
know about the British Free Corps.

232
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,520
That's about the strength of it,
yes.

233
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
Do you mind if I sit down?

234
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,360
Erm...what can you tell me?

235
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
I understand why you don't want
to talk. Not a pleasant subject.
But you have agreed to see me.

236
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,000
I've nothing to read.
The people here aren't chatty.
I don't get many visitors.

237
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,240
Right.

238
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,920
No family?

239
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,920
I don't want to see my family.

240
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,840
Why would that be?

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
Listen, there's an understanding
that there are various reasons

242
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
why people are or have become
Nazi sympathisers.

243
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
In the case of members
of the British Free Corps,

244
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,040
it seems important to establish to
what extent that sympathy is genuine

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,040
or to what extent coercion has been
involved. Why did you join?

246
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,400
Are you sorry the Germans lost,
that Hitler's dead?

247
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,760
Did you want them to win?
I don't care who won.

248
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,800
Is that really the case?

249
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
Thousands of people dead.
Everywhere burnt out.

250
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,320

What difference does it make?

252
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,960
Is this Dresden you're talking
about? I understand you were there.

253
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
I was in a lot of places.

254
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
Dunkirk, as well, I gather,

255
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
and...served with distinction,
according to your men.

256
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,360
So it's very difficult
for someone like me to understand

257
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,640
why you'd find yourself
in this position

258
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,920
and why you'd choose
to die in such a useless way.

259
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,760
What makes you think it's useless?

260
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,200
I was told you wanted to ask
about the British Free Corps.

261
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,560
All you've done is
ask questions about me.

262
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't know you.
I don't need to talk to you.

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,760
Did you ask?

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
I shouldn't have thought that was
any of my business. Or yours.

Mr Deakin, forgive me for asking,
are these war injuries?

Yes, they are.

280
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,040
Then I'd understand your difficulty
representing somebody
on these sort of charges.

281
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,960
He did speak to me,
not a great deal, but enough,

282
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,120
and I can tell you that,
whatever else he might be,

283
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,680
he's not a Nazi sympathiser,
nor is he guilty of treason.

And I'd hope to persuade you
not to assume his guilt

285

or, indeed, to abandon him to hang.

a way through this? I'm not sure.

that there's more to the situation
than he's allowing anyone to know.

Why don't you show Deakin
round the garden?

332
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
Er...yes, of course, dear,
whatever you say.

333
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Shall we?

334
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,800
James was never the same after
his mother died. He was only eight.

335
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Maybe that's what this is all about.
She was the only one he confided in.

336
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,440
I loved Caroline
more than anyone in the world.

337
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,840
She was everything to me. But James
was more her son than mine,

338
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,720
and after she died
he...drifted away.

339
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,880
Ever any mention of
or sympathy with...

340
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,680
right-wing causes?
No!

341
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,200
A model student at Eton, and at
Sandhurst. A credit to his regiment.

342
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,440
When he was taken prisoner at
Dunkirk, I thought I'd lost him.

343
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,080
Now I almost wish I had.

344
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,640
We're one of the oldest families in
England, and we have a long history
of service to our country:

345
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,760
my father at the Colonial Office,
my grandfather in Salisbury's
administration.

346
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,840
I was an MP for 30 years.

347
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,240
This unit, the British Free Corps -
They're disgusting!

348
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
Nothing!

349
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,240
What do you think drove James
to join it?

350
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,080
He was a prisoner of war.
He had been for three years.

351
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,640
He was starving.
They offered him an alternative
to a life behind barbed wire.

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
He didn't know what he was doing.
Wouldn't that be his defence?

353
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,480
Of course it's his defence!
He's not using it.

354
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,080
He's ashamed of himself.
Doesn't appear to be the case.

355
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,040
He's destroying me.

356
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,520
This...house, this land,

357
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,720
my name,
all that I've ever stood for,
he'll bring it all crashing down.

358
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,160
Mr Foyle, you told Deakin
you could help us,

359
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,680
but all you've done so far
is ask a lot of questions.

360
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,640
Why exactly are you here?

361
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
Caroline Devereaux...

362
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Sometimes I think
she never left this house.

363
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,240
It's as if she never died.

364
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,560
So...er...

365
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,960
how did it happen exactly?

366
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,520
Oh, it was a horrible accident.

367
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
She was walking over there.

368
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,800
It was late summer.

369
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,680
The deer can be very dangerous
at that time of year.

370
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Nobody knows
why she got so close to them,

371
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,520
but they gored her
with their antlers.

372
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,680
Ah. Hello.

373
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,920
All right?
I think so.

374
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,320
Do come with us. I was going to show
Mr Deakin the hide. I'd love to.

375
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
Come on!
I'm coming!

376
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,400
Slow coach!

377
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
It's got a black beak...

378
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
and...

379
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,280
white patches on its wings.

380
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,760
And what do you think it is?

381
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,880
A...nightingale?

382
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Hm, let me see.

383
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,680
Oh! No, it's a pied flycatcher.

384
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,520
It's come all the way from Africa
to be here.

385
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,480
She had it built
especially for James.

386
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,240
Does anyone use it any more?

387
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,560
Well, he wouldn't go near it
after she died.

388
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,160
(BIRD CALLS)

389
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,640
I hope you don't mind me asking...

390
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
How well do you get on with him?

391
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,920
Well, he was 14
when I married Charles.

392
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,920
He was already at Eton.

393
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,280
But I did what I could.
I tried to be close.

394
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,120
Any sign of any interest in politics,
that sort of thing, at that time?

395
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,320
Not that I know of.

396
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,280
Ah, I think he did want to become
a policeman.

397
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,360
Really?

398
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,560
He was very young.
I don't think he was serious.

399
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
So...what other interests
might he have had?

400
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,480
Er...he used to play the piano.
Ah.

401
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,560
He was actually very good.

402
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,280
But there was this business
with his piano teacher.

403
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,400
A man called...er...

404
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,800
Rothmann or Rothstein or something.

405
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,160
Anyway...erm...

406
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,680
he left under a bit of a cloud.

407
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,000
Mm-hm?
And...er...

408
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,240
James lost interest after that
and stopped.

409
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,720
Who else might I talk to
who knew him as a boy?

410
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,760
There was our old housekeeper,
Mrs Ramsay. Mm-hm?

411
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,520
But there's been this terrible
business. What's that?

412
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,560
A young woman was found murdered
in her house.

413
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,920
Murdered?

414
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,720
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you'd know all about it.

415
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,040
The police were only here
yesterday.

416
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,680
(SIGHS) My husband's secretary.
She was found strangled.

(KEY TURNS, DOOR CLANGS OPEN)

418
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,800
Dinner, Mr Devereaux.

419
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Are you still not talkative?

420
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
Well, let's see
what we've got for you.

421
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Corn-beef hash, beans
and mashed potato.

422

(WARDER CHUCKLES)

423
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
I am sorry.

424
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
That was very clumsy of me.

425
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,520
(CHUCKLES)

426
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,400
Nazi scum! Eat it off the floor.

427
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,920
And you'd better get this cell
cleaned up, or I'll have you up
before the governor.

428
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,000
(KEY TURNS IN LOCK)

429
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,360
Not many people here.

430
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,560
Well, they only called the meeting
yesterday.

431
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Don't you think that's a bit
strange?

432
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
No. Why?

433
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,880
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

434
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,600
Please, take your seats.

435
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,440
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Michael Harrison,

436
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,920
working with Harry Clifton here for
the Hastings Planning Committee.

437
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,600
Never heard of it! What good's it
ever done?

438
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,000
(LAUGHTER)

439
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,160
Ladies and gentlemen, these are the
facts. In the last five years, more
than three million houses

440
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
have been damaged or destroyed.

441
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,600
As a country, we now need to build
750,000 new homes,

442
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,240
7,000 of them here in Hastings.

443
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,000
But it may well be that the
Luftwaffe has done us a favour.

444
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,120
(JEERING)
We can look on this

445
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,040
not as a challenge, but as an
opportunity.

446
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,920
Highcliffe Green.

447
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,640
It's an empty space, even though
it's only minutes away from the
centre of Hastings.

448
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,720
And here it is again.

449
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,760
The hub of a new development zone,

450
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,960
with purpose-built housing,
improved traffic flow,

451
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,400
the sense and simplicity of
concentric rings.

452
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,640
What's he talking about?
A new modern Hastings,

453
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
with a bustling new heart.

454
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,840
But what happens to us? What about
the existing bomb damage?

455
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,000
One at a time, please. May I ask
where you live, sir?

456
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,040
Gladwell Avenue. I congratulate you
on your good fortune.

457

460
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,640
..but will be generously
compensated.

461
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,800
I like the sound of that.

462
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,920
What I'm here to talk to you about,
ladies and gentlemen,

463
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,200
is a new start.

464
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,080
I've looked at these old houses.
Many of them are in a state of
disrepair,

465
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,240
with outmoded plumbing and
electrics.

466
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,720
They're too big and they're
expensive to run.

467
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,560
What I want to say to you is,

468
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,880
welcome to the future.

469
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
(APPLAUSE)

470
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,880
Adam Wainwright. I own the guest
house, Hill House, on Highcliffe
Street.

471
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,240
So you're proposing to buy it, knock
it down, and do what exactly?

472
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Well, Hill House stands on what will
be the main thoroughfare to the new
shopping centre.

473
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,720
And you're going to build that on
the green? That's right.

474
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,320
But the green's always been there.

475
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,000
There is no historical significance
to the green. It's just an empty
space.

476
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,200
But it's common land.

477
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,960
Exactly. Isn't it common land?
Well, yes, it is.

478
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,560
But I don't think there'd be any
great objections...

479
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,280
(UPROAR)
Isn't it protected, though?

480
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,000
I think you're rather overstating
its importance.

481
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,920
People have been grazing their
animals there for centuries.

482
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,720
Let him speak. He's got a point.
How much are you gonna pay us?

483
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,600
(LAUGHTER)
That's the question I'd have asked.

484
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,720
We'll be making valuations in the
weeks to come.

485
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Now you're talking!
Hang on. Are we sure about this?

486
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,640
Why do we need a new development?
Why can't we improve the Hastings
we've already got?

487
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,000
Sit down!
You've had your turn!

488
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,720
There will, of course,
be a full and proper consultation
before any works begin.

489
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,640
(MUTTERING)

490
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,920
Adam, are you all right?

491
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,080
You haven't said anything this past
half hour.

492
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,840
I'm sorry, Sam. Miles away.

493
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,280
We should be celebrating,
shouldn't we?

494
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,600
You get the money, you get shot of
Hill House, you can start again.

495
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,720
I wasn't thinking about Hill House.

496
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,120
I really like Hastings.

497
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,000
I know I haven't been here long,
but...

498
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,760
It's just the arrogance of it all
that gets me, Sam.

499
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,800
I mean, look at this green.

500
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,840
It's been here forever.

501
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,880
When William the Conqueror landed,

502
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,920
he probably stood right here.

503
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,600
Isn't this what we've been fighting
for, for the past six years?

504
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,040
England's green and pleasant land.
Exactly.

505
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,760
I think we've earned the right to
run our own lives,

506
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,640
not be pushed around
by some Nazi in a pinstripe suit.

507
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,840
I mean, this is part of the England
we've been defending.

508
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,000
Jerry couldn't invade us.
They couldn't destroy us.

509
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,240
So why should we let someone like
Harrison achieve what they didn't?

510
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,440
Are you going to start a resistance
movement?

511
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,080
Yes.

512
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,200
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

513
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,040
Well then, count me in.

514
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,880
I'll wave the flag
or the machine gun or whatever.

515
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,240
Perfect.

516
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,280
Back again.

517
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,960
I've brought some books.

518
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,920
Decline and Fall.

519
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840
It seems appropriate.

520
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,000
I like Evelyn Waugh.
So do I.

521
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,160
And it's not too long. I don't think
I should be starting long books.

522
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,920
Thank you. That's very kind of you.
Not at all.

523
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,800
A couple of things have happened
since we last met which may be
of interest to you.

524
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,200
I went to White Friars

525
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
and met your father.

526
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Why did you do that?

527
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,200
What's White Friars got to do with
the British Free Corps?

528
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,440
Oh, it helped to know why you joined.

529
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,640
And you think
my father can tell you?

530
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,840
He had an opinion.
I bet he did.

531
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,560
I also learned that you were very
close to your mother.

532
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,880
I wondered what she'd have made of
all this.

533
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,920
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

534
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,560
goose-stepping your way around
Dresden in an SS uniform

535
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,520
isn't something that I imagine would
have endeared you to her.

536
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,480
I've had enough of this.

537
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
I'd like to go back to my cell,
please.

538
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,800
(KEY TURNS IN LOCK)

539
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,360
Sylvie Johnstone?
Yeah, that's me.

540
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,680
I'm Detective Inspector Milner and
this is Detective Constable Perkins.

541
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,000
I believe you know Agnes Lyttleton?
Yes, I know Agnes.

542
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
Why are you asking?

543
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm afraid you're going to have to
prepare yourself for some bad news.
Agnes is dead.

544
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,680
Perkins. Could you?

545
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,680
Dead?
I'm sorry.

546
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,600
What happened?
She was found at home.

547
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,760
She was living with a Mrs Ramsay.
I know. I went there once.

548
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,240
Agnes was very happy there.

549
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,120
It seems that someone came to the
house when she was on her own and
attacked her.

550
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,360
She was killed in the bedroom.

551
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,520
Oh, Lord.

552
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,000
We have to ask you some questions.
But we can come back, if you prefer.

553
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
I hadn't known her that long.

554
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,120
We met in a pub, got chatting about
horses.

555
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,280
She liked them, too.

556
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,640
I'd moved down from London. I didn't
know anyone. The two of us became
friends.

557
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
Is she really dead?

558
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm afraid so.

559
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,480
I wonder if Jack knows?

560
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
Jack?

561
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
Who's Jack?

562
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,480
Her young man.
She never told me his surname.

563
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Jack.

564
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,680
She was crazy about him.

565
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,120
Photo by the bed,
all that sort of thing.

566
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,560
Did you ever see the photograph?
No.

567
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,840
Look, shall I go and tie this up?

568
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,680
Um...

569
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,760
What else can you tell me about Jack?

570
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Not very much.

571
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,360
She was very secretive about him cos
he was...

572
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,440
You know, he was doing something
hush-hush overseas.

573
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,480
Do you know where? Was it France?
No, in Germany.

574
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,520
She shouldn't have told me that,
but she mentioned it once.
I couldn't believe it.

575
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,960
Jack had a friend. He was coming to
see her.

576
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,160
What friend?
She didn't say.

577
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,160
She just said she'd heard from
someone who had news about Jack.

578
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,360
Of course, she was sick with worry
about him.

579
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,560
But he had news for her
and he was coming down to Brighton
and he'd see her.

580
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,520
That was about a week ago.

581
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,040
And she didn't give you the name of
this friend? She never said, no.

582
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,560
So, what's she called, then?

583
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,080
Who?
The horse.

584
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,680
It's not a mare. It's a stallion.
Can't you tell?

585
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,320
We fought them on the beaches.
We fought them on the fields
and on the hills.

586
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,440
We fought them on the streets.

587
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,720
But what was the point if we were
going to sell those beaches,

588
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,520
those hills and those fields and
those streets?

589
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
Here would be interesting.
Good sense of place.

590
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,880
'We fought them on the streets.'

591
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,280
But what was the point if we were
going to sell those beaches, those
hills and those fields and streets

592
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,200
for the sake of flats and shops we
don't even need?

593
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
I can't talk about the family,
Mr Foyle.

594
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,400
I was with them for many years.
Anything I might have seen, well...

595
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,160
You know, it wasn't my place
to see anything.

596
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,080
I do understand your discretion,
of course.

597
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,360
But we must remember that tomorrow
this boy could be sentenced to hang.

598
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,440
It's a terrible thing, him going
over to the Germans like that.

599
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,560
Was it a surprise?

600
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,360
Of course it was.
He was never like that.

601
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,640
Well, obviously, he was never the
same after the death of his mother.

602
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,360
He adored her. We all did.

603
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,880
A happy family, would you say?

604
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,240
They were a family like any other,
Mr Foyle. They had their ups and
downs.

605
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,640
What can you tell me about the piano
teacher?

606
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh, yes,
that was a bad business, too.

607
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,040
His name was Rothstein.

608
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,240
Simon Rothstein.

609
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,440
He was a Hebrew. He was a good man.
That's what I thought.

610
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,640
He stole some of Lady Devereaux's
jewellery and went to prison.

611
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,240
That was just a few weeks before her
own accident.

612
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,440
You see what I'm saying?

613
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,120
James lost the two people who were
closest to him.

614
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Maybe that's what turned his head.

615
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,960
Thank you.

616
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,600
Sir Charles' secretary was staying
here, isn't that right?

617
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,920
Agnes Lyttleton.
You heard about that? Mmm.

618
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,520
I'm not sure I can live here now.
The house isn't the same any more.

619
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,400
I'd understand that.

620
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,080
You don't suppose...

621
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,120
It couldn't have had anything to do
with Master James, could it?

622
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,840
Of course it's possible.

623
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,600
Because I have something that might
help you.

624
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,760
I er...

625
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,160
I found it when I was going through
her laundry. It fell out of a
pocket.

626
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,360
Now, that is from her young man.
He was a prisoner-of-war in Germany.

627
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,200
And he wrote regularly.

628
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,160
And this is addressed to a hotel in
London.

629
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,840
And that's her handwriting on the
envelope.

630
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,880
So she might have been forwarding it,
perhaps? So it would seem.

631
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,280
Did she ever mention this
Mr Armstrong?

632
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,160
No. And as far as I know, she never
visited London, not while she was
with me.

633
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,720
I was going to pass it on
to the detective who was here.

634
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,760
Well, I could do that for you.
What's his name?

635
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,560
My name's Jack Stanford. Thank you
for agreeing to see me.

636
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,760
You're a friend of James Devereaux?

637
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,920
Yes. You're representing him,
is that right?

638
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,800
I would do, if he let me.

639
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,680
Thank you.

640
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,400
James and I were POWs together.

641
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,440
Where?
Oflag 79. In Brunswick.

642
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,600
That would have been before '43.
I knew him later as well.

643
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,720
The British Free Corps? I'm afraid
you're going to have to forgive me.

644
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,920
I can't fully explain myself.

645
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,360
Indeed, I must ask you
not to mention to anyone
that you've met me.

646
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,240
It's a matter of national security.

647
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,280
How can I help you?
Has he said anything?

648
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,360
I mean, he's on trial for his life.
Has he put forward any defence?

649
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,440
Not at all. He refuses to speak.

650
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,680
Why?

651
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,720
Well, maybe you could tell me.

652
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,200
I knew James very well, for a time.

653
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,240
I never completely understood him.

654
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,400
Actually, I thought he was dead.

655
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,480
I couldn't believe it when he turned
up after Dresden.

656
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
Maybe, in a way, it would be better
if he had died.

657
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,040
Maybe it would.

658
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,360
When does the trial begin?

659
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,120
Tomorrow. The trial's a formality.
He's pleading guilty.

660
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,240
Oh, well,
then there's nothing I can do.

661
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,320
This is from Jack.
Do you know who that is?

662
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,680
Jack was Agnes Lyttleton's young
man.

663
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,440
And I presume the man in the
photograph that had been taken from
her room.

664
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
He was a prisoner of war.

665
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
It was written in February.

666
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,400
It took almost six months to arrive.

667
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,080
Well, not surprising, given the state
of things in Europe.

668
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,640
It doesn't give much away.

669
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,600
Which, I suppose, is what you expect
with German censorship.

670
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,000
He wonders when the war will end.

671
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,320
I imagine there were thousands of
letters like this written every day.

672
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,920
This thing about the weather.

673
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,040
"It's raining dogs and cats." Do we
normally say it like that?

674
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,080
No, it should be "cats and dogs".
He's got it the wrong way round.

675
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,000
Unless he's trying to tell us
something.

676
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,520
And the date?
Is that unusual or am I imagining it?

677
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,240
We'd normally write it...
The other way round.

678
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
10th February, 1945.

679
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,080
Sir, I appreciate you bringing this
to my attention.

680
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,440
I thought I'd take a look at the
hotel this is addressed to. Mind if
I hang onto this?

681
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,640
Of course not.
Thank you.

682
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,520
And if there's anything else I can
do to help...

683
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,400
There is. Simon Rothstein, piano
teacher to the Devereaux.

684
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,880
Arrested for theft a long while ago,
but anything you can turn up
would help.

685
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,800
I'll check the files.

686
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,600
So, what did he want?

687
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,120
You searched the house and the room,
Agnes's room. Yes.

688
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,320
So, why didn't you find the letter?
Which letter?

689
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,200
The letter from Jack,
Agnes' young man.

690
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,880
I never saw any letter.
Exactly, constable.

691
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,760
But if you'd been doing your job
properly, you'd have found it.

692
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,040
So, has he got it? If you mean
DCS Foyle, yes, he's got it.

693
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,240
And he's going to keep it
a while longer.

694
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,680
Mr Foyle is helping us with our
enquiries.

695
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,120
I thought he'd left the police.

696
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,240
Constable...

697
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,160
if you and I are going to work
together,

698
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,160
do you think you could try showing
just a modicum of respect?

699
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,120
Of course, sir.

700
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,800
For you or for him?

701
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,840
We've got the mains drainage coming
down this right flank to that point
and then cutting in.

702
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,200
You're a bit premature, aren't you?

703
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,080
I'm sorry?
Do you remember me?

704
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,160
No. We met at the town hall
the other evening.

705
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,680
Because I opposed your sordid little
scheme, I don't suppose you took a
blind bit of notice?

706
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,440
Keep your hair on. Yeah, I remember
you, you're...

707
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,560
Adam Wainwright.
Gladwell Avenue.

708
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,560
Hill House, Highcliffe Street.

709
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,800
I'm sorry, Mr Wainwright, but the
meeting's over and I'm busy.

710
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,160
Do you know what I despise about
you, Mr Harrison?

711
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,600
It's not that you're changing
Hastings, not that you have a vision
for the future.

712
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
No, what I detest about you
is your high-handed attitude,

713
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,400
this unshakeable belief that you
really know what's best.

714
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,280
We are consulting...
You don't care about this area,

715
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,920
that this piece of land has history
or what it means to the people who
live here.

716
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,560
It's all just money to you.
Eric, ask this man to move on.

717
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,320
No, I will not move on. I live here.

718
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,200
Why don't you move on? Take your
equipment with you!

719
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,520
I'll have the law onto you! That's
council property.

720
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Is this council property?

721
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,920
Someone call a policeman!

722
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,280
That's enough! Stop that!
Get off!

723
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,000
Get off me!

724
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,440
What have you done?

725
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Mr Foyle! What are you doing here?
Sam told me what happened.

726
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,120
Am I in a lot of trouble?

727
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,160
The man, is he...?

728
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,400
Oh, he's all right, as it turns out.

729
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,560
But assaulting a planning committee
member is perhaps not the wisest
thing to be doing.

730
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,600
Are they going to press charges?

731
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,360
No, I persuaded Mr Harrison that a
court case might not be in his best
interests.

732
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,200
So I can go?
You can.

733
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,480
Thank you.

734
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,120
How am I going to face Sam?
Good question.

735
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,280
Do you think she'll forgive me?

736
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't think you've got too much to
worry about.

737
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,720
(BELL TOLLS)

738
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Mr Devereaux.

739
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,080
You remember your KC, Mr Carstairs.
Yes, of course.

740
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,400
Mr Devereaux, let me implore you for
one last time.

741
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,440
When we go upstairs, you will be
tried for high treason

742
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,640
under the Treachery Act of 1940,

743
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,160
as opposed to offences against the
Defence Regulations of the year
before.

744
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,920
There is one critical difference
between them.

745
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,400
If you're found guilty, there can be
no leeway.

746
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,280
The judge can show you no clemency,
do you understand that?

747
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,560
How long will it take?

748
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,160
If you insist on offering no defence,

749
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,880
if you intend to plead guilty,

750
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,000
then the whole thing
may be over very quickly.

751
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,080
The judge will sentence you and that
will be that.

752
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,160
No witnesses?

753
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,320
Not unless you enter a defence.

754
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,160
Is my father there?

755
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,200
I believe he's in the public
gallery.

756
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,800
Well, thanks for your time,
Mr Deakin, Mr Carstairs.

757
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
I just want it to be over with.

758
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,800
I think it's absolutely splendid.

759
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,240
I didn't know you had it in you.
Didn't you?

760
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,440
You're quite right to show them
they're not going to get away
with it.

761
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,480
Don't you agree, sir? There might be
more productive routes.

762
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,240
I must go. The trouble is,
everybody's taken the money.

763
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,280
Because they don't care about the
green.

764
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,880
To them, it's just a patch of grass.
Thank you, Mr West.

765
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,200
Which green are you talking about?
Our green.

766
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,200
This one?
Yes, the very same.

767
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,040
Well, that's not just any old green.
Isn't it?

768
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,280
No, it's not. They were going
to excavate that not so very many
years ago.

769
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,320
Some settlement site or another.

770
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,480
Settlement? How do you know about
that?

771
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,840
School used to dig up all sorts of
stuff there, pottery, that sort of
thing.

772
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,480
Where is it now? No idea.
Could very well still be there.

773
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,400
Where?
The school. St Saviour's.

774
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,640
Thank you.
Not at all. Bye.

775
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,720
St Saviour's.

776
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,680
How appropriate.

777
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,720
All rise.

778
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,320
Detective Chief Superintendent
Foyle.

779
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,080
We met in court rather more times
than either of us might care to
remember.

780
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,720
Now, what is it that brings you here
today?

781
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,160
Well, I hope you can tell me what you
remember about an old case that needs
clearing up.

782
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,360
A man called Rothstein, a piano
teacher.

783
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,800
Piano teacher?
Simon Rothstein.

784
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,080
Piano teacher to the Devereaux.

785
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,880
Oh, yes.

786
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,520
Rothstein.

787
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,480
I remember now - petty theft.

788
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,080
What exactly is your interest
in the case?

789
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,880
Not so much in the case
as the sentence you handed down.

790
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,200
Five years.
With hard labour.

791
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,000
Which led to his death in prison.

792
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,560
Yes, well, I can't comment
on past cases.

793
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,600
It seems the jewellery he was
supposed to have stolen was worth
only about Â£50.

794
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,520
Theft is still theft, Foyle.

795
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,080
I thought you, of all people, would
appreciate that.

796
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,480
Of course. But even so, five years'
hard labour for a first offence seems
unnecessarily harsh.

797
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,080
It was a grave breach of trust.

798
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,120
Here you have a man, a refugee,

799
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,440
welcomed into this country and into
the home of one of our most ancient
and distinguished families...

800
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,080
How many cases would you say you'd
tried over the years?

801
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,720
Thousands.

802
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,600
Do you remember them all in such
detail or is it just this one?

803
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,920
I'm not quite sure I like your tone.

804
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,720
No, I was simply wondering what makes
this one so memorable for you?

805
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,840
I've already told you. I greatly
admired Sir Charles Devereaux.

806
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,800
He was an outstanding MP.

807
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,920
Do you know him?

808
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,040
We may have met.

809
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,960
But I had absolutely no reason not
to try that case.

810
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,080
The evidence was indisputable.

811
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,040
Charles didn't even appear
as a witness.

812
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,400
Charles?

813
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,840
That would be Sir Charles?

814
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,920
It would help, don't you think,
to discount the possibility that...

815
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,880
Charles, in any way, influenced this
hugely disproportionate sentence?

816
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,440
I think you should leave now.

817
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,000
I'll see myself out.

818
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,640
JUDGE: 'James Devereaux,

819
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,960
I have read the depositions and the
exhibits in this case.

820
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,520
I am satisfied you knew what you did.

821
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,520
And you did it intentionally and
deliberately,

822
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,240
in the knowledge that
becoming a member of the so-called
British Free Corps

823
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,760
amounted to high treason.'

824
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,120
But it was a lie. It was all lies.

825
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,280
He stole nothing. Wasn't there
something about a necklace?

826
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,480
You think he would steal
from Lady Devereaux?

827
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,480
He respected her.

828
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,520
He would do anything for her,
and for her son, also.

829
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,520
Rothstein, you must help me!
Run, Lady Devereaux, run!

830
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,560
..this warrior from England.
Die!

831
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,960
What's going on here?

832
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,480
JUDGE: 'James Devereaux,

833
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,520
you come from a noble family,

834
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,280
one that has long given service
to the nation.

835
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,240
But that only casts your
transgressions in a harsher light.

836
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,880
You now stand a self-confessed
traitor to your king and country.

837
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,280
And you have forfeited
your right to live.

838
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,840
'But that was the mistake he made,
you see.'

839
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,920
He got too close to her.

840
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,480
'My son knew too many secrets,
Mr Foyle.'

841
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,560
That is why he had to be
got out of there.

842
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,920
That is why he had
to be locked away.

843
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,920
The sentence from this court is that
you be taken from here

844
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,840
to a place of lawful execution

845
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,400
and hanged from the neck until you
are dead.

846
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
The Lord have mercy on your soul.

847
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,640
Amen.

848
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,960
Take him down.

849
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,960
(JOURNALISTS SHOUT QUESTIONS)
Sir Charles! Sir Charles!

850
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,160
Will there be an appeal?

851
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,360
What have you to say to the press?

852
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,160
Thank you, Mr Carstairs.

853
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,840
I wish I could have done something
more to help.

854
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,600
I can't help feeling there's
something more to all this.

855
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,480
I'm so sorry.

856
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,680
"In his summing-up, the judge said
that he had no alternative

857
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,200
but to pass
the gravest sentence of all.

858
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,520
James Devereaux had been able to
offer no defence

859
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,760
and will now be returned to his cell
to await the hangman."

860
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,840
Afternoon.
Can I help you?

861
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,560
I hope so. Do you have a George
Armstrong staying or working here?

862
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,400
Never heard of him.

863
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,280
Got a letter for him.

864
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,480
No, there's no George Armstrong
here.

865
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,960
Who are you?
The name's Foyle.

866
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,600
I can't help you, I'm afraid.

867
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,200
Right. You've never received anything
like this before? No.

868
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,400
And you're not used as a mail box or
a forwarding address?

869
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,760
We're a hotel, Mr Foyle, that's all.
You can see for yourself.

870
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,800
Thank you very much.

871
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,680
I can take that for you,
if you like.

872
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,000
Why would you wanna do that, Mr...?

873
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,320
Dillon. It's got our address on it.
If someone comes in,
I can hand it over.

874
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,240
Better still, if anyone comes in,
send them to me. I'll hand it over.

875
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,200
This is Dillon. There's something
you need to know.

876
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,600
What's this?
It's a radius.

877
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,800
A radius of what?

878
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,600
A radius is a bone in the forearm,
my dear.

879
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,520
What else did you find,
Miss Longbridge? Oh.

880
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,680
Coins and pottery.

881
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,440
And we've found some lanterns. Some
of them are in very good condition.

882
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,920
And this.

883
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,880
It's very old.

884
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,320
But I've never been able
to discover what it's for.

885
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,320
I don't suppose we can borrow this?
I don't think so.

886
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,480
We'll take very great care of it.
I suppose so.

887
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,320
Thank you. Thank you very much.

888
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,720
I don't suppose you remember a pupil
called Christopher Foyle?

889
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,600
Christopher Foyle?

890
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,440
Yes, Christopher Foyle.

891
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,720
I remember him. Always asking
questions.

892
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,200
I often wondered
what happened to him.

893
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

894
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,640
There were Romans in Hastings.
Somebody must have written about it.

895
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,200
Goodbye!

896
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,240
So, where do we start?
Well, there's the museum.

897
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,000
Or back to the library.
There's that college in Brighton.

898
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,000
(LAUGHS)

899
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,160
Well, I know where I'm going to
start.

900
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,800
The kitchen.

901
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,240
Tea.

902
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,680
Well, it went exactly as I said.

903
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,880
Sentenced to hang.

904
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,800
When is that likely to happen?
The 17th.

905
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,520
Devilish quick. I suppose they want
to get it over with.

906
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,640
So, when are you leaving for
America?

907
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,400
The same day.

908
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,520
Well, you did everything you could.

909
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,880
I wonder.
Look here, Mr Foyle.

910
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,120
Why don't you come clean with me?

911
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,200
I've made some enquiries about you
and, frankly, you've misled me.

912
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,960
You're not even a policeman,
not any more.

913
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,800
What is your interest
in James Devereaux?

914
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,640
Well, in the circumstances, whatever
interest I may or may not have in him
is irrelevant.

915
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,280
In the interests of justice, my
concern is as great as I'd expect
yours to be.

916
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,360
The sentence has been passed in a
court of law. It's over.

917
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,600
There's nothing you can do,
Mr Foyle.

918
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,680
I disagree. It's obviously of no
interest to you.

919
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,680
But it is to me why Sir Charles'
secretary was murdered at the time
all this was happening.

920
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,200
I'd certainly like to know
where Jack is,

921
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,640
the prisoner-of-war who was writing
to her,

922
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,080
and why the Devereaux's piano teacher
was the victim of a miscarriage of
justice and died in prison.

923
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,360
So it seems to me
there's a lot to be done.

924
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,760
Since clearly no-one else is gonna do
it, I will. Excuse me.

925
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,960
Jack?

926
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,360
Er...

927
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,880
I had a young man in the office
named Jack a couple of days ago.

928
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,240
He introduced himself
as a friend of James Devereaux.

929
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,160
They were POWs together in Germany.

930
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,840
And?

931
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,600
He was very mysterious.

932
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,040
Perhaps I shouldn't be telling you
this.

933
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,000
He wanted to help James.

934
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,520
But, at the same time, he wasn't
giving anything away.

935
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,520
I also saw him in court.

936
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,840
Surname?

937
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,960
Stanford.

938
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,800
Thank you.

939
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,160
Mr Foyle?

940
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,080
Yes. I wonder if you could
come with me, sir?

941
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,680
Yes, all right.

942
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,840
Mr Foyle for you, sir.
Ah.

943
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,160
Mr Foyle.

944
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,920
I suppose we ought to apologise
to you, for bringing you here
in this way.

945
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,800
No, not at all, always a pleasure.
Thank you, Walcott.

946
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,120
I expect you're wondering what this
is all about?

947
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,040
Well, intelligence services
communicating with prisoners
overseas, perhaps?

948
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,640
You have a letter of ours.
I wonder if I could have it?

949
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,640
Ah.

950
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,560
Forgive me. You are?
My name is Brenner.

951
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,720
And this is Jack Stanford.

952
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,760
He was with James Devereaux
in Oflag 79 and then in Dresden.

953
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,400
How do you do?

954
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,200
How do you do?

955
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,000
This is not actually
addressed to you.

956
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,400
Even so, it was intended for my
office, Mr Foyle, and it is quite
important.

957
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,440
It's important to the police, since
it turned up as part of a murder
investigation.

958
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,760
So any light you could shed on that
would be appreciated.

959
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,600
I know you've had dealings with us
before, Mr Foyle, so I'm sure I can
rely on your discretion.

960
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,200
I head up a section here within MI9.

961
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,920
We were established in December '41

962
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,240
to teach evasion and escape
techniques to personnel.

963
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,200
That's ordinary officers and
servicemen heading into action.

964
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,800
There were a series of seminars.
Exactly.

965
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,800
Taught them how to make a nuisance
of themselves if they got caught by
the enemy.

966
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,280
And one vital part of the work was
getting information to us behind
Jerry's back.

967
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,000
Via coded letters. POWs would send
letters to family and friends

968
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,320
and they then forwarded them on
to us.

969
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,240
How many agents were there?

970
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,200
Oh, hundreds of them, all over
Europe.

971
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,480
And how did you communicate
with them? We couldn't.

972
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,520
By the end of the war, we weren't
sure how many of them we had or who
they were.

973
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,680
Our office in Southgate took a
direct hit and many of the records
were destroyed.

974
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,040
So we've had to rely on agents like
Stanford here to get in touch
with us.

975
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,120
And you were a member
of the British Free Corps?

976
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,400
Yes, yes,
it seemed like a good idea.

977
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,760
I thought they might amount to
something.

978
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,040
My aim was to spread discord,
undermine morale and keep MI9 aware
of their movements.

979
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,200
Stanford was afforded a remarkable
degree of freedom.

980
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,000
And thanks to him, we received a
great deal of information

981
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,040
about troop movements, bomb damage -
much, much more than that.

982
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,840
What about James Devereaux?

983
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,080
He wasn't like the others, Mr Foyle.

984
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,680
I knew him before the war. We were
at Eton together.

985
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,200
I don't know what he was doing in
the Free Corps

986
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,920
and I'm being completely honest when
I say I feel sorry for him.

987
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,360
Hmm.

988
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,400
Is he a traitor? They all are,
but for different reasons.

989
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,840
My feeling about Devereaux is that
he was out of his depth.

990
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,680
Went missing for a very long time
after Dresden.

991
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,680
What do you think happened to him?

992
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,440
The bombing of Dresden - it's a
dreadful business.

993
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,760
We were in a cafe together when it
started.

994
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,840
We got separated in the street. It
was dark, there was a lot of panic.

995
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,920
I thought he must have been killed.

996
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,320
The city, the next morning, you have
no idea.

997
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,480
So many bodies.

998
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,440
So you knew Agnes Lyttleton?

999
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Yes, yes, she was a friend of mine.
James introduced us.

1000
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,000
As you know, I used her to drop off
my letters.

1001
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,080
Did you know she was dead?

1002
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,360
Yes, yes. I read about it in the
papers. Shocking.

1003
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,800
And were you able to see her after
you got back? No.

1004
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,680
The letter, Mr Foyle.

1005
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,520
Oh, yeah.

1006
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,040
No need to remind you that it's
police evidence.

1007
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,760
Of course.

1008
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,760
We have absolutely no intention
of interfering with any police
investigation.

1009
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,200
Well, clearly no intention of
helping it either.

1010
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,400
Well, I don't see it makes much
difference.

1011
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,880
You're no longer a police officer.
Absolutely right.

1012
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,760
It doesn't stop the rest of them
investigating.

1013
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Then I suggest you leave it to them,
Mr Foyle.

1014
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,680
This really isn't your affair.

1015
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,600
Point taken.

1016
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,200
Mr West.

1017
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,480
Perhaps Mr Foyle was wrong
about the settlement.

1018
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,360
Mr Foyle is never wrong.

1019
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,040
MRS RAMSAY:
So there are three of you now?

1020
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,040
Well, Mr Foyle has kindly agreed to
help us with our investigation.

1021
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,440
I'd have thought you'd have caught
him by this time.

1022
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,120
So, why are you here? I told you
everything I know the last time.

1023
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,920
We wondered what the name Jack
might mean to you?

1024
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,240
Jack?

1025
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,120
Jack Stanford.
She never mentioned him?

1026
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,360
No. But the name did seem to mean
something to you just now.

1027
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,600
I did know a Jack. But that was a
long time ago.

1028
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,440
Go on.

1029
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,640
Sh!

1030
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,120
Mrs Ramsay,

1031
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,120
I don't suppose you've seen a dark,
dangerous-looking adventurer by the
name of Jack Harkaway, have you?

1032
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,640
No, Lady Devereaux. I've just been
cleaning in here.

1033
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,360
Ah!

1034
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,400
Now, I wonder
where he could be hiding?

1035
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,440
Wait a minute.

1036
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,680
I saw that curtain move.

1037
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,400
Have at you!
I have you, Jack Harkaway.

1038
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
My boy, Jack!

1039
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,360
'It's lunch time.
Adventurers must eat.'

1040
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,160
Jack.

1041
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,040
That was her name for him.

1042
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,600
That's what
she always used to call him.

1043
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,200
After the hero in the comic books.

1044
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,040
(KEYS JANGLE)

01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,280
(KEY TURNS IN LOCK)

1046
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,640
Why do you keep agreeing to see me?

1047
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,520
To find out
why you keep coming back.

1048
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,520
Presumably this time it's to say
goodbye?

1049
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,920
Far from it. But I do think it's
time we were honest with each other.

1050
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,960
It's certainly time you were honest
with me.

1051
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,040
Has Agnes been to see you?

1052
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,240
How do you know about her?

1053
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,440
Because I know about you...Jack.

1054
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,000
Has she been?

1055
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,720
No.

1056
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,920
Do you know why?

1057
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,800
I know what you're doing. Not at all
sure why you're doing it.

1058
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,640
But it's a tragedy you haven't been
able to see the consequences.

1059
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,080
And I think it's time you stopped.

1060
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,000
Because she's dead.

1061
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,400
How?

1062
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,320
She was strangled
at an address in Brighton,

1063
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,280
an address
you'd be very familiar with.

1064
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,280
And you know who did it.

1065

(VEHICLE ROARS PAST)

1066
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,600
To be honest, Mr Wainwright, I don't
know why you just can't take the
money like everyone else.

1067
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,440
Because it's not just a matter of
money, Mr Harrison. Isn't it?

1068
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,520
How many names did you manage to get
on that petition of yours?

1069
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,360
We got over 200.
200. (LAUGHS)

1070
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
The petition is irrelevant.

1071
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,760
You're not building on the green
because there's evidence
of a settlement.

1072
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,400
Because you found a few old coins
and broken lanterns?

1073
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,560
We never mentioned anything about
lanterns.

1074
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,360
But I will tell you
that we found this.

1075
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,840
What is that?
The coins are to pay the ferryman.

1076
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,800
The lanterns light the way to Hades.
And this, as Mr Huntsville has
verified, is a tubulus.

1077
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,920
They poured honey and wine through
it to feed the dead.

1078
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,440
Everything points to there being a
major Roman burial site underneath
Highcliffe green, Mr Harrison.

1079
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,240
So no-one's going to let you
anywhere near it.

1080
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,560
Why? Why did you have to get
involved in all that?

1081
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,520
Don't you believe in progress?

1082
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,640
Progress or profit?

1083
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,480
I think I know
which one you believe in.

1084
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,400
Adam, you were magnificent!
Do you think so?

1085
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,800
It's nothing less than a triumph
for democracy.

1086
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,560
Well, common sense.
And Hill House.

1087
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,720
We could have a fete on the green
to celebrate.

1088
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,200
Yes. What do you think?

I don't think so, don't think so.

doing in here?

any moment. It's my hotel!

I'm sorry.
I don't know, Sam.

anyway.

But how? How did this happen?

He decided to speak.

And though there are various
procedures to go through,

1137
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,360
in the light of what he said,
he'll be released very soon.

have to account for your part
in all this.

I don't understand.

1143

How long had you known Agnes?

1144
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,800
I knew her when we were children.

1145
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,560
Her father worked on the estate.
We used to play together.

1146
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,440
And later?

1147
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,080
You wrote to her, from Germany.

1148
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,400
And she helped pass on coded
information

1149
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,760
in the letters to the intelligence
services,

1150
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,560
which you signed "Jack".

01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,960

No.

My mother used to call me Jack.

He joined the British Free Corps to
undermine and to disrupt it

1159
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,280
and used the freedom of movement it
gave him to send reports back to
intelligence here.

1160
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,320
He's a brave young man.

1161
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,280
I knew it.

01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,720
I knew he couldn't have been a
traitor.

1163
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:12,960
Why didn't he say this? Why did it
never come out in the trial?

1164
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,840
Because he wanted to hang,
as a traitor.

1165
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,400
The codes I used
existed in various forms.

1166
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,680
The letter you've mentioned was
written in 56-0, for example.

1167
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,760
Which effectively means you pick out
the fifth and sixth words
of each line.

1168
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,600
And the backward date?
Indicates a concealed code.

1169
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,280
Anyone else in the British Free
Corps know you were doing this?

1170
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,080
Yes, there was.

1171
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,640
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

1172
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,600
James, this is yours, I believe.

1173
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,160
Where did you get that?
Agnes Lyttleton?

1174
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,400
You never mentioned a girl.
Give it to me.

1175
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,000
You take a devil of a time writing
these letters. And all those notes
you make.

1176
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,720
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were working on some
sort of code.

1177
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,240
Are you, James? Actually, that
would explain a lot of things.

1178
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,000
I wondered what you were doing here,
you of all people. Always asking
questions.

1179
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,040
The first of the bunch to undermine
morale.

1180
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,520
Don't worry. I'm not going to tell
anyone. I'm your friend. You can
trust me.

1181
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,120
But you're a sly old bugger,
aren't you?

1182
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,400
He worked it all out for himself.

1183
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,200
I didn't need to say anything.

1184
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,840
Jack Stanford, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Agnes Lyttleton.

1185
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,880
You don't have to say anything,

1186
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,120
but anything you do say may be
taken down and used in evidence
against you.

1187
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,680
Oh.

1188
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,440
Well, that's a bit annoying,
I must say.

1189
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,960
Really thought
I might get away with it.

1190
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,040
End of the war, all the confusion,
lost records, all the rest of it.

1191
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,320
I don't understand.

1192
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,800
The letters that you were receiving
from Germany weren't from Stanford.

1193
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,120
They were from James Devereaux,
using a childhood nickname.

1194
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,280
When Stanford found out that James
had gone missing, presumed dead,
in Dresden,

1195
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,240
he took over his identity
to save his own neck.

1196
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,400
Is this true?
I thought he was dead.

1197
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,240
It was just a coincidence that he
was using my name, so I thought,
why not?

1198
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,960
Give it a shot.

1199
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,680
But what about this girl? Why would
she have to die?

1200
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,840
She was the only one who knew the
letters had been written by James.

1201
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,960
As soon as the trial began,
she would have come forward.

1202
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,280
So he killed her.

1203
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,760
The moment that James was arrested
and brought home, it was a death
sentence for her.

1204
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,200
Stanford couldn't let her talk.

1205
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,160
There was only one thing to do.

1206
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,120
You took the photograph of James
Devereaux with you,

1207
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,240
the one thing that would have still
identified him as her boyfriend

1208
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,560
and the real author of the letters.

1209
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,320
You're a murderer and a traitor.

1210
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,680
Actually, I only joined the British
Free Corps because I was bored
and hungry.

1211
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,400
I'd had three years as a POW.

1212
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,120
I always knew the whole thing would
be a complete lash-up.

1213
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,520
Why do you find this so funny? I was
just thinking about what you said.

1214
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,720
Murderer and a traitor.

1215
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,880
I suppose it's a shame they can't
hang me twice.

1216
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,480
SIR CHARLES: 'So this man Stanford
was the real traitor.'

1217
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,840
But why did my son
let him get away with it?

1218
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,000
Why didn't he speak out?

1219
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,200
Well, at the time, he was unaware
of Stanford's involvement.

1220
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,840
None of this tells us why he put
himself in that position in the
first place.

1221
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,440
I don't understand. Why would he
want to die?

1222
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,040
There are those far more qualified
than myself to explain
this sort of thing.

1223
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,440
But as far as I understand it,
he went missing

1224
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,680
as a result of the severe nervous
collapse he experienced during the
Dresden bombing,

1225
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,120
itself compounded by the suppressed
traumas suffered in his childhood.

1226
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,320
Would we be talking about the death
of his mother?

1227
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,820
Would we?

1228
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,080
'Why was it so very important
for your father to be at the trial

1229
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,120
when you refused to even see
or speak to him before it?

1230
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,800
And why would he believe that you
want to punish him?

1231
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,520
Because it's true.

1232
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,480
He needs to be.

1233
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,120
Punished?

1234
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,360
Because of your mother?

1235
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,600
I knew her.

1236
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,040
I was injured in the first war.

1237
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,840
Not very badly,
but I was young, alone, frightened.

1238
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,760
She was a volunteer nurse.

1239
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,200
Your mother was beautiful.

1240
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,320
I knew her.

1241
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,520
She was married to my father
at the time?

1242
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,960
Yes.

1243
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,000
I can tell you that she was
desperately unhappy

1244
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,920
with the life she was leading,

1245
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,160
at her happiest when he was away.

1246
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,840
But she chose to pursue that life for
the sake of the child she was
carrying.

1247
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,400
Me.

1248
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:26,540
The accident that killed her
was just dreadful.

1249
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,020
I was very unhappy to hear
that she died.

1250
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,900
It wasn't an accident.

1251
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,540
They'd had a terrible argument.

1252
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,260
Something about Simon,
my old piano teacher.

1253
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,140
SIR CHARLES: 'You will not humiliate
me and my family...'

1254
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,300
I was in the hide.

1255
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,860
This is the end of it.
He didn't steal anything.

1256
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,020
You had him sent to prison because
he was my friend,

1257
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,980
because he knew how you treated me.

1258
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:13,100
He's a Jew. He's nothing.
You make me sick, Charles!

1259
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,980
I'm leaving you.
You will not leave me.

1260
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:19,340
How will you stop me? I'll tell
the whole world what sort of man
you are.

1261
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,540
Get out of my way!
You will not do this.

1262
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,460
You will not leave me.
I will stop you. I will!

1263
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,340
(THUDS AND SCREAMING)

1264
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,820
Dear God, Charles.

1265
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,540
You always said you loved her.

1266
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,300
Charles?

1267
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,100
I couldn't let her walk out on me.

1268
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,660
My family doesn't divorce.

1269
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,620
It's never happened.

1270
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,740
So you killed her.

1271
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,820
And James saw it all.

1272
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,340
That poor little boy.

1273
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,220
(DOOR CLOSES)

1274
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,100
This way, sir.

1275
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
Thank you once again, sir.

1276
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,380
Not at all, thank you.

1277
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,860
Well I can't take the credit
for the arrest.

1278
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,740
I don't see why not.

1279
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:49,180
So, this is goodbye.
Yeah, it looks like it.

1280
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,380
You're on your own now.

1281
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,340
He's got me, sir.
Precisely.

1282
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,980
Good luck.

1283
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,740
What will happen to me now?

1284
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,780
Well, I'd say you'll be released.

1285
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,820
It may take a day or two.

1286
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,140
And I'll be away for a while.

1287
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,380
But, as soon as I'm back, if there's
anything I can do to help...

1288
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,820
Thank you, sir.

1289
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,860
CAROLINE DEVEREAUX:
'Christopher, I'm so sorry.

1290
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,740
I can't see you again

1291
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,740
and I want you to promise

1292
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,980
that you'll never, ever try to
contact me again, whatever happens.

1293
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:47,380
Now I have to think about the child,
so I'm going back to Charles.

1294
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,060
There's no other way.
You don't know him.

1295
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,700
Please, for the sake of everything
we've been to one another.

1296
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,500
Please...

1297
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,420
forget me.'

1298
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,580
(SHIP'S HORN)

1299
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:25,900
Thank you. Happy to drive you, sir,
one last time.

1300
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,940
And do let me know when it's going
to happen.

1301
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,820
As soon as possible.

1302
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,900
I'll do my best to get back in time.

1303
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,060
The relatives
are fighting over which church
to have the ceremony in.

1304
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,860
It doesn't help having four vicars
and a bishop in the family.

1305
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,380
And then what?

1306
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:44,540
I'm thinking of getting into
politics. That business over the
green gave me a taste for it.

1307
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,340
We're going to have lots of children
and spoil them all rotten.

1308
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,540
I'm very pleased to hear it.

1309
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,820
Bye.
