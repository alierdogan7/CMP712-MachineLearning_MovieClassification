<i>Previously on "Turn"... </i>

2
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:03,273
<i>What'd you find out?</i>

3
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:06,006
A brigade of Hessian
mercenaries 1,500 strong

4
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:07,717
readies to march to Trenton.

5
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,451
I gotta get this back to Ben right away.

6
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,476
If German mercenaries are in Trenton,

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,702
then the British are surely not.

8
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,019
Now, don't you think General
Washington should want to know that?

9
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:17,668
Marco.

10
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:18,898
Polo.

11
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,317
Marco.

12
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:21,562
Polo.

13
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:24,395
You are a traitor and a spy.

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,840
You believe you should be
commander instead of Washington.

15
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:29,132
And I agree.

16
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,394
Did you arrange to sell Selah Strong's crop

17
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,498
before or after you sought your attainder?

18
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:36,879
All these confiscations achieve
is to create more Selahs,

19
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:38,994
more Ben Tallmadges, prolonging the war.

20
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,297
There is no war without an army,
and Washington's is finished.

21
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,568
- You underestimate them.
- Perhaps I overestimated you.

00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,590
- You going somewhere?
- York City.

105
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:46,157
I feel our business there
shouldn't wait till February.

106
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,291
Sit, have a sherry with me.

107
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,161

108
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,096

of making the city by nightfall.

109
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:57,532
- Nightfall with the hogs?
- No hogs, no wagon, just me.

110
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,334
This is a seller's trip.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
What I need from you is
a letter from Colonel Cook

112
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,708
to get me past the checkpoints.

113
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:09,349
Abraham, no one is conducting
business over the holiday.

114
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,020
Which leaves us with no competition.

115
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,289
See, all the fighting has
stopped for the winter,

116
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:19,893
so Howe's entire army is
bunkered down in the city.

117
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,597
Just think of the demand that this creates.

118
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,465
Now is the time to
renegotiate our contract.

119
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,702
Alas, we've struck a
gentlemen's deal with Cook.

120
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,172
<i>You want me to give you his letter</i>

121
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,441

122
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,277
<i>The army has needs.</i>

123
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,678
The city's population will have tripled.

124
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,921
Why are you so anxious to go to New York?

125
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:47,993
Don't you want to celebrate
Christmas with your family,

126
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,328
with your wife and child?

127
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:53,167
Of course I do, but, uh...

128
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,967
I must provide for them first.

129
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,868
Well, if it's a question of a loan...

130
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:59,136
<i>- No.
- ... to get you through the winter.</i>

131
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:00,738
<i>- I don't want...
- Mary doesn't have to know.</i>

132
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:03,040
I want nothing from you.

133
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:08,874
I had noticed you'd been avoiding me

134
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:11,541
since the fortification of the barracks.

135
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:13,774
"The fortification."

136
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,175
Is that truly what you're calling it?

137
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,144
I call it my duty and I would do it again.

138
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:23,245
Well, good. You still have your
wife's gravestone to tear out.

139
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,484
She would know you didn't mean that.

140
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,954
Just the same as you saying you
want nothing from me is untrue.

141
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,957
You want my pass to the
city and I do not grant it

142
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:49,858
<i>because I know that you
running from your home,</i>

143
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:53,432
from our family, will not bring you peace.

144
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,730
I will be celebrating
Christmas at my house this year,

145
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,597

146
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,432

<i>the attainder against

150
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,162
It is the military provision within it,

151
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,962
this Dunmore Proclamation,

152
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:17,364
that forms the basis of my complaint.

153
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,433
Please do tell us

154
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,803
what fault you find with Lord Dunmore.

155
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,338
Not with the man himself.

156
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,379
It's just...

157
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,750
it's cruel,

158
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:35,519
this business of freeing
slaves of suspected Patriots.

159
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,990
I am sincerely sorry

160
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,060
that you're being punished
for your husband's actions,

161
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,064
but he is a confirmed insurrectionist,
madam, not a suspected one.

162
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,835
These poor souls have never
had to provide for themselves.

163
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,672
And now you give them a mere seven days

164
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,475
to prepare for a life
they have never known.

165
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,412
Were their forefathers
given a chance to prepare

166
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,647
when they were plucked
from the Dark Continent

167
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,651
and introduced to these shores?

168
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:06,025
Sir, I have known some
of them all my life and...

169
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,893
Slavery is a sin,

170
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,926
<i>which is why it has just been
legally abolished in England</i>

171
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,595
and, I expect, soon
throughout the Crown Colonies.

172
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,400
<i>The Dunmore Proclamation will be upheld.</i>

173
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,602
The able men will go to New
York and join the war effort,

174
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:24,105
<i>and as for the women, I've already arranged</i>

175
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,538
a perfect opportunity for your housemaid.

176
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:27,873
It's, uh...

177
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,413
uh, Abigail, is it?

178
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,214
All right.

179
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,291
It was your father's.

180
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,028
He'd have been so proud that you can read.

181
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,432
- It's mine to keep?
- (Laughs)

182
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,868
<i>(door opens)</i>

183
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:59,537
<i>Jordan: Hey.</i>

184
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,205
You hungry, big man?

185
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,905
Eh? You smell that balangu?

186
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,210
You smell that balangu, huh?

187
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,481
You best hurry before the whole thing gone.

188
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,249
Go on.

189
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,024
How often must I tell you
not to push into my place?

190
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:20,326
You only got about seven days
to see what you're missing.

191
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,563
Once New Year come, I
get them papers, I gone.

192
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,098
Then I wish you safe passage.

193
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,305
Maybe you're not ready to
walk free in this world.

194
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,710
(scoffs) 'Cause I won't lay down with you?

195
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:36,178
That's a different kind of walk.

196
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,518
City walk. Eyes forward, not to the ground.

197
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:42,352
Oh, you know that walk?

198
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,818
I was born free.

199
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:47,756
Then walk free with one of your gals.

200
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,794
They ain't important.

201
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,662
Not like you.

202
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,366
<i>Abigail: Why am I so
important all of a sudden?</i>

203
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,339
Well, you can read, can't you?

204
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,282
<i>Jordan: Don't be afraid, Abby.</i>

205
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:06,951
I know your secret since way back.

206
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:15,024
Look, if you treat me right,
maybe I'll stick with ya.

207
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,795
I'll protect you and your boy.

208
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,697
You gonna need a strong man.

209
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:22,863
My son is all I need.

210
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,672
You think you better than me?

211
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,408
- I never said...
- Gals like you, always cold.

212
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,141
But watch.

213
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,476
You gon' end with nothing.

214
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,118
<i>Soldier: Major Rogers has come to wish you</i>

215
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:50,651
<i>a happy Christmastide, sir.</i>

216
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,452
Lieutenant-Colonel
Commandant is his title.

217
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:55,189
He hasn't been Major Rogers

218
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:57,627
since he fought the French
and their native allies.

219
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,829
Ah, so this is where your commander

220
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,998
keeps all his favorite boys.

221
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,432
<i>Not bad, Johnny.</i>

222
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,334
Did you follow me here?

223
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,373
It wasn't hard to track ya.
Us Rangers always get our man.

224
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,777
Oh, so you found that dragoon
you've been hunting at long last?

225
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:14,282
<i>Oh, no, I recall.</i>

226
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,455
You came back from Long
Island empty-handed.

227
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,459
And the bird sings to me that
you came back from New Jersey

228
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,362
<i>with a captured general in tow.</i>

229
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:25,300
I should wish to talk with your prize.

230
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:26,936
Where is he?

231
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,178
The birds tell me your Rangers
have been foraging for purpose,

232
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:38,449
offering to take any task for any sum.

233
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,220
For the Crown.

234
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,187
Just because you lot
plan to slumber all winter

235
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,088
doesn't mean Georgie does.

236
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,858
Have you intelligence to share?

237
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:50,394
I have experience.

238
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,759
Georgie fought alongside me in the wild,

239
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:56,761
not in the dainty fields of
Europe where rules matter.

240
00:13:56,796 --> 00:14:00,429
Still, when the bounties
of his men expire next week,

241
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:03,665
he shall be short precisely one army,

242
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,736
and General Howe will no longer
have use for the hounds of war.

243
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,580
Tell me, Robert, what do you intend to do

244
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:18,016
when this war is officially over?

245
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,752
Return to settle your estate?

246
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:22,489
Your debts?

247
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:29,162
Apologies, sir. Your presence
is requested by General...

248
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:37,174
Oh, I aim to settle all accounts, boy.

249
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:43,681
Frederick, please show my guest out.

250
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,116
<i>Frederick: Yes, sir.</i>

251
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,183
Happy New Year, Major.

252
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,021
To peace!

253
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,662
<i>Major: Tallmadge, on your feet.</i>

254
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,931
Sir.

255
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,767
Muster out and collect your supplies.

256
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,203
Every man gets three days' cooked rations,

257
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,638
40 rounds of ammunition,
fresh flints, and a blanket.

258
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,643
- For what, sir?
- Secret mission, they say.

259
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:12,211
Password challenge is "victory."

260
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,379
And the answer, sir?

261
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,215
"Or death."

262
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,433
- Caleb!
- What?

263
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,200
You know what this is all about?

264
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,403
Me? No. Thought you would.

265
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,743
All they told me is we're
crossing the Delaware.

266
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,344
Great.

267
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,345
They told us just to follow you.

268
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,147
<i>Huh?</i>

269
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:56,153
Well, you're the whaler.

270
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:59,355
As long as we're crossing, he's captain.

271
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,953
That's me.

272
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:05,925
So, you, you, and you grab the push-poles.

273
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,394
Right, push off!

274
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,032
(boat creaking)

275
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:24,013
Caleb: I mean, you ask me,
this is just a glorified scout.

276
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,981
Secret password, "Victory or death."

277
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,183
No, Washington's just trying to make us

278
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,420
feel like we're still in the fight.

279
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:33,926
Caleb, look.

280
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,468
Jesus.

281
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,439
This is no scout.

282
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,987
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,423
I was being silly.

284
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:12,190
No.

285
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,023
Do you like it?

286
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:17,026
It's beautiful.

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,925
It's yours.

288
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,628
- I insist.
- (Laughs) I couldn't...

289
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:26,300
Please, take it.

290
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,108
I know how impossible
this all must be for you.

291
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:38,142
I want you to know that I am here

292
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,376
and I will continue working for
you in this difficult time...

293
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,047
- Abigail...
- ... for whatever you can pay.

294
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,282
We will survive this.

295
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,184
Even when I'm free, we
shall still be friends.

296
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:48,853
You're not going to be free.

297
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:53,489
Major Hewlett is hell-bent
on making a gift of you

298
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:55,624
to a British officer in New York.

299
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:01,128
I am horrified by this decision.

300
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,500
<i>I protested as vigorously as I could.</i>

301
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:09,236
<i>But my possessions and any
say I might have had are gone.</i>

302
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,738
I'm as powerless in this as you.

303
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:14,177
No, your possessions are being taken.

304
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:16,415
You yourself are not.

305
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,386
I don't know what to do.

306
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,054
Tell me what to do.

307
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:25,661
Don't let them do this to me.

308
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:28,999
- I pleaded with them, Abby.
- Plead with them again.

309
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,903
Annie, please. I'm begging you.

310
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,538
If I must go to New York, I will go.

311
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,508
But let my son come with me.

312
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,611
He can work. He can earn his keep.

313
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:43,178
I asked, Abby. I begged.

314
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,048
I'm so sorry.

315
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:52,951
(sobbing)

316
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,060
(whispering) Anna.

317
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,367
Anna!

318
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,311
- Anna, wait! I need to talk to you.
- No!

319
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,317
I need to talk to you.

320
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,914
- (sobbing)
- What's happened?

321
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,984
- They're taking everything.
- What?

322
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:29,786
Everything. (continues sobbing)

323
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:34,089
- Is it the attainder?
- (Sniffles)

324
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:35,590
From my father?

325
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:41,396
Look, we shouldn't waste any more time.

326
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,663
I need you to do something for me.

327
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,598
I need you to hang a black petticoat.

328
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,238
Why?

329
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,438
The British are recalling one
of their most important men,

330
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:54,640
General Cornwallis, back to London.

331
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:58,213
Look, I copied this straight
from Hewlett's correspondence.

332
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,280
We need to get it to Caleb
and then straight on to Ben.

333
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,882
It's too late.

334
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,820
- Listen, Anna...
- It's over.

335
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,396
Washington's finished, everyone says so.

336
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,797
That's why Cornwallis is leaving

337
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,267
and why this intelligence, as you call it,

338
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:16,471
can be gotten in any local gazette.

339
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,972
- Anna.
- Now, go before somebody sees you.

340
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:22,774
Anna, wait.

341
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,046
You once said to me,
"What are you waiting for?"

342
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,049
Well, I'm here.

343
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,184
I'm trying to fight back.
I'm trying to change things.

344
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:31,781
Things have changed, Abe.

345
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:39,791
It's time for me to leave this place.

346
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:43,329
No, you can't go.

347
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:45,364
What's left here for me?

348
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,501
You have a family,

349
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:56,002
a wife and a child.

350
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,573
I have a husband in prison.

351
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:03,639
There's nothing you

352
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,542
or Ben Tallmadge can do about that.

353
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,178
Anna.

354
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,856
What is it you...  you sailors say?

355
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,323
"Fair weather brings cloudy weather"?

356
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,256
Maybe this time it'll be the reverse.

357
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,996
Or maybe the fog will lift
and there'll just be more fog.

358
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,999
We're here.

359
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:32,502
All right, on your feet, men.

360
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,738
<i>Everyone, check your flints.</i>

361
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,945
Move back, you're tipping her.

362
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,380
Watch those arms. Grab that swivel gun!

363
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:43,850
Ben, no! Ben!

364
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,791
Pull him!

365
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,100
All right? Hey, wake up!

366
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:02,169
How's that fire coming on? Come here, you.

367
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:05,672
You're not going on me
like this, you dumb bastard.

368

00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:19,444
See, all you ever done is box the Jesuit.

374
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,947
I'm surprised you're not blind.

375
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:23,949
Now, the man upstairs, He don't take kindly

376
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:26,217
to virgins over the age of 20.

377
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,817
Sees it as a waste of His good works.

- Yeah.</i>

386

You've been out for a few days, my friend.

00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,363
- What?
- The year's over.

388
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,663
Bounties are up.

389
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,570
I doubt too many are keen to reenlist.

390

Where were they headed?

391
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:22,545
Uh, Trenton.

Hey, now, that's on you, not us.

395
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,268
It wasn't my fault. The ox moved the cart.

396
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,208
You don't look like an ox. Clean it up.

Charles?

403
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,566

- In the flesh.

406
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,612

My apologies, I trust that John told
you that I'd be joining you, yes?

409

Ah, Miss Endicott,

410
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:47,195
you are in the presence

411
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:50,596
of a true hero of the Seven Years' War.

412
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,665
The Indians named him "White Devil."

413
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,934
(chuckles)

414
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,769
Boiling water, terrible temper.

415
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,403
- Oh.
- Nah.

416
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,005
It's a pleasure, Miss Endicott.

417
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,277
Major Andre was called
away by Lord Cornwallis.

418
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,714
Yes, that's an unfortunate business.

419
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:09,486
He requested that I ask
the good general here...

420
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,290
- (grunts)
- ... a few questions in his absence.

421
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,625
It's a mere formality. This any good?

422
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,995
Oh, very good. Let me get you a chair.

426
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,683
Oh, just helping Mrs. Woodhull.

(quietly) Where are you going?

430
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,740
I'm going to your father's
for the Feast of the Epiphany.

431
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,844
No, no, we're not.

432
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,647
- Abraham...
- Mary, we spoke about this.

433
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,418
I've spoken to him. We are not going.

434
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:02,257

435
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,196
What?

436
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,231
He has the croup.

Who told you that?

00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,076
Dr. Mabbs.

441
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,380
He was just here.

442
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:21,179
He recommended inhaled steam twice daily

443
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,783
<i>and a warm environment
for the rest of the winter.</i>

444
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,915
Whitehall has a hearth in every
room and excellent servants.

445
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,384
I can keep a fire burning
here night and day.

446
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:32,287
My own brother died of this.

447
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,021
I won't risk our son's life.

448
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,438
Well, you'll have to keep
him bundled, then, all right?

449
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,273
There's a chill out there.

450
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,310
- Come with us.
- I can't.

451
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,213
This is a time to be with family.

00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,282
- Mary, I can't see him.
- I...

453
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:00,419
I know that you're upset with
your father, but think of his pain.

454
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:03,222
He made a terrible sacrifice
for the good of the town.

455
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:05,092
Sacrifice? The man debased himself

456
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,627
in front of God and the entire town.

457
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:08,362
I'm not ready to forgive him that

458
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:10,530
and I'm certainly not
ready to share his table.

I know what you've been
doing with the laundry.

485
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:09,000
You hang petticoats to
summon the Brewster boy.

The one who's fighting for the rebel side.

487
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:15,038

00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:27,726
Nothing matters, actually,

529
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:31,028
when we take the measure of things,
as we're meant to do at the New Year.

530
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:34,267
<i>In fact, let's make a toast.</i>

531
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:36,771
<i>- (liquid pouring)
- To the year ahead.</i>

532
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,338
To 1777.

533
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:41,376
How much have you been drinking?

534
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,012
Mm, just a little bit. Here, have some.

535
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,015
I've come for another reason.

536
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,684
What would that be?

537
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,321
It's about our signal to Caleb.

538
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:55,657
Oh, I see.

539
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,727
Now you wanna hang the
petticoat, is that it?

540
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:00,797
- No.
- Well, good, because I burned the letter.

541
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:03,668
You were right. It's useless.

542
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:06,473
So I don't need your laundry line

543
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,043
or your sermon or your charity.

544
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,446
Shouldn't you be using that

545
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,882
to buy your husband's freedom instead?

546
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,550
Abigail knows about the petticoats.

547
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,421
She saw us meet with Caleb in the barn.

548
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,153
She knows he smuggled out a letter

549
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:26,055
and now she's traveling with
that knowledge to New York.

550
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,157
That is what I came here to tell you.

551
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:31,490
But now I see it was a mistake.

552
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,425
Wait, Anna, Anna.

553
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:37,993
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Let me go.

554
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:39,626
Tell me, what did she
say? Did she mention me?

555
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,127
What does it matter?
Nothing matters, right?

556
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,995
I don't even know who you are anymore.

557
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,966
Look, everything I do puts
me right back on my arse.

558
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,901
I have no idea if my letter got to Ben

559
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,201
or if he got it to Washington

560
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:53,704
or if any of it meant a damn thing.

561
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:56,241
Look, I do want to
strike against the enemy.

562
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,044
That does matter to me.

563
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,749
Everything matters, you know that.

564
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:03,085
You know me, Anna.

565
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:07,889
You always have.

566
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:36,421
Oh, God.

567
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,578
What are you doing here?

568
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:59,145
I live here.

569
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,918
I've had the utmost regard for this family.

570
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:14,052
Beyond the kindness and hospitality,

571
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:16,686
<i>you, Mrs. Woodhull, and little
Thomas always stood as a symbol</i>

572
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:18,687
<i>of what I came here to fight for.</i>

573
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:23,122
I suggest you join your wife and son

574
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,426
at the judge's home for Epiphany.

575
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,331
<i>(door closes)</i>

576
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:45,512
I can't make out the uniforms, can you?

577
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,716
No.

578
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,620
Wait here, I'll see if I can get closer.

579
00:35:49,655 --> 00:35:51,857
<i>(guns cock)</i>

580
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,599
Victory.

581
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,801
Or death.

582
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:06,142
(laughs) You two princesses made it.

583
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:08,778
Yeah. Kneel for your betters, mate.

584
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,746
Glad to see you in one piece.

585
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:12,083
Yeah, you, too.

586
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:14,188
He's the one saved your swivel gun.

587
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:16,590
- Boy, did we use it.
- They never saw us coming.

588
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:19,692
Yeah, surprised those German
bastards right out of their beds.

589
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,333
Come on.

590
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,703
(whispers) Christ on a pony.

591
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:30,107
Hessians.

592
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:31,176
In Trenton.

593
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,346
Woodhull.

594
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,713
(both laughing)

595
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:44,054
Ready for the bad news?
Bloodybacks ain't too happy.

596
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,192
Cornwallis is camped 'cross
that creek with all his boys.

597
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:48,894
Where are the rest of ours?

598
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:52,093
Washington marched them off
an hour ago real quiet-like.

599
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,029
Took some local cut-through to Princeton.

600
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:55,932
Then what the hell are we still doing here?

601
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,601
Look alive, boys.

602
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:08,906
Oh, we're the decoys.

603
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:17,883
General, I recommend we attack now

604
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:20,119
while we still have
the element of surprise.

605
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,025
<i>Cornwallis: Washington's entire
force is stretched along that bank.</i>

606
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,462
To turn his flank in this pitch?

607
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:31,632
Doubtful at best.

608
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:39,010
<i>Andre: It must be two, 3,000 men.</i>

609
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:42,948
- (men shouting)
- (Pots banging)

610
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:59,647
(laughing)

611
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:03,449
<i>Lee: Major Rogers... </i>

612
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:08,121
I'm afraid we must retire for the evening.

613
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,555
Oh, no, no, Charles.

614
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,391
You are going to indulge me one more time.

615
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,526
- (groans)
- Hey.

616
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,462
You see, Miss Endicott,
I'm intrigued by legends...

617
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,598
- yours, mine, Washington's.
- Yes.

618
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,801
We established our reputations

619
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,837
during the Seven Years' War.

620
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,372
Mm-hmm.

621
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,307
But where we were...

622
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:33,439
sharpened by success,

623
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:37,007
George was forged by failure.

624
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,275
Exactly.

625
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,644
George Washington is an abysmal tactician.

626
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:44,547
Always has been.

627
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:48,514
He gets more men killed than
any commander has a right.

628
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,517
At least he isn't a traitor like you.

629
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:00,657
I beg your pardon?

630
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:03,627
See, you gave up your men

631
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:06,028
for 30 pieces of silver.

632
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:07,829
Yeah.

633
00:39:07,864 --> 00:39:10,331
A Connecticut dragoon unit

634
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,666
filled with apple-cheeked young boys

635
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,536
<i>fresh from their mothers' bellies,</i>

636
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,141
fighting for freedom, fighting for you.

637
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:25,377
And you gave them up to John Andre.

638
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:29,514
And Andre fed them to me.

639
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:35,355
And we slaughtered them

640
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,355
like dogs.

641
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:45,891
One of those dragoons got away.

642
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:50,027
You are going to give me his name.

643
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:58,674
Benjamin Tallmadge.
