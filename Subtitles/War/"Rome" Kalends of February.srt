ROME: Season 1 Episode 12
Kalends of February

2
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:37,635
* That is to say, the first of February.

3
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,914
Pullo! Pullo!

4
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,034
It's quite good but...

5
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,300
they are far more handsome
in real life.

6
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,134
What are you doing?

7
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,920
Sorry, sir, sorry, sir.
Just taking your likeness, sir.

8
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,868
Taking my likeness?

9
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,901
What do you mean?
Speak, thief!

10
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:19,194
Sir, Aventine cloth dyers
association

11
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,934
are paying me

12
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,667
to do a mural of you and

13
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:26,001
Lucius Vorenus
in the arena, sir.

14
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:29,467
Explain yourself.
Why would anybody do that?

15
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,467
Why, sir?

16
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:34,267
You're famous, sir.

17
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,267
There's paintings of you
all over.

18
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,901
Not good accurate ones
like I'm gonna do, sir.

19
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,801
- Famous?
- Certainly.

20
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:47,267
- Me?
- The whole city loves you, sir.

21
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,868
You and magistrate Vorenus

22
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,267
are symbols of brotherly love
and redemption.

23
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,800
If you were in Rome today,
I doubt there's a lady in the city

24
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,690
wouldn't open her doors
for the mighty Titus Pullo.

25
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,072
Would you let me go,
please, sir?

26
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,167
Beautiful, hmm?

27
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,167
We own all of it,
as far as the river.

28
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,200
Lovely.

29
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,205
Best get used to it.

30
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,498
Caesar might well exile
me from the city.

31
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,336
Just for saving Pullo?

32
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:19,567
We'll live off the land
like peasants.

33
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:23,214
- He wouldn't be so mean.
- He might do far worse.

34
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,325
- Like what?
- Nothing.

35
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm joking.

36
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,710
I don't suppose
we can lay down a blanket.

37
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:42,667
I shouldn't think so.

38
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,701
Well, if we ever do this again,

39
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,667
I'm not wearing my best.

40
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,534
Too soft, you city girls.

41
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,933
Hush you, I'm down here,
aren't I?

42
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,207
Get on with it
before I die of cold.

43
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,987
How long like this?

44
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:02,537
Till the priest rings his bell.

45
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,834
Juno help me.

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,534
- It's good earth, this.
- It's wet earth.

47
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,534
Dark, loamy, not much clay.

48
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,107
You can grow anything
in soil like this.

49
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,796
Where should we build
the farmhouse?

50
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:20,400
That ridge over there.
Close to the water and wood,

51
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,434
good command of the valley.

52
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,434
In case we get
attacked by Gauls?

53
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,571
You never know.

54
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,367
You're meant to be pretending.

55
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,400
I am.

56
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,434
You're not.

57
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,310
Come to papa.

58
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,413
Bitch.

59
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,901
Well, how was the farm?

60
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:27,267
Clarissa, wait till you see it.
It's beautiful.

61
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,767
It's very fine, I'm sure.

62
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,350
What's wrong?

63
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,642
- You'll never guess.
- We'll never guess.

64
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,868
- Pullo ran away from the hospital.
- What?

65
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,801
Some carters found him lying
half dead by the Appian.

66
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:41,047
- He asked to be brought here.
- Here?

67
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:42,943
He's inside.

68
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,601
Gods beneath us.

69
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,834
He should not have been on his feet,
never mind on a horse.

70
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,167
All his wounds have opened up,
fresh as flowers.

71
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,400
- Poor stupid thing.
- I've given him

72
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,968
henbane to dull the pain
and immobilize him.

73
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,968
If by any chance he lives,

74
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,033
he shouldn't move
on any account

75
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,501
for at least
ten days and nights.

76
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,767
I'll send him back to the country
as soon as he is mobile.

77
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,300
He won't cause any trouble,
not like this.

78
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,200
Like old times.

79
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,917
Pullo.

80
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,734
Pullo?

81
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,467
Lucius Vorenus, sir.

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,443
What are you doing here?

83
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,167
- Where am I?
- Rome, in my house.

84
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:50,434
You should be
in the hospital at Avernum.

85
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,667
And miss all the fun?
Why am I tied up?

86
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,234
What fun is that?

87
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,201
We're famous, aren't we?
Heroes.

88
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,900
Songs, plays,

89
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,401
pictures on walls, eh?

90
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,900
Damn foolish fuss.
What of it?

91
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,600
You are a slow one,
aren't you?

92
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,101
Women.

93
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,167
Women.

94
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,368
They like nothing better
than a man with a big name.

95
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,800
Please, you are lucky
to be breathing.

96
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,250
Even if you
survive your wounds,

97
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:24,278
Caesar will probably
throw you back in the arena,

98
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,291
and me with you.

99
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,862
Do you think he'll do that?

100
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,000
Throw us back in?

101
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:36,634
I'll find out tomorrow.
I've been summoned.

102
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,234
"Women," he says.

103
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,067
If you took
a woman now,

104
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,160
you'd come apart
like an old sack.

105
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,533
Just like old times.

106
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,934
I don't mind.

107
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,967
It's good to hear your father
laughing for a change.

108
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,401
Eirene,

109
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,468
it's good to see you.

110
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,834
Fair enough.

111
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,940
If you can't do it,

112
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,368
that's all right too.

113
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,468
Eirene!

114
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,667
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

115
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,401
Don't lie.
What's that in your hand?

116
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,101
We were just talking.

117
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,892
- Talking?
- Catching up.

118
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:48,948
You fool!

119
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:51,352
What if you killed him?
What then?

120
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,101
Everybody would know
it was you.

121
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,468
A freedwoman who killed
her old master, very nice!

122
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,700
And where would
you go, hmm?

123
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,134
- What would you do with yourself?
- She has a point.

124
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,890
Go to bed.

125
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,338
We'll say no more of this.

126
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,801
She's looking well.

127
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,567
Good night, Pullo.

128
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,034
Juno protect you.

129
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,101
Don't worry.

130
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,934
I can't keep Caesar waiting.

131
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,586
Eirene, when you finish that,
check on Pullo's dressings

132
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,472
and change them if need be.

133
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,859
Me?

134
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,167
You.

135
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,234
And feed him some porridge.

136
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:20,168
Thank you.

137
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,967
As of this day,

138
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,633
the Kalends of February,

139
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,301
our beloved father dictator,

140
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,800
Gaius Julius Caesar, has decreed

141
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,301
that 100 new men* be raised

142
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:45,302
* A "new man" (in Latin "homo novus") is
a person who is the first of his family to
serve in the Roman Senate. Cicero is a
homo novus and is very proud of it but
to become a senator, he has to make the
complete cursus honorum to be a politician,
contrary to the men Caesar wants to raise.

143
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:48,401
To the Senate of the republic.

144
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,020
The third day before Nones*,

145
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:52,021
* That is to say on the 3rd of February.

146
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,567
A public banquet will be held

147
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,834
to celebrate those senators.

148
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,234
Slaves and freedmen
are not eligible.

149
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,967
Any repetition
of recent disorders

150
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:09,034
will be punished with severity.

151
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,468
I shall divert
the river here, you see,

152
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,967
by digging a canal
to the Vatican hills.

153
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:21,934
Splendid.
You shall divert the river.

154
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,710
Splendid and useful,
I have no doubt.

155
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,667
Indeed.
It will prevent flooding and

156
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,867
give easier access
to the Fields of Mars*.

157
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:29,868
* Area out of Rome for some assemblees,
civic meetings with weapons, and where soldiers
can train themselves.

158
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,301
And on the reclaimed land,
I shall build

159
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:35,234
new civic offices for the courts.

160
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,234
I shall also construct

161
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,234
a temple to Venus Birthgiver*.

162
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:39,235
*In Latin, Venus Genitrix, "Venus the Mother",
godess of the love, beauty and fertility.
The Julii revered especially this goddess
that they claimed to be the ancestor of
their family.

163
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:41,234
Another temple...
Excellent.

164
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,533
But if we might
for the moment speak

165
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,334
of this... expansion...
of the Senate?

166
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,368
We might.

167
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,368
Gauls and Celts, old boy.

168
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,850
Long-haired Gauls
and blue-faced Celts.

169
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,600
You're joking, of course.

170
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,368
He is not joking.

171
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,234
Gauls and Celts?
In the Senate?

172
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,900
From the tribes that have
served Rome longest,

173
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:07,834
- the best of their nobility.
- I'm astonished.

174
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,802
Good.

175
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:10,953
Astonishment is my intent.

176
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:14,167
Here comes
the hero of the hour.

177
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,284
What?
No wreath of oak leaves*?

178
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:17,285
* It's an allusion to the "civic wreath"
in metal representing oak leaves. It's
given to a citizen who saves, on the
battlefield, the life of another citizen.

179
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:23,900
Well now, Vorenus,
what am I to do with you?

180
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:27,134
Defying my express orders,
you dared interfere

181
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,367
in a legally sanctioned
execution...

182
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:33,967
An act of gross criminality
and disobedience.

183
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:39,251
I humbly apologize, sir.
I have no excuse.

184
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,468
You present me with a dilemma.

185
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:45,900
By right, I could have you thrown
off the Tarpeian* rock.

186
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:45,901
* Murderers and traitors were flung from
this cliff near the Capitoline hill until
the end of the Republic. Its name comes
from Tarpeia, a Vestal, who, for golden
bracelets, betrayed Rome by opening the
gates to the Sabine army. The Sabine soldiers
crushed her to death with their shields.

187
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,834
But the people, simple souls
that they are,

188
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,501
have made great heroes
out of you and Pullo.

189
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,501
If I were to punish you,

190
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:59,033
the people would be made
extremely angry.

191
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,167
I do not wish to make
the people angry,

192
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,534
ergo*, I cannot punish you.

193
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:03,535
* ergo = therefore

194
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,667
If I cannot punish you,
I must reward you,

195
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,534
else I shall seem weak.

196
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,375
Listen to this now, Cicero.

197
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,667
By popular acclaim,

198
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:16,133
I shall name Lucius Vorenus

199
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,283
a senator of Rome.

200
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,267
Good, eh?

201
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,400
Now you're all astonished.

202
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,920
Vorenus, you look like
you've seen the Gorgon*.

203
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:30,921
* The Gorgons are three sisters, monsters
with golden wings, coper claws and fangs
of boar. Their hair is snakes and they can
turn into stone whoever looks them into
the eyes. The most famous Gorgon is
Medusa.

204
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,667
Excuse me, sir...

205
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,034
I'm stunned.

206
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:35,999
What do you say?

207
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,659
Will you speak for your
people in the Senate?

208
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:42,300
I'd be honored to do so,
if you think me worthy.

209
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,300
There's none worthier.

210
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,467
You shall make
an excellent senator.

211
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:50,867
Very touching.

212
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,634
For the first few weeks,
you will stay close by me.

213
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,444
Learn the drill.

214
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:57,358
Thank you, sir.

215
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Forgive me, but really
I must, as a friend...

216
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,067
I must protest!

217
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,851
A lowly pleb in the Senate?

218
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,801
That's going too far!

219
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,767
No offense to you, Vorenus.

220
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,101
I do not wish to jump
in any arenas, Cicero.

221
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,433
I must please the people
in some other fashion.

222
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,701
Build yet another temple.
Kill someone.

223
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,097
The people are
easy to please.

224
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,185
Not this!

225
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:24,000
I wish the Senate to be made
of the best men in Italy,

226
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,701
not just the riches
old men in Rome.

227
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,033
An intriguing notion.

228
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,167
You'll make a lot of men
very angry

229
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,167
with your Gauls
and your Celts

230
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,200
and your plebs and such.

231
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,688
I'll have to double your guard.

232
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,751
That's what I told him.
Will he listen?

233
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,543
Guards can keep
my enemies away.

234
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,425
They can do nothing
about my friends.

235
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,910
You don't mean me,
do you?

236
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,967
I can assure you
I have no ill intentions.

237
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,967
I know.

238
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,967
Not that you were not
perfectly capable of

239
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:17,134
- any manner of wickedness.
- Thank you.

240
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,234
...but if you were going to betray me,
you would have done it long ago.

241
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:22,967
Don't think I wasn't tempted.

242
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,600
So, no more guards then.
You will trust Fortune.

243
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,268
- Very good. Very pious.
- Stop your grizzling,

244
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,700
you old woman.

245
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,080
Who will dare
raise a hand to me

246
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,533
with the ferocious
Lucius Vorenus at my side?

247
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,990
Clever.

248
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:43,134
All these years together,
and it still surprises you

249
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,386
I can tie my sandals.

250
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,934
Sleep sound, little man.

251
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,834
Your mother and I
have been thinking

252
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,201
About finding you that husband.

253
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,234
A senator's daughter cannot be

254
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,500
running around
unattached.

255
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,300
There's no hurry.

256
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:17,368
Don't worry, we'll find you
a good rich old man

257
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,433
you can wrap
around your little finger.

258
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,400
Beauty like you
can have your pick.

259
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,934
I told you,
I don't want a rich old man.

260
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,396
Of course you do.

261
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,397
Just think of all those

262
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,901
fine dresses and jewels
and slaves you'll have.

263
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:32,167
I don't care about
such trivial things.

264
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:33,851
Trivial?

265
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,700
When I was your age,

266
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,167
I had to eat bones
from the gutter.

267
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,334
Dresses and jewels
are not trivial.

268
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,400
They show others
that your people

269
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,867
are rich and powerful
and that you are

270
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,201
loved and protected
and valued.

271
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,867
But I want to marry
someone I love.

272
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,634
Love doesn't come unbidden,
you have to work for her.

273
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,140
Strange marriage it would be
if you loved him from the start.

274
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,696
That's right.
It takes a while.

275
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,700
Now you be a good virtuous wife,
and love will come.

276
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,368
Your mother and I,
we had our troubles, didn't we?

277
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,015
Look at us now.

278
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,016
Happy as you like.

279
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,500
I suppose.

280
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,567
So...

281
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,634
A good rich old man
it is then.

282
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:41,400
I was about to wake you.

283
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,334
Wherever you were,
you were not enjoying yourself.

284
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,634
It was another
dream of omens.

285
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,567
You're becoming
quite the oracle.

286
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,167
Shall I send
for some willow water?

287
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,867
- You'll sleep better.
- I was in the country.

288
00:20:55,934 --> 00:21:00,176
Please, I have had
such dreams for years.

289
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,034
Bloody rain,
black dogs,

290
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,567
hooded ferrymen...
For years.

291
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:07,767
Here I am,
still alive and well.

292
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,433
I've never had
such dreams before now.

293
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,533
What am I to do?

294
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,767
Should I quit Rome
and hide

295
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,734
because you have
bad dreams?

296
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,433
Why not?

297
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,501
I'm serious.

298
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,934
Are you not weary
of this toil?

299
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,700
I am.
I am extremely weary.

300
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,867
But there is
much more to be done,

301
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,467
I'm afraid.
Much more.

302
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,134
There's always
more to be done.

303
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:50,967
To what end?

304
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,500
What end?

305
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,001
Good question.

306
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,734
I shall ask Posca.

307
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,500
Go to sleep, my dear.

308
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,834
Ancestors of the Junii,

309
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,523
we ask for your blessing

310
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,713
on this man of your blood.

311
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,701
Let his arm be strong.

312
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:29,400
Let his aim be true.

313
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:34,434
Let his heart be filled
with sacred rage.

314
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,096
Good boy.

315
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,300
Hello.

316
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,834
Hello.

317
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,467
Hey, Venus,

318
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,534
I have a question for you.

319
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:02,100
Guess who I am.

320
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,767
Thanks very much.

321
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:27,234
It was nice
to meet you.

322
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
I can manage from here.

323
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:49,300
Wait.

324
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,367
So, where is everybody?

325
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,934
I'm sure I saw that one
selling fish in the forum.

326
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,334
At least he's Roman.

327
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,033
A good Roman fishmonger
is a fine nobleman

328
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
compared to some of these
Belgian and Celts

329
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,901
that call themselves "chiefs"*.

330
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:34,902
* Strangers on the Senate was considered
as an outrage so much that a placard
was posted, telling that there was forbidden
to show the new senators the way to the
Senate. There was also this song:
"Caesar led the Gauls in triumph, led
them to the senate house; then the Gauls
put off their breeches, and put on
the latus clavus." The latus clavus is
the purple border on a senator toga.

331
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,501
There's one over there
with earrings.

332
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:46,334
It's good to see you.

333
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,367
It's the end, eh?

334
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:50,606
The Gauls have invaded.

335
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,434
Well, don't be so glum.
They will return

336
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,901
to their ghastly
mountain hovels soon enough.

337
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:58,701
Caesar will only
summon them back

338
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,133
when he needs their support
for some fresh outrage.

339
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,067
The red man
shadowing Caesar is

340
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,400
The famous Lucius Vorenus,
one assumes.

341
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,934
- Indeed.
- Affectionate, aren't they?

342
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,934
Might be father and son.

343
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,234
Caesar would have
the humble people think so.

344
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,067
He keeps the wretched man
by his side constantly.

345
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:21,434
This beast of the fields
is a senator of Rome!

346
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,133
Do not fret so, Casca.

347
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,047
Timid subjects of king Caesar

348
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,000
must learn to be tolerant, hmm?

349
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
I believe I shall go home

350
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,534
and stupefy myself with wine.

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,034
Good day to you all.

352
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,301
Old fool.

353
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:07,150
He knows, I'm sure of it, he knows.
You saw how he looked at us.

354
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,343
Be calm, Cimber.
If he knew, we would be dead already.

355
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,862
He's playing the blind man.
He's waiting for us to betray ourselves.

356
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,854
- Exactly.
- He's not worried about us!

357
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:16,734
He thinks we are cowards.

358
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,734
Well, in any case,
we must act soon.

359
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:21,607
Today he brings in Gauls
and Celts and low plebs.

360
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,867
Tomorrow it'll be
Belgians or freedmen,

361
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,901
and he won't rest
until he's turned the Senate

362
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:28,068
into a bawdy house!

363
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:33,134
We good noblemen will be
outnumbered by foreign rabble.

364
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,334
We will be degraded,

365
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,731
powerless.

366
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,252
We must act soon.

367
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:40,174
What about bloody
Lucius Vorenus?

368
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:43,100
- Lucius Vorenus is a son of a whore.
- You know him personall, it seems?

369
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,100
I know him.

370
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,200
I know him.

371
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,767
Who is Lucius Vorenus?

372
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,500
You remember, mother,
the low soldier

373
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,801
that jumped into the arena
to save a comrade?

374
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,267
I remember something
of the sort.

375
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:02,240
Well, Caesar's pandered to the mob
and made him a senator.

376
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,285
And when Caesar's in the Senate,

377
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:06,801
the dog never leaves
his master's side.

378
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,167
And a fearsome dog it is.

379
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:10,200
So...

380
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:14,867
if we are to reckon
with Caesar on the Senate floor,

381
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:17,801
we must reckon
with Lucius Vorenus also.

382
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,634
Kill him as well.
What's it matter?

383
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,210
He is a popular man.

384
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:25,734
- So? I'll kill him.
- It is most important

385
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,133
that we keep the people
on our side.

386
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,133
We cannot kill
one of their heroes.

387
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,601
That would sully
the whole business.

388
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,877
Only the tyrant dies.

389
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,489
Kill Caesar in his bed then.

390
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,300
- He doesn't sleep with this man, does he?
- Quintus!

391
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,631
It's not
such a bad thought.

392
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,026
We could...

393
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:44,780
...bribe
some of his slaves.

394
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,318
Buy off his cook.

395
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,190
Buy off his taster.
Poison him.

396
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,701
Gentlemen, this is not
some cheap murder!

397
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:58,334
It is an honorable thing

398
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,068
that we do, and it must
be done honorably.

399
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,867
In daylight.

400
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,133
On the Senate floor.

401
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,233
With our own hand.

402
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,300
With my hand.

403
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,567
You're right, of course.

404
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,115
Forgive me.

405
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,334
That's all very well,

406
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,867
but how?

407
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,400
How?

408
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:51,334
What's wrong?

409
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,430
Are you still awake?

410
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:59,533
You were worrying very loudly.

411
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:11,167
I feel like everything
seems to be moving so fast.

412
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,534
It feels like...

413
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,001
I'm...

414
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:24,434
I'm scared sometimes.

415
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,567
- Lucius Vorenus, was that his name?
- What?

416
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,534
The low soldier
that Caesar made a senator.

417
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,000
Was that his name?

418
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,867
Lucius Vorenus.
Why?

419
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:20,434
I have heard the name before.

420
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:24,467
<i>"My dear friend,</i>

421
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:27,167
<i>I regret I have not seen
you or yours for some time.</i>

422
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,233
<i>Two families as entwined as ours</i>

423
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,233
<i>must not be strangers.</i>

424
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,233
<i>Would it be
convenient for you</i>

425
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,968
<i>to come and
visit me tomorrow?</i>

426
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,001
<i>With great affection, Servilia."</i>

427
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:40,367
How strange.

428
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,367
Is it?

429
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,367
Why would she want to see me?
She hates me.

430
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:48,300
So do I.
It's no bar to friendship.

431
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,300
What is she thinking?

432
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,772
Nothing to your benefit.

433
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,634
- What will you do?
- I shall accept, of course.

434
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,637
- Is that wise?
- Probably not.

435
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,833
Her rage amuses me.

436
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,759
You shall come with me.

437
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:06,729
- Why?
- To be my protector, of course.

438
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:09,194
Who knows what the mad
old turtle will do?

439
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,767
Please don't
speak of her so.

440
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:13,368
Well she is
a mad old turtle.

441
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:17,001
Anyway, I thought you were above
such petty emotions nowadays.

442
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,767
I am.
I try to be.

443
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,267
You still have feelings for her.

444
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:26,700
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- I feel nothing

445
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,234
but pity for her.
And for myself as I was then.

446
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,925
And for you.

447
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,368
Me?

448
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,267
You silly goose.

449
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,633
- Why are you dressed so?
- I'm going to the country...

450
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,867
Just for the day,
to get some fresh air,

451
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,867
stretch my legs.

452
00:32:57,234 --> 00:33:00,991
I was thinking of stopping by
the shrine of sacred Rusina*,

453
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:00,992
* Rusina is a goddess protecting the fields
("rus" means "country" in Latin).

454
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,734
Asking her if she'll forgive me for
all the bad things I've done.

455
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,444
You think she might?

456
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:11,011
Forgive me?

457
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:14,355
Who knows
what the gods will do?

458
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,694
Come along,

459
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,720
if you like.

460
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,600
Senate in session today.

461
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,900
No assemblies in the vicinity.

462
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,633
No gaming.
No prostitution.

463
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,368
May all the gods
bless our sacrosanct father

464
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:35,633
Gaius Julius Caesar.

465
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,700
- Good day, senator.
- Good day.

466
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,533
Sir, sir, a moment
of your time!

467
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,990
Read my petition!

468
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,067
Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar!

469
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:54,067
My dear Atia,

470
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,767
how wonderful to see you.

471
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,767
Wonderful indeed.

472
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,234
And Octavian!

473
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:03,234
You're practically a man!

474
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,167
I like to think so.

475
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,334
And so handsome.
Come in, come in.

476
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,533
It's looking lovely here.

477
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Have you redecorated?

478
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,533
Pull!

479
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,896
Pull!

480
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,596
Pull!

481
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,228
Pull!

482
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,301
Senator Vorenus,

483
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,567
I come about your
grandson, Lucius.

484
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:30,067
...Servilia of the Junii,
and what I tell you now

485
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:31,655
is the truth.

486
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,101
<i>You're alive!</i>

487
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,934
<i>Answer me,
what child is that?</i>

488
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:07,010
Where is Vorenus?

489
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,967
He was with us
a moment ago.

490
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,367
Never mind.

491
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,234
Mark Anthony, why don't you
give us a moment?

492
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,201
You must be wondering why I
invited you here today.

493
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:20,234
I am rather puzzled.

494
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:23,067
Well, it's important to me

495
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,600
that I be the first to tell you

496
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,533
what has happened.

497
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,067
Why?
What has happened?

498
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:32,834
- Trebonius.
- Great Caesar.

499
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
I know, Barca, I know.
I have not forgotten.

500
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,001
If I may, gracious Caesar,

501
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:41,468
you were going to consider
revoking my brother's exile.

502
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,201
I'm still considering it.

503
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,401
Take your hand off me.

504
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:56,167
What are you waiting for?
Now! Now!

505
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:57,667
- Now.
- Now!

506
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:23,267
- Wait!
- Get off me!

507
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,934
Do it.

508
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,934
Stop it!

509
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,368
What's wrong?

510
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:45,301
- Where is he?
- Who?

511
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:47,368
Your son!

512
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,129
Tell me it's not true.

513
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:59,267
Tell me!
Tell me!

514
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:03,234
Tell me!
Tell me!

515
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,301
Tell me.

516
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:15,301
I thought you were dead.

517
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:48,080
Lucius.

518
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,169
Lucius.

519
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,594
Lucius,

520
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,436
the boy is blameless.

521
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:31,101
Thus ever for tyrants.

522
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,767
No!

523
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,435
So you see,
the tyrant is dead,

524
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:43,620
the republic is restored,

525
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,083
and you are alone.

526
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:52,642
Would you like
some honey water?

527
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,087
I won't, thank you.

528
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:00,205
Please don't be afraid.
I won't harm you.

529
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:02,769
Not yet.

530
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,397
Harm?

531
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,453
Why would you wish us harm?

532
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,741
We've always been
great friends.

533
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:11,767
- Politics is for the men, I always...
- Not yet.

534
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:15,050
I will make you suffer slowly.

535
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:17,828
Slowly and deeply,

536
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:19,134
as you made me suffer.

537
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:22,201
First, I want to see you run.

538
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,201
Run for your life.

539
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:26,201
Run to some rathole

540
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:28,834
in Greece or Illyria*,

541
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:28,835
* Illyria is Western Crotia and Slovenia.

542
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,067
Wherever you like.

543
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:35,034
I shall come and find you.

544
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,633
Thank you for the visit.
