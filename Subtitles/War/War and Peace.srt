1
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,860
{y:i}As the 19th century began...

2
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:34,200
{y:i}a darkening shadow
{y:i}moved across the face of Europe.

3
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:38,231
{y:i}This shadow was propelled
{y:i}by the voice of one man--

4
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,038
{y:i}Napoleon Bonaparte.

5
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:44,070
{y:i}Only Russia and England
{y:i}offered impressive resistance.

6
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:48,244
{y:i}Over Russia the weather was clear--
{y:i}the sun was shining.

7
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,787
{y:i}Napoleon was a thousand miles away...

8
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,655
{y:i}and the streets of Moscow
{y:i}were excellent for parades.

9
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,430
Splendid sight. Splendid men.
Eh, Pierre?

10
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,831
- For parades.
- What do you mean by that?

11
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,135
Remember. I've seen
the French marching too.

12
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,368
Don't tell me they march
better than that.

13
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,306
Led by the greatest man in Europe.

14
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,010
Bonaparte?

15
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:58,778
A usurper. A murderer.
A deposer of kings.

16
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,790
A colossus.

17
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,292
A fresh wind.
A cleansing force.

18
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,553
What does your father say when
he hears you say things like that?

19
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:10,601
We don't talk about things
like that, my father and I.

20
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,360
How is he?

21
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,873
The doctors say
he will die at any moment.

22
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,704
Have you been to see him?

23
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,171
I'm waiting to be asked.

24
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:24,442
In heaven all things
will be arranged.

25
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,749
I believe that's the rumor.

26
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,152
Remember, Pierre, this is your home
when you want it to be...

27
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:34,282
and the Rostovs are your family
when you want them to be.

28
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,229
I smoke too much.

29
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:47,302
Isn't it lovely? How can you bear
not to go with them?

30
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,999
I can bear it.

31
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:51,871
If I were a man,
I'd be down there...

32
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:55,879
riding a terrible black horse,
waving a sword.

33
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,409
It's so unfair.

34
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,422
Men are the only people
permitted to have any fun.

35
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,608
What is it, Natasha?

36
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,509
All those handsome young men
marching away to fiight...

37
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,045
to be killed.

38
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,607
Don't be frightened.
Come on.

39
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,312
Nicholas!

40
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,185
Well, what's this?

41
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,486
You look so dazzling
in your uniform.

42
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,119
And you're going so far away.

43
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,958
Austria is miles.

44
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,521
I looked it up... on the map.

45
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,897
That brute Napoleon.

46
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,300
The Austrians make
the most beautiful bracelets.

47
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,668
- I'll bring you back one.
- Nicholas, two.

48
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,175
- They're wearing them in pairs.
- Two.

49
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:36,373
Pierre, you remember our cousin Sonya?
She's come to stay with us.

50
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:40,076
Of course, although she was considerably
younger the last time I saw her.

51
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,882
Girls grow up, Pierre,
very fast.

52
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,855
Doesn't he look glorious?

53
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:49,586
Who would've thought Mama and Papa
would have had such handsome children?

54
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,594
Mother, did you hear that?

55
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,028
Now attention.

56
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,827
Ensign Count Nicholas Rostov...

57
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,494
I decorate you
with the order of...

58
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,003
absolutely everything.

59
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,109
I don't think you ought to laugh at her
when she makes jokes about the army.

60
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:10,375
Oh, well, Petya, women--
you have to humor them a little.

61
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:14,248
You do look shiny, Nicholas.
If only I was old enough.

62
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,980
- That'll come, Petya.
- Not in time.

63
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:20,217
By the time I'm old enough, there won't
be a Frenchman left to be killed.

64
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,522
Don't worry, Petya. There will
always be plenty of Frenchmen.

65
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,084
Good luck.

66
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,858
With your views on war,
that's very civil of you.

67
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:30,457
But seriously, Pierre,
why don't you take a commission?

68
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:34,938
It's so easy for men. All you have to do
is decide to do something. Then do it.

69
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:38,339
If you were a man
what would you decide to do?

70
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,900
I'd decide to become
enormously powerful.

71
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,139
I'd become the czar's
most trusted minister...

72
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:45,478
and he wouldn't dare make a move
without consulting me.

73
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,348
And you would sit at my right hand
and judge the nations.

74
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,684
Whenever anything was complicated
or an injustice was being done...

75
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,850
the case would be laid before you
and your word would be law.

76
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,450
Why me?

77
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,986
Because your heart is pure
and you're good.

78
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,763
Well done, my dear.
Well done.

79
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:07,395
On that note,
I think I should leave.

80
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,770
What about if you did have
that power, what would you do?

81
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,274
I?

82
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,412
I would hesitate.

83
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,243
Now I really must go.

84
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,750
Come again soon.

85
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,514
I'll walk you to the door,
my Lord Hesitator.

86
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,523
- Good-bye, Pierre.
- Come soon again.

87
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,784
You will come again soon,
won't you?

88
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:32,761
Mama and Papa don't show it, but they're
gonna be lonely when Nicholas is gone.

89
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,890
- And they do love seeing you.
- Yes, of course I'll come.

90
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,060
I love this house
and the whole family.

91
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,933
The whole family?
That's not as simple as you think.

92
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,934
What do you mean by that?

93
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,943
Oh, there are currents
and countercurrents.

94
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,746
Now, where are you going?
To Dolokhov's rooms?

95
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,816
As a matter of fact I am.
How did you know?

96
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,223
I hear things, I hear things.

97
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:10,000
Go. Go to your night of disgusting
and fascinating debauchery.

98
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,084
Careful. There's a bet on here.

99
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,143
Go on. Bring me
a bottle of rum.

100
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,883
And you two, break this up.

101
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,425
Now, let's get this straight.

102
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,122
Fifty imperials
against Prince Anatole Kuragin...

103
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:49,324
that I will drink a bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth.

104
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,565
balancing on the outside ledge and not
touching the sides of the windows.

105
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,663
Want to make it a hundred, Anatole?

106
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,174
Fifty's enough for you to lose.

107
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,803
Here. Get down from there,
you weaklings.

108
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,744
Calculus, come on.

109
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:05,748
- Come on.
- You do it.

110
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,681
Hail Moscow!

111
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,944
Give me that.

112
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,919
Don't be crazy, Dolokhov.
You'll be killed.

113
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:48,917
If you touch me again
I will throw you down there...

114
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,552
and that goes for everyone
of you here.

115
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,222
Play, play!
What are we paying you for?

116
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,861
Now then, my friends.

117
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:04,738
Remember, without taking
the bottle from your lips, huh?

118
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,824
Fifty imperials, Anatole.

119
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:57,656
And it's double for anyone else
who will do it.

120
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,896
I'll do it for nothing--
without a bet.

121
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,338
You get dizzy walking up
a flight of steps.

122
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,998
Get out of my way.

123
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,416
Give me a bottle.

124
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,129
-Get down from there.
-Can't take the bottle from your mouth--

125
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:36,359
- Get down from there, Pierre.
- No, let him do it.

126
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:40,032
Your father's calling for you.

127
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,302
Excuse me, gentlemen.

128
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,707
I suggest a little
cold water fiirst.

129
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,375
I'll wait for you.

130
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:53,973
Prince Andre.

131
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,417
Is the old boy
really dying this time?

132
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,978
The doctors are fairly certain
Count Bezukhov won't last the night.

133
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,086
Are my father and sister there?

134
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,959
Your father was there and
the Princess Helene was expected.

135
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,932
That's good. I don't have to go.
The family's well represented.

136
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,209
Careful, careful.

137
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,342
- You disapprove of me?
- Well--

138
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,846
Of course you do.

139
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:27,008
You'd be wrong if you didn't.

140
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,917
Arriving at the deathbed
of my father bleary-eyed...

141
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,649
stinking of alcohol.

142
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:35,988
He disapproves, too, my father.

143
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,890
Well, that's fair enough.

144
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,158
I disapprove of many things
about him.

145
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:45,133
Chiefly, I disapprove of the fact
that he didn't marry my mother.

146
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:48,467
Perhaps if I was legitimate--

147
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,708
I have sinned, Lord, but I have
several excellent excuses.

148
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,847
With all that, Andre,
you still disapprove?

149
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,746
You're not being worthy
of yourself, Pierre.

150
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,218
You're not living up to
the best things in yourself.

151
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,423
You must be somebody.

152
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,754
That's where the puzzle begins.
Be somebody. Be what?

153
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:13,456
Who am I?
Am I the next Count Bezukhov...

154
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,328
lord of vast estates
and the fiixed positions...

155
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,834
fiixed responsibilities?

156
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,369
Not quite.

157
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:24,464
My father cannot quite acknowledge
that I am his son...

158
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,773
but he cannot quite acknowledge
that I am not his son.

159
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,542
That makes everybody uncomfortable,
including myself.

160
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:34,106
Well, you must aim at something,
fiind a beginning.

161
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,642
Oh, you're right.
Don't think I don't agree with you.

162
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:41,213
Each morning I wake up,
I'm disgusted with myself...

163
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,124
with what I did the night before.

164
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,925
I tell myself today...
a change.

165
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:49,989
If my headache is bad enough,
I say...

166
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,901
''Pierre, today you must
take steps to become a saint.''

167
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:58,731
I say, I'll drop in at the club
and watch the card playing.

168
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,868
just order a glass of water...

169
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:05,381
to prove to myself how marvelously
I resist temptation.

170
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,883
Then someone comes along
and says...

171
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:09,885
''Just one vodka, Pierre.''

172
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:14,947
Next morning my headache is worse,
my pockets are emptier.

173
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,220
There must be something
you wanna do.

174
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,353
Of course.
I wanna discover.

175
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,795
- Discover what?
- Everything.

176
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:25,699
I want to discover why I know what's
right and still do what's wrong.

177
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:29,905
I wanna discover what happiness is...

178
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,441
and what value there is
in suffering.

179
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,740
I wanna discover
why men go to war...

180
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,212
and what they really say...

181
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:41,046
deep in their hearts
when they pray to God.

182
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,283
I wanna discover what it is that men
and women feel when they say they love.

183
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,285
You see, there's enough
to keep me busy.

184
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,065
It's hard for you to understand
someone like me.

185
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,499
Everything is so clear for you.

186
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,503
You always know exactly what
you must do and you do it.

187
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:03,903
- Exactly.
- You're different from me.

188
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,908
You study, you become enlightened.

189
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:09,309
I study, I become confused.

190
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,473
You love, you marry.
You believe, you act.

191
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,278
There's a war, you serve.

192
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,479
How wonderful it would be if
I really answered to your description.

193
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:20,955
- You do, I tell you.
- Shall I show you how wrong you are?

194
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,889
I know you. I'm not wrong.

195
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,690
Do you know why
I'm going to the war?

196
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:28,629
You think it's because I think
that Napoleon is a monster?

197
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,463
You think I believe that we have any
business fiighting Austria's battles...

198
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,435
2,000 miles from home?

199
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:37,303
You think that I think Russia will be
a greater nation when this war is over?

200
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:38,864
Then why are you going?

201
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,206
Because I'm married to one of
the most loving and honorable...

202
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:44,042
and attractive women in Moscow...

203
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,048
and I can't stand it.

204
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,218
Never, never marry, Pierre.

205
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:52,687
Or if you must marry, marry when
you're old and good for nothing.

206
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,953
Or else everything that is fiine
and noble in you will be lost.

207
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,995
You'll waste yourself on trifles.

208
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:02,361
Yes, yes, don't look at me
like that.

209
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,900
You talk of Bonaparte
and his career.

210
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,061
If Bonaparte had married
when he was young...

211
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,469
he'd still be a half-pay captain
in Marseilles...

212
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,064
going to dinner parties
and carrying his wife's handbag...

213
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:14,576
and inviting idiots to his house
because his wife...

214
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,908
wanted to be invited
to their houses.

215
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,641
Prince Andre.

216
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,077
Princess Helene.

217
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,581
Didn't you tell my brother
that he was expected here?

218
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,743
- I did.
- Isn't he coming?

219
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,411
I believe not.

220
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,221
Thank you.

221
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,100
How is he, Prince Vasili?

222
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,438
His confessor is with him.

223
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,978
They are giving him
extreme unction.

224
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,081
He was asking for you.

225
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,644
I hope you are in a proper condition
to see him at this time.

226
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:08,288
Follow me.

227
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:11,691
Go ahead.
I'll wait for you here.

228
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,074
If you please, Monsieur Pierre.

229
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,748
He wishes you to kiss him good-bye.

230
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,821
This is for you.

231
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:56,727
Now he would like to sleep.

232
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,385
So late. Finally
at the end he loved me.

233
00:22:27,464 --> 00:22:28,897
So late.

234
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,592
He gave me this.

235
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,204
This letter is for the czar...

236
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,472
and this one for you, Pierre.

237
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:43,978
Open it.

238
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,551
Your father wishes you to know
that in the letter to the czar...

239
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,357
he begs that you be legitimately
acknowledged as his son...

240
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,557
and the next Count Bezukhov...

241
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,863
the sole heir to all his estates.

242
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:19,347
Be worthy, my boy.

243
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,681
Be worthy of your great father.

244
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:24,686
How often we sin...

245
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:27,382
how much we deceive,
and for what?

246
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:29,891
All ends in death.

247
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,359
Kiss your cousin Helene.

248
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:35,765
He has been reborn.
Embrace him.

249
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:37,958
Wish him well.

250
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,325
It's a good thing
we're going back to Moscow.

251
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:09,525
After three weeks in the country
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

252
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,003
Still, it was a profiitable trip,
wasn't it, Pierre?

253
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:19,002
Very profiitable.

254
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,792
I'll see how long we have to wait.
It shouldn't be too long.

255
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:50,635
There's no hurry. It'll give Papa
a few extra winks of sleep.

256
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,949
- Where are you going, to your father's?
- Yes.

257
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:10,618
What have you been up to?
Tell me all the news. Are you alone?

258
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:15,153
No. Prince Vasili is with me
and his daughter too.

259
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,165
We've made a tour of inspection
of my estates.

260
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:21,329
I've never been there before.
It's huge. So backward.

261
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:24,737
And now that I'm Count Bezukhov,
I feel I must do something about it.

262
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:27,901
I see. That's why you went
with Prince Vasili and Helene.

263
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:31,037
Well, Prince Vasili helps me
with the administration.

264
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,445
Of course.

265
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:34,574
Come say hello to Lise.
It will give her pleasure.

266
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:37,677
She's miserable at the idea
of being stuck away in the country.

267
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:39,688
Helene is different.
She loves the country.

268
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:42,384
- It was her idea to come along.
- I'm sure.

269
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:47,624
- Children, go away.
- How long do you expect to stay here?

270
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:51,133
Forever. Months
and months and months.

271
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,498
Until after the baby's born.

272
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,127
No, thank you.

273
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,434
You know Andre's leaving tomorrow?

274
00:25:57,507 --> 00:26:00,169
He thought it would be better for me
to be here with his father and sister...

275
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,835
than alone in Moscow.

276
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:04,106
And how do you feel about it?

277
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,114
I dread it.

278
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:09,640
And even so, you consented
to bury yourself down here?

279
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:12,586
Andre wants me to.
What else is there to do?

280
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:16,386
I assure you, if it were I,
I would fiind something else to do.

281
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,826
I suppose so, but
we're very different, you and I.

282
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,523
Yes, indeed we are.

283
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:24,327
Have you asked her
to marry you yet?

284
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,330
Are you going to?

285
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:30,163
I don't know yet.

286
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,471
- Do you want some advice?
- On any subject, Andre.

287
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,273
Not on this.

288
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:38,780
All right.

289
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,761
We thought you would never come.

290
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,998
- Oh, Lise, you look so beautiful.
- You too, Mary.

291
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,801
No, I'm just a little
country mouse.

292
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,071
Andre, it isn't true what you wrote
in your letter...

293
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,078
that you're only staying
overnight?

294
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:13,912
- I'm afraid it is.
- Lise, talk to him.

295
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:16,178
- Make him stay.
- I've tried.

296
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:19,813
Mary, Lise's very tired.
I think she'd better get some rest.

297
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,357
- Yes?
- Excellency, your father heard you.

298
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,393
He would like you
to present yourself immediately.

299
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,486
Thank you. No, you'd better
go upstairs, Lise.

300
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,929
You'll see him at dinner.

301
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,432
Come.

302
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:40,542
Here is the warrior.

303
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,170
Here's the Bolkonsky
who's going to beat Napoleon.

304
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,573
How are you, my boy?
How are you?

305
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,982
I'm well, Father.
How is your health?

306
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:55,683
Oh, the same, boy. The same.
Only fools fall ill.

307
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,226
You know me, busy from
morning till night.

308
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,889
Little to eat, less to drink.
So of course I'm well.

309
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:03,158
Thank God.

310
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:05,792
God has nothing to do with it.

311
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:16,368
just a moment, Andre, please.

312
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,209
- Don't refuse.
- What is it?

313
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,916
Father's father used to take it
along with him... in all his wars.

314
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:28,620
If it's not too heavy
and won't break my neck.

315
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:33,594
Andre, promise that
you'll never take it off.

316
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:36,097
- Promise?
- Yes.

317
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:43,329
Kiss me here.

318
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:55,343
Thank you, my boy. Thank you.

319
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,909
Why do you thank me, Father?

320
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,887
For doing your duty.

321
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:03,357
For not allowing yourself to be tied
to a woman's apron strings.

322
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,762
The army before everything.
Thank you. Thank you.

323
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:14,194
About my wife, Father.

324
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,862
Your wife?

325
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,462
Well, go on, speak.

326
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,907
When her confiinement is due,
send to Moscow for a doctor.

327
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:22,535
A doctor?

328
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:25,012
I know that if nature won't
do its work, no one can.

329
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,549
But they've been
telling her things and...

330
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,209
she's had a dream.

331
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,515
She's frightened.

332
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,179
All right, all right.

333
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:36,191
Give this to Michael Kutuzov.

334
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,655
We were at school together.

335
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:42,425
He wasn't exactly a bright lad,
but never mind.

336
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,834
I've written to him to tell him
to keep you away from headquarters.

337
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,838
They're bad places.

338
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,334
Tell him I remember him
and I admire him.

339
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,344
Now good-bye.

340
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,979
Remember this, Prince Andre.

341
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,753
If they kill you,
it will hurt me, your old father.

342
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,688
But if I hear that you've not behaved
like a son of Nicholas Bolkonsky...

343
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:15,628
it will be worse.

344
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,223
I shall be shamed.

345
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:22,127
You needn't have said that
to me, Father.

346
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:23,967
I--

347
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,736
I also wanted to ask you...

348
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,243
if I am killed
and I have a son...

349
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,878
don't let him be taken
away from you.

350
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:36,550
Let him grow up... here...

351
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,914
with you, please.

352
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:49,198
Well, what are you waiting for?
We've said good-bye. Go, go.

353
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,510
You're leaving already.
Don't go. Don't leave me here.

354
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:06,047
I won't be able to stand it.
I'll be so lonely.

355
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,175
I leave you in my family's house,
with my father, with Mary.

356
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,811
Stay until tomorrow.
Stay another day, please, I beg you.

357
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:13,821
I can't, Lise.
You know that.

358
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:18,793
You're delighted to go.
You're delighted to get rid of me.

359
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,037
Good-bye, Mary.

360
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,818
Ketya, go and get
some smelling salts.

361
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:58,233
Would you please tell your horse
to stop shaking his head?

362
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,961
I'll never get it this way.

363
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:04,097
You heard the lady.
Stop shaking your head.

364
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,907
You see, animals are much more
reasonable than people.

365
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,252
Mademoiselle, I wonder if I might
offer you a million rubles...

366
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,516
to paint my portrait.

367
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:26,326
On one condition. You must make me
look at least as good as the horse.

368
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:32,030
It's not fair to look at it
before it's fiinished.

369
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,864
Very unpromising, isn't it?

370
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,631
Yes, it is.

371
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,765
You needn't be in such
a hurry to agree.

372
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,332
Anyways, it's not meant
to be a work of art.

373
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,471
Papa bought the colt to give to Nicholas
when he comes back from the war.

374
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,483
And I'm gonna send him the picture
to show him what it's like.

375
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,109
Have you fiinished?

376
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:51,983
For the moment.

377
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:58,685
Charge! Come on!
Hurry! Come on!

378
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,122
Come on!

379
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:08,766
- Have you heard from Nicholas?
- Mama and Papa received a letter.

380
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,772
He hasn't written me or Sonya.

381
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,673
Men forget about women immediately
when they go to war, don't they?

382
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,438
Men don't. Boys do.

383
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:18,344
Nicholas would be furious
if he heard you call him a boy.

384
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,439
He'd probably challenge you
to a duel.

385
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:22,814
That's better a reason than most
for fiighting a duel.

386
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:25,820
Actually, the only reason he wrote
was that he wanted some more money.

387
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:30,018
He keeps lending money to his captain
who keeps losing it at cards.

388
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,720
The captain sounds a lot
like Papa.

389
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:36,788
His name's Denisov. And Nicholas says
he's got moustaches out to here...

390
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:40,097
he lisps and he's the bravest man
in the world.

391
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,660
Nicholas says he's having
a perfectly glorious time...

392
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,899
and we're bound to win the war soon.

393
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:47,534
He's beginning to feel quite sorry
for Napoleon.

394
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,170
Charge! Kill 'em!

395
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,680
Come on, men!

396
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:54,306
Take that!

397
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,816
Come on!

398
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:02,114
There's no doubt about it.
Wars must be very amusing.

399
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:05,388
- I must put it on my list.
- What list?

400
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,259
I'm making a list of the greatest
pleasures human beings are capable of...

401
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,922
in the order of their importance.

402
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,092
- I neglected war.
- What are the other pleasures...

403
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,102
in the order of their importance?

404
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,638
The opera, eternal friendship,
summertime...

405
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:19,765
dancing the mazurka, moving to
the country in the springtime...

406
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:21,776
and welcoming soldiers home
from the war.

407
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:25,109
- Have you any suggestions?
- Well, let me think.

408
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,116
To be able to believe in God...

409
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:30,652
to cause happiness, to love.

410
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,552
Love? Look at Sonya.
She's in love with Nicholas...

411
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:37,524
and she cries every day between 8:00
and 9:00 in the morning-- a full hour.

412
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:41,689
- Don't you ever intend to fall in love?
- Ten or 1 1 times. Only for recreation.

413
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:44,358
I'll keep changing partners
like a dance.

414
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,937
When I fiinally say I love you to a man
and really mean it...

415
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,939
it'll be like a defeated general
who's lost all his troops...

416
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,272
surrendering and handing his sword
to his enemy.

417
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,073
You'll change.

418
00:34:57,146 --> 00:35:00,547
The hideous thing about being young
is everybody is always telling you...

419
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:02,550
you'll change.

420
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,846
Are you dining with us tonight?

421
00:35:06,922 --> 00:35:09,823
I'm afraid I can't.
I have a previous engagement.

422
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,826
Oh? With whom?

423
00:35:12,962 --> 00:35:15,089
My cousin, Princess Helene.

424
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:20,360
I'd like to be like her
when I grow up.

425
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:24,031
Of course I'll have to fiill out
around here.

426
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:28,805
Tall, proud, beautiful,
cold and untouchable...

427
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,278
with regiments of men
dropping at my feet.

428
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,650
I'm going to marry her, Natasha.

429
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,254
Gently, gently.

430
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:44,615
Who's surrendering his sword,
you or she?

431
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:51,766
Be happy, dearest Pierre.

432
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:59,637
I order you to be supremely happy.

433
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:24,228
I'll be leaving again directly.
Wait.

434
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:37,773
I have a message for General Kutuzov
and I must deliver it immediately.

435
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,782
There's the general's aide.
You talk to him, Ensign.

436
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:47,555
Sir. I've just come
from the picket lines.

437
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,786
I have a message and it must be
delivered immediately to the commander.

438
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:52,918
His Excellency is in the middle
of a council of war.

439
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:55,589
- Give it to me. I'll deliver it.
- A verbal message.

440
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,955
Deliver it to me now.

441
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:01,730
My squadron is on picket duty.

442
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,738
This evening we saw the French
put out their fiires...

443
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,774
and we heard sounds in their camp.

444
00:37:05,841 --> 00:37:07,832
- The enemy's on the move, sir.
- Is that all?

445
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,809
Is that all?

446
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:15,841
I would say that you have seen
no action yet, am I right?

447
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:23,819
Good luck, my friend.

448
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:27,259
It is quite apparent that the enemy
has regrouped his position.

449
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,924
Surely now, Your Excellency
should take into consideration...

450
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,833
the fact that we must change
the orders for tomorrow.

451
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:35,836
Or rather for today...

452
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:37,838
for it is past midnight.

453
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:40,966
Gentlemen.

454
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,643
Gentlemen...

455
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:49,309
the orders for tomorrow...

456
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:51,319
cannot now be ordered.

457
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,154
You've heard them...

458
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:58,693
and we shall all do our duty.

459
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:02,720
But before the battle...

460
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:05,130
there is nothing more important...

461
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,936
than to have a good sleep.

462
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:14,706
Good night.

463
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:16,711
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

464
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,793
But, sir...

465
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,621
if the French are that
far south of Austerlitz--

466
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:38,131
Plans.

467
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,029
Tomorrow after the battle...

468
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:44,436
they will all have a hundred reasons
why the plans didn't work.

469
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:47,375
They'll blame everything
but themselves.

470
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:50,171
How do you think it will
go tomorrow?

471
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,607
I think the battle will be lost.

472
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:03,682
We shall not have lost
the war, Andre...

473
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,352
because of this one battle.

474
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,452
There will be peace...

475
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:12,390
and then a new war.

476
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:15,402
Men like Napoleon can never stop...

477
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,961
until their own ambition
destroys them.

478
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,844
The only important battle
is the last.

479
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:26,346
Good night.

480
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:34,988
Fire!

481
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:46,759
Sir, it looks as if the French
have broken our flank.

482
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:54,267
Captain, the hussars must charge.

483
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,992
-You're wounded.
-Wound's not here. There's my wound!

484
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,098
Stop them!

485
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,695
Stop those cowards!

486
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,617
Forward! Forward!

487
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,446
Forward!

488
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,786
- Forwards, lads.
- Forward!

489
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,520
That... is a fiine death.

490
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,350
He's alive.

491
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:57,831
Have this man attended to and take
him to my bivouac like all the others.

492
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:01,062
Let my doctor examine his wounds.

493
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,900
It's so early in the morning, Pierre.

494
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,961
- It's 1 1 :00.
- It's so early.

495
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,237
Since we decided to go to the country in
a week, we have a lot of shopping to do.

496
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,744
Oh, Pierre, I'm so tired.

497
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,872
It's all right. I'll go this morning
and come back early.

498
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:55,215
- The morning papers, sir.
- Thank you.

499
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,029
Anything amusing in the Gazette?

500
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,829
It's not very amusing.
We've lost again.

501
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,434
An armistice is going
to be discussed.

502
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:16,669
Prisoners wounded on both sides
will be immediately returned.

503
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:20,475
In a word--
we're suing for peace.

504
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:22,277
You sound bitter.

505
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:24,683
Maybe I am.

506
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:28,085
What difference does it make
if a piece of Poland changes hand...

507
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,886
a new prince is established
in Austria?

508
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,587
Oh, it's so boring to worry
about things like that.

509
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:37,130
So, no more war.

510
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,361
- For the time being.
- For the time being.

511
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:43,370
Then the armies
will be coming back.

512
00:43:43,438 --> 00:43:45,133
Yes, I suppose so.

513
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,232
Moscow will be very gay
and exciting.

514
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:52,575
Pierre, why don't we stay here
and not go to the country?

515
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:56,174
Not this year, at least.
It'll be such a gay season.

516
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,275
I'm not particularly interested
in a gay season.

517
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,253
Besides, I have so much work to do
down there-- the hospital, the school.

518
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,187
They will die just as well
without you in the hospital.

519
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:08,194
And they'll learn just as many idiotic
things without you in the schools.

520
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:10,355
I promised those people.
I can't disappoint them.

521
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,695
Well, I never liked the idea.

522
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,602
Pierre, come here.

523
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:22,033
Listen. You know what we can do?

524
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,442
You go to the country
all by yourself.

525
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:28,778
Do there what you have to do.
Get the house ready and so on.

526
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,114
Then I'll join you
in the spring, huh?

527
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:33,779
The country's so dreary
in the winter.

528
00:44:34,856 --> 00:44:37,484
Please don't force it on me, Pierre.

529
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:41,619
If you must stay, stay, but I'll
be lost without you there, Helene.

530
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,425
Nonsense.

531
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:46,023
It will be good
for the both of us.

532
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,594
And you will appreciate me so much more
when you haven't seen me for some time.

533
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,935
I couldn't
appreciate you more, Helene.

534
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,108
If you only knew how many things
I have to do.

535
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,808
There's a dozen dresses
I have to have made...

536
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:04,181
and lots of shoes and things--

537
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,187
Why are you looking at me
like that?

538
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:09,789
Why?

539
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,818
What does it mean?

540
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,454
Nothing, my dear.

541
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,578
They lost. They were defeated.
What are they cheering about?

542
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,743
Because they fought,
because they're alive...

543
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,752
because they've come home.

544
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,535
Vaska, I hope nothing's happened.

545
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,902
Gracious heavens.
The young count.

546
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:03,307
- Can it possibly be?
- Prokofy. Is everything all right?

547
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:06,107
The Lord be thanked, yes.

548
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,447
Good.

549
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:15,611
You're back!

550
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,849
It's you!

551
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:18,652
Oh, dear!

552
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,340
Papa!

553
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:49,717
Mama.

554
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,929
- And you must be--
- Vasili Denisov, your son's friend.

555
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,937
I know. Nicholas wrote to us.

556
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:07,599
Darling. Welcome.

557
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:11,610
Welcome.

558
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:13,009
Isn't it wonderful?

559
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,480
Nicholas, you haven't said hello
to Sonya yet.

560
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,083
What's the sense of coming home from
a war if that's all you're gonna do?

561
00:47:37,003 --> 00:47:38,527
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

562
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,539
Gwishka, my pipe.

563
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,809
Rostov, wake up.

564
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:47,942
- Why? Is it late?
- Late? It's 1 0:00.

565
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,641
- What?
- Get up, Nicholas.

566
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,308
Directly.

567
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,945
Is this your saber
or yours?

568
00:47:57,023 --> 00:47:59,150
Take that, you Frenchman!

569
00:48:01,394 --> 00:48:03,624
- Here I come!
- At last!

570
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:11,534
Why did you stay in bed so long?
I've been waiting for you to get up.

571
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,769
You're quite a man, aren't you?

572
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:18,367
I'm awfully glad you're my brother.

573
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,174
I want to know what men are like.

574
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:24,716
Are you the same as all of them?

575
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,018
Sonya is so young.

576
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,250
You know, Sonya's my dearest friend.

577
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:33,588
If she loves someone,
she does it for life.

578
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,958
And she loves you and me
like that.

579
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:38,520
You remember before you went away?

580
00:48:38,598 --> 00:48:40,589
Well, she told me
to forget all that.

581
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:45,661
She said, ''I will love him always,
but let him be free.''

582
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,798
Isn't that lovely and noble?

583
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:50,536
- Isn't it?
- I'll never go back on my word.

584
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,011
We knew you'd say that,
but you see, it won't do.

585
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,607
Because if you marry her just because
you're bound by a promise...

586
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,380
it'll seem as if you're marrying her
because you must.

587
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:03,979
It wouldn't be right, Nicholas.

588
00:49:04,057 --> 00:49:05,991
We'll talk it over later.

589
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:08,323
Oh, I'm so glad I have you.

590
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:11,954
Tell me, are you still true
to Pierre now that he's married?

591
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,000
Don't be silly.

592
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:17,365
- I'll be a dancer. I'll never marry.
- What?

593
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,166
- But don't tell anyone.
- Oh, no.

594
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:23,171
Go and get dressed and
we'll have breakfast together.

595
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:39,990
Did you get my letter?

596
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,528
- We met the doctor at the last relay.
- She'll be relieved.

597
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:45,155
- Is he in time?
- Let's hope so. We must pray for her.

598
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:48,826
- She's longed for you.
- What a strange fate, Masha, darling.

599
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:12,082
My darling. God is merciful.

600
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:14,058
I love you.

601
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:16,095
I love you all.

602
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:18,426
I've never done any harm to anyone.

603
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:21,633
Why must I suffer so?

604
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:23,635
Andre, please help me.

605
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:26,399
My boy, you'll have to leave now.

606
00:50:32,412 --> 00:50:34,676
There, there, my dear.

607
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:40,535
Upon my word, Rostov,
if I were to see 50 more operas...

608
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,132
I'd wager I might wind up
liking them.

609
00:52:44,544 --> 00:52:47,308
But I do like the intermissions.

610
00:52:49,882 --> 00:52:51,850
I say, Rostov...

611
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,715
that one there.

612
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:56,380
- Yes?
- She's superb.

613
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:01,956
But wait. Well.

614
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:03,461
Where's the husband?

615
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:07,990
He spends most of his time
in the country nowadays.

616
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,264
If I were the husband...

617
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,275
I'd come up
from the country... fast.

618
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:06,221
So, listen. So we took the bear
to the house of that actress...

619
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:09,352
and when the police tried to arrest us,
we took the most insolent policeman...

620
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:10,629
tied him on the back of the bear
and shoved them both into the river.

621
00:54:10,629 --> 00:54:14,588
tied him on the back of the bear
and shoved them both into the river.

622
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:15,758
What happened to him?

623
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:19,201
There they were, swimming,
both of them, the man and the bear.

624
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:22,604
Hey, Hercules. Wake up.
The party's still young.

625
00:54:22,674 --> 00:54:24,437
Don't be rough with him.

626
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,774
One should always be polite
to the husbands of pretty women.

627
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:27,937
That's right.

628
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:31,141
Let's drink to the health
of beautiful women everywhere.

629
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:34,208
Yes, to the health
of lovely women. Huh, Pierre?

630
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:38,456
And to their lovers.

631
00:54:43,729 --> 00:54:47,130
Look at this. It's a new song
written about General Kutuzov.

632
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:53,867
- That interests me.
- What are you doing?

633
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,134
I said that interests me.

634
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:25,501
Then allow me to express your regrets
and I'm sure your opponent will accept.

635
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:28,870
What is there to talk about?
Is everything ready?

636
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:32,274
- No apologies.
- First, tell me how to use this thing.

637
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:36,712
It's very simple. You cock it.
There's the trigger.

638
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:38,875
Oh, yes. I know.
I just forgot.

639
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:43,817
No apologies, none whatever.

640
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:55,255
On the count of three,
begin to advance.

641
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:00,737
One...

642
00:56:00,806 --> 00:56:03,206
two, three.

643
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,924
Get away from here!

644
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:23,962
It's not over.

645
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,969
To your barrier!
Stay where you are!

646
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:40,638
Cover yourself, you fool!

647
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,618
Well now, the hero.
The dashing duelist.

648
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:26,021
My protector. Thank you so much
for defending my honor.

649
00:57:26,091 --> 00:57:29,026
You were told that Dolokhov
was my lover and you believed it.

650
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:31,528
Well, what did you prove?

651
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:34,088
That you are a fool,
but everybody knew that.

652
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,999
Now I will be the laughingstock
of all Moscow.

653
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:39,833
Everyone will say that you were drunk,
not knowing what you were doing.

654
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:43,534
Challenging a man that
you were jealous of without cause.

655
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:47,705
A man that is a better man
than you are in every way.

656
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:53,309
- We had better separate.
- Separate?

657
00:57:53,385 --> 00:57:57,446
That's a charming idea.
It's a wonderful idea!

658
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:00,821
It's the best idea you've had
in your whole life.

659
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:04,692
Good. By all means we'll separate,
but you will pay for it.

660
00:58:04,763 --> 00:58:07,323
You'll give me a fortune for it.

661
00:58:11,937 --> 00:58:13,165
Get out!

662
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:24,140
The count is waiting for you
upstairs, sir.

663
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:47,093
- What have you heard?
- He'll recover. Dolokhov won't die.

664
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:48,764
Thank God.

665
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:53,534
It's only easier to kill good men.

666
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:58,007
Men like Dolokhov
are only good for wars.

667
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:01,541
In between wars, they ought
to be locked up in cages.

668
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,053
Here.

669
00:59:04,156 --> 00:59:06,181
I'd like to leave Moscow.

670
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:09,659
I wanna get away from these people
who believe it's normal to kill--

671
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,219
who are scornful of a man
if he doesn't kill.

672
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,067
At the banquet,
when Dolokhov made the toast...

673
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:21,264
I looked across at him
smiling at me...

674
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,036
I was convinced of the guilt
of my wife.

675
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:25,838
Well, is that a reason to kill?

676
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:28,778
- Look, my dear fellow--
- Helene was guilty, not Dolokhov.

677
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:31,077
In his place, I might have done
the same thing.

678
00:59:31,149 --> 00:59:33,674
Maybe it's even certain
that I'd have done the same thing.

679
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,486
There we were in the snow
facing each other with pistols.

680
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:42,950
You know who's the guilty one?
I. Only I.

681
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:45,258
Pierre, don't be silly.

682
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:50,229
And you know why? Because
I married her without loving her.

683
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:53,999
I wanted her. I had to have her,
so I made myself blind.

684
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:57,405
I lied when I said to her,
''I love you.''

685
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,944
And because of that...

686
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:05,244
there's Dolokhov stretched in pain,
alive only by the grace of God.

687
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:10,084
Because of my weakness, my lie.
I'm guilty. I must suffer for it.

688
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:12,282
Pierre, you must stop
thinking like this.

689
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:15,292
It'll become an obsession,
and it's not like you.

690
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:18,727
Look, if you'll agree...

691
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:21,493
we'll all take a fiine trip
to our place in the country.

692
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:25,434
It'll do us all good, and Nicholas
wants to show it to Denisov.

693
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:27,631
We'll start tonight,
and you'll come with us, eh?

694
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:30,641
Of course you'll come with us.
I'll go and tell the family.

695
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:39,709
Hurry! We'll start
for the country tonight.

696
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:43,380
Why didn't you tell me Pierre
was here? Will you go, Pierre?

697
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:45,446
We must start while the moon
is still high.

698
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:47,515
Of course Pierre will go.

699
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:50,925
What has happened, Ilya?
And what moon are you speaking of?

700
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:54,056
Is there more than one, my pet?

701
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,533
Oh, how long must we wait
for Nicholas?

702
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,535
I'm so happy you made up your mind.

703
01:00:58,603 --> 01:01:01,128
I was just saying, ''One more day
and the snow will be gone.''

704
01:01:01,206 --> 01:01:02,730
Thank you.

705
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:08,505
- Order the troikas.
- Immediately, sir.

706
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:09,808
We're off!

707
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:13,009
Hurry up, Nicholas. You're delaying
the trip to the country.

708
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:14,381
The country?

709
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:17,149
You said you wanted to go
to the country to show Denisov.

710
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:19,690
- Come, hurry.
- Come, Vaska. You'll like this.

711
01:01:19,758 --> 01:01:21,919
I was just beginning
to enjoy Moscow.

712
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:29,122
Faster, faster!

713
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,026
Faster, Nitka!

714
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,801
{y:i}As we ride in the troika
{y:i}you and I

715
01:01:37,876 --> 01:01:40,140
{y:i}Stars are twinkling
{y:i}up in the sky

716
01:01:40,212 --> 01:01:43,272
{y:i}Strains of sweet balalaika
{y:i}soft and low

717
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:47,751
{y:i}Sleigh bells
{y:i}twinkling across the snow

718
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,480
Whoa, careful!

719
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:09,202
Come on. It's your turn.

720
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,214
{y:i}Hold me close
{y:i}and kiss me, katiusha

721
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:18,909
{y:i}Let's be happy and gay, hey

722
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:13,930
Ever since Nicholas joined the army,
he's become terribly effiicient.

723
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:16,405
Hardly seems to be my own son.

724
01:03:16,474 --> 01:03:19,568
- I quite agree with you.
-Just a minute.

725
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:24,107
I believe that's my friend
Prince Andre Bolkonsky.

726
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:26,673
- May I ask him to join us?
- Yes, by all means.

727
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:28,685
Do ask him.

728
01:03:33,525 --> 01:03:35,459
Come on, Natasha.

729
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:43,799
Greetings.
How glad I am to see you.

730
01:03:43,868 --> 01:03:45,802
I didn't know
you were still in the country.

731
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,805
The Rostovs invite you
to join the hunt.

732
01:03:48,873 --> 01:03:51,341
For the time being, I'm afraid
anyone else's society...

733
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:53,400
would give me more pain
than pleasure.

734
01:03:57,715 --> 01:04:00,513
Prince Andre, may I present
the Countess Rostova...

735
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:03,513
and her brother Petya Rostov.

736
01:04:03,588 --> 01:04:06,148
I do hope Pierre has convinced
you to come, Prince Andre.

737
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:08,590
It promises to be one of
the very best hunts of the year.

738
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,151
And the huntsman swears he knows
where there's a wolf and her cubs.

739
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:13,527
And the ground's just perfect.
We'd be so delighted if you'd--

740
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:18,631
What I mean is,
I do think you would enjoy it.

741
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,864
Perhaps I'll join you later,
if I may.

742
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,501
- And stay to dinner?
- Possibly.

743
01:04:24,576 --> 01:04:27,704
- But you just said--
- Shall I come now?

744
01:04:27,779 --> 01:04:29,440
Wonderful!

745
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,747
- I'm glad you stayed tonight.
- So am I.

746
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:39,305
- Aren't the Rostovs charming?
- Charming.

747
01:05:39,384 --> 01:05:41,318
It's wonderful
to watch them together.

748
01:05:41,386 --> 01:05:44,048
They're like a special race--
a race of handsome, healthy...

749
01:05:44,122 --> 01:05:46,113
gay, thoughtless animals.

750
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,316
Thoughtless?

751
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:49,656
That's the most charming
of their characteristics.

752
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:51,854
- All of them, you think?
- All of them.

753
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:57,493
No, within a year or two, the girl,
Natasha, will begin to think.

754
01:05:57,569 --> 01:06:00,732
That will make her even more
charming and less of a Rostov.

755
01:06:00,805 --> 01:06:03,296
- You follow me?
- I think so.

756
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:11,447
I think it's bad for you--
it's wrong to stay down here...

757
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:14,451
year after year, brooding,
not seeing anyone...

758
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:16,453
living the life of a hermit.

759
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:18,989
Bad? Wrong?

760
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:24,117
There are only two things in this
life that are really wrong.

761
01:06:24,195 --> 01:06:27,164
Remorse and illness.

762
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:30,166
When I've recovered from the both,
I'll go out in the world again.

763
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:33,726
Remorse? What have you got
to be remorseful for?

764
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:35,397
I was too late.

765
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:39,600
I let Lise die
feeling unloved, uncomforted.

766
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:41,645
I was too busy
on the trail of glory...

767
01:06:41,713 --> 01:06:44,113
to take the time
to comfort my wife.

768
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:49,682
Well, I found glory.

769
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:53,155
I stopped the retreat
of a hundred men for fiive minutes.

770
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:56,955
I was left for dead on
a lost battlefiield in a lost war.

771
01:06:58,329 --> 01:06:59,819
I'll stop being a hermit...

772
01:06:59,897 --> 01:07:02,661
when something happens to make me
forget all those things.

773
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:09,064
Well, I think I'd better
go to bed now.

774
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:12,071
Good night, Pierre.

775
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,842
Thank you again.

776
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:20,679
Good night, Andre.

777
01:07:33,164 --> 01:07:35,530
Natasha, come to bed.
You'll catch cold.

778
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,296
I won't. I can't sleep.
What's the use?

779
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:40,837
After a day like this,
it's impossible to sleep.

780
01:07:40,905 --> 01:07:42,338
How can anyone sleep?

781
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:46,366
Do just come and see what a moon.
Look how glorious it is.

782
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:51,479
Yes?

783
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:54,074
Do you think
Prince Andre likes us?

784
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:57,087
- Of course he does.
- He's so silent.

785
01:07:57,155 --> 01:08:00,750
He keeps sitting there as though
he's passing judgment on us.

786
01:08:00,825 --> 01:08:03,157
I'm a little frightened of him,
aren't you?

787
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:07,061
I'm a little frightened,
and yet when I sang after dinner...

788
01:08:07,131 --> 01:08:09,929
I wanted to go up to him
and take him by the hand...

789
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:13,061
look in his eyes
and sing just for him.

790
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:16,231
Poor man. He'd never come
here again if I'd done that.

791
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:21,045
Did you notice
he almost never smiles?

792
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,446
While I was singing, I turned
and caught him looking at me.

793
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:29,213
He was smiling then.

794
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:31,278
And I felt--

795
01:08:31,355 --> 01:08:33,721
But it's almost
impossible to describe.

796
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:36,157
I felt as if
someone had given me...

797
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:40,129
the most enormous,
beautiful present.

798
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:42,189
Come to bed, Natasha.
It's terribly late.

799
01:08:42,266 --> 01:08:45,360
Oh, you try to spoil everything.

800
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:48,337
A night like this,
I feel like hugging myself...

801
01:08:48,406 --> 01:08:52,172
and straining tight as possible
and flying away.

802
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:55,076
- Take care! You'll fall out!
- All right.

803
01:08:55,146 --> 01:08:58,547
But it is a shame to go in
on such a night.

804
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:01,016
It's as though you can hear
wonderful music...

805
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:04,145
and you just know that the next
song or the song after that...

806
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:07,885
will be the most beautiful thing
you've ever heard in your life.

807
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:10,757
And being pulled away
and missing it forever.

808
01:09:15,633 --> 01:09:17,066
Forever.

809
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,671
All right.

810
01:09:47,731 --> 01:09:50,325
- The expression on my face.
- What about it?

811
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:53,131
- Do I look disdainful?
- No.

812
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:55,604
You're impossible.
I'm sure I look disdainful.

813
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:57,766
What do you want to look
disdainful for?

814
01:09:57,842 --> 01:09:59,867
I thought if I looked bored
and disdainful...

815
01:09:59,944 --> 01:10:03,004
nobody would notice that this is
the fiirst ball I've ever been to.

816
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:09,579
- How's this? Better?
- Oh, that's much better.

817
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:11,086
Good.

818
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,591
- You must promise me one thing.
- What's that?

819
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:27,967
- Not to dance with me...
- Not a chance.

820
01:10:28,038 --> 01:10:30,199
no matter if I just stand
against the wall for fiive hours...

821
01:10:30,274 --> 01:10:33,107
and nobody comes over
and says a word to me.

822
01:10:33,177 --> 01:10:35,338
No matter how much I seem
to be appealing to you...

823
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:37,846
you must absolutely promise me
not to ask me to dance.

824
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:40,440
- Why not?
- It will be too humiliating...

825
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:43,180
for the world to see the only
person who asked me to dance...

826
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:46,189
is my brother... out of pity.

827
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:49,552
- Promise?
- I promise.

828
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:09,209
What now?

829
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,374
- Is everybody looking at me?
- Can't you see for yourself?

830
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:15,850
Not without changing
the expression on my face.

831
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,753
Natasha, you know, there's
one awful thing about you.

832
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,689
Tell it to me!
Tell me the whole truth.

833
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:25,752
No girl I'll ever meet will ever
be able to amuse me like you do.

834
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:29,526
Don't talk like that.
Now go and leave us to our fate.

835
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,592
Excuse me, my dear.
Nicholas, look after your mother.

836
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,900
- You all right, Mother?
- Yes, my darling.

837
01:12:16,413 --> 01:12:18,779
{y:i}What a horrible mistake.

838
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:20,908
{y:i}I shouldn't have come.

839
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:23,419
{y:i}Nothing is going to happen.

840
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:27,287
{y:i}The night is going to be one
{y:i}horrible, black...

841
01:12:27,358 --> 01:12:29,292
{y:i}degrading zero.

842
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:34,858
Aw, Count Denilov,
come and meet my family.

843
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:37,127
Madame Maria Peronskaya.

844
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:41,638
You know my wife. My niece Sonya.
And my daughter Natasha.

845
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:44,640
- How do you do?
- May I have the pleasure?

846
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:58,954
Oh, dear.

847
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:09,532
Perhaps I shall be
more fortunate later on.

848
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,795
Have no fear.
I shall try again.

849
01:13:17,775 --> 01:13:20,471
Denilov is our hostess'
fiirst cousin.

850
01:13:20,544 --> 01:13:23,513
- Supposed to be worth millions.
- Second cousin, dear.

851
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,141
Ah, there's the French
ambassador himself.

852
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:29,208
He looks as if he were a king.

853
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:34,654
You're rather late, you know.
Most of my dances are gone.

854
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:52,603
{y:i}Why must I keep thinking
{y:i}of Prince Andre?

855
01:13:52,676 --> 01:13:55,201
{y:i}Am I so much in love with him...

856
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:58,544
{y:i}that all others seem ridiculous?

857
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:01,083
{y:i}We saw so little of each other...

858
01:14:01,151 --> 01:14:04,314
{y:i}and yet I remember every moment.

859
01:14:05,589 --> 01:14:09,286
{y:i}Oh, if only he could have
{y:i}brought me here tonight.

860
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,885
{y:i}Why doesn't he like the city?

861
01:14:11,962 --> 01:14:14,157
{y:i}It isn't right for a man
{y:i}to shut himself off...

862
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,165
{y:i}for months and months
{y:i}as he does.

863
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:18,667
I am so delighted
to see you again.

864
01:14:25,843 --> 01:14:27,936
Will you honor me with this dance?

865
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,547
- Pierre, nice to see you again.
- Pierre, my boy.

866
01:14:34,318 --> 01:14:36,479
Will you honor me with this dance?

867
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:45,251
Don't you just love dances?

868
01:15:45,322 --> 01:15:47,381
Not ordinarily.

869
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,653
This is the fiirst one I've come to
in more than two years.

870
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:52,194
I'm so glad you did come.

871
01:15:52,262 --> 01:15:54,594
I mean, after the night
of the hunt...

872
01:15:54,665 --> 01:15:57,133
Mama and Papa said how nice it was
that you came to visit...

873
01:15:57,201 --> 01:16:00,500
and they hoped you'd come again.

874
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:04,598
I hope you tell Mama and Papa
that I intend to visit often.

875
01:16:04,675 --> 01:16:06,870
Very often, if they will permit me.

876
01:16:06,944 --> 01:16:10,311
- I certainly shall tell them.
- And on moonlit nights...

877
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,976
do you still want to hold yourself
tight and fly off to the moon?

878
01:16:15,052 --> 01:16:17,179
How do you know?
Where did you hear?

879
01:16:17,254 --> 01:16:20,621
I couldn't help overhearing.
My window is just below yours.

880
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,457
What a disaster.
You heard everything.

881
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,794
No. You disappeared too soon.

882
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,629
You must think
I'm an utter idiot.

883
01:16:35,706 --> 01:16:38,869
No. I don't think
you're an idiot.

884
01:16:39,943 --> 01:16:41,877
- I think--
- Permit me, mademoiselle.

885
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:44,436
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

886
01:16:48,218 --> 01:16:49,651
Thank you.

887
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,404
{y:i}What a joy it is
{y:i}to dance with her.

888
01:17:12,476 --> 01:17:15,707
{y:i}Like holding springtime
{y:i}in your arms.

889
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:19,840
{y:i}Like holding a branch of lilac
{y:i}or a kitten.

890
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,282
{y:i}Look at her now.

891
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:32,017
{y:i}If she looks back at me
{y:i}and smiles on the next turn...

892
01:17:32,095 --> 01:17:33,858
{y:i}she'll be my wife.

893
01:18:03,527 --> 01:18:06,155
Guide us with thy infiinite wisdom.

894
01:18:08,131 --> 01:18:11,032
Teach us to abide in thy mercy.

895
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:17,832
And if it be thy will,
let this bed be my grave.

896
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:20,399
Mama, I must talk to you
just once more.

897
01:18:20,477 --> 01:18:22,877
Well, well.

898
01:18:22,946 --> 01:18:26,507
It's about Prince Andre,
I suppose.

899
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:33,022
Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

900
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,684
Five days that he hasn't
been heard from.

901
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:38,284
First he comes and sees me
every day, morning and evening...

902
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:41,991
and quite turns my head, then
nothing happens and all's fiinished.

903
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:45,899
Now, let me tell you about myself
when I was young.

904
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:49,632
I had a cousin.
A handsome young man.

905
01:18:49,706 --> 01:18:52,140
Yes, really handsome.

906
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:55,440
I know-- Cyril Nutvich.

907
01:18:55,512 --> 01:18:58,242
But must everything, as
in your case, end up in nothing?

908
01:18:58,315 --> 01:19:01,011
Now you're being impulsive,
as I used to be.

909
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:04,110
You must be patient,
very patient.

910
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:08,021
You must wait till a proper
proposal has been made to you.

911
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:10,355
- He'll show up.
- The last time he came...

912
01:19:10,427 --> 01:19:13,396
he had it right here on the tip
of his tongue, his proposal.

913
01:19:13,463 --> 01:19:16,261
And he seemed so in love.

914
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:19,393
I'm always a little afraid
when I'm in his presence.

915
01:19:19,469 --> 01:19:23,929
What does it mean?
Does it mean that it's real love?

916
01:19:24,007 --> 01:19:27,602
- Mama, are you asleep?
- No, my pet.

917
01:19:27,677 --> 01:19:31,875
I'm a little frightened myself.
Now go.

918
01:19:31,948 --> 01:19:34,815
Oh, it's not fair.
I shan't sleep.

919
01:19:34,885 --> 01:19:38,514
Mommy, such a thing
has never happened to me before.

920
01:19:38,588 --> 01:19:41,819
Could we ever have thought it when
he fiirst came to the country...

921
01:19:41,892 --> 01:19:44,122
that we should meet at the ball?

922
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:46,025
Well, it must be fate.

923
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:50,328
Clearly it must be fate
if everything led up to this.

924
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,528
Mama, need one be ashamed
of his being a widower?

925
01:19:53,603 --> 01:19:57,835
No, darling. Pray to God.
Marriages are made in heaven.

926
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:03,475
Mama, how I love you.
I'm so happy.

927
01:20:06,116 --> 01:20:08,209
Little countess,
are you asleep?

928
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:13,820
Yes, dear, I'm asleep.
Good night.

929
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:20,155
Marry. Marry?

930
01:20:21,264 --> 01:20:24,825
As though life were not
complicated enough as it is.

931
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:26,801
And in such a hurry.

932
01:20:27,938 --> 01:20:30,065
You thought you knew
what you were doing last time too.

933
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,267
- Do you remember?
- This is completely different.

934
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:35,277
- It's always completely different.
- Before I met her...

935
01:20:35,345 --> 01:20:37,074
life was sad...

936
01:20:37,147 --> 01:20:39,809
meaningless, hopeless.

937
01:20:39,883 --> 01:20:43,216
You're over 30.
By the time a man's over 30...

938
01:20:43,286 --> 01:20:45,914
life should be sad,
meaningless and hopeless.

939
01:20:45,989 --> 01:20:48,981
- Father.
- All right, all right!

940
01:20:49,059 --> 01:20:52,028
Let's be reasonable.

941
01:20:52,095 --> 01:20:55,121
- Her family is nothing.
- Now, Father--

942
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:57,530
Nothing compared
to the Bolkonskys. Nothing.

943
01:20:57,601 --> 01:21:01,196
Her father is well known
as a man who used to chase...

944
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:04,240
every woman in Moscow
and St. Petersburg...

945
01:21:04,307 --> 01:21:06,775
without success.

946
01:21:06,843 --> 01:21:09,368
Now that he's grown older...

947
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:11,641
he's well known as a man
who plays in every card game...

948
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:16,049
in Moscow and St. Petersburg,
equally without success.

949
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:18,451
They're a happy
and delightful family.

950
01:21:18,522 --> 01:21:21,923
That's a success too.
Perhaps the greatest success.

951
01:21:23,527 --> 01:21:26,496
But do you think you're
being fair to the girl?

952
01:21:27,564 --> 01:21:29,896
You're much older than she.

953
01:21:29,966 --> 01:21:31,900
You have a son to bring up.

954
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:33,936
Who's going to take
the responsibility?

955
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:35,938
A little chit of a girl?

956
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:42,204
I beg of you,
put it off for just one year...

957
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:44,042
and go abroad.

958
01:21:44,114 --> 01:21:46,241
There's this peace mission
to Prussia.

959
01:21:46,316 --> 01:21:48,750
The czar and the emperor Napoleon.

960
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:51,252
They'll be signing
a treaty there.

961
01:21:51,321 --> 01:21:54,779
I know you wanted to go
on the mission.

962
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:57,827
Now, after one year,
if you still have this love...

963
01:21:57,894 --> 01:22:01,523
or obstinacy, passion, whatever
you choose to call it, marry her.

964
01:22:01,598 --> 01:22:03,862
That is my last word
on the subject.

965
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:05,868
It's my last word.

966
01:22:18,782 --> 01:22:21,512
{y:i}Is it possible
{y:i}that I, Natasha...

967
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:25,954
{y:i}am to be the wife of this strange,
{y:i}dear, clever man...

968
01:22:26,022 --> 01:22:28,490
{y:i}whom even my father looks up to?

969
01:22:28,558 --> 01:22:30,583
{y:i}Can it be true?

970
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,959
{y:i}Can it be true that there can be
{y:i}no more playing with life--

971
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,692
{y:i}that now I am grown up,
{y:i}that on me now lies...

972
01:22:36,766 --> 01:22:40,463
{y:i}the responsibility
{y:i}of my every word and deed?

973
01:22:52,349 --> 01:22:54,749
I have loved you
from the fiirst moment I saw you.

974
01:23:02,192 --> 01:23:04,990
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

975
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:25,815
What is it?
What's the matter?

976
01:23:27,717 --> 01:23:29,514
I'm so happy.

977
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:42,593
Did your mother tell you
what I explained to her?

978
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:44,463
There's nothing to explain.

979
01:23:44,534 --> 01:23:46,900
Did she tell you
that it can't be for a year?

980
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:50,497
Forgive me, but you're so young.
I want you to be absolutely sure.

981
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:52,063
I am sure.

982
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,976
One year isn't too terribly long,
and you'll be free.

983
01:23:56,046 --> 01:23:58,981
If within that year
you fiind that you don't love me...

984
01:23:59,049 --> 01:24:00,914
or if you come to love
someone else--

985
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:04,078
Don't say that. You must never
say anything like that again.

986
01:24:06,356 --> 01:24:09,325
Ayear? Am I going
to see you, though?

987
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:13,021
Of course. I have to go to Poland,
but I'll be gone only a few months.

988
01:24:13,096 --> 01:24:15,826
Well, can't it be helped?
Is there anything that can be done?

989
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:19,027
It's awful! I'll die waiting
a year! It's impossible!

990
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:24,098
No, I'll do anything.
Whatever you say.

991
01:24:24,174 --> 01:24:27,439
Oh, I'm so happy.
We have the rest of our lives.

992
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:37,613
{y:i}At Tilsit, in Prussia,
{y:i}on June 1 3, 1 807...

993
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:40,918
{y:i}Napoleon met with
{y:i}Emperor Alexander of Russia...

994
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:44,448
{y:i}for the purpose of discussing
{y:i}a treaty of peace.

995
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:08,540
{y:i}They can't help liking me.

996
01:25:08,618 --> 01:25:11,678
{y:i}I'm so willing
{y:i}to do anything they wish...

997
01:25:11,755 --> 01:25:14,747
{y:i}so ready to be fond of him...

998
01:25:14,824 --> 01:25:17,224
{y:i}for being his father.

999
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,569
- I am Mary Bolkonsky.
- Charmed.

1000
01:25:26,636 --> 01:25:29,196
- And this is my daughter Natasha.
- How do you do?

1001
01:25:29,272 --> 01:25:31,536
Good afternoon.

1002
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:35,066
Please excuse my father.
He doesn't feel well.

1003
01:25:35,145 --> 01:25:37,807
He asked me to welcome you
in his name.

1004
01:25:42,652 --> 01:25:45,587
- Will you have some tea?
- Well, I think that would be--

1005
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:47,088
No, thank you.

1006
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:49,924
No, thank you.

1007
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:58,794
I suppose you've heard
from Andre?

1008
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:01,365
Yes.

1009
01:26:03,673 --> 01:26:04,935
Father!

1010
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:09,037
Ah, you're the young
Countess Rostov.

1011
01:26:09,112 --> 01:26:12,548
I didn't know you were paying me
the honor of a visit.

1012
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:16,551
You must excuse my costume.
I came to speak to my daughter.

1013
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,349
Why wasn't I told?

1014
01:26:19,422 --> 01:26:22,619
Count Rostov. Oh, yes,
I've heard a great deal about you.

1015
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:25,752
A great deal about you.

1016
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:29,856
As the Lord is my witness,
nobody told me that they were here.

1017
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:34,062
This house--
utter confusion, chaos.

1018
01:26:34,137 --> 01:26:36,833
People coming and going,
and you can't fiind anything.

1019
01:26:36,906 --> 01:26:39,374
Even the papers in my desk.

1020
01:26:39,442 --> 01:26:41,569
You must excuse me.

1021
01:26:41,644 --> 01:26:44,442
As you see,
I'm not prepared to entertain.

1022
01:26:44,514 --> 01:26:46,982
I can't stand Moscow anyhow!

1023
01:26:48,184 --> 01:26:51,278
I wouldn't be here
except I've no alternative.

1024
01:26:51,354 --> 01:26:54,881
I'm forced to be here.
You understand, don't you?

1025
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,623
Well, I think we'd better
leave now, Princess.

1026
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:07,063
Wait. I must talk to you.

1027
01:27:07,136 --> 01:27:09,366
Dear Natasha,
I want to tell you...

1028
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:13,000
that I'm certain my brother
has found happiness.

1029
01:27:13,076 --> 01:27:17,035
Princess, I think it is not
convenient to speak of that now.

1030
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:37,660
Isn't it wonderful?

1031
01:27:37,734 --> 01:27:41,465
Aren't you glad you decided to come
instead of sitting home all night?

1032
01:27:41,537 --> 01:27:43,937
I don't know.
Until Andre comes back...

1033
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:45,941
I can't be glad about anything.

1034
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:50,946
Well, it's only a few weeks.
Do you see that tall man over there?

1035
01:27:51,014 --> 01:27:52,743
Yes. What about him?

1036
01:27:52,815 --> 01:27:55,181
When we passed him,
I heard him say to his wife...

1037
01:27:55,251 --> 01:27:59,415
''That's the Countess Rostov, the
one who's going to marry Bolkonsky.

1038
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:01,184
Lucky man.''

1039
01:28:01,257 --> 01:28:04,351
- He said, ''Lucky man?''
- Lucky man.

1040
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:09,155
I must write that to Andre.

1041
01:28:09,232 --> 01:28:11,826
He can pass it on
to his horrible old father.

1042
01:28:16,806 --> 01:28:19,741
- Countess Bezukhov has arrived.
- Bezukhov?

1043
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:22,175
One of my favorites.
I must call on her.

1044
01:28:23,613 --> 01:28:26,377
Countess Bezukhov!
You're back in Moscow.

1045
01:28:26,449 --> 01:28:30,215
I'm delighted to see you. The city
hasn't been the same without you.

1046
01:28:32,155 --> 01:28:35,215
I've brought my two girls
with me, as you can see.

1047
01:28:43,933 --> 01:28:45,867
Magnifiicent woman.

1048
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:49,268
Yes. You can understand how men
must fall in love with her.

1049
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:55,169
Dolokhov, see the girl
in that box?

1050
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:57,474
Yes. She's lovely, but--

1051
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:04,718
For you? Anatole,
she's not exactly your type.

1052
01:30:36,846 --> 01:30:39,246
Count Rostov, may I borrow
your lovely daughter...

1053
01:30:39,315 --> 01:30:41,306
to sit with me
through the next act?

1054
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:45,115
Oh, Countess, how charming.
Natasha, my dear, come along.

1055
01:30:45,188 --> 01:30:47,816
- Isn't it exciting?
- Yes.

1056
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:58,332
Enchanting. You mustn't
bury her in the country again.

1057
01:30:58,401 --> 01:31:01,564
Oh, you're too kind.
Natasha, sit down.

1058
01:31:03,739 --> 01:31:06,765
Now we can tear
all our friends to pieces.

1059
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,343
You realize that everyone in
the theater is talking about you--

1060
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:18,183
how lovely you are and
the brilliant match you've made.

1061
01:31:18,254 --> 01:31:21,985
- You know about that?
- It's the news of the season.

1062
01:31:22,058 --> 01:31:24,151
Prince Andre Bolkonsky?

1063
01:31:24,227 --> 01:31:28,027
Why, every woman here tonight
is jealous of you at this moment.

1064
01:31:29,098 --> 01:31:30,531
Why, Anatole!

1065
01:31:31,868 --> 01:31:36,168
May I present my brother?
Countess Natasha Rostov.

1066
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,804
My brother is the center
of fashion in Moscow.

1067
01:31:40,877 --> 01:31:43,072
That means that he eats
and drinks too much...

1068
01:31:43,146 --> 01:31:45,080
and plays for too high stakes.

1069
01:31:45,148 --> 01:31:48,083
He also sees the worst
and most amusing people.

1070
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:51,518
You simply must get him to tell you
all there is to do this season.

1071
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:54,681
- Countess!
- Prince, you've been neglecting me.

1072
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:56,358
- I was convinced you were dead.
- Dead?

1073
01:31:56,358 --> 01:31:57,120
- I was convinced you were dead.
- Dead?

1074
01:31:57,192 --> 01:31:59,126
When I saw you
the fiirst time at the ball--

1075
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:01,287
When was it,
six, seven weeks ago?

1076
01:32:01,363 --> 01:32:05,459
I thought, ''What a pretty girl.''
That's all I thought.

1077
01:32:05,534 --> 01:32:10,699
But tonight--
But you felt it too, hmm?

1078
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:14,899
- I felt--
- When our eyes met?

1079
01:32:14,977 --> 01:32:17,946
Don't look guilty.
What's there to be ashamed of?

1080
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:25,577
Are you enjoying the opera?
It's very good, isn't it?

1081
01:32:25,654 --> 01:32:28,782
Oh, is it?
I haven't noticed.

1082
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:31,291
I haven't looked
at the stage tonight.

1083
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:34,791
I must see you again.

1084
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:38,731
You must come to my sister's
house... very soon.

1085
01:32:40,135 --> 01:32:41,568
I think--

1086
01:32:43,705 --> 01:32:47,505
I think my mother's in the country.
I may go up to be with her.

1087
01:32:49,178 --> 01:32:51,112
She's enchanting.

1088
01:33:03,325 --> 01:33:06,556
Go away, Anatole.
You will distract us.

1089
01:33:06,628 --> 01:33:08,061
All right.

1090
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:10,664
You'll come.

1091
01:33:12,134 --> 01:33:14,500
I'll take this as a pledge.

1092
01:33:20,542 --> 01:33:23,272
My brother is very amusing,
isn't he?

1093
01:34:08,924 --> 01:34:10,983
How lovely she is.

1094
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:14,426
I don't think so...
when I look at you.

1095
01:34:14,496 --> 01:34:16,794
Natasha, come.

1096
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:30,077
You're enchanting.

1097
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:33,444
From the moment I saw you,
I never ceased worshipping you.

1098
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:40,188
I do hope you don't think us
too informal, Count.

1099
01:34:40,255 --> 01:34:42,246
Oh, Countess!

1100
01:34:55,871 --> 01:34:57,805
I'm madly in love with you.

1101
01:35:04,446 --> 01:35:07,210
The success was triumphant.
The whole theater--

1102
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:11,013
- Papa, we must leave.
- My dear, we can't go now.

1103
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:16,023
It was like one big heart,
palpitating with emotion.

1104
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,356
His Majesty the king
was so moved...

1105
01:35:19,428 --> 01:35:21,896
that tears
were streaming down his face.

1106
01:35:25,834 --> 01:35:27,768
My cloak, please.

1107
01:35:57,299 --> 01:35:59,494
I can't.
You know I can't.

1108
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,547
{y:i}"Dearest Natasha...

1109
01:36:53,622 --> 01:36:57,080
{y:i}My fate has been sealed--
{y:i}to be loved by you or die.

1110
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:59,184
{y:i}I know your parents
{y:i}won't give you to me...

1111
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:02,059
{y:i}for secret reasons
{y:i}I will reveal only to you.

1112
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:04,428
{y:i}But if you love me, you need
{y:i}only say the word yes...

1113
01:37:04,499 --> 01:37:06,660
{y:i}and no human power can hinder us.

1114
01:37:06,735 --> 01:37:08,396
{y:i}Anatole. "

1115
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:17,043
You're back.

1116
01:37:19,414 --> 01:37:22,941
How was your evening?
Did you amuse yourself?

1117
01:37:23,018 --> 01:37:27,580
Yes. I made excuses for you.

1118
01:37:27,656 --> 01:37:31,524
I was worried about you.
How's your headache? Better?

1119
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:34,255
- Sonya, you read that letter.
- Yes.

1120
01:37:34,329 --> 01:37:37,730
I'm glad you read it. I couldn't
keep it from you any longer.

1121
01:37:40,502 --> 01:37:43,835
- You know we love one another.
- But Anatole Kuragine.

1122
01:37:43,905 --> 01:37:46,465
- If only you knew how happy I am.
- And Andre?

1123
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:49,476
- You don't know what love is.
- Then you are refusing Andre?

1124
01:37:49,544 --> 01:37:52,809
You don't understand anything.
Don't talk nonsense. Listen.

1125
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:56,078
How is it that you loved a man
for so many months, and suddenly--

1126
01:37:56,151 --> 01:37:59,951
Why? You've only seen
Anatole three times.

1127
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:04,390
I've never loved anyone before.
I know it's hard to understand.

1128
01:38:04,459 --> 01:38:07,257
I've heard it's happened that way.
You must have too.

1129
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:10,059
It's only now I feel such love.

1130
01:38:10,132 --> 01:38:13,727
As soon as I saw him,
I felt he was my master...

1131
01:38:13,802 --> 01:38:17,203
and I his slave,
and I couldn't help loving him.

1132
01:38:17,272 --> 01:38:20,400
Yes, his slave!
Whatever he commands, I must do!

1133
01:38:20,475 --> 01:38:23,205
- What can I do, Sonya?
- If he loves you...

1134
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:26,179
why doesn't he come honestly
to the house, to your father...

1135
01:38:26,248 --> 01:38:28,910
ask for your engagement
to Andre to be broken off?

1136
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:32,181
- Why all this secrecy?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1137
01:38:32,254 --> 01:38:35,246
Whatever his reasons,
they are good ones.

1138
01:38:35,323 --> 01:38:38,053
I told you I have no will.
I love him!

1139
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:41,721
Then I won't let it come to that.
I shall tell.

1140
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:45,197
Sonya, what do you mean?
You wouldn't tell anyone!

1141
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:47,997
Don't torture me!
I can't live without him!

1142
01:38:48,069 --> 01:38:52,403
Natasha, what are you saying?
Think about Father and Nicholas.

1143
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:55,204
I don't love anyone but him.

1144
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:58,178
Go, Sonya.

1145
01:38:58,246 --> 01:39:01,738
I don't want to quarrel
with you. Go away!

1146
01:39:10,358 --> 01:39:14,385
Anatole, where
do you mean to take her?

1147
01:39:14,462 --> 01:39:18,091
Her family will fiind out about that
girl in Poland you had to marry.

1148
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:21,602
- If you're caught, it'll mean jail.
- It will be worth it...

1149
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:26,869
even if it is for one month
or one week with that girl.

1150
01:39:26,942 --> 01:39:30,469
There are some things in life
it's impossible not to have.

1151
01:39:32,914 --> 01:39:37,044
- The driver you sent for, Prince.
- Come here. Have a drink.

1152
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:39,484
- You've got to drive far and fast.
- Call Matrevna.

1153
01:39:39,554 --> 01:39:42,546
- Tell her to bring the cloak.
- We go again, sir?

1154
01:39:42,624 --> 01:39:45,218
- Elopement.
- Oh, I like a job like that!

1155
01:39:45,293 --> 01:39:47,227
Youth, romance, excitement!

1156
01:39:47,295 --> 01:39:49,229
There's a priest of a sort
waiting for us at Tver.

1157
01:39:49,297 --> 01:39:51,424
Run down anyone
who tries to stop you.

1158
01:39:51,499 --> 01:39:53,490
There is a man for you!

1159
01:39:56,338 --> 01:40:00,434
- You want me?
- Now, you take this.

1160
01:40:00,508 --> 01:40:02,840
Listen to me. I know
something about this game.

1161
01:40:02,911 --> 01:40:06,244
You fiind the girl shivering
and having forgotten everything.

1162
01:40:06,314 --> 01:40:09,374
You wrap her up, for the minute
she gets into the cold night air...

1163
01:40:09,451 --> 01:40:12,716
there will be a stampede
back to the house for furs.

1164
01:40:12,787 --> 01:40:16,018
Papa awakened, Mama screaming,
tears, recriminations...

1165
01:40:16,091 --> 01:40:18,218
challenges, etcetera.

1166
01:40:18,293 --> 01:40:21,194
Always keep a young girl
warm, my boy.

1167
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:24,061
Now, up with the collar!

1168
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,232
- Take it.
- Yes, sir!

1169
01:40:30,305 --> 01:40:33,001
- But my cloak.
- I will get another one someday.

1170
01:40:33,074 --> 01:40:36,635
- But when?
- All take glasses! Yours.

1171
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:39,544
Now, comrade
and friend of my youth...

1172
01:40:39,614 --> 01:40:41,775
we've had our fling,
we've lived and reveled.

1173
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,978
Yeah. Now let's... farewell.

1174
01:40:45,053 --> 01:40:46,987
- To your health.
- To your health.

1175
01:40:51,192 --> 01:40:54,684
- How sad it is.
- Sure. Let's go.

1176
01:40:54,763 --> 01:40:57,755
Anatole! I still think
you shouldn't do it.

1177
01:40:57,832 --> 01:40:59,265
So do I.
