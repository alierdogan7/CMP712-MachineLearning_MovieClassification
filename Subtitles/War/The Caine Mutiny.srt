1
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,727
And so today
you are full-fledged ensigns.

2
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,450
Three short months ago,
you assembled here

3
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,940
from all parts of the nation,
and all walks of life. -

4
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:27,193
- Field, factory,
office, and college campuses.

5
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,489
Each of you knew what the fighting was about,
or you wouldn't have volunteered.

6
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:36,869
Each of you knew that the American way of
life must be defended, by life itself.

7
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:41,400
From here on,
your education must continue...

8
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
in the more demanding school
of actual war.

9
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,755
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign
in the United States Navy. -

10
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:53,219
- You go down to the sea to fight in
the toughest conflict of all time.

11
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:56,510
Your fellow Americans share
my confidence that...

12
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,510
you will serve the Navy and the Country
with honor and distinction.

13
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:03,479
Good luck
and good hunting.

14
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:13,614
Mother: Willie,
over here!

15
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:18,950
- Darling, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks, Mother.

16
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,950
- Congratulations, Willie.
- Thanks, Uncle Loyd.

17
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,470
Your mother promised to
let me know if the Navy...

18
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,370
doesn't makes full use of your abilities.

19
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,629
With the proper approach, perhaps I could
help you be placed somewhere else.

20
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:34,302
- Good luck for now, in the meantime.
- Thank you.

21
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:36,910
Mother, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
skip your party tonight.

22
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,010
Some of the fellas are having
a little celebration.

23
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:42,935
But darling, the party's in your honor.
Besides, we have so few days left together.

24
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:48,065
Your friends will forgive you, I'm sure.
You can call them from the house.

Darling,
you were wonderful.

41
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,090
Thanks.
I'm surprised your mother let you out.

42
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,650
I had to be with her.

43
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,350
I should have told you yesterday I couldn't
make it here tonight. I'm sorry.

44
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:54,610
- Order me a drink, then we'll fight.
- Leo, two Scotch and waters, please.

45
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,780
Darling, let's not spoil the night.
I've only got a couple of days left.

46
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:06,662
- I'm leaving Sunday.
- How do you expect me to feel?

47
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,810
Leaving me standing there
all alone.

48
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,210
Willie, why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?

49
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:16,360
I wanted you to met her.
But, there's a time for everything.

50
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm sure.

51
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,391
To the most important woman in your life...
Mom.

52
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,396
- May, stop it.
- I'm sorry, Willie.

53
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:37,060
I didn't mean to ruin your big evening.
I guess, I just bruise easily.

54
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:41,280
Alright,
what do we do to celebrate?

55
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:44,700
We can go to the Fairmont, Top of the Mark,
anything you say...

56
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Or we don't have to go to a club.

57
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:53,459
- Meaning what?
- Look darling, I've only got 48 hours.

58
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:58,047
- Willie, don't.
- May, I love you.

59
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:05,096
All right.
Will you marry me?

60
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,224
Look darling,
if there were more time...

61
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,853
I didn't expect you to.

62
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:17,567
I guess I forgot who I was. Just another
nightclub singer for a big weekend.

63
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:21,612
I don't want any more of it.
Not another minute.

64
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:53,186
- Good luck, Mr. Keith.
- Thanks, George.

65
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:58,107
Goodbye,
Mother.

66
00:07:58,316 --> 00:07:59,610
Drop a cable the minute
you get to Pearl Harbor.

67
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,710
If I can.

68
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,110
I'm terribly worried.
Uncle Loyd tells me...

69
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,510
that ship you've been assigned too
has been in lots of battles.

70
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,720
Mother,
don't worry.

71
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,530
- Do you have enough spending money?
- More than enough.

72
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,000
You'd better take this extra $100, dear.

73
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Mother,
please don't cry.

74
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,580
I can't help it.
You're all I have left.

75
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,900
Willie, promise me you'll be careful. Don't
volunteer or do anything foolish.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,420
Mother,
I won't.

77
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:29,013
I won't. I promise.
Goodbye, sweetheart.

78
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,400
- Request permission to come on board.
- Permission granted.

79
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
- Request permission to come on board.
- Permission granted.

80
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,010
Sir.
the Caine's a real beauty.

81
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,610
The Caine is the inboard ship.
Crossing over.

82
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,310
- Very well.
- This way, Keith.

83
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,000
This way,
Keith.

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,190
Hey!

85
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:30,218
Watch that enthusiasm. Nobody ever felt
that way about the Caine before.

86
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,410
I'm sorry, sir.
I lost my footing.

87
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,010
Keith,
this is our communications officer Lt. Keefer.

88
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,010
- How do you do, sir.
- How about logging him in, Tom

89
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,400
Your orders,
Keith.

90
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,600
Those monstrous papers that transform
ex-civilians into men without minds.

91
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,940
- I hate to be the one that does this to you.
- Gangway, lady with a baby!

92
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:52,970
Meatball, Horrible,
pick up Mr. Keith's gear in the well boat.

93
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,070
Aye, aye, sir.

94
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:00,450
Oh Keith, this is our executive officer,
Steve Maryk.

95
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,750
- Glad to have you on board, Keith.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,970
Steve's our fireball,
the guy who gets things done.

97
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,670
- There's one on every ship.
- Very funny.

98
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,630
Come on Keith,
let's meet the captain.

99
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,230
- Watch your feet, sir!
- Come on, Keith!

100
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,090
They're making a mistake
scraping this ship.

101
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,190
The only thing that's keeping the water out
is the rust.

102
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,320
What do you want?

103
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,120
He's here,
sir.

104
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,730
OK, bring him in.

105
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,330
In here,
Keith.

106
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
Captain DeVriess,
this is Ensign Keith.

107
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,100
Keith!

108
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:10,860
May I see your orders and qualifications jacket,
or are they a military secret?

109
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:12,420
I'm sorry,
sir.

110
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,920
Princeton,
'41...

111
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,000
Top five percent
in midshipman's school...

112
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:31,297
Pretty good background,
pretty good record.

113
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:36,010
Disappointed they assigned you
to a minesweeper, Keith?

114
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,510
Well, sir... to be honest.
Yes, sir.

115
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:43,680
You saw yourself on a carrier,
or a battleship, no doubt?

116
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes sir,
I had hoped that...

117
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:50,358
Well, I only hope that
you're good enough for the Caine.

118
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,420
I'll try to be worthy of this assignment,
sir.

119
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,320
She's not a battleship or a carrier,
the Caine is a beaten-up tub.

120
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:02,570
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hrs
a day just to keep her in one piece.

121
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,870
I understand,
sir.

122
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,610
I don't think
you do.

123
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,710
But whether you like it or not, Keith,
you're in the junkyard navy.

124
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,130
Steve, put in with Keefer
in Communications.

125
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,720
And tell Tom when he's free,
to show this Princeton Tiger

126
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,720
and our other new ensign
around the ship.

127
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes, sir.

128
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,936
And Keith...

129
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:31,274
Don't take it so hard.
War is hell.

130
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,900
- Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.
- My condolences.

131
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
- Thanks.
-Alright, my Junior League\citizens...

132
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,872
Let's get with it.
The USS Caine is a minesweeper.

133
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,120
These paravanes
used for minesweeping.

134
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,620
They carry sweep wires
off both sides of the ship.

135
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:54,005
The wire contacts the mooring cable of a mine
and saws it in two.

136
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,960
We've been in combat a year and a half,
and during that time ...

137
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,960
we've never been asked to
swept one single mine.

138
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,930
So, the first thing you've got to learn
about this ship is that ...

139
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,430
she was designed by geniuses
to be run by idiots.

140
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,190
This is the engine room.

141
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,690
To operate, all you need is any group
of well trained monkeys.

142
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,200
99 percent of what we do
is strict routine,

143
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,900
only one percent requires creative intelligence.

144
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,730
That about does it.
Any more questions?

145
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,530
Yes, sir.
Where do we go to surrender?

146
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:27,960
It's not that easy.

147
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,660
- Sir, you don't like the Navy, do you?
- Who called the Caine <i>"the Navy"</i>?

148
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,250
Well gentlemen, just one more thing to do.
Climb the mast.

149
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:44,263
What for?
A mast is a mast.

150
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,890
When the Captain orders a tour,
he means from the keel to the foretop.

151
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,890
That's the foretop.

152
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:56,984
I have a wife and a kid, I'm very fond of them.
I'll probably never see them again.

153
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,850
Well done!

154
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,350
- I'm glad he liked it.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:39,819
Keith, I regret to tell you, I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:45,324
Height bothers me.
Those poor sailors down there.

157
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,530
I could use my hat,
but it's the only one I've got.

158
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,530
I have two others.

159
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,709
- That's darn cordial of you.
- Perfectly, welcome.

160
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,761
Hey, what's keeping you guys up there?
Lunch!

161
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Lunch!?
Oh!

162
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:16,898
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's all right.

163
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:21,520
Tell me Keith, now that you've had
a chance to study the Caine...

164
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,190
more closely,
do you like her better?

165
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:30,453
- The tour was very interesting, sir.
- Is the ship too messy for you?

166
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,120
- That is a difficult question, sir.
- It's a ridicules question.

167
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,120
The question is,
<i>"Is this mess a ship?"</i>

168
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:42,673
Very decent of you to join us for lunch, Tom.
I didn't think you could spare the time.

169
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:47,094
Well, my novel will suffer, but even the
greatest of literary artists gets hungry.

170
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:50,310
Pull up a chair, Tom, and
cast some pearls before the swine.

171
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,010
- Or whatever it is you say you do.
- I will.

172
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:58,105
Somebody has to protect these fresh eager
young faces from the captain's badgering.

173
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:02,527
I'm not badgering anyone, Tom. I'm just
conducting a one-man board of inquiry.

174
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:07,198
I'm trying to find out if
Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.

175
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:12,010
There is no escape from the Caine, save death.
We are all doing penance.

176
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,330
Sentenced to an outcast ship,
manned by outcasts,

177
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,830
and named after the greatest outcast
of them all.

178
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,250
- Here we go again.
- I'm merely stating absolute fact.

179
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,350
He's right, Steve...

180
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,220
I've been sweating out myself,
waiting for two years to be...

181
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,220
relieved of command,
and there is no sign of it yet.

182
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:35,268
But then...
I don't have Ensign Keith's influence.

183
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,060
Sir,
I don't understand.

184
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:45,111
I received this dispatch from
Admiral Wards about an hour ago.

185
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,075
<i>"With your approval, I will request transfer
to my staff for Ensign Willis Steward Keith."</i>

186
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:56,414
<i>"Understand of course
needs of USS Caine have priority."</i>

187
00:17:56,622 --> 00:18:02,753
- Sir, I didn't know anything about this request.
- Could be coincidence.

188
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:06,465
Or someone pulling strings.

189
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:07,970
What'll it be,
Keith?

190
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,380
The admiral's staff or as Tom puts it:
<i>"the hell of the Caine"?</i>

191
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,430
Well, I don't know,
sir.

192
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,430
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to fight a war?

193
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,560
Captain,
this is hardly a place for a decision.

194
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,560
Oh nonsense, Steve. A good officer should be
able to make up his mind anywhere.

195
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:33,659
- Well, come on, Keith. We haven't got all day.
- Well, sir...

196
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:52,011
- I'll stay on board, sir.
- That takes care of that.

197
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,097
Ah Willie,
you will live to regret this day.

198
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:17,360
Sir, I spotted a lot of Japanese aircraft
off the starboard bow. Position, Angle 20.

199
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,660
Angle 20.

200
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,916
You see them,
Captain?

201
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:28,047
If the war last ten years Keith, you may learn
to tell the difference between aircraft and seagulls.

202
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:44,856
<i>"Man all stations for minesweeping drill.
Man all stations for minesweeping drill."</i>

203
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,360
Launch sweep gear.

204
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,060
<i>"Launch sweep gear."</i>

205
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,288
Port paravanes in the water.

206
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,030
<i>"Steve, that was the lousiest performance
I've ever seen.  </i>

207
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,730
<i>"Tell the men to get the lead out."</i>

208
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,730
Stand by to stream starboard side.

209
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,000
Retrieve sweep gear.

210
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,510
<i>"Retrieve sweep gear."</i>

211
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,995
<i>"C'mon Steve, snap it up.
The Jones is beating us in."</i>

212
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,130
Look out!

213
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,400
Stop the engines.
Get me a line.

214
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
You're not going to swim for it,
the water's full of sharks.

215
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,420
- Stand by the line.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:07,063
Mr. Keith, this action dispatch just arrived.
Mr. Keefer said you had the code duty.

217
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,310
I'll take care of it
right away.

218
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,080
OK!
Haul away!

219
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,840
Lead the line
outboard of everything.

220
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,240
Report
<i>"float recovered."</i>

221
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,961
The Jones never saw the day
they could beat us.

222
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,216
You pooped out, Steve! We streamed three
minutes quicker at Guadalcanal.

223
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,930
You must love that guy
to do what you did for him.

224
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,180
Go dry yourself,
Keith.

225
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:39,155
- Is that you, Willie?
- Yeah.

226
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,700
Hey Willie,
didn't you say you went to Princeton?

227
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,700
I didn't say.

228
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,700
Well, maybe one of these days I'll let you read
a couple of chapters of my novel.

229
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:51,450
- A Princeton man's opinion might be valuable.
- Thanks.

230
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,930
- Horrible!
- Yes, sir?

231
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,420
Pick up those orange peels.
This isn't a hunting barge.

232
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Yes, sir

233
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
[Meatball laughs]

234
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:25,451
Alright Meatball, laugh once more
and you're in trouble.

235
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,440
[Bosun's whistle sounds off]

236
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,950
Over intercom: <i>"Ensign Keith, report to
the Captain's cabin.  </i>

237
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,550
<i>"On the double,
on the double!"</i>

238
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,680
Oh these 90-day wonders...

239
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,980
Everyone one of them thinks
they're five-star admiral.

240
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah.

241
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,250
[Knocks on door]

242
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,600
- Come in.
- Yes, sir?

243
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,570
Keiths, three days ago, this ship received a
dispatch addressed to us for action.

244
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,780
- Smitty here, says he gave it to you.
Is that correct?

245
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,780
Yes, sir. I forgot about it.
It's still in the pocket of my dirty khaki.

246
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:15,793
- Did you decode the message?
- No, sir.

247
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,500
It's incredible stupidity
and carelessness on my part...

248
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,500
Fortunately,
I had the job done for you.

249
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:23,000
- That'll be all, Smitty.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:27,720
Keith...

251
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:33,500
Have you any idea how serious misplacing
an action dispatch can be?

252
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,170
Yes, sir.

253
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,390
I don't think you have.

254
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,690
Because of you, this ship might have failed
to carry out a combat assignment.

255
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,200
I hope you realize that
for such a failure,

256
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,700
I would bear the full responsibility
in a court martial.

257
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,490
I understand,
sir.

258
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:55,010
I've been filling out officer's fitness
reports this morning, Keith.

259
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,630
- How you think this ought to affect yours?
- Anyone can make a mistake, sir.

260
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,460
There are mistakes
and mistakes.

261
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,460
The margin for error
is narrow in the Navy, Keith.

262
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:11,015
There's too much loss of life and property
damage possible in every act.

263
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,390
Here.

264
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,390
Read it.

265
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:22,485
<i>"Ensign Keith seems
a fairly bright young man."</i>

266
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:26,781
<i>"He may become a competent officer
once he overcomes...</i>

267
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:30,159
<i>...the light and careless approach
to his duties."</i>

268
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,450
- Do you consider that fair?
- Sir, if I may be permitted...

269
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,950
Go ahead,
Keith.

270
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:39,460
I made a mistake, but I don't see why
I should be singled out for it.

271
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Everyones goofed off
around here.

272
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,000
The Caine's a slack ship.

273
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,500
The men act like a pack of cut throats,
and the decks look like a Singapore junk.

274
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:51,347
I take it than, you must also
strongly disapprove of me.

275
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:58,187
- Go ahead Keith, man to man.
- Sir, I'm in no position to approve or disapprove.

276
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:02,066
I only know my conception of a captain
seems different from your own.

277
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:06,863
I'll take it under advisement.
Since you feel so bitter. -

278
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:11,110
- Perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day.

279
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:16,120
As you can see Keith,
I'm being relieved of command.

280
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,793
Next week, this time,
you'll have yourself a new captain.

281
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,466
Lieutenant Commander
Philip Francis Queeg. Feel better?

282
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:32,680
- Definitely, sir.
- Good. That'll be all, Keith.

- Thank you.

Crew dismissed.

293
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:33,550
Oh... ah Captain,
if you would like me too,

294
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,950
I'll stay aboard for a couple of days
till you get used to the feel of things.

295
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,270
No thanks. There's no need for that. We all
have our own ways of running a ship.

296
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,870
Sure.

297
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,580
This one's tired.
She's had the guts run out of her.

298
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,080
She ought to be melted down
for razor blades.

299
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:53,761
The crew may not look like much,
they're tired, too. Every man is okay.

300
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,848
- I understand.
- I hope you do.

301
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,250
Yours, Captain.

302
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,110
Attention on deck.

303
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,810
- Request permission to leave to leave the ship.
- Permission, granted, sir.

304
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,210
Captain,
sir?

305
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,440
- What is it, Meatball?
- Nothing, sir.

306
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:17,326
Well, a few of the guys chipped in and...

307
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,200
Whose idea was this?

308
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:28,340
Well, I won't accept it.
It's against Navy regulations.

309
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,340
- Well, that's what I told them, sir
- You don't always go by regulations, Captain.

310
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:35,887
That's my trouble.
I've been aboard the Caine too long.

311
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,720
Now you men take an even strain
with the new skipper,

312
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,720
and everything
will be all right.

313
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:47,064
- I'm leaving the ship, sir.
- Yes, sir.

What do you know? Somebody
left his watch lying around.

316
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:13,257
I might as well have a souvenir of this old bucket.
Not a bad-looking watch at that.

- 11:00, sir.

Make it 10:30.
I'll always keep it a half hour slow -

319
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:26,229

of the fouled-up crew of the Caine.

so choked up for?

officers at in the wardroom 13:00.</i>

324
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:20,690
Well gentlemen,
we'll gonna be shipmates for a long time.

325
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,910
I though we ought
to get acquainted.

326
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,165
I've formed some pretty good impressions.
You're probably curious about me.

327
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:31,252
Well, my background is simple enough.
Just another naval officer.

328
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,600
I've had seven tough years
in the Atlantic.

329
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,410
Believe-you-me,
they made the last two mighty interesting.

330
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:42,900
The way those subs ganged up on us,
I thought they had it in for me personally.

331
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
Now,
to get down to cases.

332
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,980
Anyone who knows me,
will tell you I'm a book man.

333
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,680
I believe everything in it was put
in for a purpose.

334
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:54,275
When in doubt, remember on board this ship,
we do things by the book.

335
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,610
Deviate from the book, and you've better
have a half a dozen good reasons,

336
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,110
and you'll still will get
an argument from me.

337
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:02,870
And I don't lose arguments
on board my ship.

338
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,370
That's one of the nice things
about being captain.

339
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,990
Now I want you to remember
one thing,

340
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,710
on board my ship
excellent performance is standard. -

341
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,000
standard performance
is sub-standard,

342
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,590
and sub-standard performance is not
permitted to exist. That, I warn you.

343
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:23,040
OK?
Now that I've shot my face off,

344
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I'll give anyone who wants too,
the chance to do the same thing.

345
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,920
Captain,
I don't want to seem out of line,

346
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,190
but it's been a long time since
this crew did things by the book.

347
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,690
Mr. Maryk,
you may tell the crew for me...

348
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,400
there are four ways
of doing things on board my ship:

349
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,770
The right way, the wrong way,
the Navy way, and my way.

350
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,160
- They do things my way, and we'll get along.
- Aye, aye, sir.

351
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,400
Okay?
Anyone else?

352
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,540
[Knock on door]

353
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,793
Come in.

354
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:58,130
Beg pardon, Captain. Sorry to interrupt.
Official message from ComServ Pac.

355
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,630
Thank you.

356
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:07,430
One moment,
messenger.

357
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,270
What's your name
and rate?

358
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,270
Urban, sir.
Seaman First, Signalman Striker.

359
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,862
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:43,170
Gentlemen,
did anyone notice anything peculiar...

361
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,170
about Seaman First Class Urban?

362
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:50,900
A shirt-tail hanging outside trousers
is the regulation uniform,

363
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,140
I believe,
for bus boys...

364
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,730
not however,
for a sailor in the US Navy.

365
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,730
These are the things we are going
to start noticing again.

366
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,154
- Maryk, who's the Morale Officer?
- There is no Moral Officer, sir.

367
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:06,240
- Who's the Junior Ensign?
- Keith, sir.

368
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:08,500
Mr. Keith?
Sir?

369
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,070
You are now the Morale Officer.

370
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,450
In addition to your other duties,

371
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,250
you will now see to it that every man keeps
his shirt-tail tucked inside his trousers.

372
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,250
Aye aye, sir.

373
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,250
OK...

374
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,801
If I see another shirt-tail flapping while
I'm Captain of this ship...

375
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:28,400
Woe betide the sailor,
woe betide the OOD,

376
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,800
and woe betide the Morale Officer.
I kid you not.

377
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Now...

378
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,310
according to this dispatch,
we are to proceed to Area X-ray...

379
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,000
at 08:00 tomorrow
to tow targets.

380
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:41,870
I'm going to give it to you simply.

381
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,070
The Caine is going to be the best
target-towing ship in this man's navy.

382
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,740
That'll be all,
gentlemen.

383
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:54,910
Mr. Keith, I want all the men to have their hair
cut to regulation length,

384
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,410
and their faces clean shaven
by 24:00.

385
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,210
Aye, aye, sir.

386
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,510
Well,
he's certainly Navy.

387
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,010
Yeah,
so was Captain Bligh.

388
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:26,112
Intercom: <i>"Attention all hands.
Attention all hands. </i>

389
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:29,200

on the double. On the double. "</i>

396
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,160
Yes, sir!

397
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:26,000
Keith, do you have any explanation
for the appearance of this sailor?

398
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,230
- Corporal, you heard my order on shirt-tails.
- Sir, I've got a heat rash...

399
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,630
Well,  tuck your shirt in,
now.

400
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:33,140
Sir,
the captain won't let me.

401
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,340
Of course not. I want you to see the
rotten job you're doing, Mr...

402
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:42,313
<i>- Gwendolyn, Gwendolyn, this is Tarzan.
- Tarzan, this is Gwendolyn.</i>

403
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,859
<i>Cease present exercises
and return to base. Well done. Out. </i>

404
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:50,530
Roger.
Thank you, sir.

405
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:54,000
We're heading back.
Right standard rudder.

406
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:56,240
And now,
Mr. Keith...

407
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,740
First of all, do you or don't you have
an explanation for this?

408
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:01,220
Sir, I was on the fantail-

409
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,620
I didn't ask for an alibi. Evidently,
my orders must mean very little to you.

410
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:07,540
Sir, I'm completely at fault,
but I tried my best.

411
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,340
Your <i>"best",</i> Mr. Keith,
is only a maximum of inefficiency.

412
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,900
Hey, what's the matter with the old man?
We're steaming in a circle.

413
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,390
Yeah,
I know.

414
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,970
- Captain...
- Will you not interrupt while I'm speaking?

415
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,830
Captain,
we're going around in cir...

416
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:26,040
One more word out of you,
and you're on report.

417
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,940
Aye, aye, sir.

418
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:29,400
And you, Mr. Keefer, can you explain why the
first violation...

419
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,400
occurred while you were
officer of the deck?

420
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,400
There are limits to what a man can do
when he has the deck.

421
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:38,570
Mr. Keefer, the officer of the deck is
as equally as responsible his duties...

422
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,910
as I am for the welfare
of this ship.

423
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:45,626
And one thing more, mister.
War is a 24-hour job.

424
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:49,922
There will be no more
<i>"novel-writing"</i> on the Caine.

425
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:59,223
Mr. Keith, Mr. Keefer, you will both
submit written reports explaining:

426
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:01,430
A. Why this man had
his shirt-tail out.

427
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,290
B. Why you failed so miserably
to carry my orders out.

428
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,390
Keefer:
Aye, aye, sir.

429
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:15,156
Meatball, look! I'm I seeing straight or
are we cutting back across our tow?

430
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,744
It's impossible.
But it's happened!

431
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:26,900
We're gonna cut our own tow line.
You'd better tell him again.

432
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Not, me.

433
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
[Loud screeching sound]

434
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,760
What's happening?
What's going on?

435
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,760
[Loud snapping sound]

436
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,310
What's our target
doing out there?

437
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:50,790
What blazes were you two doing?

438
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,790
Sir, you told me to keep
right standard rudder. I was just...

439
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,190
You idiot.
All engines stop.

440
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:07,870
Captain, we've steamed
over our tow line.

441
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,080
Who said we steamed over the tow line?
Who said that?

442
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,590
We've cut the target adrift.

443
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,290
We did nothing of the kind. Something
must have been wrong with the cable.

444
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,970
We can hardly be held responsible
if we're given faulty cable...

445
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,470
that breaks the minute
the ship turns a few degrees.

446
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,391
Sir, should we recover the target?
It shouldn't take more than half an hour.

447
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:28,771
Half an hour? That means we'll be the last ship
back in Pearl Harbor. No thank you.

448
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,930
We're not going to have to answer
a lot of questions...

449
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
about something that's
not our fault.

450
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,155
- Reel in the cable.
- Aye, aye, sir.

451
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:46,330
Mr. Keefer, send the following dispatch.
ComServ Pac:

452
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:53,296
<i>"Defective tow line parted,
south-west corner, x-ray."</i>

453
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:57,758
<i>"Target adrift.
Menace to navigation."</i>

454
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:02,722
<i>"Suggest tug,
recover or destroy."</i>

455
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:07,518
He'll never get away with it.

456
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,180
Now, let's head for the barn.
Aye, aye, sir.

457
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,980
All engines ahead full.

458
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,000
All engines ahead full,
sir.

459
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,840
Queeg: Willie?
- Sir?

460
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,040
You look worried?

461
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:36,320
I know a man's shirt is a petty detail, but
big things are made up of details.

462
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,920
Don't forget...

463
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,760
For want of a nail, a horseshoe
was lost, and then the whole battle.

464
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,000
A captain's job is a lonely one.
He's easily misunderstood.

465
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:53,610
Forget that I bawled you out. It was good
for the morale of all concerned.

466
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,810
OK?

467
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,528
Yes, sir.

468
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,380
Keefer:
Hallelujah!

469
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,560
Look what just came in.
We're going back to San Francisco.

470
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,160
San Francisco?
You're kidding.

471
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:18,673
All thanks to our beloved Captain Queeg.
He's in plenty of hot water.

472
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,300
I told you the Navy would never accept his
double talk about the towing line.

473
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,800
They can't be sending us all the way back
just for that?

474
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,150
Listen to this: <i>"Upon arrival,
Commanding Officer USS Caine...</i>

475
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,470
<i>"report immediately
Commander Western Sea Frontier."</i>

476
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,470
I tell you Willie,
he's in serious trouble.

477
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:35,590
Our Captain is about
to be boiled in oil.

478
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,190
And you, you lucky fellow,
are about to see your girl.

479
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,750
Willie!

480
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,383
- Willie, darling.
- Mother.

481
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:48,650
This is a real surprise.

482
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,950
Well, you didn't expect me not to be here,
did you?

483
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,350
Oh, it's wonderful to have
my boy close again.

484
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:03,230
Mother... I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine. May Wynn.

485
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:09,283
I'm always delighted
to meet one of Willie's friends.

486
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,619
Thank you.

487
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:22,046
Hello, Oh! Hello, May?
Sure! I'll be right down then. Okay.

488
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,350
Well, I guess I'm ready to go, mother.
I'm afraid I'm going to miss you all.

489
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,050
It's just a weekend at Yosemite.

490
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:33,182
- A sailor needs some play time.
- Miss Wynn's going with you?

491
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,000
Yes,
she is.

492
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:40,356
- You must feel strongly about her.
- I do, mother. I like her a lot.

493
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:47,488
- You have a nice weekend yourself.
- Are you in love with her, Willie?

494
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:51,325
I don't know. But I sure missed her
every minute I was away.

495
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:55,746
Well, she is attractive, but you
don't know anything about her.

496
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,520
You haven't even
met her parents.

497
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,120
That's right. I guess I'll have
to do that someday.

498
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:03,990
Wille, for your own sake,
all I want you to do is...

499
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,590
well, promise you won't
do anything rash.

500
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:08,620
- I promise.
- You mean it, Willie?

501
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,920
Sure,
I mean it.

502
00:43:11,095 --> 00:43:13,010
Goodbye,
Mom.

503
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:38,581
Easy, May.
That's good.

504
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:47,920
Well,
how did you like it?

505
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,420
It's like breaking in a new song.
Fun but scary.

506
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:55,973
You know, it was nice of your mother
to let you come to Yosemite like this.

507
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,268
- It wasn't up to my mother.
- Well...

508
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:03,648
- It looks like the war has made a difference.
- Has it?

509
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:08,736
I missed you more than
I planned to.

510
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:15,910
Announcer:
<i>"Let the fire fall!" </i>

511
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,169
- May: This is paradise.
- Willie: Isn't it.

512
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:34,510
- Willie, there are people.
- Let them look.

513
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,852
You have changed. Sometimes I think
there's almost a chance for us.

514
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:50,820
- Willie, it's getting late.
- It's getting very late.

515
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:20,930
I'll wait,
thanks.

516
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:24,450
Good morning, darling.
Sorry I'm late.

517
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,850
I guess I'm not used to being
without an alarm clock.

518
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:31,777
- What a day. Have you ordered yet?
- Not yet.

519
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:35,323
- Just some orange juice and coffee, please.
- Make it two.

520
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,880
Do you know what I would like to do?
I'd love to take a long walk.

521
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,280
Climb to the top of that mountain
over there.

522
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:48,503
- Darling, what's the matter?
- Just thinking.

523
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:51,790
Well, come on now, somethings the matter.
I expected you to be happy...

524
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:57,220
May, what would you think about spending
the rest of your life with a monster like me?

525
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:01,974
- What's this?
- I'm talking about our getting married.

526
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,940
Is that what
you really want?

527
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,940
Of course I want it.
Don't look at me as if I'm a crazy.

528
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:13,440
I don't want you to marrying me because
you feel sorry for me.

529
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,040
Because you think it's the
decent thing to do.

530
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,614
Look, May...

531
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,618
I love you and I want to marry you.
Yes or no?

532
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,660
No.

533
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Why not?

534
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:31,060
Because your mother won't approve.
I think that's whats bothering you.

535
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,080
Of course she'll approve.

536
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,380
She won't approve, but you'll marry me anyway
and you'll be so unhappy.

537
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:40,346
I won't be unhappy.
I love you.

538
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:44,183
Maybe you do...
really do.

539
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:50,398
But marriage has to be by your own approval.
No one else's.

540
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:53,401
That's asking a lot,
May.

541
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:58,530
That's right.

542
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:08,249
Have a good cry, Willie.
I know I will.

543
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,490
Well brother, in another 30 seconds
you'd have been AWOL.

544
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,920
I just got the telegram.

545
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,820
And you just couldn't tear yourself away
from your girl?

546
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,820
Yeah.

547
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,310
Any news on Queeg?

548
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,810
Queeg: <i>"Tangle up all lines
and stand by to cast off. </i>

549
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:38,905
<i>"Hope you haven't been inconvenienced any,
Mr. Keith. "</i>

550
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:42,408
Looks like you made a slight mistake, Tom.
He's still here.

551
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:45,490
My mistake was nothing
compared to the Navy's.

552
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,990
Take in the bow.

553
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:56,210
Well gentlemen,
as you probably know by now,

554
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,710
we returned to San Francisco
for a new radar installation.

555
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:03,470
However, certain misleading reports on things
that happened at Pearl Harbor...

556
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,470
were sent to
the Force Commander.

557
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,250
This created doubts in his mind
about the Caine's competence...

558
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,850
to be returned
to combat.

559
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:12,990
I made it clear to him that I inherited a ship
in a low state of training...

560
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,690
and I could hardly be expected to pull it
into shape overnight, he agreed.

561
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:21,490
So from now on, gentlemen,
there will not be further mistakes...

562
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,990
on the part of the officers
and crew of this ship.

563
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,850
[Coughing] Sorry sir,
some smoke went down the wrong way.

564
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,790
This,
is an important command.

565
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:32,290
The Navy's is probably waiting for me
to make a butch,

566
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,790
Well I'm not going to make it and I'm not going
to permit anybody to make it for me.

567
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:39,670
So much for old business.

568
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,630
Gentlemen,
I've have good news for you.

569
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,970
We're on our way to
the greatest invasion attempted in this war.

570
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:53,145
I kid you not. The greatest.
So let's all straighten up and fly right.

571
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:15,293
All hands, put on battle dress.

572
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,250
[ Blowing: <i>"General Call"</i> ]

573
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:23,926
<i>"All hands, put on battle dress
and anti-flash cream."</i>

574
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:36,022
We don't have to shot the Japs.
We can scare them to death.

575
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:24,862
Cease fire, cease fire.
Keith: <i>"Cease fire, cease fire."</i>

576
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:26,990
Close the boat group and take stations.
Mr. Keith, you take the com.

577
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,390
Aye, aye, sir.

578
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:47,969
That's the group we're suppose to take in.
Jacob Group Four.

579
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:50,300
Correct course, 045.
<i>"045",</i> aye, aye.

580
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,300
All engines, ahead full.
<i>"All engines, ahead full."</i>

581
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:02,480
We're closing too fast.
We're gonna run those boats down.

582
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,480
Where's the captain?

583
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:04,730
He's on the wing.

584
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,730
On the wing? How can he left you handle
the ship at a time like this?

585
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,825
All engines stop.
- <i>"All engines stop."</i>

586
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:16,500
Boats ahoy!
Boats ahoy!

587
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,890
What's going on?
Who's yelling at whom, here?

588
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,790
Sorry, sir. It looked like we were overshooting
these boys, so I stopped.

589
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,860
Well, let's get it over with.
What's the distance to the beach?

590
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,960
About three miles, sir.
We're suppose to take...

591
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:29,060
I just want to know the yardage,
OK?

592
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,760
Steve, you take the com, get us there.
Full speed ahead.

593
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,019
We will proceed.
Follow us. Good luck.

594
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,010
OK,
thanks.

595
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:55,661
Left tangent: 006.

596
00:51:55,828 --> 00:52:00,166
- Beacon: 084.
- Distance: 5,000.

597
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:22,939
We're pulling too far ahead of the attack group.
All engines back one third.

598
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:34,325
Left tangent: 350.

599
00:52:34,492 --> 00:52:38,955
- Beacon: 116.
- Distance: 4,000.

600
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,870
Why are we slowing down?
Sir, we we're losing them.

601
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,170
If they can't keep up with us, throw over
a dye marker when we reach the spot.

602
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:59,050
Hey, we're getting too close.
You want to run us on the beach?

603
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,480
Sir, we still have at least 1,500 yards
to go with the boats.

604
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,480
1,500 yards?
You're crazy.

605
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,860
I can read instruments
as well as anybody on this ship.

606
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,690
We're within 1,000 yards
of the beach right now.

607
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,690
This is as far as we're
suppose to take them.

608
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:14,400
- Left full rudder.
- <i>"Left full rudder."</i>

609
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,700
- All engines ahead full.
- <i>"All engines ahead full."</i>

610
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:18,160
- Throw over a dye marker.
- But, Captain...

611
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,260
You heard me,
throw over a dye marker.

612
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,660
Fantail from the bridge,
throw over a dye marker.

613
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,270
Sir, we can't leave
those marines...

614
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,270
Mr. Maryk, I'm taking the com,
I'm relieving you.

615
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,970
Aye, aye, sir.

616
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:58,070
- What's he doing? Running away?
- Don't look for trouble, Tom.

617
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,430
Well...

618
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:12,480
What do you think of
your boy now?

619
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,880
I don't know.

620
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,890
- There must be a reason for what he did.
- Yeah. There's a reason, all right.

621
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:39,951
<i>"I've got those yellow stain blues
those silly yellow stain blues</i>

622
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:45,540

623
00:54:45,706 --> 00:54:52,088
<i>"I've got those yellow stain blues
the old yellow stain blues</i>

624
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:56,968
<i>"those yellow stain blues. "</i>

625
00:54:57,134 --> 00:55:00,230
- We'd better pipe down.
- Don't be so worried, Willie.

626
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,970
You know, it's about time you
got over being impressed

627
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,070
by people in authority like parents
and ship captains.

628
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,740
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome.

629
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,640
Shhh...
more, more.

630

if he should spy a shirt-tail..." </i>

632
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,163
- OK Buddy, cut it.
- Oh Steve, I thought you'd be amused.

633
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:27,300
This is magnificent saga of a man who's lack of
charm...

634
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,500
is only exceeded by his
lack of intestinal fortitude.

635
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,960
It's not funny Tom,
and you ought to know better.

636
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,080
Find somebody else to sing about.
That's an order.

637
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:37,250
Why, <i>"Old Yellowstain"</i>
ought to be flattered.

638
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,260
I don't want to hear the name
<i>"Old Yellowstain"</i> again.

639
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,760
Yes, sir.

640
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,600
The captain wants a meeting
in the wardroom, immediately.

641
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,600
And he kids us not.

642
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:56,950
Now, don't get up gentlemen, please.
I'm not too feeling well.

643
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,150
What I have to say
won't take long.

644
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:03,500
That'll be all,
steward.

645
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:16,923
I know that some of you are perhaps
a little afraid of me.

646
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:21,344
I'm not that terrible.
I have a wife and a child and a dog.

647
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:27,808
They're rather fond of me. Even
the dog doesn't think I'm a monster.

648
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,064
Perhaps certain things
happened today.

649
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:36,440
Well, as I always say,
a command is a lonely job.

650
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,440
It isn't easy to make decisions.

651
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:42,000
Sometimes the captain of a ship
needs help...

652
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,280
by help I mean...
constructive loyalty.

653
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,960
What I'm trying to say is,
a ship is like a family.

654
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,960
We all have our ideas
of right and wrong. -

655
00:56:56,128 --> 00:57:00,716
- But we have to pitch in
for the good of the family.

656
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,050
If there was only some way
we could help each other.

657
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,810
I, ah...

658
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:21,445
If there is anything, any of you would like to say,
I.. I mean, I'll be glad to listen.

659
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:36,294
Well, I've spoken my piece.
I only hope it registers.

660
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,390
Don't get up,
please.

661
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:46,510
Painter, have the pharmacist mate
send up some more aspirin.

662
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,510
My headache's much worse.

663
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:49,840
Yes, sir.

664
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:06,699
This is what is known
in literature as the <i>"pregnant pause."</i>

665
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:29,847
Well, there's only one thing left to do,
write to Walter Winchell.

666
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:35,770
- He almost made me feel sorry for him.
- Don't be so sentimental, Willie.

667
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:38,000
I thought it was a
pretty good speech.

668
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:42,250
It wasn't exactly an apology, but it was
as close as he could get to one.

669
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,650
We could have
backed him up.

670
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,782
What could we have said? He turned yellow
the first time we got into action.

671
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:50,540
Look Princeton, you know from nothing
about DeVriess...

672
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,240
and you know even less
about Queeg.

673
00:58:53,412 --> 00:58:56,332
He's a tired man .
His nerves are shot.

674
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,253
It's happened before that a man loses his
head after what Queeg has gone through.

675
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:03,464
That's an endearing explanation,
but it won't hold.

676
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:09,262
Has the thought ever occurred to you that
our captain might be unbalanced?

677
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:12,723
I'm no psychiatrist, but I know something
about abnormal behavior.

678
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,470
Captain Queeg has every symptom of
acute paranoia.

679
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,470
It's just a question of time before
he goes over the line.

680
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:21,482
- Step outside, Keith.
- I'd like to stay, sir.

681
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:27,488
- Let him. He studied psychology at college.
- You're fooling with dynamite, Tom.

682
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:29,940
Will you look at the man?
He's a Freudian delight.

683
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,740
He crawls with clues.

684
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,290
His fixation on the little rolling balls.

685
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,000
The chattering in second-hand phrases
and slogans.

686
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,290
His inability to look you in the eye.
The constant migraine headaches...

687
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:42,940
Shirt-tails, and tonight's pathetic speech:

688
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,040
<i>"Forget about my turning yellow,
my dog likes me."</i>

689
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,370
- I think Tom does make sense.
- You stay out of it.

690
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,470
Alright...

691
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,660
so he has migraine headaches
and he rolls steel balls.

692
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,760
And he does a lot of other screwy things,
so what?

693
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:01,772
You used to get up before reveille,
and fill a lot of paper with scribbling.

694
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:04,901
Everybody's a screwball in some way.
That doesn't make them crazy.

695
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:08,112
You're kidding yourself,
Steve.

696
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:11,010
Alright, will you go over to
the fleet medical officer with me,

697
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:14,110
and repeat everything
you've told me?

698
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:15,860
Do you agree with my diagnosis
of Queeg?

699
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,160
Not with a word of it, even if I understood
what you were talking about.

700
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:22,370
Well then, why should you expect me to take
the whole thing on my shoulders?

701
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,370
You are his executive officer, if you don't see it,
I wouldn't stand a chance.

702
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:29,000
OK then,
we drop it right now.

703
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,590
There'll be no more talk about
the captain being crazy.

704
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,180
It's like running around explosives
with a blow torch.

705
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,180
I still insist he's
a paranoia case

706
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:44,982
See this bible?

707
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:46,400
I swear to you on this,

708
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,400
I'll report to the captain anything further
you say along those lines.

709
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:54,617
There's no more friendship on this point.
That's the straight dope.

710
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:32,196
<i>"Medical log
on Lieutenant Commander X-ray. </i>

711
01:01:32,363 --> 01:01:36,784
<i>"This log is being started because
the possibility appears to exist -</i>

712
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:40,780
<i>"- that the commander of this ship
may be mentally disturbed."</i>

713
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,790
<i>"March 5, 1944. This evening,
as usual, </i>

714
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:51,290
<i>we were showing a Hopalong Cassidy
movie on the foresail ... "</i>

715
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:04,270
Stop the picture!
Will you please stop this picture!

716
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:06,190
Attention on deck!

717
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:11,140
May I ask, why I wasn't notified that
this movie was being shown?

718
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,440
Sir, last week you told me you
couldn't look at another Western.

719
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
So I just assumed...

720
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:18,951
You assumed! This was calculated disrespect
to your commanding officer.

721
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:23,000
All right. There will be
no more movies for 30 days.

722
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:31,797
<i>"May 28, 1944. Morale couldn't be lower.
The crew is resentful. </i>

723
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:35,960
<i>"The officers are just going through
the motions of carrying out orders. </i>

724
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,200
<i>"This afternoon, the captain decided
to hold a general drill...  </i>

725
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,600
<i>"for the instruction
and safety of the crew..."</i>

726
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:15,930
This is the captain speaking.

727
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,630
A great many men have ignored
my orders about wearing battle gear.

728
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,630
So there is only one way
to drive the point home.

729
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:26,000
Every man not wearing a helmet or lifejacket
will be docked 3 days liberty.

730
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:40,420
I see you! Now I want that knocked that off!
Stop putting on that gear!

731
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,820
- Mr. Keith.
- Sir?

732
01:03:41,993 --> 01:03:44,580
Put that man down there without
a lifejacket on report.

733
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,880
Which one,
sir?

734
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,580
That one down there,
on number one machine gun!

735
01:03:51,752 --> 01:03:54,920
You people think you're very clever.
Well, you're not fooling me!

736
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:06,180
Get that red-headed fellow over there.
That one there!

737
01:04:09,103 --> 01:04:10,970
Sir, it's impossible to tell
which one's red-headed.

738
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,270
- They're all wearing their helmets.
- Keith, you're an idiot!

739
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:20,710
This is the captain speaking.

740
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:25,410
Some misguided sailors on this ship still think
they can pull a fast one on me.

741
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:26,950
Well, they're very
much mistaken.

742
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,950
Since you've taken this course,  the innocent
will be punished with the guilty.

743
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:33,080
There will be no liberty for any member
of this crew, for three months.

744
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,580
I will not be made a fool of.
Do you hear me?

745
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:45,389
<i>"July 30, 1944. Today we received
a gift from officers of the USS Pinkney. </i>

746
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:48,768
<i>"A gallon of frozen strawberries. </i>

747
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:54,190
<i>"I was checking the watch at 1:00 in the
morning when I spoke to Ensign Keith..." </i>

748
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,000
How's it going?

749
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,670
Situation quiet, the captain's been put away
for the night.

750
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,730
Lay off.

751
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:06,770
Steve, you know that I was with you,
and against Tom at the beginning.

752
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,700
But I don't see how the Caine can go on
like this much longer. No ship can.

753
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,000
You haven't the experience to know,
one way or the other.

754
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,338
- I'm not blind. I've watched the men.
- All right, all right.

755
01:05:17,505 --> 01:05:20,910
The captain's in rocky shape, but he'll
come out of it. He's got too.

756
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:25,370
Mr. Maryk, Mr. Keith, the captain wants
a meeting of all officers right away.

757
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,660
- Now, at 01:00 in the morning?
- Yes, sir.

758
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,160
Do you know what's it about?

759
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,760
Yes, sir,
Strawberries.

760
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,000
Are you sure this
is a gallon can?

761
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:40,440
Yes, sir. It's a lard can.
Just took it from the pantry, sir.

762
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:45,199
I suppose you're wondering
why I called this meeting.

763
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:47,910
As you all know by now, we had an
excellent dessert for dinner tonight,

764
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,410
ice cream and frozen strawberries.

765
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,920
Well, about an hour ago, I sent Whitaker
to the pantry to bring me another portion.

766
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,120
He came back with the ice cream
all right.

767
01:05:56,294 --> 01:06:00,000
But he said:
<i>"Sir, there ain't no more strawberries."</i>

768
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:04,450
Now gentlemen, I do not believe that
the officers of this ship consumed...

769
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,220
a full gallon of strawberries at dinner tonight.
And I intent to prove it.

770
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,937
Mr. Maryk, how many portions of ice cream
and strawberries did you have?

771
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,190
- Two, sir.
- Whitaker...

772
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:20,050
dole out a scoop of sand
for each portion of strawberry.

773
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,150
Yes, sir.

774
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:30,703
- Mr. Keefer, how many for you?
- Three, Captain.

775
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:38,794
- Keith?
- Two, sir.

776
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:42,465
- Harding?
- Two, sir.

777
01:06:47,512 --> 01:06:50,097
- Painter?
- Two, sir.

778
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,800
- Comedy?
- Two, sir.

779
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,100
- Jorgensen...?
- Two, sir.

780
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,100
-Laughlin?
-Two, sir.

781
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,760
And the steward's mates had three.
Right, Whitaker?

782
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,660
Yes sir,
one helping each, sir.

783
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:14,455
- Mr. Keith said it was okay.
- Yes, I did, sir.

784
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:21,003
And I had four.

785
01:07:22,547 --> 01:07:26,217
Twenty-four portions in all.

786
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:32,000
Now gentlemen, this tureen holds
an amount of sand that is equal...

787
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,410
to the amount of strawberries we had
at dinner tonight. Right, Whitaker?

788
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,310
Yes, sir.

789
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:40,481
Mr. Maryk, take a look at this gallon can
and tell me how much sand is left.

790
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,610
Maybe a quart,
or a little less.

791
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,780
OK...

792
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:54,990
have any of you gentlemen an explanation for
the quart of missing strawberries?

793
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
There can be no doubt that someone else
finished them for us.

794
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,000
As of now gentlemen, you are all appointed
to a board of investigation...

795
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,750
to find out who's responsible
for this theft.

796
01:08:05,923 --> 01:08:10,553
- Mr. Maryk, you are the senior member.
- Do you mean in the morning, sir?

797
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,210
Now Mr. Maryk, according to my watch,

798
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:15,510
does not mean in the morning,
it means 01:47.

799
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:18,000
I expect a full report by 08:00.

800
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:23,630
Alright, alright, pipe down.

801
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:26,230
The faster we get  this done,
the faster we can get some sleep.

802
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,090
Send in the stewards one at a time
for questioning.

803
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,190
Yes, sir.

804
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:35,470
If only the strawberries had been poisoned,
all our problems would have been solved.

805
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,570
Strawberries,
anyone?

806
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:48,716
- Unsatisfactory.
- Sorry, Captain.

807
01:08:48,883 --> 01:08:51,260
We kept the mess boys and the cook
most of the night.

808
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,760
They may be lying,
but it's a dead end.

809
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,220
We couldn't keep covering the
same ground endlessly, sir.

810
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,220
Gentlemen, you spent the entire night
and accomplished nothing.

811
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:02,313
While I thought the whole thing out
very clearly.

812
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,480
Did it ever occur to you that some bright boy...

813
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,150
might have made a duplicate key
to the wardroom icebox?

814
01:09:07,318 --> 01:09:08,650
Sir, there's no indication...

815
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,650
There are some things we must assume,
Mr. Maryk, in order to be a good officer.

816
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:17,310
Now back in '37, when I was
a lowly ensign on a cruiser,

817
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,410
five pounds of cheese
was missing.

818
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:23,835
Everybody was willing to forget about it,
but not me.

819
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:26,440
I snooped around
and found some chow hound...

820
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,140
had made a wax impression
of the icebox key.

821
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,500
I made him confess and I got myself
a nice letter of commendation.

822
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,420
This looks to me like exactly
the same situation.

823
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:39,267
- But sir, we can't be sure there's a dupli...
- You've tired every other solution, haven't you?

824
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:41,000
Now I've worked out a very simple plan.

825
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:45,890
First, we collect every key on this ship
and tag it with the name of the owner.

826
01:09:46,065 --> 01:09:50,319
Second, we strip all hands to make
sure we've got all the keys.

827
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,323
Third, we test each key
on the icebox padlock.

828
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,850
And the one that fits
will give us the name of the owner.

829
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,450
But Captain,
how do we know there is such a key?

830
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,000
I say there's a key.

831
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,000
Captain, what's to prevent this bright boy
from tossing the key overboard?

832
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,250
No, no, no, he would never toss
it overboard...

833
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,750
after he had gone to all the trouble
of making it.

834
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:12,340
He may try to hide it,
but we'll find it.

835
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,340
I ah...
never thought of that, sir.

836
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,250
Don't stand there,
get on the ball.

837
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,450
We ought to have little fun
for a change,

838
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,050
now that we have some
detective work to do.

839
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,350
Yes, sir.

840
01:10:28,566 --> 01:10:33,529
Steve, turn me in if you want to.
But this is it. This is over the line.

841
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,910
Queeg is a paranoia or
there's no such thing as paranoia.

842
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,910
-Tom, I warned you.
- Yes. Can't you see what he's doing?

843
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:43,164
He's re-enacting his big triumph of his career,
<i>"The Cheese Investigation."</i>

844
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:48,930
He still wants to prove he is the red hot
Ensign Queeg of 1937. There is no key.

845
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,340
Well,
what happened to the strawberries?

846
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,340
Does it matter?
Is it worth turning a ship upside down?

847
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:56,760
Would anyone
but a crazy man do it?

848
01:10:59,639 --> 01:11:04,227
Steve, are you familiar with
Article 184 of Navy regulations?

849
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,479
Vaguely.

850
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,860
Listen to this.

851
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,860
On the Caine
it's required reading.

852
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,860
Article 184:

853
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:24,163
<i>"It is conceivable that most unusual and
extraordinary circumstances may arise </i>

854
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,310
<i>"In which the relief from duty of
a commanding officer... </i>

855
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,410
<i>"by a subordinate becomes necessary.</i>

856
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,710
<i>"Either by placing him under arrest
or on the sick list.</i>

857
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:35,710
<i>"Such actions shall never be taken without the
approval of the Navy Department... </i>

858
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:40,300
<i>"except when it is impracticable because
of the delay involved."</i>

859
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:45,518
If I were you, Steve,
I'd memorize it.

860
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:06,450
I'll take these
to the captain.

861
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:13,400
- Great weather for stripping down.
- Yeah, great for pneumonia.

862
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,150
That wouldn't stop
the investigation.

863
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,170
- Next.
- Alright, Meatball, you can get dressed.

864
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,740
Why... Mr. Keith, don't you want to x-ray me
for the key? Just to make sure?

865
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,140
I've seen him, Mr. Keith, he swallowed the key
with his coffee. Very tricky.

866
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:26,392
Pipe down you guys,
both of you.

867
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:29,990
So long, fellas.

868
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,690
Well, don't tell me you're
escaping from the Caine.

869
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:37,850
I got dispatch orders back to the states.
My wife is seriously ill.

870
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,150
I'm sorry to hear that.

871
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,660
- She'll be all right, Harding.
- Thanks.

872
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,360
We'll keep you posted on the outcome
of the great key investigation.

873
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,660
Yeah,
do that.

874
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:48,000
- Good luck, Harding.
- Thank you, sir.

875
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:53,430
Look fellas, if I tell you something, will you
promise not to do anything about it?

876
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,830
At least for now,
until I'm ashore?

877
01:12:58,216 --> 01:13:01,219
- OK, what is it?
- There is no key.

878
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:05,097
- What?
- How do you know?

879
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:08,768
I know, the mess boys ate the strawberries.
I saw them.

880
01:13:08,935 --> 01:13:12,280
I kept my mouth shut because I
didn't want to get them in trouble.

881
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,680
Then I made
my mistake,

882
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,240
I told the captain.

883
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,240
He called me a lair, and threatened to
hold up my orders ...

884
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,440
if I mentioned a word to anyone.

885
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:22,824
- So please don't say anything.
- You can count on us.

886
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:27,078
Boy, I'm happy to get out of this madhouse.
Well, so long and good luck.

887
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,410
I'll call all your wives and girls
for you.

888
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:36,950
Well...

889
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:42,050
Tom, I've been thinking about
what you've were saying.

890
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:46,681
I've been thinking about Article 184,
and I've got to admit you're right.

891
01:13:46,848 --> 01:13:48,520
Admiral Halsey is here
with the fleet.

892
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,520
How about going over to see him after
we finish with this nonsense.

893
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:57,567
- Sure.
- You too, Willie.

894
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:46,450
Request permission to come on board, sir.
Admiral Halsey's quarters.

895
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,950
- Official business from the Caine.
- Very well.

896
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,450
- Lt. Jones.
- Yes sir.

897
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:51,950
These gentlemen
would like to see the admiral.

898
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:54,450
Very well.
Come along with me.

899
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:45,000
Just a minute please,
gentlemen.

900
01:15:57,395 --> 01:16:03,734
Steve, this is a fine time to think of this,
but... we're making a big mistake.

901
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:06,820
- What are you talking about?
- Well, look at this.

902
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:09,360
We've been
kidding ourselves.

903
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:13,360
This isn't the Caine. This is the real navy,
with real officers, not Queegs.

904
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:17,957
- The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.
- What are you driving at?

905
01:16:18,124 --> 01:16:19,570
They'll never believe our story.

906
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,170
I don't get it.
Is the captain off his head or isn't he?

907
01:16:23,337 --> 01:16:24,830
Is this record I've kept,
correct or not?

908
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,630
Yes, it's correct. The trouble is that
we won't be able to make it stick.

909
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:31,060
Unfortunately, everything Queeg did,
everything you've got in your log there,

910
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,360
can be interpreted
as an attempt to enforce discipline.

911
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,700
Yes,
but we know different.

912
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,600
Yeah, because we've lived through it,
Halsey hasn't.

913
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,690
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

914
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,190
Just be glad I've
thought of it now.

915
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,690
Believe me, Steve, if go through with this,
we're in trouble.

916
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:46,230
It won't mean as much to our boy here
and me, as it will to you,

917
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,230
you want to
stay in the Navy.

918
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:49,740
This can smash your whole career.

919
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,940
Do you want them to think
you're a mutinous officer?

920
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,740
Tom has an argument there.

921
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:57,079
Yes, but I'm willing to take a chance.
Are you scared?

922
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:02,100
Scared? I can see six sides to every risk and
12 reasons why I shouldn't take it.

923
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,570
Cut the kidding,
Tom.

924
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,460
Look fellas, behind this smiling
eloquent brilliant exterior,

925
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,060
I've got a yellow streak
15 miles wide.

926
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:13,720
- I'm too smart to be brave.
- Admiral Halsey will see you now.

927
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,650
I pass.

928
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:20,350
Thanks anyway. Thank the admiral.
We've decided this isn't the time.

929
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:27,020
Intercom:
<i>" Station special C at anchor detail. </i>

930
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,020
<i>" Make all preparations for getting under the way</i>

931
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:35,030
<i>" Make all preparations for heavy
weather. Dismissed from quarters. "</i>

932
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:53,928
- Steve, what do we do now?
- Without Tom, I couldn't get to first base.

933
01:17:54,095 --> 01:17:57,090
I never even heard the word <i>"paranoid"</i>
before he pulled it on me.

934
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,930
He's got to make the pitch,
or we're sunk.

935
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,100
I just don't get it.
Tom's certainly not a coward.

936
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,770
To tell you the truth Willie,
I don't know what Tom is... now.

937
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,370
You better double-time it
back to your ship.

938
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,770
We received a storm warning
and the fleet's getting underway.

939
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:42,530
- Turn on the standard lights.
- Aye, aye, sir

940
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,450
Sir, the barometer's still dropping.

941
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,350
Captain, the barometer is still dropping!
- I've seen it.

942
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:55,400
Captain, the Chief Engineer wants to know
if you gonna take on ballast?

943
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,000
No.
Tell him no.

944
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:58,430
Captain, I suggest that we do,
sir.

945
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,430
I'm not gonna foul up the fuel lines
with salt water.

946
01:20:31,878 --> 01:20:35,756
Captain the sea is brutal.
We need more knots to outrun it.

947
01:20:36,924 --> 01:20:39,430
Bridge to Engine Control.
This is the captain speaking.

948
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,930
You down in there the engine room,
I want power.

949
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:46,620
Power on the starboard engine, do you hear?
Emergency flank power.

950
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,220
Do you want this ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.

951
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:59,155
Close that door
and lock it.

952
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:03,451
- Sir, I've relieved the watch.
- Pass the word to put on life jackets.

953
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:11,292
It's difficult holding her, sir.
The wheel feels loose.

954
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,610
Captain, I don't know if we can keep on riding
with our stern to the wind.

955
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,670
Those are fleet orders,
Mr. Maryk.

956
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,670
I still think the depth charges
should be put on safe.

957
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:22,170
Sir, the depth charges are on safe.
Mr. Keefer gave the order to set them

958
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:25,848
Why wasn't I told these things? I can't go
steaming around with a lot of dead charges.

959
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,500
- Sir, I told Mr. Keefer...
- You speak when you're spoken too.

960
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Mr. Keith, put this man on report
for insolence and neglect of duty.

961
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:34,774
While you're at it, get another helmsman.
Keep that idiots face out of my sight.

962
01:21:34,941 --> 01:21:37,730
- But Stillwell's our best man.
- Will you stop this back talking?

963
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:40,730
Is there no one left on this ship who
pays attention to my orders?

964
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:47,760
Engine room reports #1 switchboard
shorted out by salt water...

965
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,160
Shifting to number two.

966
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,877
We're falling off to starboard now, sir.

967
01:21:58,172 --> 01:22:01,509
Captain we're listing to.
Try backing the starboard engine.

968
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,470
Back the starboard engine!

969
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,970
- Back the starboard engine.
- Aye, aye, sir!

970
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:17,130
Willie, look in the radar shack.
See if there are any ships near us.

971
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,730
Aye, aye, sir.

972
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:29,490
If we keep our running with stern to the wind,
we'll roll over.

973
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,230
Captain, the radars are jammed.
There's no sign of the fleet.

974
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:34,830
Passing 2-2-5...

975
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:36,290
Swinging around faster.

976
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:39,290
Captain, we have to maneuver
for the safety of the ship.

977
01:22:39,463 --> 01:22:41,520
We received no orders to move
to maneuver at discretion.

978
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,920
Fleet course is 1-8-0.

979
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:46,020
Sir, how do you know what
the fleet orders are now?

980
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,820
We can call the fleet Commander
and tell him we're in trouble.

981
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,475
We're not in any trouble.

982
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:06,866
Heading 2-4-5!
I can't hold the wheel, sir!

983
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,000
Captain,
back the starboard engine!

984
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:27,840
Captain!

985
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:41,317
Stilwell,
hold it a hard right!

986
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:49,158
- Ease your rudder to standard.
- Rudder easing to standard, sir.

987
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:53,162
Heading 3-2-5.
She's coming around slower, sir.

988
01:24:02,463 --> 01:24:07,090
Stay on this bearing heading into the wind.
Steady on 0-0-0.

989
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,220
Who gave those orders?
Fleet course is 1-8-0.

990
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,220
Captain,
we're in serious trouble.

991
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:18,010
Mr. Maryk, if you question my decisions once
more, I'll order you off this bridge.

992
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,310
Helsman, come left.

993
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:30,491
Stilwell, steady as you go.
Willie, note the time.

994
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,620
Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.

995
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,620
I'm relieving you as captain of this ship
under Article 184.

996
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:45,256
I don't know what you are talking about.
Helmsman, left 1-8-0.

997
01:24:45,423 --> 01:24:48,500
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the Officer of the Deck.

998
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,720
I told you to come left,
now come left, and fast.

999
01:24:51,888 --> 01:24:55,040
I'm sorry sir, but you're not issuing orders
on this bridge anymore.

1000
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,140
I've relieved you.

1001
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:58,890
I take full responsibility.

1002
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,890
Mr. Maryk, you're under arrest.
Go below to your cabin.

1003
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:02,910
Left to 1-8-0.

1004
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,810
No, to right standard rudder.
Come to new course 0-0-0.

1005
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:08,230
Mr. Keith, what do I do?

1006
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:12,533
Come north, Stilwell.
Mr. Maryk has taken command.

1007
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,690
Call your relief, Mr. Keith.
You're under arrest, too.

1008
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:21,459
All officers not on watch, report to the bridge.
This is Mr. Maryk.

1009
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:39,890
- What's up?
- I have just relieved the captain.

1010
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,490
He will continue to be treated
with the utmost courtesy.

1011
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,486
But from now on, I will give all orders.
I take full responsibility for this action.

1012
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:53,366
Don't kid yourself, Mr. Keith backed you up.
He'll pay the same as you will.

1013
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:57,910
You officers, if you know what's good for you,
tell them to stop, while they can.

1014
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:04,752
You officers approve?
Do you, Mr. Keefer?

1015
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:10,800
- It isn't up to Mr. Keefer to approve, Captain.
- You'll all hang for conspiracy to mutiny.

1016
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:16,597
Everybody back to their stations.
Hold the course 0-0-0.

1017
01:26:46,043 --> 01:26:48,580
- It's right over there, mister.
- Thank you.

1018
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:53,550
Yes?
Yes, this is Ensign Keith.

1019
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:59,474
New York?
Thank you.

1020
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:02,220
Hello?

1021
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,720
Hello?

1022
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,317
- May?
- Willie, I've been trying to get you all day.

1023
01:27:09,484 --> 01:27:12,361
- Are you all right?
- Well, I'm OK. How are you?

1024
01:27:12,528 --> 01:27:14,950
Willie,
an officer from your ship called.

1025
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:19,450
Ensign Harding?
He told me that you were in trouble.

1026
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:21,480
Willie,
I'm worried.

1027
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,580
Is your mother there
with you?

1028
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:30,463
- No, she's in Washington. Uncle Loyd's sick.
- Sorry to hear it.

1029
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:33,630
May,
it was wonderful of you to phone.

1030
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,475
- May... darling.
- Willie, please don't.

1031
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:45,180
What an idiot I was.

1032
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:49,650
I could have married you in the
most beautiful place in the world.

1033
01:27:50,817 --> 01:27:56,405
- I'll always regret that I didn't for the rest of my life.
- Don't... please.

1034
01:27:56,572 --> 01:28:00,451
It's over.
It's all in the past.

1035
01:28:00,618 --> 01:28:06,374
But I want you to know that I love you,
and I'll never forget you.

1036
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:14,090
Goodbye, Willie.
Thank you.

1037
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:48,750
- Mr. Maryk?
- I'm Maryk

1038
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,910
My name is
Barney Greenwald.

1039
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,530
Pleased to meet you.
Have a crack-up?

1040
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,030
Yep.

1041
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:59,218
- Are you our lawyer?
- Well, I'm a lawyer.

1042
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:03,040
- This is Ensign Keith, Lieutenant Keefer.
- Keith. You're the co-defendant.

1043
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,140
Yes, sir.

1044
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:08,019
- And you, Mr. Keefer?
- I'm holding his coat.

1045
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:09,600
I'm a friend of the family.

1046
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,100
That's pretty flip under the circumstances,
Mr. Keefer.

1047
01:29:12,273 --> 01:29:14,520
Sorry, I was on board the Caine,
communications officer.

1048
01:29:16,694 --> 01:29:17,950
I will be frank with you two.

1049
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,650
I read the preliminary investigation very carefully,
and I think that what you've done stinks.

1050
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,580
If that's the way you feel about it,
then why are you taking the case?

1051
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,280
I didn't say
I'd take it.

1052
01:29:27,455 --> 01:29:28,900
I told legal I would have
a talk with Mr. Maryk.

1053
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,700
Rather I take it or not depends
on what he has to say.

1054
01:29:31,876 --> 01:29:33,990
Steve, maybe you better
get yourself another lawyer.

1055
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,790
Try it. Eight other officers have
already turned it down.

1056
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:39,350
I don't want to upset you too much,
but at the moment,

1057
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,250
you have an excellent chance
of being hanged.

1058
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,057
We'll answer anything
you want to know, Mr. Greenwald.

1059
01:29:46,224 --> 01:29:49,900
Alright, Mr. Maryk, which are you?
A fool or a mutineer?

1060
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
There's no third possibility.

1061
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:55,850
I guess the only way I could prove I was right
was to let the ship go down.

1062
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,650
Three ships were lost in the typhoon,
you know.

1063
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:03,000
Sure, and 194 stayed afloat without the
executive officer relieving the skipper.

1064
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,320
There wasn't any other choice.

1065
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,620
Hold it Willie.

1066
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,620
OK, maybe I was a fool,
but I'm not a mutineer.

1067
01:30:09,789 --> 01:30:11,410
He should get a medal
for what he did.

1068
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:14,910
He had a paranoid skipper who went to pieces
when the ship was in danger.

1069
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,710
And he saved the ship.

1070
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:18,840
The Navy has three psychiatrists
who are prepared testify...

1071
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,740
that Capt. Queeg is completely sane.

1072
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,840
Sure...
paranoids are clever.

1073
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:26,639
They walk a thin dividing line
between sanity and lunacy.

1074
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,250
Are you a psychiatrist,
Mr. Keefer?

1075
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:34,021
No, I'm a writer. It's my business
to be a judge of human behavior.

1076
01:30:34,188 --> 01:30:38,317
I see. And you were the first one to notice
the captain's <i>"psychotic symptoms"?</i>

1077
01:30:38,484 --> 01:30:39,480
Yes.

1078
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:43,150
You explained this all very carefully to Mr. Maryk,
of course.

1079
01:30:43,322 --> 01:30:47,118
- I discussed it, yes.
- Well, that's an interesting point.

1080
01:30:47,285 --> 01:30:49,680
Would you be prepared to repeat it
on the witness stand?

1081
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,950
Why not?

1082
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:56,520
Mr. Keefer, you ought to take a look
at Article 186 of Navy regulations.

1083
01:30:58,296 --> 01:31:02,175
<i>"An officer relieving his commanding officer,
or recommending such action...</i>

1084
01:31:02,341 --> 01:31:05,070
<i>"Together with all others
who so counsel...</i>

1085
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,930
<i>"Must bear the legitimate responsibility for...</i>

1086
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:09,630
<i>"and must be prepared
to justify such action."</i>

1087
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,360
That's confusing the issue.
I'm not on trial.

1088
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,060
If I were,
I'd take the rap with the others.

1089
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:18,310
Too bad we can't use you as
an expert on psychiatry.

1090
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,310
After all,
you made the diagnosis.

1091
01:31:21,486 --> 01:31:23,000
Yes.

1092
01:31:25,656 --> 01:31:27,850
The atmosphere is getting a little thick
in here.

1093
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,450
If you can get along without me,
I'll wait in the hall.

1094
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:35,540
Tom had nothing to do with it.
It was my decision.

1095
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,540
Nobody counseled me,
nobody told me what to do.

1096
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:42,215
- Sure.
- Will you take the case?

1097
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:45,000
I'd much rather prosecute.

1098
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:48,710
Well, I guess I can't
blame you.

1099
01:31:53,643 --> 01:31:57,480
- I'll take it.
- How do we plead?

1100
01:31:57,647 --> 01:32:01,234
- Your case depends on Maryk.
- Well, then, how do I plead?

1101
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,910
Not guilty,
of course.

1102
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,610
You're a great naval hero.

1103
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:10,618
Charge: <i>"Making a mutiny."</i>

1104
01:32:10,785 --> 01:32:15,122
Specification: <i>"In that Steven Maryk,
Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserve.</i>

1105
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:20,336
<i>"While serving on board the USS Caine,
did on or about July 31, 1944.</i>

1106
01:32:20,503 --> 01:32:23,030
<i>"Willfully, forcibly, and without proper authority...</i>

1107
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:27,130
<i>"relieve Lt. Commander Phillip Francis Queeg,
U.S. Navy</i>

1108
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:30,340
<i>"Who was then and there was engaged
lawfully in the exercise of his command, </i>

1109
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,340
<i>"the United States then being in
a state of war."</i>

1110
01:32:35,601 --> 01:32:38,860
Steven Maryk, Lt. U.S. Navy you heard the
charge and specifications preferred against you.

1111
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,560
How say you to the specification?
Guilty or not guilty?

1112
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,560
Not guilty.

1113
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,237
How say you to the charge?
Guilty or not guilty?

1114
01:32:46,404 --> 01:32:48,000
Not guilty.

1115
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:56,706
Gentlemen, the prosecution
is prepared to prove...

1116
01:32:56,873 --> 01:32:59,330
that the removal of Lt. Commander Queeg
was not justified...

1117
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:01,830
by any provision of
the U.S. Navy regulations.

1118
01:33:02,003 --> 01:33:05,882
And consequently, constituted the making of
a mutiny against legal authority.

1119
01:33:06,048 --> 01:33:09,340
We will also submit
qualified psychiatric testimony...

1120
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,340
establishing without a doubt...

1121
01:33:11,512 --> 01:33:14,220
that Lt. Commander Queeg is a sane
and intelligent officer,

1122
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,220
and should not
have been relieved.

1123
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,897
No statement at this time.

1124
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:24,900
In order to establish circumstances,
the prosecution would like to call...

1125
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,400
as it's first witness,
Ensign Willis Stewart Keith.

1126
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,320
Mr. Keith, where you the Officer of the Deck
on the DMS Caine...

1127
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,720
during the morning
of the 31st of July?

1128
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,820
Yes, sir.

1129
01:33:36,996 --> 01:33:41,270
Was the Captain relieved of command by the
Executive Officer during that watch?

1130
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:42,370
Yes, sir.

1131
01:33:42,543 --> 01:33:45,070
Do you know why the Executive Officer
took the action he did?

1132
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:47,000
I do.

1133
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,761
The Captain lost control of himself and the ship
was in imminent danger of foundering.

1134
01:33:51,928 --> 01:33:54,180
Have you ever been in a ship
that foundered?

1135
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,180
No, sir.

1136
01:33:56,349 --> 01:34:00,645
- Mr. Keith, how long have you been in the Navy?
- A little over a year, sir.

1137
01:34:00,812 --> 01:34:04,900
Do you know how many years
Lt. Commander Queeg served at sea?

1138
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,370
No.

1139
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:10,570
As a matter of fact, Lt. Commander Queeg
has served over eight years.

1140
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:14,867
I ask you, which of you is better qualified
to judge if a ship is foundering?

1141
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,830
Myself, sir.

1142
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,700
When I am in possession
of my faculties...

1143
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,700
and Lt. Commander Queeg is not.

1144
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:25,840
Tell me, Mr. Keith. Just how would you
describe this loss of faculties?

1145
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:29,840
Did the Captain rave
or make insane gestures?

1146
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,969
Well,
no, sir.

1147
01:34:33,136 --> 01:34:36,380
After being relieved,
did the Captain go violently crazy?

1148
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:40,140
Well, the Captain was never wild or raving
either before or after being relieved.

1149
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,640
There are other forms
of mental illness.

1150
01:34:42,812 --> 01:34:45,565
Thank you for
your expert opinion.

1151
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:50,111
Are you aware the Captain has been pronounced
completely rational by three qualified psychiatrists?

1152
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:53,573
They weren't on the bridge
of the Caine during that typhoon, sir.

1153
01:34:53,739 --> 01:34:58,310
- Did you like the Captain, Mr. Keith?
- At first I did, yes, sir.

1154
01:34:58,410 --> 01:34:59,410
And later?

1155
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:04,300
Well, I thought he was incompetent
and unfair.

1156
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,300
He blamed the members of the crew
for his own mistakes.

1157
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,000
And He rode the men
too hard.

1158
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:11,257
- Yourself included?
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:35:11,424 --> 01:35:13,590
You ended up by hating Captain Queeg?

1160
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:15,761
Yes, sir.

1161
01:35:15,761 --> 01:35:20,099
Now, let's come to
the morning of 31st of July, Mr. Keith.

1162
01:35:20,266 --> 01:35:22,770
Was your decision
to obey Mr. Maryk...

1163
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:25,770
based upon your judgment that the Captain
had gone crazy...

1164
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:29,692
or was it based on your hatred
of Capt. Queeg?

1165
01:35:33,571 --> 01:35:37,090
Mr. Keith, it's contempt of court
to refuse to answer questions...

1166
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,490
except on sufficient grounds.

1167
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:43,623
All I can say is that I believe Mr. Maryk
did the right thing, sir.

1168
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:47,960
No further questions.

1169
01:35:49,128 --> 01:35:54,300
Mr. Keith, I would like to ask if you have ever
heard
the expression <i>"Old Yellowstain"?</i>

1170
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:59,263
- Would you repeat that, please.
- <i>"Old Yellow-stain."</i>

1171
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:03,210
- Yes, sir, I've heard it.
- Was it a nickname?

1172
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,810
Yes, for Captain Queeg.

1173
01:36:04,977 --> 01:36:08,606
- What did it imply?
- It implied Cowardice.

1174
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:11,860
I object. I move that question and answer
be struck from the record...

1175
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,860
as an unnecessary attack on the honor
of an Naval officer.

1176
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,000
Mr. Greenwald, the career of an officer
with a 14 year...

1177
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,400
unblemished record
is involved here.

1178
01:36:20,576 --> 01:36:22,890
The court understands your zeal,
but I warn you,

1179
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:26,490
you bear full responsibility
for your conduct in this case.

1180
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:30,290
The court will hold in abeyance
to the prosecution's motion.

1181
01:36:31,462 --> 01:36:34,710
Did that nickname have
anything to do with the typhoon?

1182
01:36:35,883 --> 01:36:38,553
- No, sir.
- That's all.

1183
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,224
- No further questions.
- The court has no questions.

1184
01:36:43,391 --> 01:36:46,270
Mr. Keith, you are warned not to discuss
your testimony with anyone...

1185
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:49,270
except the parties to the trial
and the accused.

1186
01:36:49,438 --> 01:36:51,150
You're excused.

1187
01:36:52,316 --> 01:36:54,530
The ship was rolling bad.
I couldn't hold her.

1188
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:58,030
The Captain wanted me to come left,
the Exec wanted me to come right.

1189
01:36:58,197 --> 01:37:00,530
- Which did you do?
- I obeyed Mr. Maryk, sir.

1190
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:01,530
Why?

1191
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:04,100
Well, Mr. Keith told me that
Mr. Maryk had taken command.

1192
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,700
Did the captain act crazy?

1193
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,470
No, sir.

1194
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,958
- Did Mr. Maryk act crazy?
- No, sir.

1195
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,620
- Did the Captain seemed scared?
- No, sir.

1196
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,120
- Did Mr. Maryk seemed scared?
- No, sir.

1197
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,120
Did anyone?

1198
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:16,000
Just me. I was dam...
I was plenty scared.

1199
01:37:18,176 --> 01:37:19,500
Did you like Captain Queeg?

1200
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,840
I liked him, but not a lot.
But I liked him.

1201
01:37:24,015 --> 01:37:27,920
- He acted strange.
- Was it strange he cleaned up the Caine?

1202
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
No, sir.

1203
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,380
Was it strange he made
the men get haircuts?

1204
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,180
No, sir.

1205
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,880
- Was it strange he was strict
about Navy regulations?

1206
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,980
No, sir.

1207
01:37:36,152 --> 01:37:37,580
Evidently, what you thought strange
were attempts...

1208
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,380
to make good sailors
of his crew.

1209
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:41,780
That's all.

1210
01:37:41,949 --> 01:37:44,050
What do those campaign stars
represent?

1211
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:45,850
Well...

1212
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,622
What do they represent?

1213
01:37:47,622 --> 01:37:52,376
This silver star is the Coral Sea,
Midway, Guadalcanal, Tulagi...

1214
01:37:52,543 --> 01:37:57,465
- That's all.
- Call Lt. Thomas Keefer.

1215
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,344
Mr. Keefer, when did you first learn
about Capt. Queeg's relief?

1216
01:38:01,511 --> 01:38:03,430
Mr. Maryk called us
to the bridge.

1217
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,430
When we arrived, he told us
he had assumed full command.

1218
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:09,977
Did Captain Queeg show any external signs
of being sick?

1219
01:38:10,144 --> 01:38:13,898
Well, in the height of a typhoon nobody
on board a DMS looks very well.

1220
01:38:14,065 --> 01:38:16,859
Lt. Keefer,
didn't you realize...

1221
01:38:17,026 --> 01:38:18,780
that Capt. Queeg's warning
to the other officers...

1222
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,780
about collusion in mutiny
was well founded?

1223
01:38:21,948 --> 01:38:22,800
Yes, I did,
sir.

1224
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,700
Then why, as the next senior officer,
did you take no action?

1225
01:38:25,868 --> 01:38:28,538
I wasn't present when the Captain
was relieved.

1226
01:38:28,704 --> 01:38:30,020
So, I don't know what
he might have done...

1227
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,120
in the critical moments  to convince
the Executive Officer he was sick.

1228
01:38:33,292 --> 01:38:38,131
I decided for the safety of the ship that my
best course was to obey Mr. Maryk's order.

1229
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:43,594
Until such time higher authority either
endorsed or overruled his action.

1230
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:45,990
Mr. Keefer,
during all the period Captain Queeg...

1231
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:48,090
was in command
of the Caine.

1232
01:38:48,266 --> 01:38:51,350
Did you ever observe any
evidence of insanity in him?

1233
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:56,274
I'm afraid I can't answer that question
intelligently, not being a psychiatrist.

1234
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:01,112
Mr. Keefer, did you ever have any reason to
think Capt. Queeg might be insane?

1235
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,110
Greewald: Objection, the witness
is not an expert.

1236
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:05,110
Matters of opinion are
not permissible evidence.

1237
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,110
Judge:
Strike it from the record.

1238
01:39:08,369 --> 01:39:11,550
Mr. Keefer,
at anytime prior to 31st of July,

1239
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:15,250
did you know that Mr. Maryk suspected
Capt Queeg of being mentally ill?

1240
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:21,382
Yes, sir. Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log
he had written on Capt. Queeg's behavior.

1241
01:39:21,549 --> 01:39:25,553
Did you believe that log justified
the relief of Captain Queeg?

1242
01:39:29,056 --> 01:39:32,685
- Well, sir...
- Yes or no, please?

1243
01:39:38,024 --> 01:39:39,310
No, sir.

1244
01:39:41,486 --> 01:39:43,200
Mr. Maryk was
a close friend of mine.

1245
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,400
He persuaded Mr. Keith and me to
go with him to see Admiral Halsey.

1246
01:39:48,576 --> 01:39:51,160
When we arrived on board the flagship
I told him as forcibly as I could,

1247
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,160
that the log didn't
justify such action.

1248
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:58,002
And that we all would be liable to a charged
of combining to make a mutiny.

1249
01:39:58,169 --> 01:40:01,798
Were you surprised later
when Mr. Maryk relieved the captain?

1250
01:40:01,964 --> 01:40:04,801
Yes, sir. I was flabbergasted.

1251
01:40:04,967 --> 01:40:10,973
- Were you pleased, Mr. Keefer?
- I've said Mr. Maryk was a close friend.

1252
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,380
I was badly disturbed.

1253
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,680
I anticipated that at best, he would be
involved in a great difficulty.

1254
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:20,020
No further questions.

1255
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,020
No questions.

1256
01:40:23,277 --> 01:40:25,840
Does Defense Counsel intended to recall
the witness at a later time?

1257
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:26,940
No, sir.

1258
01:40:28,533 --> 01:40:31,120
- No cross-examination?
- No, sir.

1259
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,320
Witness, excused.

1260
01:40:32,495 --> 01:40:33,720
But Barney,
he's lying.

1261
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,120
Every time he opens his mouth,
he gets you into more trouble.

1262
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:39,420
Forget it.
I want one hero, not two mutineers.

1263
01:40:40,294 --> 01:40:42,290
Call Dr Dixon,
please.

1264
01:40:44,257 --> 01:40:45,920
Dr Dixon,
please.

1265
01:40:52,598 --> 01:40:53,940
How did it go,
Tom?

1266
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,640
Raw deal. You know.
You were on the hot seat yourself.

1267
01:40:57,812 --> 01:40:59,980
Sure, I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

1268
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,380
But you're the old word-king.
You know what you were doing.

1269
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,980
Yeah...

1270
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:07,655
Yeah,
I knew what I was doing.

1271
01:41:13,244 --> 01:41:15,250
Doctor, may I ask you
as a psychiatrist,

1272
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:19,750
is it possible for a sane man to
perform offensive or foolish acts?

1273
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:21,240
It happens every day.

1274
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,540
Assuming for the moment,
this is a hypothetical question...

1275
01:41:24,714 --> 01:41:27,460
Assuming that the captain's conduct
was harsh and oppressive,

1276
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,460
and often showed
bad judgment.

1277
01:41:29,635 --> 01:41:32,763
Would that be inconsistent
with your diagnosis of him?

1278
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:38,853
No, no, my colleagues and I didn't find
Lt. Commander Queeg a perfect officer.

1279
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,100
We found a absence
of mental illness.

1280
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,100
Then you would still say that the defended
was unjustified in relieving him?

1281
01:41:44,275 --> 01:41:47,904
From a psychiatric standpoint,
completely unjustified.

1282
01:41:49,322 --> 01:41:51,407
Your witness.

1283
01:41:52,533 --> 01:41:57,030
Doctor my background is legal, not medical.
Forgive me if I ask some elementary questions.

1284
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,530
It's perfectly alright.

1285
01:41:58,706 --> 01:42:01,700
Now doctor, you said in previous testimony
that Lt. Commander Queeg,

1286
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,000
like all adults,
had problems which he handled well.

1287
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:06,600
Could you describe
the problems?

1288
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:10,800
I object. Lt. Commander Queeg is not
on trial here. Lt. Maryk is.

1289
01:42:10,968 --> 01:42:15,097
This question constitutes irrelevant probing
of medical confidence.

1290
01:42:15,264 --> 01:42:16,520
I rely on the judgment
of the court.

1291
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,120
Evidence regarding Lt. Commander Queeg's
mental make-up...

1292
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:21,220
is of the utmost importance
to my case.

1293
01:42:21,395 --> 01:42:24,357
The question is material.
Objection overruled.

1294
01:42:24,524 --> 01:42:27,270
The doctor may answer within
the limits of medical discretion.

1295
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,770
The reporter will
repeat the question.

1296
01:42:28,945 --> 01:42:32,510
<i>"You said that Lt. Commander Queeg,
like all adults,</i>

1297
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:35,110
<i>"had problems which he handled well.</i>

1298
01:42:35,284 --> 01:42:37,570
<i>"Could you describe the problems?"</i>

1299
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:44,000
The overall problem is one of inferiority
arising from an unfavorable childhood...

1300
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,045
and aggravated by some adult experiences.

1301
01:42:46,212 --> 01:42:51,467
- What were those adult experiences?
- He'd undergone a lot of strain.

1302
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:56,305
Long, arduous, combat duty.
I think that's about all I can say.

1303
01:42:56,472 --> 01:43:02,270
- Would he be incline to admit mistakes?
- Well, none of us are.

1304
01:43:02,436 --> 01:43:06,440
- Would he be a perfectionist then?
- Yes.

1305
01:43:06,607 --> 01:43:11,180
Inclined to hound subordinates
about small details?

1306
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,280
Yes.

1307
01:43:12,446 --> 01:43:16,360
Would he be incline to
think that people were hostile to him?

1308
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,360
Yes, that'd be part
of the picture, yes.

1309
01:43:18,536 --> 01:43:22,498
And if criticized, would he feel
that he was being unjustly persecuted?

1310
01:43:22,665 --> 01:43:25,330
I say it's all one pattern
stemming from one premise...

1311
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,330
that he must try
to be perfect.

1312
01:43:28,588 --> 01:43:31,210
Now doctor, you have testified
that the following symptoms...

1313
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:33,210
exist in Lt. Commander Queeg's behavior:

1314
01:43:33,384 --> 01:43:36,804
Rigidity of personality, feelings of
persecution, unreasonable suspicion,

1315
01:43:36,971 --> 01:43:40,933
a mania for perfection, and a neurotic
certainty that he is always in the right.

1316
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:45,938
Doctor, isn't there one psychiatric term
for this illness?

1317
01:43:46,105 --> 01:43:50,318
- I never said there was any illness.
- Thank you for the correction, sir.

1318
01:43:50,485 --> 01:43:53,230
What would you call a personality
that had all these symptoms?

1319
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,452
A paranoid personality.
But that is not a disabling illness.

1320
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:04,457
- What kind of personality, Doctor?
- Paranoid.

1321
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,500
Thank you.

1322
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:11,464
If I may speak, sir. I would like to protest
the counsel's twisting of words.

1323
01:44:11,631 --> 01:44:15,843
There's a big difference between real mental
illness and minor mental disturbances.

1324
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:17,390
Let me put it this way,
Doctor.

1325
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:21,090
Could Captain Queeg have been
disabled by the severe strain of command?

1326
01:44:22,266 --> 01:44:24,930
- That's absurdly hypothetical.
- Is it?

1327
01:44:26,103 --> 01:44:29,941
- Have you ever had any sea duty, doctor?
- No.

1328
01:44:30,107 --> 01:44:32,570
- Have you ever been at sea?
- No.

1329
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,570
How long have you been in the Navy?

1330
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,697
Five months.

1331
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,890
Have you ever had any dealings
with ship captains before this case?

1332
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,990
No.

1333
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,700
Then I suggest that you can not
set yourself up...

1334
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:44,750
as an authority on
the strain of command,

1335
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:47,250
and thus you may be completely wrong
about Capt Queeg.

1336
01:44:51,212 --> 01:44:54,465
- Your witness.
- One minute, Doctor.

1337
01:44:54,632 --> 01:44:57,969
It seems counsel for defense
has raised an interesting point.

1338
01:44:58,136 --> 01:45:00,400
Now in private practice,
did you ever have patients...

1339
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:04,100
who had to deal
with complicated command decisions?

1340
01:45:04,267 --> 01:45:07,020
Men such as plant managers,
industrialists, etc...

1341
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,020
Yes,
quite a few.

1342
01:45:09,188 --> 01:45:10,420
Including some fliers,

1343
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,020
who have to decide questions
of life and death every day.

1344
01:45:13,192 --> 01:45:16,487
I've written a book
on the subject.

1345
01:45:16,654 --> 01:45:19,070
And in those cases, could you
detect where a neurosis...

1346
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:23,070
might damage the ability to make decisions
correctly and at the right time?

1347
01:45:23,244 --> 01:45:24,580
Absolutely.

1348
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,580
And in your examination
of Lt. Commander Queeg.

1349
01:45:27,748 --> 01:45:31,252
- And you found no such damage, is that right?
- Absolutely right.

1350
01:45:31,419 --> 01:45:35,214
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all.

1351
01:45:36,632 --> 01:45:40,386
- Smart guy, Charlie.
- He's sure gonna bear down on me.

1352
01:45:44,223 --> 01:45:45,890
And that's the way
I saw it.

1353
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,890
I thought it was my duty
as a naval officer.

1354
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:53,900
Captain Queeg was mentally ill
and I had to take over.

1355
01:45:54,066 --> 01:45:57,487
And I tell you honestly, if I had to do it again,
I'd do it.

1356
01:45:57,653 --> 01:46:01,199
Thank you, Mr. Maryk.
Your witness, sir.

1357
01:46:01,365 --> 01:46:03,400
Mr. Maryk, 
just a few questions. 

1358
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:07,410
Would you say your grades 
in high school were average?

1359
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:12,800
- Lower than average.
- And in college?

1360
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,630
Lower than average.

1361
01:46:15,797 --> 01:46:18,410
What training have you had in psychiatry, 
or medicine?

1362
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:20,510
None.

1363
01:46:20,676 --> 01:46:23,930
Where did you get the idea
that Capt Queeg was mentally ill?

1364
01:46:25,097 --> 01:46:27,760
- Out of books...
- What books, name the titles. 

1365
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,936
Oh... I can't remember them.

1366
01:46:29,936 --> 01:46:33,439
- Mr. Maryk, define schizophrenia.
- I can't.

1367
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:36,984
- What's a manic-depressive?
- I don't know.

1368
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:39,980
What's the difference between
<i>"paranoid"</i> and <i>"paranoia"</i> ?

1369
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,480
I don't know.

1370
01:46:41,656 --> 01:46:42,710
In truth, 
than Mr. Maryk, 

1371
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:46,410
you don't know what you're talking about 
when you discuss mental illness.

1372
01:46:46,577 --> 01:46:48,000
I didn't say I know 
much about it.

1373
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:51,450
Yet, you thought you knew enough 
to commit an act of outright mutiny.

1374
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:53,480
I wanted to save the ship.

1375
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,880
But doctors, responsible doctors, 
Mr, Maryk, 

1376
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,880
have found the Captain wasn't mentally ill, 
haven't they?

1377
01:46:59,048 --> 01:47:02,800
- They weren't in the ship.
- But, isn't the reverse possible?

1378
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,180
Mr. Maryk, 
isn't it possible that under pressure, 

1379
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,480
you became erratic and couldn't understand 
the captain's sound decisions?

1380
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,350
- Isn't that possible?
- It's possible.

1381
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:12,890
Between the Captain 
and his Executive Officer, 

1382
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,890
who is presumed by the Navy to have
the better judgment in ship handling?

1383
01:47:16,065 --> 01:47:19,000
- The captain.
- One last question, Mr. Maryk.

1384
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:22,320
If the diagnosis of expert doctors
is correct, 

1385
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:25,320
then you're guilty as charged, 
aren't you?

1386
01:47:28,161 --> 01:47:30,160
I guess, 
maybe so.

1387
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:38,296
- No more questions.
- No further questions.

1388
01:47:38,463 --> 01:47:41,210
You may step down, 
Mr. Maryk.

1389
01:47:50,183 --> 01:47:54,353
Take it easy. You've just seen the first act.
The finale's still to come.

1390
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:05,900
Good afternoon, 
gentlemen.

1391
01:48:12,914 --> 01:48:16,620
I assumed command of an extremely sloppy, 
badly-handled ship. 

1392
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,120
I was determined to bring 
the ship into line.

1393
01:48:19,295 --> 01:48:22,290
Lt. Maryk, I might say, 
opposed me from the very first.

1394
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,490
Maybe he thought I was crazy
to keep trying.

1395
01:48:26,177 --> 01:48:29,300
In your judgment, was your ship 
on the verge of foundering...

1396
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,400
when the Executive Officer 
assumed command?

1397
01:48:32,975 --> 01:48:37,190
Well, as you gentlemen know, in a typhoon 
is an extreme hazard at all times,

1398
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,190
but the ship was riding well.

1399
01:48:39,357 --> 01:48:42,318
Lt. Maryk, however, 
went into a panic and ran amok.

1400
01:48:42,485 --> 01:48:46,405
He acted under the disillusion that he, 
and he alone, could save the ship.

1401
01:48:46,572 --> 01:48:49,900
Ensign Willis Keith, 
a totally unreliable and disloyal officer,

1402
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:53,700
combined with him against me 
at this crucial time.

1403
01:48:53,871 --> 01:48:57,430
Bad luck for them really. 
I bear them no malice.  

1404
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,830
I'm extremely sorry 
for them.

1405
01:49:00,002 --> 01:49:01,260
No more questions.

1406
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,960
A word of caution before you proceed 
with the examination, Mr. Greenwald.

1407
01:49:06,134 --> 01:49:08,220
The court recognizes the defense 
is compelled... 

1408
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:11,720
to try to challenge the competence 
of Lt. Commander Queeg.

1409
01:49:11,889 --> 01:49:13,540
Nevertheless, all the requirements
of legal ethics... 

1410
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:17,140
- and military respect remain in force.
- Thank you, sir.

1411
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:22,567
Mr. Queeg, during a period
when the Caine was towing targets. 

1412
01:49:22,733 --> 01:49:25,778
Did you ever steam over your 
own tow line and cut it?

1413
01:49:25,945 --> 01:49:27,900
Objection. 
I beg the courts indulgence. 

1414
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,200
But, I must say, the defense outrages
the dignity of this proceeding.

1415
01:49:31,367 --> 01:49:34,240
The judge advocate wants the defense to 
switch to a guilty plead. 

1416
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:37,240
He thinks the report of the psychiatrist 
closes the case.

1417
01:49:37,415 --> 01:49:40,170
But I say it is up to you 
line naval officers, not doctors...

1418
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,670
to judge the captain's performance of duty.

1419
01:49:42,837 --> 01:49:46,299
And I must review that performance of duty 
for the navy to render a judgment.

1420
01:49:46,466 --> 01:49:47,800
Objection overruled.

1421
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,180
Now sir, did you ever steam over 
your own tow line and cut it?

1422
01:49:52,346 --> 01:49:57,226
Well sir, I for one, am happy to dispose
of this particular slander.

1423
01:49:57,393 --> 01:49:59,350
During the time we were towing the target,

1424
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:02,350
I noticed some anti-aircraft bursts 
close to board.

1425
01:50:02,523 --> 01:50:04,540
Naturally, 
I turned to avoid them.

1426
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,940
And you continued to turned 
in a full circle?

1427
01:50:07,111 --> 01:50:09,110
Well, my helmsman, 
a very unreliable man,

1428
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:11,860
failed to warn me we that we were 
coming around 360 degrees.

1429
01:50:12,033 --> 01:50:14,330
I caught it in time 
and instantly reversed course.

1430
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:18,530
To the best of my knowledge, 
we didn't steam over the tow line.

1431
01:50:18,706 --> 01:50:24,470
I see. Well, besides the anti-aircraft burst, 
did nothing else distract you?

1432
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,170
No, 
not that I recall.

1433
01:50:26,339 --> 01:50:29,240
Captain, weren't you engaged 
in reprimanding a seaman...

1434
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:32,840
named "Lugatch" at length, 
for having his shirt-tail out...

1435
01:50:33,012 --> 01:50:36,349
while the ship turned 360 degrees?

1436
01:50:36,516 --> 01:50:39,477
Well yes, I reprimanded him, 
but that only took two seconds.

1437
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:41,270
Un huh

1438
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:45,441
Now on the morning the Caine escorted
attack boats of Marines to the beach.

1439
01:50:45,608 --> 01:50:49,070
Did your orders include
dropping a yellow dye marker?

1440
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:53,741
- I don't recall.
- Did you drop a dye marker?

1441
01:50:53,908 --> 01:50:57,203
I don't recall.

1442
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:00,980
Well Captain, didn't you steam several hundred 
yards ahead of the attack boats, 

1443
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,580
drop a yellow dye marker,

1444
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:06,629
and retire at high speed, leaving the boats
to make the beach on their own?

1445
01:51:06,796 --> 01:51:08,920
The question is abusive 
and fragrantly leading.

1446
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,420
Mr. Greenwald, there can be a 
no more serious charge...

1447
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,420
against an officer than 
cowardice under fire.

1448
01:51:13,594 --> 01:51:17,431
Sir, 
may I make one thing clear?

1449
01:51:17,598 --> 01:51:21,030
It is not the defense's contention that 
Lt. Commander Queeg is a coward. 

1450
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,930
Quite the contrary.

1451
01:51:23,104 --> 01:51:26,400
The defense assume that no man who raises 
to command a US naval ship... 

1452
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,690
can possibly be a coward.

1453
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,690
And therefore, if he commits 
questionable acts under fire,

1454
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:34,690
the explanation 
must be elsewhere.

1455
01:51:34,866 --> 01:51:36,490
 You may resume 
your examination.

1456
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:40,990
Captain, you seem to be the victim 
of constantly disloyal officers.

1457
01:51:41,164 --> 01:51:44,709
Now, I didn't say that.
Only some of them were disloyal.

1458
01:51:44,876 --> 01:51:47,370
- Mr. Keith and Mr. Maryk, for instance?
- Yes.

1459
01:51:48,546 --> 01:51:53,170
Mr. Queeg, this is a fitness report you wrote 
on Mr. Maryk, 1 July, 1944. 

1460
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,170
One month before 
he relieved you.

1461
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:57,510
Do you recognize it?

1462
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,510
Yes, I do.

1463
01:52:01,684 --> 01:52:04,680
Do you mind reading your
 comments on Mr. Maryk?

1464
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,314
[Queeg mumbles]

1465
01:52:06,314 --> 01:52:09,560
I don't believe the court can hear you, 
Mr. Queeg.

1466
01:52:10,735 --> 01:52:14,950
<i>"This officer has improved in performance 
and duties since his last fitness report."</i>

1467
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,826
<i>"He's consistently loyal, unflagging, 
thorough, courageous, and efficient."</i>

1468
01:52:18,993 --> 01:52:20,690
<i>"He's recommended
for transfer to the regular navy."</i>

1469
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,390
Now, in relation to that report, 
would like to say that...

1470
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,490
Thank you, sir.

1471
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:25,890
Captain, did you ever turn 
your ship upside down...

1472
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,290
in the vain search for 
a key that did not exist?

1473
01:52:28,461 --> 01:52:31,460
I don't know what lies have been
sworn to in this court, 

1474
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,420
But I would like to set you straight on 
this matter right here and now. 

1475
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,920
A key definitely did exist.

1476
01:52:36,093 --> 01:52:39,400
May it please the court. The witness is
 understandably agitated by this ordeal, 

1477
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:40,800
and I request a brief recess to give him a brief...

1478
01:52:40,973 --> 01:52:44,685
I don't want a recess. 
I'll answer all questions right here, and now.

1479
01:52:44,852 --> 01:52:48,272
- Did you conduct such a search?
- Yes, I did.

1480
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:52,610
As usual, my disloyal officers failed me,
and the key couldn't be found.

1481
01:52:52,777 --> 01:52:56,697
Is it a matter of actual fact that wasn't
 this whole fuss over a quart of strawberries?

1482
01:52:56,864 --> 01:52:59,220
The pilfering of food 
in large amounts or small, 

1483
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,620
is one of the most serious occurrences 
on board ship.

1484
01:53:02,787 --> 01:53:05,040
Yes, but didn't you learn that the mess boys
had eaten the strawberries... 

1485
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:07,040
and that you were conducting 
a search for an imaginary key?

1486
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:09,810
I repeat, 
the key was not imaginary. 

1487
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:14,210
And I don't know anything about 
the mess boys eating strawberries.

1488
01:53:14,382 --> 01:53:17,410
Captain, have you no recollection of a 
conversation with an Ensign Harding... 

1489
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:19,500
just prior to him 
leaving the Caine?

1490
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,510
What about?

1491
01:53:21,681 --> 01:53:25,601
Didn't Esign Harding tell you that
the mess boys ate the strawberries?

1492
01:53:25,768 --> 01:53:29,090
All I remember is that, 
he was very grateful for his transfer. 

1493
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:32,190
His wife was ill in the states.

1494
01:53:32,358 --> 01:53:34,470
Captain, do you know
where Ensign Harding is now?

1495
01:53:34,570 --> 01:53:36,070
I have no way of knowing.

1496
01:53:36,237 --> 01:53:38,660
Ensign Harding is in San Diego. 
His wife is fully recovered. 

1497
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:43,160
He has already been summoned and can be 
flown up here in three hours if necessary.

1498
01:53:43,327 --> 01:53:46,100
Would it serve any useful purpose 
to have him testify?

1499
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,200
No, I...

1500
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,200
I...

1501
01:53:51,085 --> 01:53:54,797
I don't see 
any need of that.

1502
01:53:54,964 --> 01:53:59,620
Now that I recall, he might have
said something about mess boys, 

1503
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,220
and then again 
he might not.

1504
01:54:01,387 --> 01:54:06,476
I questioned so many men, and Harding
was not the most reliable officer.

1505
01:54:06,642 --> 01:54:10,640
I'm afraid the defense has no other recourse
than to produce Ensign Harding.

1506
01:54:11,314 --> 01:54:12,860
Now, there's no need 
for that!

1507
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,660
I know exactly what he'll tell you, 
lies!

1508
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,860
No different from any other officer 
in the wardroom.

1509
01:54:17,028 --> 01:54:18,650
They were all disloyal.

1510
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,650
I tried to run the ship properly, by the book, 
but they fought me at every turn.

1511
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,970
If the crew wanted to walk around with their 
shirt-tails hanging out, 

1512
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:25,570
that's alright, 
let them.

1513
01:54:25,745 --> 01:54:28,498
Take the tow line... defective equipment. 
No more, no less

1514
01:54:28,664 --> 01:54:31,500
But they encouraged the crew to 
go around scoffing at me, 

1515
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,500
spreading wild rumors about 
steaming in circles. 

1516
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:36,280
And then <i>"Old Yellowstain". </i>

1517
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:40,380
I was to blame for Lt Maryk's 
incompetence and poor seamanship.

1518
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:44,347
Lt Maryk was the perfect officer,
but not Capt Queeg.

1519
01:54:44,514 --> 01:54:47,150
Ah... but the strawberries, 
that's where I had them. 

1520
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,850
They laughed at me 
and made jokes.

1521
01:54:49,018 --> 01:54:51,050
But I proved beyond the 
shadow of the doubt... 

1522
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:55,850
with geometric logic that a duplicate key to 
the wardroom icebox did existed.

1523
01:54:56,025 --> 01:54:59,020
I would have produced that key, 
if they hadn't pulled the Caine out of action. 

1524
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,820
I know now they were only trying 
to protect some fellow officer...

1525
01:55:15,419 --> 01:55:21,217
Naturally, I can only cover
these things from memory.

1526
01:55:21,384 --> 01:55:26,681
If I've left anything out,
why, just ask me specific questions. 

1527
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:32,895
And, I'll be glad to answer them
one by one.

1528
01:55:56,085 --> 01:55:58,000
No further questions, 
sir.

1529
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,000
The court is closed.

1530
01:56:05,845 --> 01:56:11,809
<i>"For he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1531
01:56:11,976 --> 01:56:17,940
<i>"for he's a jolly good fellow
that nobody can deny. "</i>

1532
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,380
[Singing continues]

1533
01:56:19,484 --> 01:56:24,655
No, baby, there are no girls here.
Just the officers of the Caine.

1534
01:56:24,822 --> 01:56:28,993
What, darling?
Hey, Steve, make them pipe down, will you.

1535
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,240
Knock it off, fellas. 
Ole Willie is talking to his girl.

1536
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,740
Hi, Tom.

1537
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:38,628
Hi, fellas.

1538
01:56:38,795 --> 01:56:42,340
- Steve.
- Hello, Tom.

1539
01:56:42,507 --> 01:56:45,000
I didn't think you had the guts 
to come around.

1540
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:47,590
I didn't have the guts 
not to.

1541
01:56:53,768 --> 01:56:55,100
Steve.

1542
01:56:59,941 --> 01:57:04,445
I want to thank you for not telling the fellas
about what happened.

1543
01:57:04,612 --> 01:57:06,430
Of course I'm delighted about 
the way things turned out.

1544
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,030
So, It's over and done with.

1545
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:12,260
Look, you can take 
a plane tonight. 

1546
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:16,660
I'm getting a new ship and a new skipper, 
but we'll have plenty of time to get married.

1547
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:21,040
We'll let my mother afterwards.
Please, May.

1548
01:57:22,213 --> 01:57:27,718
I love you, darling. I love you!
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1549
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:32,550
Hey, Steve, Tom, that was May.
We're...

1550
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:41,816
Well, well, well. The officers
of the Caine in happy celebration.

1551
01:57:41,983 --> 01:57:48,360
- What are you Barney, kind of tight?
- Sure, I've got a guilty conscience.

1552
01:57:49,532 --> 01:57:52,960
I defended you Steve because I found
the wrong man was on trial. 

1553
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,660
So I torpedoed Queeg 
for you.

1554
01:57:55,830 --> 01:58:00,251
I had to torpedo him.
And I feel sick about it.

1555
01:58:00,418 --> 01:58:02,750
OK Barney, 
take it easy.

1556
01:58:03,921 --> 01:58:05,190
You know something? 

1557
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:10,590
When I was studying law, and
Mr. Keefer here was writing his stories. 

1558
01:58:10,761 --> 01:58:15,266
And you Willie was tearing up the dear 
old playing fields of Princeton. 

1559
01:58:15,433 --> 01:58:19,395
Who was standing guard over this fat, 
dumb happy country of ours, aye?

1560
01:58:19,562 --> 01:58:24,108
Not us. Oh no, we knew you couldn't
make any money in the service.

1561
01:58:24,275 --> 01:58:28,730
Who did the dirty work for us?
Queeg did, and a lot of other guys.

1562
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:32,283
Tough, sharp guys
who didn't crack up like Queeg.

1563
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:36,170
But no matter what, Capt Queeg endangered
the ship and lives of the men.

1564
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:39,570
He didn't endanger anybodies lives.
You did, all of you. 

1565
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:41,870
You're a fine bunch 
of officers.

1566
01:58:42,043 --> 01:58:43,670
You said yourself 
he cracked.

1567
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:47,670
I'm glad you brought that up Mr. Painter. 
That's a very pretty point.

1568
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,887
You know, I left out one detail in court martial.
It wouldn't have helped our case any.

1569
01:58:53,054 --> 01:58:55,180
Tell me Steve, after the <i>"Yellowstain"</i> incident, 

1570
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,680
Queeg came to you for help, 
and you turned him down. Didn't you?

1571
01:58:58,851 --> 01:59:01,437
Yes, we did.

1572
01:59:01,604 --> 01:59:05,775
You didn't approve of his conduct as an officer. 
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.

1573
01:59:05,942 --> 01:59:09,987
So you turned on him. You ragged him.
You made up songs about him.

1574
01:59:10,154 --> 01:59:11,740
If you'd given Queeg 
the loyalty he needed, 

1575
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,240
do you suppose the whole issue 
would have come up in the typhoon?

1576
01:59:15,409 --> 01:59:17,830
You're an honest man, Steve, 
I'm asking you. 

1577
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:20,830
Do you think it would have been necessary 
for you to take over?

1578
01:59:21,999 --> 01:59:24,470
It probably
wouldn't have been necessary.

1579
01:59:26,045 --> 01:59:29,632
- If that's true, we were guilty.
- Ah... you're learning, Willie.

1580
01:59:29,799 --> 01:59:33,344
You learn you don't work with a captain
because of the way he parts his hair.

1581
01:59:33,511 --> 01:59:37,430
You work with him because he's got the job,
or you're no good.

1582
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:42,000
Well, the case is over.
You're all safe.

1583
01:59:43,563 --> 01:59:46,190
It was like
shooting fish in a barrel.

1584
01:59:48,734 --> 01:59:52,000
And now we come to the man
who should have stood trial.

1585
01:59:52,655 --> 01:59:54,450
The Caine's favorite author. 

1586
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:57,450
The Shakespeare whose testimony
nearly sunk us all.

1587
01:59:57,618 --> 01:59:59,530
Tell them, 
Keefer.

1588
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:03,830
No, you go ahead. 
You're telling it better.

1589
02:00:05,168 --> 02:00:09,422
You ought to read his testimony.
He never even heard of Capt Queeg.

1590
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:13,301
- Let's forget it, Barney.
- Queeg was sick, he couldn't help himself.

1591
02:00:13,468 --> 02:00:20,057
But you, you're real healthy. Only you didn't
have one tenth the guts he had.

1592
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,310
Except I never fooled myself, 
Mr. Greenwald.

1593
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:26,310
I want to drink a toast to you, 
Mr. Keefer.

1594
02:00:26,481 --> 02:00:30,985
From the beginning you hated the Navy.
And then you thought up this whole idea.

1595
02:00:31,152 --> 02:00:35,948
You managed to keep your skirts nice and 
starched and clean, even in the court martial.

1596
02:00:36,115 --> 02:00:38,390
Steve Maryk will always be remembered
as a mutineer...

1597
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:39,990
But you...

1598
02:00:40,161 --> 02:00:45,917
You'll publish your novel, you'll make a
million bucks, marry a big movie star.

1599
02:00:46,083 --> 02:00:48,410
And for the rest of your life, 
you'll live with your conscience.

1600
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:50,210
If you have any.

1601
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:54,760
Here's to the real author of
<i>"The Caine Mutiny".</i> 

1602
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,260
Here's to you, 
Mr. Keefer.

1603
02:01:02,475 --> 02:01:05,000
If you want to do anything about it, 
I'll be outside. 

1604
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:09,520
I'm a lot drunker than you are, 
so it'll be a fair fight.

1605
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:18,301
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Willie.

1606
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,300
Keith!

1607
02:02:39,447 --> 02:02:41,240
Attention on deck.

1608
02:03:02,804 --> 02:03:03,850
 Keith.

1609
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:05,550
Yes, sir.

1610
02:03:07,642 --> 02:03:09,100
Take her out.

1611
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,100
Aye, aye, sir.

1612
02:03:17,193 --> 02:03:21,322
- Single up all lines!
- <i>"Single up all lines!"</i>

1613
02:03:21,489 --> 02:03:26,244
- Stand by to cast off!
<i>- "Stand by to cast off!"</i>
