1
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,994
<i>My earliest memories were working</i>
<i>alongside Mother in the fields.</i>

2
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,295
<i>Always working, my mother.</i>

3
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:28,836
<i>Each grain of rice, a symbol of life,</i>
<i>never wasted.</i>

4
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,669
<i>While we worked,</i>
<i>she'd teach me all I had to know about life.</i>

5
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:38,507
Mama, where did I really come from?
Where do babies come from?

6
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,214
From my belly button.

7
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:49,288
Don't worry. God makes babies
and puts them in your belly.

8
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,589
You have plenty of warning.

9
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:58,959
<i>The fragile rice had to be planted</i>
<i>and transplanted several times.</i>

10
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,233
<i>Our rice paddies were always</i>
<i>near the cemeteries...</i>

11
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:08,366
<i>...because we believed the spirits</i>
<i>passed through the soil into the rice...</i>

12
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,145
<i>...so the new generation,</i>
<i>in eating the rice...</i>

13
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,976
<i>...was sharing in the spirit</i>
<i>of their ancestors.</i>

14
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:12,238
<i>One day, in the summer of 1953...</i>

15
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,208
<i>...the French came.</i>

16
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,393
<i>They destroyed our village.</i>

17
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,300
<i>And the following year, we went hungry.</i>

18
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,701
<i>I will never forger my father's eyes...</i>

19
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,841
<i>...as he watched our house burn</i>
<i>to the ground.</i>

20
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,877
<i>But, as it had happened to our village</i>
<i>for so many centuries...</i>

21
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,243
<i>...we rebuilt our lives.</i>

22
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,528
Mama, where do babies really come from?

23
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,378
<i>Then, in 1963...</i>

24
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:11,215
<i>...the peasant countryside changed forever.</i>

25
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:32,507
<i>When the Viet Cong first arrived</i>
<i>that rainy season...</i>

26
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,242
<i>...some of them were remnants</i>
<i>from the war against the French.</i>

27
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,348
<i>Many of them were displaced immigrants</i>
<i>from the North.</i>

28
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,010
<i>All of them were angry.</i>

29
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,300
<i>My parents taught me Vietnam is...</i>

30
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,132
...a free nation.

31
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,609
That is what this war is about.

32
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,674
The Chinese, the Japanese, the French,
have each tried to rule us.

33
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,415
And we have won!

34
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,853
The North and the South are inseparable,
like sisters.

35
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,145
But in 1954...

36
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:25,289
...the French and American allies
separated us and kidnapped the South.

37
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,764
Can we stand by
and watch the kidnappers...

38
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:33,357
...taking turns raping
and corrupting our sister!

39
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,901
That's what this war's about.

40
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,408
Why should outsiders come in...

41
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,512
...divide the land and tell people
to go north and then go south?

42
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:44,442
Why?

43
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,775
If Vietnam were truly
for the Vietnamese people...

44
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,080
...we would be able to choose
the kind of government we want.

45
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,316
A nation can't have two governments any
more than a family can have two fathers.

46
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:59,589
-They have bombs, ten men for one of us!
-He's right.

47
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,227
What do we have?

48
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,526
We have rags! We have rifles!

49
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,261
And sticks! We have sticks!

50
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:11,196
We have no rank, no promotion.

51
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,174
We take no money.

52
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,912
We are your servants.

53
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:21,272
We respect your homes and shrines.

54
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,251
We are your family.

55
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,742
Do you want to dance?

56
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,155
<i>It was my brother Sau I loved the most.</i>

57
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:14,468
<i>He was always there to protect me</i>
<i>and make me laugh.</i>

58
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,452
Hurry.

59
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,816
Sweet rice, black beans.

60
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,693
You be very careful. Write, Sau.

61
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,022
I will return.

62
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,767
Le Ly, I will return.

63
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,872
Be a big girl.
Always take care of Mama and Papa.

64
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,942
Protect yourself from ghosts.

65
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,132
Take care.

66
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,581
<i>As they went north to Hanoi</i>
<i>with the Viet Cong...</i>

67
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:05,619
<i>...I felt it was the last time</i>
<i>I'd see my older brother, Bon...</i>

68
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,417
<i>...and my younger brother, Sau,</i>
<i>for a long, long time.</i>

69
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,390
<i>Maybe forever.</i>

70
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,524
<i>But it was Sau who was ripped</i>
<i>from my heart.</i>

71
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:28,437
You understand that a country is more
than a lot of dirt, rivers and forests?

72
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,275
You know your brother, Sau,
may not come back?

73
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,719
I told you many times...

74
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,429
...the Chinese ruled our land.

75
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,165
Many died.

76
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,759
Le Loi, Jia Long and the Trung sisters.

77
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:58,698
And your ancestor Phung Thi Chinh fought
to throw out the Chinese.

78
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:03,111
Your grandfather fought
and died against the Japanese...

79
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,110
...just before you were born.

80
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,677
We suffered much.

81
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,880
When the Japanese came...

82
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,079
...your mother and I were taken
to Danang...

83
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,522
...to build a runway for the airplanes.

84
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,264
We worked like slaves.

85
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,333
Our reward was a bowl of rice...

86
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,495
...and another day of life.

87
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,898
Freedom is never a gift, Bay Ly.

88
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,442
It must be won and won again.
You know that?

89
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,077
I do.

90
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,875
See this land?

91
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,176
Vietnam is going to be yours now.

92
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,145
If the enemy returns...

93
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,948
...you must be both a daughter
and a son now.

94
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,735
<i>From my father, I learned to love God</i>
<i>and the people I could not see...</i>

95
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,309
<i>...my ancestors.</i>

96
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,576
<i>But I would learn in time...</i>

97
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,650
<i>...my father's words would be twisted</i>
<i>by events.</i>

98
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:38,630
<i>Government soldiers came to our village</i>
<i>with the support of American advisors.</i>

99
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,733
Your village will be safe.

100
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,065
<i>They built barricades</i>
<i>against the Viet Cong.</i>

101
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,498
It's part of the new Binh Ky hamlet.

102
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:50,169
Many of you will be asked
to take militia training...

103
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,340
...so you will be prepared...

104
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,176
...to resist the Communist rebels!

105
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,544
You will be rewarded...

106
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,482
...with food and money.

107
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,986
Your older children will be sent to camp...

108
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,221
...for military training.

109
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,029
But younger children can go to school.

110
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:14,069
Your village will be happy and peaceful.

111
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,901
Do you have any questions?

112
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,930
Go to your leader.

113
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,539
<i>The soldiers ate our food,</i>
<i>slept with our women...</i>

114
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,585
<i>...and searched us just as the soldiers</i>
<i>of the warlords had centuries before.</i>

115
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,992
<i>But the government leader, whose name</i>
<i>was Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally...</i>

116
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,219
<i>...was a Catholic, like the French...</i>

117
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:43,957
<i>...and that alone made him suspicious</i>
<i>to the Buddhists in our area.</i>

118
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,702
<i>The Northern leader, Ho Chi Minh...</i>

119
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:52,474
<i>...had been a great patriot</i>
<i>against the Japanese and the French.</i>

120
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,634
<i>We heard stories of his compassion</i>
<i>and his love for Vietnam.</i>

121
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:16,124
What are they? Americans?

122
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,565
They say they all have blind blue eyes
behind their glasses.

123
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:25,740
If you take their shoes off,
they have soft feet and cry in pain.

124
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,635
Take away their glasses,
their boots, they can't fight.

125
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,806
Not very good soldiers.

126
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,242
Not very good fence.

127
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,142
Your president, Ngo Dinh Diem,
wants to know...

128
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:41,151
...what will you do if you see a Viet Cong...

129
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,251
...or hear about someone helping them.

130
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,688
Turn him in to the soldiers.

131
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:51,164
Good.

132
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,427
And get a big reward for every Viet Cong
you help capture.

133
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,706
<i>During the day,</i>
<i>we were a government village.</i>

134
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:05,144
<i>But each night, when the soldiers returned</i>
<i>to their base and we played...</i>

135
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:08,541
<i>...there was never any shortage</i>
<i>of Viet Cong fighters.</i>

136
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,627
<i>One night, the Viet Cong came</i>
<i>for my teacher.</i>

137
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,939
Have you been teaching these children
to betray their country? Traitor!

138
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,548
The first thing you should learn
on this night...

139
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,284
...Ky La was saved from the oppressors.

140
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,593
We're the liberators!

141
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,192
<i>The night belonged to the Viet Cong.</i>

142
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,661
<i>Even though I was scared...</i>

143
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,233
<i>...there was no real choice.</i>

144
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:03,269
<i>They fought for our freedom</i>
<i>against the Southern government.</i>

145
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,140
No matter who's asking the questions,
either side...

146
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,438
...play stupid, stupid, stupid child.

147
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,274
Any news from Sau or Bon?

148
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,211
They're training in the North.

149
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:20,753
-Any chance for a visit?
-There's no time for sons and mothers.

150
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,860
I told them we needed her on the farm.

151
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,991
For all the help she is here...

152
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,493
...maybe we should send her with Sau.

153
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,634
That'll teach her the value of work.

154
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:34,997
Don't say that!

155
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,702
Le Ly must do her work like everyone else.

156
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:42,810
She thinks she's too good for work.
Too busy flirting with no-good schoolboys.

157
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,739
-No, it's the big boys that bother me.
-Don't talk like that.

158
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,576
-Be quiet!
-Don't hit her!

159
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:49,975
Do you hear me?

160
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,111
Do you want to send all my children
to Hanoi or Saigon?

161
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:56,824
If I can't have my family around me,
what's the point of living?

162
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,050
You always think of only yourself!

163
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,558
The French, the Japanese,
now the Americans are all over us!

164
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,296
It's good they go North.

165
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,668
War is coming, you stupid, selfish man!

166
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,161
Stop it!

167
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,393
Go!

168
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,838
Forgive him, Mama.

169
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,878
Don't cry.

170
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,753
I've made your papa lose face.

171
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,350
If you ever do that to a husband...

172
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:34,661
...I'll have both your cheeks glowing,
one from him and one from me.

173
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,955
You hear me?

174
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,744
Who's first?

175
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:02,215
You talk now or it's bye-bye, Charlie!

176
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,923
You dig, asshole?

177
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,637
All right, it's your ass!

178
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,632
Kiss it good-bye.

179
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,177
You're next.

180
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,012
You talk?

181
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,517
You going to talk?

182
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:08,653
<i>At my mother's request, a local wizard</i>
<i>examined the umbilical cords...</i>

183
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,654
<i>...of my two soldier brothers...</i>

184
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,984
<i>...who hadn't written in over a year.</i>

185
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:14,525
The older one...

186
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,488
...is strong and healthy.

187
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,298
The younger one...

188
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,871
...is in a place too gray for me to see.

189
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,575
No, that's not true.

190
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,705
I know Sau is alive.

191
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,378
I feel it in my womb.

192
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,080
Did you hear...

193
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,155
...funny noises last night?

194
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,757
Maybe voices...

195
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,553
...last night in the rain?

196
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:46,826
I did.

197
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,325
Here is your trouble, then.

198
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,666
Your shrine...

199
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,000
...is too small.

200
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,164
And we have a lost soul...

201
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,165
...who needs to come in.

202
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,502
That's all.

203
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:04,778
Just build a shrine outside...

204
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,172
...and everything will be fine.

205
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,017
<i>The Viet Cong ingrained</i>
<i>in us a sense of ''xa '':</i>

206
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,053
<i>Duty to land...</i>

207
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:49,848
<i>...duty to country.</i>

208
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:52,592
<i>The ant became our moral model.</i>

209
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,589
<i>We formed cells, associations...</i>

210
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:58,460
<i>...where no one person</i>
<i>accumulated power over others.</i>

211
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,593
Only in battle or by your own hands
will you be immortalized.

212
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:07,742
<i>You never moved up in the ant society,</i>
<i>you only moved further in.</i>

213
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,335
<i>If the Viet Cong won the peasants over...</i>

214
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,709
<i>...it was because they lived their lives</i>
<i>with us.</i>

215
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,866
<i>But every time we ambushed</i>
<i>the government soldiers...</i>

216
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,735
<i>...twice as many came back.</i>

217
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:41,589
Get your sorry asses down there!

218
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,198
<i>One day...</i>

219
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,875
<i>...they came for me.</i>

220
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,438
Papa! Help me!

221
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,040
Tell me quickly.
Why were you on the road?

222
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,381
Cutting grass for the water buffalo.
I didn't tell my parents.

223
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:35,312
Liar.

224
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:40,848
Again.

225
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,819
Why were you on the road?

226
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,390
I didn't mean any harm!

227
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,194
Liar!

228
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,477
You are <i>can bo cai...</i>

229
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,113
...VC cadre girl.

230
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,549
You were warning your friends.

231
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:16,285
Where's the VC base?

232
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,324
I don't know.

233
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,167
How many battles have you been in?

234
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,442
What's your rank?

235
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,104
Please<i>....</i>

236
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,444
I'm just a girl.

237
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,182
I have not done it.

238
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,397
Do you know what this is?

239
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,595
Think what this can do to your body.

240
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,998
How would your baby like you
with no nipples?

241
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,537
Or maybe I could cut some skin
off your ass to make some sandals.

242
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,437
Think about it...

243
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,744
...Miss Viet Cong hero.

244
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,152
And when you're called again...

245
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,686
...be prepared to tell me
everything you know.

246
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,256
Don't move.

247
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,088
Don't move.

248
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:13,791
I haven't done anything!
I don't know anything!

249
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:37,750
<i>My mother used my dowry to bribe</i>
<i>a military official to have me released.</i>

250
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,210
<i>And now...</i>

251
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:43,550
<i>...the villagers were suspicious</i>
<i>of my family's ties to the government.</i>

252
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:52,059
<i>Finally...</i>

253
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,200
<i>...the Viet Cong came for me.</i>

254
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,401
-She did nothing!
-Stay back!

255
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:00,865
No respect!

256
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,539
You've no respect!

257
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,441
-I'm coming with her!
-No, the prisoner comes alone!

258
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:07,506
Stay back!

259
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:10,474
Our men were betrayed.

260
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,743
The informer's here!

261
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,579
How else could the enemy know so much?

262
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:20,089
This village is filled with traitors!

263
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:24,364
Government sympathizers
that would sell us out for a relative...

264
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,299
...for money, for privilege!

265
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,494
So I ask you:

266
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,471
What should we do with these people?

267
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,872
We must give these people a lesson
they will never forget.

268
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:42,448
See?

269
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,275
See it?

270
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,524
-What is it?
-A grave.

271
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:51,790
Your grave...

272
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,121
...stupid girl.

273
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,131
What deal did you make
to get out of prison?

274
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,962
Did you promise them some of our ears
for their belts?

275
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:05,129
No, my mother bribed an official.
Why won't you believe me?

276
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,800
Little rich girl!

277
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:35,731
You want to live?

278
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,942
My life is in your hands.

279
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,609
What does that mean?

280
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:46,943
I mean I won't talk to the enemy.

281
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,810
I've been shamed enough in my village.

282
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,144
If you want, I'll go far away.

283
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:55,451
I'll never come back.

284
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:03,859
You talk about this, I'll kill you for real.

285
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,431
No, don't!

286
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,534
No, get off!

287
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:17,076
Shut up!

288
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:48,170
<i>I was never to understand</i>
<i>why I was raped...</i>

289
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:49,671
<i>...and not killed.</i>

290
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:54,208
<i>Or if I had ever really been sentenced</i>
<i>by the Viet Cong.</i>

291
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,979
<i>It may have just been a warning</i>
<i>to my father.</i>

292
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,253
<i>But it ended forever...</i>

293
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,126
<i>...my relationship to my village.</i>

294
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,950
<i>My sister Hai found us a job in the city.</i>

295
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:39,455
<i>Papa stayed on the land</i>
<i>to guard the spirits of our ancestors.</i>

296
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:41,787
<i>In Saigon...</i>

297
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,092
<i>...much to our confusion...</i>

298
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,358
<i>...the monks were being arrested.</i>

299
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:00,744
<i>I've never seen so many cars,</i>
<i>so many people.</i>

300
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,244
The other one.

301
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:24,995
Madam, they're ready.

302
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:33,878
This way.

303
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,231
Country fresh. Good workers.

304
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:58,096
So, which village?

305
00:35:58,272 --> 00:35:59,261
Ky La.

306
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,474
Near Danang?

307
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,908
Ly is wonderful with children.

308
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,705
Perfect babysitter.

309
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:09,715
How old is she?

310
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:11,209
Eighteen.

311
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,913
Is she strong?

312
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:19,021
Yes, she's very strong. She started
to work in the fields when she was four.

313
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,121
They'll do.

314
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:24,890
Let's go.

315
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:13,236
You'll be punished for this, you stupid girl!

316
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,716
Making the Master open the door!

317
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:19,011
Don't be too hard on her.
It's been a long day.

318
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,680
Run off to bed. I'm fine. Go on.

319
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,766
I couldn't sleep.

320
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:15,996
I couldn't either, Master.

321
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,616
I am not your first.

322
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:42,548
Yes, you are.

323
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,664
I was raped...

324
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:59,571
...by the village boys in Ky La.

325
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,736
My poor thing.

326
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,106
Have you bled?

327
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:49,884
Stupid girl.

328
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,583
You weren't satisfied with a perfect life
in a perfect house?

329
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:59,298
You had to seduce the husband!
Made him stray from his wife.

330
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,190
Look what it brought you.

331
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,668
That's not how it happened!
Anh cares for me. He loves me.

332
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:08,633
Do you think a stupid girl like you
means anything to him?

333
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,772
Now you're going to have his bastard.

334
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,637
Perfect!

335
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:16,013
You'll have to get rid of it.

336
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,516
We'll go see the herbalist tomorrow.

337
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,385
What are you doing?

338
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,122
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.

339
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,361
I'm expecting a child.

340
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:11,436
Yes, I know.

341
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,930
We learned it from the herbalist.

342
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:17,074
Who is the father?

343
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:20,208
Don't look so surprised.

344
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,173
A boy.

345
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:29,015
Someone I met in the park.
You don't know him.

346
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,652
Why are you burning incense?

347
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:35,450
Because...

348
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,091
...I don't want the baby.

349
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,390
I was praying to be forgiven.

350
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,235
In front of my husband's ancestors?

351
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,340
I don't know what else to do.

352
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:49,475
The boy's Catholic, like you.

353
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,810
I'm a Buddhist.

354
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:53,838
I see.

355
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,742
Le Ly, I have another explanation.

356
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:04,656
I believe the father of your baby
is my husband.

357
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,716
Oh, no! Anh<i>....</i> I mean the--

358
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,792
Silence!

359
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:18,928
You know I'm not well.

360
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,875
But I have given my husband sons.

361
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:24,905
Beautiful boys.

362
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:28,178
As fine as any woman could've given him.

363
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:29,876
Don't think...

364
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:33,551
...you won't pay for what you've done.

365
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:38,222
You and your daughter
must leave the house at once.

366
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,591
Leave?

367
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:41,922
But why?

368
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,329
Nobody knows but you.

369
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,157
Let people think the father is some soldier.

370
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,030
I know, and that's enough.

371
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,268
Men are like dogs pissing on posts.

372
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,640
They go once, they go twice.

373
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,415
But Bay Ly's no threat to you.
She has nothing for a proper man.

374
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,884
She's just a country girl.

375
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:07,910
An ignorant, stupid, foolish child.

376
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,614
A maid that will never be a bride.

377
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,025
She's nothing! Worthless!

378
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,793
Absolutely not.

379
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,396
I won't have her in my house.

380
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:18,993
Not as a nanny.

381
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,760
Not as a housekeeper.

382
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,232
Then as number two wife!

383
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:22,927
What?

384
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,528
You're crazy.

385
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,165
As concubine to the Master.

386
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,537
As your slave to kick around.

387
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,114
To warm your husband's bed
when you have better things to do.

388
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:38,851
Why waste your health on a man's rutting
when you can leave it to a stupid girl?

389
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,878
You're always number one wife.

390
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:43,455
The law is on your side.

391
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,081
-Please, Mama!
-Stupid, stop!

392
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:56,262
They must go now. Today, before supper.

393
00:45:57,471 --> 00:45:59,200
You tried to get rid of it?

394
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,871
Yes, of course.

395
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:03,242
But your seed, Master, is too strong.

396
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:06,468
Now it has hold of Bay Ly, too.

397
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,815
Please, help us get by the best we can.

398
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,184
At least until the child is born.

399
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:15,614
I won't throw you into the street.

400
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:18,786
But I cannot ask my wife
to let you live with us.

401
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,692
I'll put you in an apartment.

402
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:22,853
Not in Saigon.

403
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:24,896
How far away do you want them?

404
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,858
How far can you drive in a day?

405
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,671
All right.

406
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,809
I will send them back to Danang.

407
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,239
But we have nothing!

408
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,642
With enough money until the baby's born.

409
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:42,237
I'll send you money monthly.

410
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,143
To a bank or a relative.

411
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:47,083
I don't want you to know their address.

412
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,044
That's an absolute condition.

413
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:54,792
You will have enough to live on.

414
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,759
My steward will handle everything.

415
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,357
One day she'll come back!

416
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,927
Don't forget her!
She makes an excellent second wife.

417
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,907
Promise you won't forget her.

418
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:17,176
<i>But the money never came.</i>

419
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,182
<i>Madame Lien saw to that.</i>

420
00:47:20,153 --> 00:47:22,815
<i>My mother sold snails</i>
<i>for a while in Danang...</i>

421
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,791
<i>...but soon gave up and returned to Ky La.</i>

422
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:31,428
<i>My father, ashamed that I was unmarried</i>
<i>and pregnant, refused to see me.</i>

423
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,494
-You want Mary Jane?
-Go away.

424
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:35,534
Hey, GI, number one cigarette?

425
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,703
How about some boom-boom?

426
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,465
No, me no hooker!

427
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:41,573
-Give you $10.
-No. Cigarettes?

428
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:43,676
-$15.
-No. Cigarettes?

429
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:47,413
What you hiding there?
Those baby bellies turn me on.

430
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:49,879
-Come on, give you $50. Come on.
-No! MP! MP!

431
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:51,314
No, you fuck off!

432
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:12,838
What's in the box?

433
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:15,801
Johnny Walker, cigarettes.

434
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,444
-What's this?
-Marijuana, huh?

435
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,845
This is all I have.

436
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:25,748
That's okay.

437
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:00,411
Where's Kim?

438
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,611
In work.

439
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,955
Kim work.

440
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:12,026
I'll wait for her, little sister.

441
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:14,099
No, baby. Baby.

442
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,197
You go, 'bye.

443
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:17,928
Beer.

444
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,572
You go, 'bye.

445
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,703
Beer.

446
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,827
I look for Kim.

447
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:46,192
Me daughter.

448
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:48,766
Kim here?

449
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:49,961
She not here.

450
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,204
Please. Me daughter, daughter.

451
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:54,531
I come long way.

452
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:56,533
-Go away.
-Please, please.

453
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:58,133
Me Papa.

454
00:49:58,612 --> 00:49:59,943
-Papa.
-Get him out.

455
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:02,042
-No see long time.
-Get him out.

456
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,107
Please, please, please!

457
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:08,046
Go now, you stupid gook asshole!

458
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:32,274
-What are you doing here?
-Papa's at the house. Paul's back.

459
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,376
Paul's back? So soon?

460
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,710
Paul, good to see you, honey!

461
00:50:37,984 --> 00:50:39,281
This isn't a good time.

462
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:41,176
Oh, baby!

463
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:45,985
I'm six weeks in the fucking bush.
I need some pussy bad! Now!

464
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,351
Father came a long way to see me.
Not good time.

465
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,796
He's got time, I don't. Get him out!

466
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:54,758
Come back.

467
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:57,836
I need some pussy, now, baby. Now!

468
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,197
He pays my bills. He's my man.

469
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:03,069
-Will you come on?
-Give me a little time, Papa.

470
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,344
Come back in two hours.

471
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:08,840
Let's do it.

472
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,307
See you.

473
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:46,580
I came to see your sister.

474
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,548
She's at work.

475
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:50,720
Selling near the base.

476
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:53,926
-Is she doing well? Getting by?
-She's lazy.

477
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,760
-But I help her all I can.
-And the baby?

478
00:51:57,164 --> 00:52:00,156
I don't know why she had to seduce
her master's husband.

479
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,461
When she got caught,
did she keep quiet? No!

480
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:05,832
Yes. She has brought shame on us.

481
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,031
An unwed mother.

482
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:12,445
But she's not the only one
who has brought shame to us.

483
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,978
I do the best I can, Papa.

484
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,511
I'll be late for work.

485
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:24,415
When you see her...

486
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,253
...tell her I came to see her.

487
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:34,800
I miss her very much.

488
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:40,065
She shouldn't worry about being punished
for her mistake.

489
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,767
Life finds a way to balance itself.

490
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:51,550
Will you tell her that?

491
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,278
Of course, Papa.

492
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:56,881
And me?

493
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:00,221
You too, my little one.

494
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:11,596
Your boyfriend treated Papa so bad.

495
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:14,166
You would be ashamed.

496
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:15,601
You were there.

497
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,775
This is not the way Papa taught us to be.

498
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:23,407
Do you think I like what I'm doing?

499
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,349
Someone has to make a living around here.
You don't help!

500
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,649
I don't know why I let you stay here!

501
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,814
My boyfriends all complain about you!

502
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,391
Pregnant women are bad luck!

503
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,460
How disrespectful you are! If Papa--

504
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:37,754
Papa what?

505
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:38,989
An invader!

506
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:40,164
Really?

507
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:41,832
You sleep with the enemy!

508
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:43,493
You betray your family!

509
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:45,837
That's enough!

510
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,039
That's enough out of you!

511
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:51,568
And I'll marry one, too! You'll see!

512
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,111
And I'll get out of this goddamn country!

513
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:59,718
And as for you, young lady...

514
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:02,416
...no more charity for you!

515
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:04,655
Go on! Get out!

516
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:06,014
Get out!

517
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,121
Do you think that
you're the only one Papa loves?

518
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:11,587
You spoiled...

519
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,397
...spoiled<i>....</i>

520
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:30,506
<i>To survive, I picked through</i>
<i>the American base camp garbage.</i>

521
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,228
<i>And it was there that I first saw...</i>

522
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,697
<i>...the remains of poor prostitutes</i>
<i>who'd been murdered by men.</i>

523
00:54:57,944 --> 00:54:59,844
Thank heaven it's a boy.

524
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:02,675
Put him up to feed quickly.
Too much blood.

525
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,619
How will you care for him?

526
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:10,446
Better give him away or kill him.

527
00:55:10,657 --> 00:55:12,955
And your shame will be washed away.

528
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:28,834
You're a very lucky girl among
the indig personnel referred to this office.

529
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:32,808
I will have no problem placing you.

530
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,576
Provided, of course, you play ball.

531
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:38,849
No big deal.

532
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,618
We'll do it any way you want.

533
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:43,880
Now, you do your best...

534
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,251
...and I'll do mine.

535
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:52,954
Open door!

536
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:57,861
Don't make such a big deal about it.
Just a little suck.

537
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:04,008
Bitch!

538
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,211
Stop!

539
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,438
You! Call MP now!

540
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,850
This man try to rape me!

541
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:13,077
Go! Go!

542
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:17,719
This is supposed to be a joke, right?
It's a joke.

543
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,493
<i>Months went by.</i>

544
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:27,265
<i>There were more prostitutes, pimps,</i>
<i>black marketeers. Everything had a price.</i>

545
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,362
<i>My family was suffering.</i>

546
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,631
<i>My papa had gotten old and sick</i>
<i>and could no longer work the land.</i>

547
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,702
Hey, GI, you buy? You buy?

548
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,206
-No, not today.
-GI, you buy? Smokes? You buy?

549
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:45,881
GI, you buy?

550
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,709
Hi, Big Mike.

551
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,345
You look <i>beaucoup sau.</i>

552
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:52,255
No good day.

553
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:55,920
I got something might change your mood.
See those grunts?

554
00:56:56,396 --> 00:56:58,626
They're leaving for the world today.

555
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:01,263
So what? They want souvenirs?

556
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,336
I got Chinese jade, Big Mike. Mary Jane.
<i>Titi</i> money.

557
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:07,729
No, they want a real souvenir.
They want boom-boom you.

558
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,009
<i>Beaucoup</i> boom-boom over there.

559
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:13,171
Plenty of crabs over there, too.

560
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:17,941
These pencil dicks are clean. They've been
in the bush since they got here.

561
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,109
One of them's going home to his wife.

562
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:23,687
Want them to go boom-boom
some scuzbag and bring home the clap?

563
00:57:24,124 --> 00:57:26,422
They're willing to pay $20 each head.

564
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:30,191
Le Ly good girl. Fuck off.

565
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:34,623
Okay, five flags. Just for one guy.
$100 for the other.

566
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,758
$200, real money.

567
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:38,735
Why?

568
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:40,664
Too much.

569
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,369
You joking.

570
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,204
These guys got the bread
from being in the bush.

571
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:47,705
I told them clean poon is expensive.

572
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:50,105
Look, Le<i>....</i>

573
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,940
They beat the odds.

574
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:56,052
They want to leave something behind.
A memory. Something.

575
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:00,825
Le Ly not that kind of girl.

576
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:02,693
No deal.

577
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:05,631
Jesus Christ, you drive a hard bargain.

578
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:07,558
400 fucking dollars.

579
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,732
This is green.

580
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:12,234
That's it. That's all they gave me.

581
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,906
You give me $50 commission,
you pocket $350.

582
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:19,176
Support your family for a year, easy.
What's so hard about it?

583
00:58:19,646 --> 00:58:21,307
15 minutes. It ain't even work.

584
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:25,611
Just lie there and let them do the work.
What they'll do you've already done.

585
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:31,556
They don't got all day. Take the money...

586
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:33,815
...and give them a story to bring home.

587
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:35,424
You're no cherry.

588
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,722
Just do it for fucking world peace.

589
00:58:39,232 --> 00:58:40,529
Come on!

590
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:42,999
Send the poor bastards home with a smile.

591
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,052
<i>My father was dying.</i>

592
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:13,658
<i>I returned for the first time to my village.</i>

593
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:36,666
What are you doing here?

594
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:38,643
I heard there's trouble.

595
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:39,971
Where's Papa?

596
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:50,179
The Americans came one day
to look at our family bunker.

597
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:55,792
They think Viet Cong inside,
make Papa go inside first.

598
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:57,254
No VC!

599
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,691
<i>But he told them no one was inside.</i>

600
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:02,564
<i>They still throw grenade.</i>

601
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:05,364
But it did not explode.

602
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,699
<i>Two Americans went in.</i>

603
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,442
<i>No more.</i>

604
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,441
They were very angry at Papa.

605
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,210
<i>They beat him.</i>

606
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:21,280
<i>Put paper on his back:</i>

607
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:22,613
<i>''VC. ''</i>

608
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:24,722
<i>Took him to prison.</i>

609
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,225
Bad, bad beating.

610
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,122
Come, Mama.

611
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:33,797
Come.

612
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,252
You're drinking now.

613
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:06,230
Stupid wizard came by the other day.

614
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:11,566
He said to me:

615
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:15,866
'<i>'</i>I have nothing to tell you.'<i>'</i>
Just like that. I have no future.

616
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,909
He didn't mean it.

617
01:03:19,846 --> 01:03:22,007
If I stay in the village, I die.

618
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,883
You know wizards,
they hate to give people bad news.

619
01:03:26,252 --> 01:03:29,915
You're just imagining things.
There's nothing to worry about.

620
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:31,950
Who's worried?

621
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:36,861
What's wrong with living forever
with your ancestors?

622
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:41,866
I'm worried about you,
but your mother is not the same.
