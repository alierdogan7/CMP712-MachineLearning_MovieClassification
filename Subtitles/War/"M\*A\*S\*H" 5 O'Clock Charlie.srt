Right. Uh, oh, sir, excuse me.

While I've got you on the pipe,
the suggestion's been made...

149
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:19,136
that we could use
an oh-four W.W. "nug."

150

<i>Yeah, that's right, sir.</i>
<i>A nug so that we can, uh, uh</i>...

151
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:27,873
What's a nug, sir?
Well, a nug is a, uh...

152
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:32,111
A gun, sir. A 40 "M.M." gun.

153
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,278
- Henry, you gotta be kidding!
- We definitely do not need a nug.

154
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,187

- We don't need a gun or a nug.

What are you trying to do,
get us into the war?

156
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,018
General, listen, you send a gun up here
and that's gonna draw fire.

157
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,087
- That won't do our wounded much good.
- Give me that!

- Isn't that good enough for ya?
- Yeah, what more do you want?

Yes, of course. Burns.

We wanted to talk to you

- There's a war on, General.
- I read the papers.

The major and l...
we two majors...

feel that the colonel
and a certain two captains...

199
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,639
That's two majors against
a colonel and two captains.

200
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:15,943
What the major is trying to say,
General, is that we feel they will...

201

- The colonel and two captains.
- Try to influence you against the gun.

202

Nothing can make a general's mind up
for him. I'll decide this matter myself.

- I'd better tell Blake I'm in camp.

- Major, I'll want to discuss this later.
- Yes, sir.

Instead of trying to knock out Charlie,
just get rid of this.

00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:12,366
That'll keep him away.
Or does that make too much sense?

215

- Certainly not.

otherwise. No, I don't think that.

Men, I don't have to tell you
of the importance of our mission.

235
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:58,076
We are the first surgical unit
to have an antiaircraft capability.

236
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:02,204
Our success is vital.
I repeat, vital.

- Oh, well, I am.

But for purposes of our table
of organization, I am the commander.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,934
So you will be platoon leader,

00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,936
you will be squad leader,

245
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,905

Oh, please.
Goes great with a soap chaser.

324
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,749
Mmm!

325
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,751
I gotta hand it to us, Trap.

326
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,515
We have made that ammo dump
absolutely unmissable.

327
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:32,047
- Even for Charlie.
- Two hours to show time. It'll be over.

328
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,151
And poor Frank won't be able
to play with his "ack-ack" anymore.

329
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:38,062
Hey, let's do something nice for him.

330
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,861
All right. How about a couple
of C.C.'s of the plague?

331
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:44,267
- We could name an infection after him.
- Or make him the infection.

332
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,397
Either way, it's a nice gesture.

333
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,143
- I just had a terrible idea.
- Hmm?

334
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:56,171
<i>What if that creep gets lucky and hits</i>
<i>Charlie before Charlie hits the dump?</i>

335
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,184
<i>We'd better take care</i>
<i>of that contingency.</i>

336
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,282
Hey! This is the nurses' shower!

337
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,382
I waited as long as I could.

338
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,795
She's late today.

339
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:17,335
Okay, watch it!
Here he comes. Hurry!

340
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,574
Hi, Frank. Down this way.

341
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:24,543
- We think it's an early abscess.
- Well, why call on me?

342
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,045
Because when it comes to pus,
we always think of you.

343
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:30,515
This is your arena.
Post-op infections, that's you.

344
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,757
Problem is he should've
had antibiotics immediately.

345
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:43,922
<i>You waited too long.</i>
<i>Now you've got a fever on your hands.</i>

346
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,363
Fantastic. He goes right to
the heart of the clinical picture.

347
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,367
He's got eyes
in the back of his stethoscope.

348
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:53,896
Doctor, I'm getting ready to do the
4:30 feeding on Thompson. Bed number 6.

349
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:56,875
You do that, Ginger.
Give him the 4:30 feeding.

350
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,877
Kind of fun working like this,
huh, guys?

351
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,839
- We got to pull together more, Frank.
- Yeah.

352
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:07,067
Amen to that, old buddy.

353
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:10,703
<i>[Engine Sputtering]</i>

354
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,252
That's Charlie.

355
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,084
Why, it can't be, Frank.
It's only 4:30.

356
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,784
I know Charlie when I hear him.

357
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,884
Impossible.

358
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,233
You... You sneaks!

359
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,966
I've got to get to that gun.

360
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,271
It's Pearl Harbor all over again!

361
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:45,677
<i>[P.A. Announcer]</i>
<i>Attention. Two minutes to Charlie.</i>

362
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:49,479
- <i>Two minutes to Charlie.</i>
- Take your positions, men!

363
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:51,519
Uh, uh, uh...

364
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,578
Uh, uh, uh...

365
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:57,456
- <i>180 degrees point south.</i>
- 180 degrees.

366
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,427
- By 270 point west.
- 270.

367
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,298
- <i>On a sixty degree azimuth due north.</i>
- Sixty!

368
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:09,428
- A 60 degree azimuth. Do I hear 65?
- <i>I bid 65!</i>

369
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,439
- <i>Wait a minute. He said sixty.</i>
- <i>Sixty!</i>

370
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,101
- I'm sorry, sir, we already have a 65.
- 65.

371
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,701
- I said 65!
- Let's start all over.

372
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,339
- Colonel!
- I have a colonel. Do I hear a general?

373
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:22,441
- <i>I'll bid a general, one star.</i>
- One!

374
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:25,248
- A one-star general. Do I hear two?
- Two!

375
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,517
Come on, we're not gonna let this
fine war go for just a two-star general.

376
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,901
Henry, what they're doing is mutiny!

377
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:48,306
- That's a little strong, Frank.
- I'm placing you both under arrest!

[Bomb Whistling]

379

Fire, damn it! Fire!

381
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,883
- But, sir...
- You heard him, soldier. Fire!

382
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,571
Hell of a shot, Frank.

383

<i>the hospital is open 24 hours...</i>

<i>for your dining and dancing pleasure.</i>

387

- Did you see this stuff on vein grafts?
- Yeah, that's fantastic.

388
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,797
I bet that cuts down
on amputations by 50 percent.

389
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,891
Or better.

390
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:50,501
- You know, I could eat.
- Yeah.

- I miss him.
- Me too.

393
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,277
Hey, tell the truth, Frank.
Don't you miss Charlie?

394
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:05,582
- Oh, I forgot. You did.
- Oh, Hawk, that's in bad taste.

395
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:09,385
- If I did, it was all your fault!
- Frank, why don't you join us?

396
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,585
You don't mind eating with
a couple of"peacemongers," do you?

- No.
- Come on, Frank.
