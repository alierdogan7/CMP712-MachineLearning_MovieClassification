00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,082
[military march]

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,607
I have a nice load of ladies
for you this morning.

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,048
Them city dick turd packing hookey
motherfuckers have drafted...

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,681
my main man away.
They'll send you off to kill Chinks.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,481
Who's gonna take care of
the vineyards for me on the street?

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,483
Look son, I don't care
what you mother says.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,406
You're doing the right thing by joining up
now. Get the service out of the way.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,805
You're fighting a real war over there,
boy. It's not like your make up stories.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,489
You're always bragging about
how you ran off and joined up.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,085
It's good enough for you.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,450
- Vinnie...
- Come on, Jill.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,602
Vinnie, I've got work to do.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,566
You've got work to do?
What am I, going to a picnic?

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,330
Hey, where you going?

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,409
Excuse me, Inspector. You think
J. Edgar Hoover would fire you?

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,090
Well, the cuffs have got to stay on.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,927
Bets, about last night, I...

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,081
Well, I just...
I want you to know...

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,481
Don't worry, Billy.
I wanted to.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,769
It'll make me feel closer
while you're away.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,602
Well, take care of your ass, nigger.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,646
Take care.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,963
You take care of yourself, you hear.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,163
You relax, just relax.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,489
I'll get out of this.
I'll kiss the sergeant or something.

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,609
Hey, peace, man.
Make love, not war, man.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,005
[ALVIN]: August 27, 1967.
We took the oath this morning.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,769
Tyrone Washington, Chicago, Illinois.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,162
Billy Ray Pike, Galveston, Texas.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,484
Me, Alvin Foster, Emporia, Kansas.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,770
Vinnie Fazio, Brooklyn, New York.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,926
Dave Bisbee, Seattle, Washington.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,124
And a bunch of other guys
from all over the country.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,690
I decided to keep a journal...

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,730
and write about our experiences
in the Marine Corps.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,121
Maybe I can get it
published some day.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,925
That is if anybody even wants
to read about what happens...

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,721
to a bunch of guys
they're gonna send to Vietnam.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,851
- Hey, look at them guys march.
- What?

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,682
Hey, you think we're gonna get
machine guns?

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,606
I don't know. What do I look like,
an information booth over here?

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,444
- Just guys are marching.
- Hey, my name's Alvin.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,761
Hey, Alvin, I'm Vinnie.
Vinnie Fazio.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,330
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to know you.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,765
- Hey?
- What?

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,600
- You ever shot a machine gun?
- Have I ever shot a machine gun?

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,886
- Yeah.
- I'm from Brooklyn.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,440
- We play ball on the streets, you know.
- You play baseball?

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,169
Yeah.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,208
All right, you people, listen up.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,922
You are now at the US Marine Corps
recruit depot San Diego, California.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,521
When you left home, you were under
your mother's care, you are now...

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,922
under mine. From now on, you will not
eat, sleep, blow your nose...

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,810
or scratch your ass
until someone tells you to do so.

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,123
I am going to give you approximately
30 seconds to fall out of this bus...

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,921
and god help the last man off because
you better give your soul to god...

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,810
because your ass is mine.
Do you understand?

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,167
- Yes!
- I can't hear you.

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,207
Yes!

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,085
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
I still can't hear you.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,288
- Yes, sir!
- Move!

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,445
Move. Get out. Get out.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,761
You get out of the bus right now.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,690
[continuous shouts and yelling]

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,004
God dammit!

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,166
What the fuck has the goddamn
recruiters given me now?

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,730
Holy shit!

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,088
I've never seen a bunch fucking
walking garbage heap in my life.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,051
You look like a bunch of sorry
son of a bitches if I ever saw them!

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,204
Mister, you got something
tickling up your ass?

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,766
What the fuck are you
bouncing up and down at rest for?

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,287
What are you looking at, Hollywood?
Straight eyes.

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,769
I don't owe you no money.

74
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,247
Man, we got
Jesus Christ with us today.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,085
What are you looking at? You
should be looking at your father...

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,322
God, not me.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,882
Do you find something funny?
Get on fucking knees...

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,928
and you be his disciple.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,011
You freaking...
You find again something funny, huh?

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,891
Listen, man...

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,088
- Listen, man?
- I don't want any hassles.

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,844
I mean, I like you. I like you.

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,049
I ain't gonna give you no hassle,
I like you too.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,327
- Okay.
- Maybe you love me?

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,011
- Yeah, I love you. I love everybody.
- Very good.

86
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,289
I love you, too.
Maybe one day we'll get married.

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,404
If you don't get your shit together,
you ain't even have to worry...

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,369
about getting engaged!

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,924
Okay?
What?!

90
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,884
- All right, sir!
- Thank you very much!

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,083
You find something funny?

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,447
- Did you eat shit this morning?
- No, sir.

93
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,490
Then why the fucking shit eating grin?
What do you mean?

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,609
Don't even start to explain yourself.
You're a bad fucking excuse.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,969
Get up on your goddamn feet,
you shit head!

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,365
Come on, snap to!

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,364
Hollywood, what are you looking at?

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,723
Take off those goddamn glasses
before I yank them off you.

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,561
Hey, god dammit.
You, with the fucking pretty face.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,324
What are you spitting
on the ground for?

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,562
- What is that shit in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco, sir.

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,563
- it's what?!
- Chewing tobacco, sir!

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,849
What the hell are you doing,
chewing tobacco in your mouth?

104
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,162
I don't know sir.
I chew when I play baseball.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,971
Do you think this looks like
a baseball stadium?

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,724
- No sir, it doesn't.
- Then what the hell...

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,565
are you chewing tobacco for?
You got on the wrong fucking train?

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,530
- Or did they draft you?
- No, sir. I enlisted, sir.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,604
- You did what?!
- I enlisted in the marines, sir.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,803
What the hell did you do
a thing like that for?!

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,246
- Answer me, god dammit!
- I wanna be a marine, sir.

112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,924
What the hell for?

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,400
- So I can fight for my country, sir.
- You fucking turd!

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,691
Right now I can't stand
to look at you.

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,604
Sergeant, get this shit
out of my fucking face.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,966
I'm Sgt. Loyce.

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,123
I'm your drill instructor for the next
two fucking months, maggots.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,729
Jesus. How in the hell do they
expect me to train fucking marines...

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,089
when they won't even send me
human goddamn beings to start with!

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,209
Sergeant, get these fucking people
through receiving barracks.

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,284
I'm gonna help you out. I don't wanna
drop any of their fucking civilian...

122
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,761
slime on the way through. Jesus!

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,721
When you are told to do so,
you will reach down by your right foot...

124
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,640
...pick up your bags, empty the contents
on the table in front of you.

125
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,323
You will empty your pockets and place
the contents of your pockets...

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,805
on the table in front of you.

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,967
Do it, now!

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,125
What do you got
in your back pocket?

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,646
- A diary.
- Contraband, get rid of it!

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,965
What do you got in your pocket?
All right, Technicolor rubber.

131
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,245
- I bet you're a virgin, aren't you?
- I lost it when I was 13.

132
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,688
- What?
- I lost it when I was 13, sir!

133
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,841
Contraband, get rid of it.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,884
- What's in the plastic there, private?
- Cookies from my girlfriend, sir.

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,281
Bullshit, contraband,
put it on the table.

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,085
Oh, what do we have here?
A little faggot, huh?

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,970
Get your jewelry off there,
sweetheart, and put it on the table.

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,089
What do you have in your
pocket there, lipstick?

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,281
Jesus.
Put the goddamn thing on the table!

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,322
You will answer
the following questions.

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,404
Have you ever had any sexual act
with another man?

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,211
With an animal?
Do you wet your bed?

143
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,370
Do you like to wear women's clothing?
How often do you masturbate?

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,568
- Where's your belt, private?
- What?

145
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,564
- Where's your belt?
- Well, I don't know. Where's his?

146
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,404
I'm asking you private.
Where's your belt?

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,562
I must have left it in my bed.

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,291
You get your belt and you better report
back to me when you're through.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,521
- You understand?
- Okay.

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,921
- You get your belt too.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,049
Unhook.

152
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,689
Move it out, guys.
Get out there.

153
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,410
Move it out.
Move it out.

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,610
Go, go, go, go.

155
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,160
Asshole!
Get up there.

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,127
Move it up to the private
in front of you in file.

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,283
Platoon 163 here.
First five privates, get on the chair.

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,886
Move it up. Hurry!
We don't have all day, private.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,962
Move it up.
Hold it up there, little man.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,283
[electric clipper buzzing]

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,525
[buzzing stops]

162
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,561
Get out of here.
Move.

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,369
Move it up.
We're late.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,801
We don't have all day, ladies.
Anytime, anytime.

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,609
Move it up.
Next five. Next five.

166
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,410
Come on up, quickly!

167
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,966
Get in here.
Get in there, Jesus.

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,209
I want you to do a special job
on Jesus for me there, huh.

169
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,287
Very nice.
Yeah.

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,569
Do Jesus real good there for me.
I want to see Jesus' bald head.

171
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,330
Huh, Jesus? Huh?

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,886
Very cute.

173
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,927
Sexy.

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,961
Very nice.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,921
Cute.

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,442
Try to stay in step with the private
in front of you.

177
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,005
Keep your head always up.

178
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,090
Move it up.
Get in there.

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,806
Move. Move. Move.

180
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,641
All right, you maggots.
Listen up.

181
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,611
We're gonna say
your Marine Corps prayer.

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,251
You will repeat after me.

183
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,328
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,491
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,566
I will fear no evil...

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,601
for I am the biggest, baddest,
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

187
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,049
For I am the biggest, baddest
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,450
When I tell you to prepare to mount
you will say "Prepare to mount" after me.

189
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,124
You're will say "Aye, aye, sir."

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,090
Then you will do it
as I give you the command.

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,563
- Prepare to mount.
- Prepare to mount, aye, aye, sir.

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,201
Do it.

193
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,086
At attention worms.
At attention.

194
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,044
You will repeat after me.

195
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,881
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,167
- Louder!
- Gung ho!

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,647
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

198
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,686
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.

199
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,367
Revelry you at 0430.

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,011
You boneheads go to sleep.

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,568
Who the fuck is Chesty?

202
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,846
[laughter]

203
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,605
Who's gung ho?

204
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,489
[more laughter]

205
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,925
Hey, what do you think,
we're gonna get to shoot tomorrow?

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,244
Oh, great, they got bizzaro over there,
one of those gung ho types.

207
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,088
Hey, what the hell is that?

208
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,087
It's the only paper
I could find to write on.

209
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,161
Oh, yeah?

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,164
Tell me, what are you writing,
a note to your asshole?

211
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,602
- No, it's sort of like a journal, sort of.
- Oh, a journal, huh?

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,205
Why don't you write in your notebook
or something like that?

213
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,567
You saw them,
they took my notebook.

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,886
They did?

215
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,407
What's that under your pillow then,
Swiss cheese? What?

216
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,563
- Hey, that's it.
- Hey...

217
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,405
This is mine.
This is my notebook.

218
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,891
That's right.

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,729
- Hey, how'd you get it?
- I don't reveal my sources.

220
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,849
I didn't register because I figured
if they got you, they got you.

221
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,729
If they don't, they don't.

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,165
Well, they got me.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,491
I guess that's my karma
coming out the Marines.

224
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,891
Shoot

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,444
I knew the Army could draft you, but
did you know the Marines can draft you?

226
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,208
The guy at the recruiting office told me
that if I can prove myself as a writer...

227
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,681
he could get me assigned
to public information in the Marines.

228
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,568
- Oh, yeah?
- Right.

229
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,729
So I can write about all the stuff
we do around here. And then...

230
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,929
if we get sent to Vietnam
I can get into combat information...

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,604
...write about the war.

232
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,045
- Combat?
- Yeah.

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,885
- You wanna get into combat?
- I'm gonna write about it.

234
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,566
What, are you kidding me?
Listen, I'll tell you something.

235
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,325
The only thing I wanna get into is
how I'm gonna get the hell out of here.

236
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,562
And Vinnie Fazio is
gonna get his ass out of here.

237
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,166
- Out of boot camp?
- Yeah, out of boot camp.

238
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,050
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,765
Hey, listen.

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,604
You gotta know the angles.

241
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,682
I've seen a golf range
on the base on the way in.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,001
All the hoi polloi use the golf range.

243
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,050
All you gotta do is move in,
get with the people that can help you.

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,724
That's what I'm talking about.

245
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,203
Well, you're gonna have
to do it without me.

246
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,849
I'm not going.
I'm getting out of here.

247
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,888
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Hey...

248
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,803
What's the matter with you,
you chicken?

249
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,120
Shit.

250
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,807
Pussy.

251
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,369
Hey, what are you doing, son?

252
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,606
And what are you doing, son?

253
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,603
You're gonna get warts, boy?

254
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,330
Hey, stop shouting, you jerk!

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,164
Jerkin' himself off!

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,685
Give me back my blanket.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,091
Shut up!

258
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,007
You listen to me dip shit.
And I ain't gonna repeat myself.

259
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,208
Don't mess with me.

260
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,487
Don't mess near me.

261
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,483
Don't bring no heat down on me.

262
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,641
You're all headed for a fall and
I ain't taking the ride. Do you dig?

263
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,884
You just stay clear of Tyrone.

264
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,570
Because your all a bunch of fuck ups.

265
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,128
And you're all gonna die.

266
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,926
Every last one of you.

267
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,727
You too, dipshit.

268
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,451
Platoon 163.

269
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,601
Sir, Platoon 163.
Aye, aye sir.

270
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Get on the road.

271
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,368
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,124
Hurry up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

273
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,440
What are you doing on my grass,
private, huh?!

274
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,010
Move, move, move.

275
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,084
You wanna rest on that grass?
Get in line!

276
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,924
Move it down.
Move it down.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,650
Oh, what do we have here?

278
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,370
Nice fucking move sweetheart.

279
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,290
When we come out of the village
we're fully dressed, you understand me?

280
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,686
Do I make myself clear?!

281
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,410
Oh, Christ, my nuts!

282
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,200
- Do you like your nuts?
- Let go, man, what are you doing?!

283
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,930
You don't talk to me like that.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,650
- Do you like your nuts?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,926
- You want some?
- Shit, yeah.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,889
- Do you wanna keep them?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,203
All of you son of a bitches,
grab your fucking nuts.

288
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,248
Right now, grab your nuts!

289
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,805
You too, you freak.

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,088
All of you guys grab your nuts.

291
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,322
- Grab your fucking nuts.
- Get a hold of them.

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,689
- Do you like them?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,922
- Do they feel good to you?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,685
If you fucking guys
wanna keep them son of a bitches...

295
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,206
...you better listen to your
drill instructors.

296
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,725
I'm trying to help you keep them.

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,082
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

298
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Do you think your girlfriends is gonna
love it if you come back without them?

299
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,082
No, sir.

300
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,290
If you come back without your balls
they're gonna find another guy.

301
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,249
Did you understand
what I'm saying to you?

302
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,207
Yes, sir!

303
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,000
I've got eight weeks to train you...

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,249
to think, to act, to be one.

305
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,408
I'll have to make you
depend on each other.

306
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,448
I have to make you
a fighting Marines unit.

307
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,969
Look around you.
You like the man next to you?

308
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,206
You think he's a nigger or
that one's a Jew or that one's a spik!

309
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,205
I don't care.

310
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,961
That motherfucker
is gonna save your life one day!

311
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,370
And you better depend on you buddy.
And you're buddy's buddy.

312
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,523
- You understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,051
Sergeant!

314
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,927
Explain your two tours
to these people...

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,890
and clean this shit off
the fucking street.

316
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,931
I spent 26 months in Vietnam.

317
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,204
And I can tell you
right goddamn now, privates...

318
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,568
if you don't pay attention to what's
happening here in the recruit training...

319
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,567
and learn, you're gonna come back from
Vietnam in a goddamn plastic body bag.

320
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,363
Right now the casualty rate for
young Marines is over 50 percent.

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,487
If you don't pay attention, you are
gonna be that private in the body bag.

322
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,531
September 1, 1967.

323
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,569
We can't seem to do anything right.

324
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,043
In fact, half of us don't even know
our right from our left.

325
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,966
Sgt. Loyce says if Uncle Sam
is counting on our platoon...

326
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,283
to win the war for him,
he's betting on the wrong side.

327
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,442
Without my rifle I am useless.

328
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,851
[gunshots]

329
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,881
Undoubtedly, you people have set
some kind of a new record today.

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,043
You have fucked over
these weapons so goddamn bad...

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,168
they'll probably never fire again!

332
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,287
Let's move.

333
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,528
Oh, come on, baby, pull that out.
Get out of here!

334
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,882
Peace!

335
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,041
Kill, kill, kill!

336
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,841
Come on, Alvin.
Protect yourself, Alvin.

337
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,569
Alvin, get up, get up.

338
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,324
- Come on man, get up now.
- Come on Alvin, get up.

339
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,208
Protect yourself!

340
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,487
Come on Alvin, get up.
Protect yourself.

341
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,321
- Pop it!
- Hey, man!

342
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,448
Why'd you get on my foot, boy?

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,201
All right, move it up.
Quickly. Quickly.

344
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,683
Jesus, get your ass back there.
Go over that goddamn bar.

345
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,607
Let see a little goddamn teamwork.
Quickly!

346
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,603
God damn it, you're in combat!

347
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,921
AK-47s are firing over your head.

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,765
They'll tear your asshole
the size of a goddamn basketball.

349
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,368
Move it up.
Get over there. Get over there.

350
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,281
- How's my time, sir?
- Good work, but you lost, dummy.

351
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,409
You left the half of your goddamn
platoon behind the enemy lines!

352
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,130
Come on, get moving.
Don't wait.

353
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,804
Don't you wait for him.
Shit!

354
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,042
Faster private!

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,045
God damn it, Washington, you just
put two private's on a trip wire.

356
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,482
You just wiped out everybody
in a 50 meter radius, you dummy.

357
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
You wiped me out!

358
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,761
Go!

359
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,648
[splash]

360
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,449
God damn it, teamwork.

361
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,249
You're all dead!

362
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,245
Get in the fucking water.
Get in the water.

363
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,288
Get in the fucking water.

364
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,441
You're all dead.

365
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,885
Get over there Washington, quickly.

366
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,405
You're dead!

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,685
The VC just heard you
and you're dead!

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,490
And you can thank that man.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,843
Washington, you're instructors
have been telling you for weeks...

370
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,686
...to pull together, pull together.
But he let you get wiped out.

371
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,445
That's all it takes,
one fuck up.

372
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,368
You look like shit.

373
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,521
So I'm going to give you a shit detail
that will help you pull together.

374
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,363
Let's get this goddamn aircraft loaded.
Let's get this aircraft loaded.

375
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,202
Get them moving.

376
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,202
Hey, Billy Ray Pike.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,240
Billy the Vile.

378
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,882
Damn, you ain't Smoke Spaulding,
are you?

379
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,361
In the flesh, bro, in the flesh.

380
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,886
You know, I got me
a nice soft desk job here.

381
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,043
I'm the company clerk. You know,
I thought that was your name I saw...

382
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,521
- on that telegram I got the other day.
- What telegram?

383
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,682
Your D.l.'s got it, man.

384
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,809
Betsy's up at Ocean side,
and the Marines...

385
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,121
- Wait man, Betsy's here?
- What a hole in the wall!

386
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,686
- Full of sailors.
- Shit man. She might need me bad.

387
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,001
Hey man, you gotta...
Can I get to see her?

388
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,849
- Can you give me a pass?
- Hold your horses.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,922
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Look...

390
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,884
I gotta take some stuff op tomorrow
and I'm gonna a private to help me...

391
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
[gunshots]

392
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,885
Goddamn shit.

393
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,530
Oh, my god!
Christ Almighty!

394
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,130
Shit! God, no!

395
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,051
- Who's in charge here?
- The Lieutenant, sir.

396
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,770
The Lieutenant.
Is that your Lieutenant?

397
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,205
Leave me. Leave me.
Get away.

398
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,608
- Are you all right?
- Alvin...

399
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,808
- What the hell.
- I'm okay, nothing happened.

400
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,731
Damn bastards.
Just trying to make fools of us.

401
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,768
I knew they were just
trying to scare us.

402
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,128
They did a good job on you, Billy Ray.
You almost pissed in your pants.

403
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,201
Bullshit.

404
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,444
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
What seems to be going on here?

405
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,364
Well, sir, it looks like we just
wiped out your entire platoon here.

406
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,727
We got an airplane
and two trucks beside.

407
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,161
Now, sir, I'm afraid
there has been mistake.

408
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,924
These people die at my command.

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,085
Excuse me, you gentlemen are all dead.
Will you please lie down?

410
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,207
I'm their drill instructor.
This a recruit platoon...

411
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,884
Are you all right?

412
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,885
All right? Hey, I knew they were
blanks the whole time.

413
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,884
El Toro called up and they said
they had an emergency shipment...

414
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,327
...that had to go to Vietnam.
I volunteered my privates...

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,721
to come up here and now
they are involved in some kind...

416
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,451
- of a silly ass war game.
- Excuse me, sir.

417
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,646
This is not a game.

418
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,726
This is an advance combat tactical
exercise and these men are all dead.

419
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,167
Now, lay down, that's an order!

420
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,368
Come here, Lieutenant.
May I have a word with you?

421
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,442
You're dead. You're dead.
Get down.

422
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,806
Get down!

423
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,209
What is all this stuff anyway?

424
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,490
- HQ111 Marine Air Force, Da Nang.
- RVN. What's RVN?

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,170
Republic of Vietnam.

426
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,931
This stuff is going to Vietnam, Alvin.
What is this?

427
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,161
Ouch!

428
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,085
What the hell is this?

429
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,207
I don't know.

430
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,129
Hey, Fazio.

431
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,607
- Foster, what is this stuff?
- We don't know.

432
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,523
I think it's a giant rubber.

433
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,967
Put it over your head,
Pike, you're a big prick.

434
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
Shit.

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,449
Hey, look here, man.
Looks like an airbag or something.

436
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,124
I don't think so.

437
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,922
Hey, I got it, you sleep in it.

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,571
It's a lightweight, sleeping bag.
Look at this!

439
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,683
Hey, look at this.
It's for sleeping, man.

440
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,171
I can sleep all night in this thing.

441
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
Hey, Billy...

442
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,330
Billy, if you fall asleep in that,
you won't wake up.

443
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,851
It says it's a body bag.

444
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,963
What's a body bag?

445
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,761
What's a body bag?
That's what they ship the stiffs in.

446
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,604
Damn, the zipper is stuck.

447
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,761
Get me out of here.
Get me out!

448
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,962
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, take it easy.

449
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,121
Hey, Alvin, are you still writing
about that creepy shit?

450
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,885
Listen, I'm gonna show this
to the public information officer.

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,804
This is a story
I can really say something about.

452
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,048
I mean, the way they stick somebody
in one of those bags...

453
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,248
...seal it up and send it off?

454
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,171
It's like a neat little convenient
package.

455
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,330
And nobody even thinks
about what's inside.

456
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,720
Yeah?

457
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,962
Nobody ever looks inside.

458
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,843
Alvin, Alvin, look at this.

459
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,969
This is that driving range I was
telling you about. Look at this.

460
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,566
And look, look at the full bird
colonel out there.

461
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,325
And look at the legs
on the chick his playing with.

462
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,210
Well, I'm gonna be that guy's Caddie.
I'm not fooling around here, no more.

463
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,930
- Hey, Vinnie, no, no...
- Hey, hey, listen...

464
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,684
You only got one shot, right?

465
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,366
I mean, it's not like you got forever,
you know what I mean?

466
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,887
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Okay, see you.

467
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,644
Take it easy, man.

468
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,291
Stupid motherfucker.

469
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,402
What else can we do?

470
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,281
You know...

471
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,691
You see...

472
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,888
I heard about, you know,
down in Tijuana...

473
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,125
they got real doctors.
They ain't like it as here.

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,850
You're allowed to...

475
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,764
You know. I mean...

476
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,967
- I can get the money.
- I have the money.

477
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,211
It's just ain't the right time now.

478
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,931
It's just not the right time.

479
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,409
You see?

480
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,245
I see.

481
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,048
Baby...

482
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,762
I gotta go.

483
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,288
Please don't leave yet.

484
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,881
Halt. Who goes there?
Hey, you!

485
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,770
- [gunshots.]
- Goddamn! Oh, Goddamn!

486
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,490
Jesus!

487
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,808
You son of a bitch,
you didn't have to shoot me.

488
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,644
Well, you scared
the shit out of me, asshole.

489
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,721
Goddamn!

490
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,164
Sir, here are the agents of Hanoi who
have come to fuck the Marine Corps, sir.

491
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,402
Which one is the Dago, Fazio?

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,525
Ain't he the cute one?

493
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,809
It says here, he was trying to get his
end in with the Colonel's daughter...

494
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,450
...out on the driving range.

495
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,409
Let me tell you this, private.

496
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,370
We'll take care of your
overactive sex drive in here.

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,125
We got us a Foster, Alvin,
apprehended by public information...

498
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,965
...for disseminating classified
and subversive material.

499
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,883
- No, sir, that was...
- Quiet, Billy Ray.

500
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,404
AWOL and resisting arrest.

501
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,482
Sir, private's wounded, sir.

502
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,565
Quit your whining you candy ass turd!
You ain't got nothing but a scratch!

503
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,325
And you, what are you doing
bleeding all over my floor?

504
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,007
Sir, this prisoner
is by nature a filthy hippie.

505
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,651
He was trying to desert,
but he was so high on marijuana...

506
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,451
that he tripped and fell
into the barbed wire, sir.

507
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,806
That's a lie.

508
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,208
I'm sorry.
That's a lie, sir.

509
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,442
Don't you wanna be
n the Marine Corps, Private?

510
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,601
Don't you want
to fight for your country?

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,561
Sir, the war in Vietnam
is a purely, internal, civil war.

512
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,723
- Do you believe that crap?
- Yes, I believe that.

513
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,969
You're all fucking communists.
Sergeant...

514
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,761
Get this faggots out here. See if you
can teach them how to walk around...

515
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
without falling down and
hurting themselves all the time.

516
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,007
About face!
Move out!

517
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,120
♫ Don't wanna fight ♫

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,690
♫ War is hell so we might as well
Make love tonight ♫

519
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,926
♫ Oh, put down your gun
Let's have some fun by the moonlight. ♫

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,561
Hey, there Jethro, what for
they stick us in this outfit?

521
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,089
They got more niggers in this platoon
than the Oakland fucking Raiders.

522
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,245
Sambo, why don't you get some of that
whitewash on your black ass there?

523
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,850
Hey, boy, what you going
inside for there, boy?

524
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,605
I thought the hot sun
don't bother you.

525
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,441
[banging]

526
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,801
Sir, Private Washington requests
permission to speak with...

527
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,848
- the drill instructor, sir.
- Speak.

528
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,367
Sir, Private Washington requesting
permission to enter the duty office, sir.

529
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,841
Enter.

530
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,405
Sit down.

531
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,408
You've met our four new
replacements yet?

532
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,926
Their drill instructors call them
the four fucking stooges.

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,287
Replacements?
Man, I ain't no fool.

534
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,329
Those fucks won't last
a week out there.

535
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,722
And anybody who's gotta depend
on them is already dead meat.

536
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,366
I don't believe that.

537
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,286
But I'll tell you what, Washington.
I respect your judge of character.

538
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,045
You think they're anymore fucked ups
in the rest of the shit we got in this...

539
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,531
- goddamn platoon?
- No, shit.

540
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,688
Why don't you just march
the whole fucking platoon right here...

541
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,603
blow their damn brains out right here...

542
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,284
cause you're gonna end up
killing all of us.

543
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,682
I'm not the goddamn one, Washington,
that's killing these people.

544
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,161
It's you, asshole.
You're the one!

545
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,368
- Not me.
- That's bullshit. That's Bullshit.

546
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,771
That's bullshit!

547
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,763
Let me tell you something,
Washington.

548
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,528
I've got one hell of a shitty
goddamn job here.

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,809
They send me 60 to 80 buckets
of civilian shit...

550
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,801
and expect me to train them to become
combat-goddamn-ready marines.

551
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,611
I've got to send these people
to Vietnam.

552
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,523
I'm the one that has to send them.

553
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,089
They're gonna come back in bags.

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,525
They're gonna come back in
wheelchairs.

555
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,647
They're gonna be maimed.

556
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,809
They're gonna be fucked up people
when they come back.

557
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,367
It's up to me how they come back.

558
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,126
And you, asshole,
Washington, you're not motivated.

559
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,125
You're not motivated at all.
You can fucking help me.

560
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,081
But no, hell no.

561
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,925
You've got your goddamn
head up your ass all the time.

562
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,924
You're playing your own
silly ass goddamn game.

563
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,050
But I tell you one thing, hippie,
you're gonna start playing my game...

564
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,323
or you're gonna find yourself
in combat in Vietnam...

565
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,448
and you're gonna have Charlie
shooting at you from the front...

566
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,205
and the four Stooges are gonna be
shooting at you from the rear.

567
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,011
Sir, are you talking to me
man to man?

568
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,810
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
man to man.

569
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,611
Then will you remove your hat, sir
so I could face you eye to eye.

570
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,047
I don't mind at all, Washington,
if it's gonna help you out.

571
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,690
Okay, sir, what do you want me
to do, huh?

572
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
I mean, what the fuck
do you want me to do, man?

573
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,163
You want me to...
You want me to be a good nigger...

574
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,369
so you can march those boys
out of the brig, is that it?

575
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,690
No, Washington, I don't want...
Goddamn, I don't want a good nigger!

576
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,083
I want a goddamn man
that's out there pushing these people.

577
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,721
Somebody they can trust, somebody
that they know is trying to help them.

578
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,282
I want somebody
that they can count on in Vietnam.

579
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,124
I don't want them to be afraid
to fall down...

580
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,407
because they know somebody's
behind them to pick them up

581
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,721
and stand them back up
on their goddamn feet.

582
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,003
I got eight fucking weeks
to teach these goddamn people...

583
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,048
what it took you to 20 years
to learn on the streets.

584
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,090
Now, you show me
that kind of a goddamn nigger...

585
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,528
and I'll give you a platoon
that will stand by you.

586
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,803
A platoon that will save your ass
in combat, Washington.

587
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,723
And they will
save their own asses, too.

588
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,167
Teamwork, goddamn it.
Teamwork.

589
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,765
Yes, sir.

590
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,565
Sir...

591
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,484
Can you get them back?

592
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,645
Yeah, I can get them back. But I'll you
one fucking thing right now, hippie.

593
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,571
You start this lone wolf shit
again on me...

594
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,769
and I'll stick you with a maggoty ass
bunch of goddamn shit...

595
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,684
you've ever seen in your life.
You are bound to get fucking killed...

596
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,445
in the first week in Vietnam.

597
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,171
Get them back.

598
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,722
- I got your goddamn word?
- You got my goddamn word.

599
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,290
All right.

600
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,323
Go out there and get rid of that...

601
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,803
Those four fucking scumbags.
Send them beck where the fuck they came from...

602
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,803
and I'll go down to the brig
and I'll pull some strings...

603
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,486
- and I'll get our people back.
- Thank you. Sir.

604
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,922
You don't have to thank me.

605
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,725
Oh, shit.

606
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,561
Hey, boys, here comes our
pickaninny friend again.

607
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,325
What's the matter boy, they quit
giving away fried chicken in there?

608
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,006
Excuse me sir, but do you mind moving
your asshole downwind of me?

609
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,208
- You said what?
- Oh, I'm sorry, that's your mouth.

610
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,851
I didn't see the teeth. Hey man,
anybody could have made a mistake.

611
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,605
[multiple kicks and painful yells]

612
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,970
[cheering and laughter]

613
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,931
October 7, 1967.

614
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,889
Now we can't seem
to do anything wrong.

615
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,849
We're good and we know it.

616
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,522
We're the biggest, baddest,
meanest mothers in the valley.

617
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,882
I still don't know
if we can win the war single-handed.

618
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,247
But I feel sorry for anyone
who gets in our way.

619
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,767
Harch!

620
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,602
Rifle salute.

621
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,923
Harch!

622
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,641
Arms at ease!

623
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,005
Perfect. Perfect.
Outstanding, girls.

624
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,370
Haarch!

666
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,284
Due to an urgent demand
for additional Marine manpower...

667
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,806
by the Navy's Mediterranean fleet...

668
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,968
only half this series will be
assigned to combat duty in Vietnam.

669
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,128
The other half will receive orders
for sea duty.

670
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,326
Drill instructors take charge
and dismiss your platoon.

671
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,641
Attention.

672
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,130
- Platoon 163 dismissed.
- [March music in.]

673
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,161
Platoon 163 dismissed!
Aye, aye, sir!

674
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,528
[cheering]

675
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,849
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

676
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,005
Come on. You got a 50-50 chance
to go on a sea duty.

677
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,050
What are you talking about? Buford's
been looking at me the same way...

678
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,481
he looked when he found out
I was trying to hump his daughters.

679
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,211
I wound up in the brig, right?
I'll only wind up in Vietnam.

680
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,727
No, no, no, listen. He can't change
orders, they're already written.

681
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,967
Honest, listen.

682
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,328
In two weeks, you'll be in a beach
somewhere in Italy, take my word.

683
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,925
God, sea duty.
I got to get it.

684
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,128
All right, man. Well, just think
good thoughts. Think good karma...

685
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,647
and you will get it man, sea duty.
Sea duty, think sea duty, you know.

686
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,724
- Sea duty, sea duty, sea duty.
- Spaulding, man, he could swing it.

687
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,883
Yeah, you say things
are dry on the street.

688
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,721
Hey, man, well, before you know,
traffics gonna start to flow.

689
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,811
It will be coming in on a C-130
and Uncle Sam is paying the postage.

690
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,885
Is it safe?!

691
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,761
Spoon, it's air-tight and waterproof.

692
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,487
With Marine guards
and a band to boot.

693
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,451
I love it.

694
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,966
All right.

695
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,164
You too, brother, easy.

696
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,290
All right, last two people
for sea duty.

697
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,289
Daugherty M.

698
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,285
Fazio V.

699
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,850
You did it! That's it!

700
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,008
What's the matter, garlic breath,
you don't like boat?

701
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,323
- You get seasick?
- Oh no, I love boats. I love boats!

702
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,641
Boats, the Mediterranean Alvin!

703
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,282
Sorry, Sir, but we got
a change of orders.

704
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,768
- Private Vincent Fazio...
- Fazio, that's me.

705
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,411
-I'm out of here man.
Signed by Colonel Buford...

706
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,323
- a new friend of yours.
- Buford?

707
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,961
Don't be getting your nut off yet,
private. Get back in formation.

708
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,362
You are now an O-300.
Col. Buford doesn't like people...

709
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,681
to come around and get
a little pussy off of his daughters.

710
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,524
- What's O-300?
- He just changed your orders.

711
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,490
- O-300, basic infantryman.
- Does that mean Vietnam?

712
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,402
Yeah.

713
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,404
Goddamn right, it means Vietnam,
numb nuts.

714
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,166
Goddamn it,
O-300 is basic infantryman.

715
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,689
O-3 fucking hundred
is the United States Marine corp.

716
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,888
Goddamn, bag of shit.

717
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,931
Now, I want you people over here
to get in this truck over here.

718
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,368
We're going to Pendleton. And you,
people, from here on over...

719
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,286
jump in the 6 by 8 it's by right here.
Quickly, let's get it done.

720
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,249
Come on girls.

721
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,808
Washington, come here.

722
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,011
I just want you to know,
Washington, I'm watching you.

723
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,209
You're under surveillance all
the time. You fuck up in Vietnam...

724
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,044
somebody's gonna tell me.
I swear to god...

725
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,088
I'll jump up on a goddamn
troop transport...

726
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,324
and come over and straighten your
ass out. Now, get in the fucking truck.

727
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,324
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, Sergeant.

728
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,771

742
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,561
January 4, 1968.

743
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,969
Vinnie finally got his boat ride.

744
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,122
And I finally have some time
to catch up with my journal...

745
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,000
after three tough months of advanced
training. The Marine Corp...

746
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,004
prepared us for everything except
our new company commander.

747
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,163
It's easy to see what's in your minds
as we steam for far-off angry shores.

748
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,961
So I'd like to share with you some
figures that have come my way. Gunny?

749
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,369
From 1961 until this past summer 1967,
only 13,000 Americans...

750
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,762
have died in combat in Vietnam.
You, you step forward.

751
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,928
That means...

752
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,364
of the 110 men in C company,
the chances are only two...

753
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,490
will die. I find that pretty
reassuring. Thank you, men.

754
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,563
I have a theory as to why we aren't
doing as well as we might in Vietnam.

755
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,850
Our thinking is shaped
by the games we grow up with.

756
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,447
The VC don't play by our rules. They
grew up with a game that demands...

757
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,966
constant movement
and fluid shifting strategy.

758
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,522
Now while you're on the ship,
you will all learn to play their game.

759
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,001
And, gentlemen,
their game is soccer.

760
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,362
Soccer?

761
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,522
Kiss my ass.

762
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,331
All right, you catch up with the ball
and kick it into the goal...

763
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,482
before it hits the white line.
You ready? You got to run. Go!

764
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,688
Come on, Fazio. Go.

765
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,450
Lt. Archer, sir?

766
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,086
Sir, some of the men were talking
about Captain Collins' theory.

767
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,130
And I was curious about
what you think of it.

768
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,448
Well, Foster...

769
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,840
I... I think it's bullshit.

770
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,201
January 9, 1968.

771
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,761
Maybe Lt. Archer is right
about the Captain 's theory...

772
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,003
on how soccer can help us beat the
enemy. But at least, playing soccer...

773
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,560
keeps us from thinking about
the Captain's other theory...

774
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,361
and wondering if he's right that only
two guys in the company will die.

775
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,046
Anyways, he's get me
keeping stats on the team...

776
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,566
but I'm using the time to write
in this journal. Vinnie says...

777
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,486
if I play my cards right, this journal
could prove my writing ability...

778
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,484
and get me a desk job, behind
the lines, writing propaganda.

779
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,167
But what I wanna do, is get in to
combat and write about the real thing.

780
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,810
I guess I won't have to wait
much longer.

781
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,362
We're docking at Cam Ranh Bay,
Republic of Vietnam.

782
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,081
Hello, you darlings.

783
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,162
Dave, how do you say
"how much"?

784
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,322
[foreign language]

785
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,090
- She says 300 Piestas.
- 300 Piestas? What am I, the bank?

786
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,649
- How much is 300 Piestas?
- That's about three bucks.

787
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,131
Three bucks... to get laid?!

788
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,008
Hey!

789
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,563
That's what I'm talking about!

790
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,565
Come on, man.

792
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,963
Keep your hands off my girl.

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,527
Hey, watch it.

794
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,724

Get out of here now! Let's move!

00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,081
- Wait.
- Move!

806
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,366
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

807
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,281
Goddamn it, come on!

808
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,330
Leave it, damn it!

809
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,004
Hurry! It's coming in here.

Captain, in here!

812
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,922
We've got to check
on transportation.

813
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,368
Lieutenant, get them all there.
I gotta check on the transportation.

814
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,169
Go on! In here, in here!
Move, move, move!

815
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,722
Come, you guys, let's go.
Move it, line up. Come on, move.

816
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,211
Move, line up!

817
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,930
Let's go, let's go.

818
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,366
Let's go, on the double!

820
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,408
Get your ass inside there!

821
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,407
Move!

822
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,768
- OK, go back.
- Fazio, what the hell are doing?!

823
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,049
- I got it down to one buck.
- Get the hell inside!

824
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,963
Move people move.

825
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,529
Pull in the rear. Attention!

826
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,926
Now, drop your duffle bags.

827
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,042
Drop your pants,
this won't last a second.

828
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,881
I am going to have to insert this,
take a little sample.

829
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,691
- It won't hurt.
- OK, I speak English.

830
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,251
You've got cold hands, little lady.

831
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,449
- It's Lieutenant.
- Sorry, Sir... Miss. Whatever.

832
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,887
What's the fuck's going on here?

833
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,006
With all due respect, sir,
this is an army matter.

834
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,651
These people are under quarantine
and will not be returned to the States...

835
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,888
until they've been checked
and treated for VD.

836
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,725
We must consider the loved ones
and wives back home.

837
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,723
That's absolute bullshit.

838
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,962
- People, please put on your trousers.
- Sir, I said the right...

839
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,648
Sergeant! These people just got
in the country five minutes ago!

840
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,007
They're United States Marines,
not the goddamn army.

841
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,208
Men, the airbase is shut down
by incoming rockets.

842
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,687
Looks like we're gonna be
stranded here for a couple of days.

843
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,162
Now, there is a vital army convoy
leaving for Long Khe in the morning.

844
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,687
General Dearborne up there is goddamn
anxious to get it through safely...

845
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,127
and I volunteered Company C
to ride shotgun.

846
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,409
We're gonna show that Army General
what a few good Marines can do.

847
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,482
Get in bed early.
We leave first thing in the morning.

848
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,847
What the hell
are these nurses doing in here?

849
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,321
- You won't believe me if I told you sir.
- Well get them out of here before...

850
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,767
somebody jumps them,
for Chrissakes.

851
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,607
January 10, 1968.

852
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,888
The convoy staffed at dawn.

853
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,691
Before we left, this army major
gave us a big speech...

854
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,650
on how vital and urgent it was
to get the convoy through safely...

855
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,087
to General Dearborne
up at Long Khe.

856
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,601
The country is beautiful,
it's so quiet.

857
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,523
It's herd to believe
there's a war going on.

858
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,966
- Do you play guitar?
- Oh yeah, you kidding me?

859
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,647
- Here.
- You do?

860
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,961
- Hold on, Fazio.
- Hold my rifle for me.

861
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,127
I got it.

862
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,561
Come on, Tom, you and do me do
some blues. Give me some of that...

863
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,801
West side Chicago stuff.

864
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,284
[blues music]

865
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,685
Well, you play like
you've got some black in you.

866
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,891
- He does.
- Come on, baby.

867
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,442
♫ Hey, streets of Chicago... ♫

868
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,086
♫ that gets cold at night... ♫

869
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,571
♫ We've learned some good things... ♫

870
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,211
♫ and it's good to learn to fly... ♫

871
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,523
The pause that refreshes.

872
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,768
While we were stopped,
the Captain spotted some...

873
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,810
Vietnamese kicking a ball around
here. That was all he needed.

874
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,923
Billy is really a hotshot.
The Captain calls him twinkle toes...

875
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,482
and says with e star like Billy
we could put together e greet team.

876
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,164
What good that would do us,
nobody seems to know.

877
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,527
The Captain keeps getting lost.

878
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,489
But we 're not complaining.

879
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,371
And every time we stopped,
someone tries to sell us something.

880
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,480
We're having a great time.

881
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,443
But I just keep wondering about those
poor army guys sweating it out...

882
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,130
waiting for us up at Long Khe.

883
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,487
Get on that radio
and get a recovery vehicle down.

884
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,881
And get this road clear
on the double. Do it now.

885
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,524
I've got a working party. Get this
thing cleared in a minute, skipper.

886
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,446
Don't touch anything at all. This whole
goddamn place could be boobied.

887
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,090
We've got to get out of here.

888
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,845
Hey, Alvin, goddamn it! Put
the camera away. Are you crazy?

889
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,726
I don't like it.

890
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,484
I don't like it at all,
we're sitting ducks.

891
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,369
All right get back in here.
We're moving out, back it up!

892
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,124
No, Captain, you're gonna
bunch us up!

893
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,090
We can turn around in that clearing
and let's get the fuck out of here.

894
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,730
- Go, go!
- Keep your interval.

895
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,485
Do not bunch up.
Keep your distance.

896
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,484
Back, back, back.

897
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,724
All right, people, get down
and men the flanks.

898
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,208
Keep your distance,
keep your distance.

899
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,362
Don't bunch up.
Do not bunch up.

900
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,841
Keep your interval.
You must keep your interval.

901
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,451
[explosion]

902
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,968
Dismount, people, get out of here.

903
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,969
Get the hell out of the way, damn it!

904
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,771
Dismount, people.

905
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,365
Keep your distance, people.

906
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,204
[machine gun fire]

907
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,367
Get on my shoulder man
and you be cool here.

908
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,046
I'm gonna make a tourniquet for your
leg. And you hold on to it...

909
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,248
you hold it tight, or you're gonna die!

910
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,322
[explosion]

911
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,527
I see him. You wanna fight?

912
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,729
Come on, Lieutenant,
let's stay on this motherfucker.

913
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,842
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

914
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,762
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

915
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,330
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

916
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,880
The boys have been hit hard.
Better call the MEDEVAC in.

917
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,566
No time for a goddamn MEDEVAC.
We're getting the shit blown out of us.

918
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,768
If I don't get some air cover,
we will be blasted.

919
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,007
[machine gun fire]

920
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,207
You son of a bitch!

921
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,486
Asshole!

922
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,606
You... you motherfucking goop!

923
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,084
Delta 5, this Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, over.

924
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,449
- Where's my RTO?
- He got hit, skipper.

925
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,091
I don't believe this.
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.

926
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,968
Come in, over!

927
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,404
He's gone.

928
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,963
Must have had a tunnel.

929
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,043
Lieutenant, you're sure
he's not still there?

930
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,646
What the hell do you mean,
are you sure he's not still there, man?

931
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,803
You come bursting across the damn
field with that big ass gun.

932
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,882
We had him trapped,
we had him cornered.

933
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,088
We were gonna maim
that motherfucker.

934
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,408
One MEDEVAC is not is
not enough, goddamn it!

935
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,041
We're bleeding, we need more! Why
can't I get what I want around here?!

936
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,202
Jesus christ!

937
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,851
Captain!

938
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,646
- You got your two dead men.
- Easy, private.

939
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,326
Private, I don't have to take that shit
from you. Now listen to me!

940
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,564
It could not be helped. This is a war and
people die! Now we got a job to do.

941
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,526
We are taking a convoy to Long Khe
and it's vital and it's urgent.

942
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,009
This convoy will save hundreds of men
and two lives are a small price to pay!

943
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,485
- Easy, baby.
- Bullshit!

944
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,608
- Bullshit?!
- Bullshit, Captain!

945
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,131
At ease!

946
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,721
Is that your fucking vital supply, sir?

947
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,486
How many lives is this gonna save?

948
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,840
You son a bitch!

949
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,805
We're dying out here...

950
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,528
so that some shit bird general
can have his fucking pork steak!

951
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,962
Come on. Take it easy.

952
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,490
We must be having
a vital and urgent sale...

953
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,086
a vital and urgent sale
at the PX, huh, Captain?!

954
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,842
Out, out! Get it all out.

955
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,926
Happy birthday, Gen. Dearborne.

956
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,208
Here is your new
mobile whorehouse.

957
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,448
Compliments of Charlie Company!

958
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,801
Was it worth all this, Captain?
Was it worth it?

959
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,802
I didn't know.

960
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,848
Is it the Captain's job
to kill his own men?!

961
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,571
- Son of a bitch!
- The Major told me it was urgent.

962
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,929
- I didn't know! Son of a bitch!
- Come on. We gotta call in...

963
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,449
I didn't know! God damn it.
What the fuck? I did not know!

964
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,371
I never saw a dead body before.

965
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,051
They look real small.

966
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,209
You've never seen a stiff, huh?

967
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,887
- Did you?
- Yeah.

968
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,209
Well, not in real life, you know.
Just... on TV.

969
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,771
It's not the same.

970
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,647
January 11, 1968.

971
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,769
Our vital Army convoy finally got
through to the U.S. Army Base...

972
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,730
at Long Khe.
General Dearborne commanding.

973
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,769
The Captain says that since
we've shown the general...

974
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,731
what e few good marines can do,
he's given us 24 hours liberty.

975
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,923
T24 hours to eat,
drink, smoke and screw.

976
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,890
After what we've been through,
I don't know if we've got the energy.

977
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,683
But I know we left two guys back there
who'd have wished they had a chance.

978
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,962
Hey, do you want to buy
some ears, man?

979
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,566
I'm just glad I'll never be able to see
the sorry looking bunch...

980
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,847
of Army fuck-ups
that they died for.

981
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,003
Look at this!
Esther Williams Swimming Pool...

982
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,321
Beauty Parlor and Bowling.

983
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,925
That figures.

984
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,481
Hey, Albert. Albert!
The Nikon's here.

985
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,483
Trade in that toy now
and get a real camera.

986
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,527
I think I'm gonna.

987
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,365
Madame Cocos Steam Bath,
Massage and Health Club!

988
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,408
- Where?
- Follow the arrows.

989
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,087
- That's nothing. Look at here.
- Prime Cut Steak House...

990
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,290
home of Armed Force Television,
Channel 4, movie theater, snack bar.

991
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,091
Hey, man, now that ain't gonna be se
bad. Everything you ever wanted...

992
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,209
in a whole fucking world
is right here, on this base.

993
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,726
Hey man, I wonder where
the Base Hospital is?

994
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,211
Let's get out of here.

995
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,089
- Yo, Vinnie!
- What?

996
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,810
- Where is the Base Hospital?
- Hospital?

997
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,848
- Hospital?
- You take care of my shit.

998
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,730
I'm gonna go out here
and check out this new turf.

999
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,122
Oh, look at this, more stuff.

1000
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,289
Now what am I, a closet?

1001
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,201
Oh, don't do anything.
Just stand there, Alvin.

1002
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,441
That's right.

1003
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,761
Okay, you're ready to go out there
and show them what's what?

1004
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,604
- Alight!
- I thought you're gonna sleep though.

1005
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,411
I can't sleep, you know. I've been
sitting so long I get all cramped up.

1006
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,051
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1007
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,885
All right, let's go. Let's have action.

1008
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,447
You should have joined the Army,
Bisbee.

1009
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,329
I didn't join, sir.

1010
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,323
I told you already, I can't refill
that prescription. It's a narcotic.

1011
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,006
Come on, it's just some little pills
they gave me back in boot camp.

1012
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,924
Look, Private, I'm off duty.
Sick call's in the morning.

1013
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,082
Hey, you got to give me something.

1014
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,731
Wait a minute, goddamn it.

1015
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,530
[whistling]

1016
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,522
Come here, man. I'm not gonna talk to
you out on the street. Come on.

1017
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,323
I want you to do
some of this stuff, man.

1018
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,687
I mean, this is gonna
set you right partner, no lie.

1019
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,208
Oh, man, are you crazy? I ain't gonna
shoot none of that shit in my veins.

1020
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,927
Oh, I don't blame you, man.
I mean, I hate needles myself.

1021
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,331
You just...

1022
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,240
Now, I don't do drugs.
I don't want to get hooked on dope.

1023
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,685
I just... I've been taking
some little pills that's all.

1024
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,650
They gave them to me in boot camp
for pain. Demerol.

1025
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,960
Demerol?

1026
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,248
And what you think Demerol is?
Some guy in a lab...

1027
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,443
he cooks this stuff up into little pills,
he sticks it in a bottle...

1028
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,649
- it's the same as this.
- Yeah, like hell it is.

1029
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,321
Well, there's just one way
to find out, huh, sport?

1030
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,450
I need enough to circulate
in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles.

1031
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,761
Everybody's out, everything is dry.

1032
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,366
I'm here to represent
all the dryness there.

1033
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,125
I need to meet the big man, here.
Beaucoup.

1034
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,965
I'm taking about the big money,
dollars...

1035
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,449
Motherfucker, do you
understand English?

1036
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,688
Don't poke sticks!

1037
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,401
OK, huh?!

1038
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,329
[reloading]

1039
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,128
Guns are different.

1040
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,564
I am Col. Long Dong...

1041
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,326
district chief and commandant
of the National Police Field Force.

1042
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,721
- I suspect you know why you're here.
- Look, man.

1043
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,246
I only went into that dump
to have myself a drink.

1044
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,561
I took the wrong turn
when I was looking for...

1045
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,406
Corporal, you're conspiring
to traffic heroin, don't deny it.

1046
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,767
I wonder of you were aware
of the Vietcong bringing heroin...

1047
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,844
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and
that the profits support guerilla forces!

1048
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,126
- I had no idea...
- Doesn't it bother you...

1049
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,487
to harm your own troops?
Does it bother you...

1050
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,881
to put money in the pockets
of your enemies?

1051
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,766
No?

1052
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,441
Good.

1053
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,045
Doesn't bother me either.

1054
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,687
Men of conscience have
no place in our business.

1055
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,208
I understand you'll be stationed
in I Corps.

1056
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,882
My brother-in-law, Col. Trang,
is District Chief there.

1057
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,406
If we are to do business,
he will visit you.

1058
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,447
What's the big "if"?

1059
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,730
You understand that everything
you ship back to your country...

1060
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,486
- is searched thoroughly?
- There's one thing that isn't.

1061
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,764
What is that?

1062
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,967
The body bags.

1063
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,520
Oh...

1064
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,364
Oh, Alvin...

1065
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,289
Look at the tits on number 40.

1066
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,451
Give her a 10.

1067
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,568
All right, a 10?

1068
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,080
- Nine and three quarters.
- Nine and three quarters.

1069
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,522
While you're at it, write something down
and we'll get you the hell out of here.

1070
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,648
I don't want to get out of here, Dave.

1071
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,526
[sighs]

1072
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,489
Al, it's true.

1073
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,010
Half of your fucking problem
is no fucking!

1074
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,087
Come on!

1075
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,208
Hey, listen now, once you find out
that your pecker is good...

1076
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,170
for more than goosing with, you won't
be so quick to want to get it shot off.

1077
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,401
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

1078
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,761
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

1079
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,520
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

1080
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,969
♫ Happy birthday, General Dearborn,
Happy birthday, fuck you. ♫

1081
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,364
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1082
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,410
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1083
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,290
I got some money for everybody.
Hang on, baby.

1084
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,445
There you go.

1085
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,525
Sound off!
1-2...

1086
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,330
[laughing]

1087
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,089
Al, look at this!

1088
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,681
Hey! It's Mickey Mouse Mantle
over here.

1089
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,603
Doesn't look like
he can handle his stuff, huh?

1090
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,720
- What he needs is a little more of this.
- You get that bottle out of his face!

1091
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,562
Oh, my god, this boy is OD-ing
on some heavy shit.

1092
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,405
If we don't get him up right now,
he'll be cold in half an hour.

1093
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,801
All right, everybody up.
Hold on to this, Alvin.

1094
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,527
Hold on. Here we go.
Everybody up!

1095
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,690
What's this guy bringing,
potatoes in a bag?

1096
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,571
Stop fucking up. If you're not
gonna help, get out of the way!

1097
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,483
This guy's dying, goddamn it.

1098
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,447
[explosion]

1099
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,320
it's over. You get down.

1100
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,041
Sandbag!

1101
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,408
The enemy blew up the General's trailer!
We'll go through over the wire!

1102
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,209
- There's VC all over the place!
- Pike!

1103
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,884
Wake up!

1104
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,291
What?!

1105
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,761
The enemy blew up
the General's trailer.

1106
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,090
All the world is exploding.
Jesus Christ!

1107
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,731
♫ Happy Birthday,
General Dearborn... ♫

1108
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,163
Jesus h. christ!

1109
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,721
Hey, Al!
Pike is sleeping like a log.

1110
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,480
Bisbee, get down,
you stupid motherfucker.

1111
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,642
Get over here and sit down.
Sit down!

1112
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,561
Pike!

1113
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,801
Oh, god...

1114
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,891
Damn it! The VC are fucking having an
attack on us, and you're out there...

1115
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,042
- playing your music.
- They're not VC.

1116
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,646
I put a Claymore
under the General's trailer.

1117
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,809
You put one more round
into the god damn mortar...

1118
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,167
I'm gonna blow up
whatever brains you got left!

1119
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,163
- There's 10,000...
- Asshole!

1120
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,641
You and your freaks are the only ones
shooting anything around here.

1121
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,208
Come here. Come here.

1122
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,846
Come here!

1123
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,486
Oh, man... I can't keep you
alive by myself.

1124
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,609
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

1125
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,929
I cannot keep you alive by myself!

1126
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,520
You're gotta wanna live.
Come on, man.

1127
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,726
I can't feel my legs.

1128
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,565
What do you mean you can't feel
your legs? You're dying, man.

1129
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,371
You're fucking dead meat, man.
You're fucking dying!

1130
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,166
You understand me?
Look at your eyes.

1131
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,289
Your eyes are like
two fucking pin holes in the snow.

1132
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,281
Come on, Pike. Come on.

1133
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,967
Come on, Pike. Come on.
Come out of it.

1134
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,487
Come on, Pike.
You gotta help me, man.

1135
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,130
You gotta want to live.

1136
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,971
You son of a bitch,
you ain't gonna die on me!

1137
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,008
You gotta wanna live,
goddamn it!

1138
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,005
January 12, 1968.

1139
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,321
We're on our way to the Division
Headquarters at Da Nang.

1140
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,485
The Captain can't prove that Dave
blew up the General's trailer.

1141
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,528
I just hope he hasn't noticed that
one of our Claymore mines is missing.

1142
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,648
Billy seems to be fine now.

1143
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,644
But Tyrone is still really pissed off
at him. I can't see why.

1144
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,326
I mean, it wasn't Billy's fault
he got all messed up.

1145
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,961
I sort of wonder what's really bugging
Tyrone. I know whet's bugging Vinnie.

1146
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,727
He picked up a dose of clap
from those hookers.

1147
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,280
And now he thinks I must have
it even worse than he does...

1148
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,045
because I had three of those girls
come up to my room.

1149
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,202
The only thing I did
was talk to them.

1150
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,760
And I got some great stories
for my journal.

1151
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,205
Of course,
how could I tell Vinnie that?

1152
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,805
Look! Al!

1153
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,009
Al, that's triage.
That's a hospital, Al.

1154
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,804
- So what?
- So what?

1155
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,726
So we gotta go see a doctor, Al, before
our peckers run off and crawl way.

1156
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,804
Look, I'm dripping like a Good Humor
in July, you know what I mean?

1157
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,048
What are you talking about?
I feel fine.

1158
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,527
You feel fine? Hey, if I got the clap
from one of them...

1159
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,563
you got it at least three times
as bad, right?

1160
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,887
Now, listen, Archie went that way.
We go this way.

1161
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,002
Keep your mouth shut. Come on.

1162
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,442
Pike, look at that. That's The Dragons.
They're the soccer champs of I Corps.

1163
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,971
Flashy devils, ain't they?

1164
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,048
How'd you like
to beat the shit out of them?

1165
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,811
You think what that would do
for morale.

1166
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,440
All right, people set it down in here.
Take five.

1167
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,881
Okay, Jarines listen up here.

1168
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,561
It is your job to make sure...

1169
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,604
that when a coffin contains
a body bag...

1170
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,564
marked "remains non-viewable"...

1171
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,926
that no one...

1172
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,241
especially the next of kin...

1173
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,484
will open that body bag
under any circumstances.

1174
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,405
Okay, load them up.

1175
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,723
But make sure that the coffins
are loaded with the head down...

1176
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,684
otherwise embalming fluid
will collect in the feet...

1177
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,963
and the body will begin
to decompose.

1178
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,929
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

1179
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,761
January 14, 1968.

1180
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,885
We've been assigned to the combat
base at Con Thien...

1181
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,810
up near the DMZ.

1182
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,281
We 're what they call
a Replacement Company.

1183
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,050
All the guys are trying
not to think about...

1184
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,600
what happened to the company
we 're replacing.

1185
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,000
I'm not worried about that.

1186
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,488
I just hope we get there
in one piece.

1187
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,524
This is supposed to be
a pacified area...

1188
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,964
but after what happened in the last
convoy, the guys are all pretty jumpy.

1189
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,681
They see Vietcong
behind every rice pile.

1190
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,246
And Vinnie almost shot
a water buffalo.

1191
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,290
Captain Collins has been so busy
looking out for another ambush...

1192
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,846
he's gotten us lost
three times already.

1193
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,248
Bisbee, get on the horn and find out
what the hell he's stopping for!

1194
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,201
- Yeah, I think you're right there.
- There! Over there!

1195
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,004
[automatic fire]

1196
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,682
Wait a minute!
Goddamit!

1197
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,970
Who gave the order to shoot?

1198
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,050
Get a hold of Archer. Get Archer.

1199
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,564
- What's everybody shooting at?
- What the hell are you pointing at?

1200
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,041
I was pointing at the road
to Con Diem!

1201
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,081
Oh, shit.

1202
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,800
Gentleman, welcome to Con Diem.

1203
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,970
Your company commander tells me...

1204
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,281
you've already had some
seasoning under fire.

1205
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,207
Here, at the first battalion will take
a lot of pride in a high body count.

1206
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,288
Now the company you're replacing
had the highest kill ratio...

1207
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,731
in the whole damn division.

1208
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,010
And I'd be mighty proud of any unit that
fought and died half as courageously...

1209
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,242
as they did.
Now to back you up...

1210
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,565
we got fire support on hill 609,
614, and right here.

1211
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,768
And we can hit any damn spot
in the valley.

1212
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,887
[explosion]

1213
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,286
Charlie can, too!

1214
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,001
Captain, get your people
on the Northeast perimeter.

1215
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,687
I wanna see all officers, staff, NCOS
in the command bunker now. Move it!

1216
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,331
Let's go! Let's move!
Go! Go! Go!

1217
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,401
[cannonade]

1218
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,010
Move! Let's go!

1219
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,286
Move! Move!

1220
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,325
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1221
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,166
Squad leader! First squad to the tree
at the first bunker!

1222
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,960
Second squad to the first part
of the second bunker!

1223
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,170
[multiple gunshots]

1224
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,724
- Fire power!
- Lieutenant!

1225
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,810
God damn it! The Colonel wants
your ass in the CT now!

1226
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,166
On the double!

1227
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,322
- Get somebody to watch that position.
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,768
Hold your fire! Stop shooting!
Those are our own troops!

1229
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,646
Shit, the VC's got them
pinned down!

1230
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,685
Get the lieutenant. Tell him they got
pinned down by enemy sniper!

1231
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,326
Oh my god! They're being shelled
by our own artillery!

1232
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,880
Tell them, man, they're being shot at
by our own artillery!

1233
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,201
- Our own artillery is...
- What the hell he's saying?

1234
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,731
Says it's out of his hands.
The Colonel's in charged of this.

1235
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,040
What do you mean,
it's out of his hands?

1236
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,043
The colonel can't fucking see
what's happening man!

1237
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,010
What the he'll are they doing
in that god damn hole!

1238
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,445
God damn it!

1239
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,045
You can't stop this!

1240
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,443
Lieutenant...

1241
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,643
Get the hell out of here! Not a goddamn
thing you can do in here right now!

1242
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,882
Lieutenant, but you don't know
they're blowing away our own men.

1243
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,042
The Colonel knows what he's doing,
goddamit!

1244
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,168
They're walking the artillery back to
the tree line so that they can...

1245
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,562
- zap the snipers and free our patrol.
- But he's walking it right over our men!

1246
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,961
And you know that, man, you could
see that if you weren't hiding...

1247
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,690
down in this god damn hole!

1248
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,570
Man, you gave us all the jive
about playing Charlie's games...

1249
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,768
by Charlie's rules, and you're
fucking down here...

1250
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,683
staying in this place
from the god damn bench...

1251
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,167
...like Charlie's standing still
waiting for the ball to be snapped.

1252
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,527
- Back it up, man!
- Go ahead, kill me, man!

1253
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,931
Harry!

1254
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,810
Keep your goddamned mouth shut,
Washington, just for a goddamn minute?

1255
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,564
Captain... Captain...

1256
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,529
Call off the artillery.
Give me a few men...

1257
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,204
I'll go up and get those gooks
out of that tree line.

1258
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,251
Lieutenant, the colonel has decided he'd
rather commit firepower than risk manpower.

1259
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,242
Just shut up!

1260
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,166
And you get your black ass beck on that
line before I court martial you both.

1261
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,730
Jesus Christ!

1262
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,406
These assholes are not gonna help us.
Now go ahead now. Go ahead!

1263
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,486
[explosion]

1264
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,524
Hey, Red, I need this man.
I owe you a favor.

1265
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,841
Later.

1266
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,004
[explosion]

1267
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,047
I need this shit, man.
I will give it back to you later.

1268
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,005
[explosion]

1269
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,362
Come on, Pike!
Here, Fazio.

1270
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,171
Bisbee! Get you're ass over here
and follow me, on the double!

1271
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,690
Keep low!

1272
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,968
OK. Everybody stay down
and stay quiet.

1273
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,963
Don't you fire
until I give you the signal.

1274
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,882
Pike? Don't fuck this one up.

1275
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,361
Now!

1276
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,286
[cheering]

1277
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,766
Yeah! I did it!
And I hope I got your mama!

1278
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,161
Hey...

1279
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,368
I wonder if any of our guys
are still alive.

1280
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,486
OK, Washington, I just got my ass
chewed up by the old man.

1281
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,404
We're going out on patrol tomorrow.
Your ass is going to be on the point...

1282
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,960
right in front, And I'm going to
guarantee you some action.

1283
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,566
Because thanks to you, I had to promise
the Colonel a bigger body count...

1284
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,769
- than the company we replaced.
- Yeah? I got you a head start already.

1285
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,764
And that is the only thing
keeping your big mouth out of the brig.

1286
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,131
Do you mind if I get this men some help
before he bleeds to death... Sir?

1287
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,326
Corpsman,
Can we get some help please?

1288
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,965
Watch his face.

1289
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,883
- You people okay?
- Yeah.

1290
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,088
You got that patrol on time.

1291
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,209
Next time don't waste time
going to captain first, right?

1292
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,330
Next time I'll make sure
I'll get the captain out of my way first.

1293
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,522
Well, you did good.

1294
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,811
Pike! Are you fucking
with pills again?!

1295
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,163
Hey... hey... hold up!!!

1296
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,210
Lieutenant, it's okay.

1297
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,810
Fucking told your ass I don't want
no junkie on my back. Didn't I?

1298
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,327
Yeah, well the captain gave me these.
Goddamit, 'cause my fucking foot hurts.

1299
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,166
And he also said I don't have to be
in your shitty squad anymore.

1300
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,687
- it's okay.
- I know it's okay.

1301
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,201
I'm cool.

1302
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,290
Stay away from me!

1303
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,251
You stay the fuck away from me, man.
If I ever catch you near me again...

1304
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,369
I'm going to put my foot
upside your ass... sideways.

1305
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,006
Line of departure,
lock em' and load em'.

1306
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,724
Now keep those canteens full.

1307
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,009
I don't want half empty sloshing around.
VC will hear, there'll be an ambush.

1308
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,162
Yeah, you can see this line
a mile away.

1309
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,481
Get to the point Washington,
right at the point.

1310
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,211
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
What am I, Charles Atlas?

1311
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,521
- Stop it, Fazio.
- Get up front, move.

1312
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,968
Lieutenant, keep them off the roads,
they're fully mined.

1313
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,321
Captain, I'm gonna take it a little easier
today. Half my people still have the shits.

1314
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,561
All right.

1315
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,600
- Pike.
- Yes, Sir?

1316
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,240
Get the hell with that...

1317
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,005
- How's that kicking foot?
- Better. Thanks for set-up.

1318
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,367
All right, you step right next to me.

1319
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,651
Well, today is the start
of a new body count month.

1320
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,411
I don't have to remind you...

1321
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,327
that the company, that leads...

1322
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,925
the highest body count...

1323
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,324
will get three days of R&R
at China Beach.

1324
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,644
- Hey, Vin, you know I'm just thinking?
- Yeah.

1325
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,642
How tough it is to hump this stuff
in this muddy swamp here.

1326
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,169
No, this isn't a swamp,
These are rice fields.

1327
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,489
This is an engineering marvel,
thousands of years old.

1328
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,484
They terrace the land,
so that the water flows evenly...

1329
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,769
from one paddy, to the next,
to the next, to the next.

1330
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,684
Like this whole valley
was one giant fountain.

1331
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,247
Hell, I hate rice.

1332
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,644
I don't even eat Rice Krispies.

1333
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,287
You've got a heavy load right there,
take it easy.

1334
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,131
I wish I didn't have this M-16
to tow around.

1335
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,691
The gun doesn't weigh anything, Bisbee.
The radio weighs about 40 pounds.

1336
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,250
- You won't kill anybody with a radio.
- Say what?

1337
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,365
Can't kill anybody with a radio, sir.

1338
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,929
Damn it, Pike, put that letter away.
It's ankle breaking territory.

1339
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,049
Yes, sir. See, I read the damn thing
20 times anyway.

1340
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,641
Don't worry, she'll wait for you.

1341
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,167
It ain't that.

1342
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,211
She says some damn freshman broke
one of my high school track records.

1343
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,884
I ain't afraid of getting killed today

1344
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,606
so much as what's going
to happen after, I mean.

1345
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,848
Ain't nothing except a couple
of damn trophies at school...

1346
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,725
and then next year, somebody hit more
homeruns than you did and then they...

1347
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,327
change the damn names on the trophy.
There ain't nothing left at all.

1348
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,801
Don't you worry, we'll get you into
a soccer game with the Dragons...

1349
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,770
and get a whole shitload of new
records. Yep.

1350
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,850
[clicking]

1351
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,641
Did anybody hear a click?

1352
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,083
No, no. That's just me.
I'm just taking some pictures.

1353
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,881
Oh. You idiot. Will you put that camera
away and watch out for trip wire?

1354
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,166
Sorry.

1355
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,646
Al, I'm dying of thirst over here,
I'm parched. I can't believe...

1356
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,451
we can't take a drink because of this
no sloshing canteens ruling.

1357
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,767
No sloshing... we sound like
a bunch of plumbers out here.

1358
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,165
[clicking]

1359
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,241
Foster...

1360
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,923
- Did you just take a picture?
- No.

1361
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,520
Everybody stop!
Be still.

1362
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,083
Everybody just be cool.

1363
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,521
What're you doing?

1364
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,524
I'm taking a bath really.

1365
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,530
Oh, come on, I'm serious!
What're you doing?!

1366
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,568
- I'm on a mine.
- What?

1367
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,560
What do I do?

1368
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,927
The fuck you mean, what?
Get the hell out of the way!

1369
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,800
All right, it's a mine!
Everybody retrace your steps!

1370
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,561
Retrace you steps!
Back! Back!

1371
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,928
Damn it, don't go near that man.
Leave him alone, he is a dead man!

1372
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,525
Back it up! Back it up!

1373
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,690
Damn it! That's an order!

1374
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,969
Do not move, Washington.
It's a pressure release device.

1375
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,408
It will not detonate
unless you take your weight off it.

1376
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,050
Like I'm going somewhere.

1377
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,802
- Do not move! Do not breathe!
- Move, Lieutenant. That is an order!

1378
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,765
Get those ammo cases.
Get those ammo boxes.

1379
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,046
Right now!

1380
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,441
Goddamit, Pike!
I will not lose another life!

1381
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,045
Now, come on back here!

1382
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,566
Pressure release device. Gotta
replace Washington's weight...

1383
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,768
with the weight of ammo boxes.

1384
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,526
Find the plate, seek out the plate.
Find it first.

1385
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,330
Very carefully.
Do not move Washington.

1386
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,004
Do not move at all.

1387
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,930
Very carefully Pike, That's it!

1388
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,286
Very carefully.

1389
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,966
Will you get the fuck away from me,
Pike? I'll kick you in your ass.

1390
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,202
Shut up, you big lummox.
If you do any kicking...

1391
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,163
you'd better do it with your
god damn right foot.

1392
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,361
Let him work, Washington!

1393
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,122
You find it?
You find it, Pike?

1394
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,086
All right. Take that first box, and
you put it on the edge of the panel.

1395
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,322
Very carefully, very softly.
As he does so, Washington...

1396
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,803
you move your foot, slowly removing
the amount of weight he's replacing.

1397
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,283
All right, here comes the first one.

1398
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,486
Easy.

1399
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,086
Ease off.

1400
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,411
- Man, will you just get out of my life!
- Just shut up, you make me nervous.

1401
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,801
You both better shut up
if you wanna live!

1402
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,449
Put that second box down there,
Pike.

1403
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,408
I may not get a chance
to tell you this...

1404
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,051
but you're the biggest goddamn bastard
I have known in my life.

1405
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,361
Yeah? But your mama like it,
you motherfucker!

1406
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,122
All right, now, very slowly,
on the count of three...

1407
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,965
remove your foot and run like hell.
Do you understand me, Washington?

1408
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,802
OK, let's go.

1409
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,209
One, two, three...

1410
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,406
Let's go!

1411
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,924
[explosion]

1412
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,243
We are going on the road. This whole
area and all these paddies are mined!

1413
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,489
Dipshit!

1414
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,771
Well, I ain't gonna kiss
your skinny lips, quaker.

1415
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,450
Yeah, we're even.

1416
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,883
So fuck off.

1417
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,286
Can you imagine being
on one of those mines?

1418
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,603
- Go nuts in five seconds.
- What are sweating about, Al?

1419
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,001
Fazio would have you
off there like that.

1420
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,851
- Hey, you'd risk your life for me?
- Of course, I would.

1421
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,684
- Would you do the same for me?
- Yeah.

1422
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,250
Well, we're buddies.

1423
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,091
Washington?

1424
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,129
Slow down, Washington, we're not
running any race around here.

1425
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,369
Lieutenant, did you see
the Captain's face?

1426
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,287
- See his face when?
- When I was standing on that mine.

1427
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,728
What are you talking about,
Washington?

1428
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,649
Was the son of a bitch smiling?

1429
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,005
Son of a bitch is running.

1430
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,369
You want these back, stay out of trouble
and start taking care of yourself.

1431
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,886
- Sir, it's the Colonel again.
- You're worth shit to me!

1432
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,800
It's Collins here, sir.

1433
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,325
Lieutenant!

1434
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,684
All right, I want two scouting details.
Check out the left hand side...

1435
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,649
and the right hand side
of the river next to the bridge.

1436
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,290
Lieutenant, what the hell
is going on now?

1437
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,601
I'm sending some people to checkout
the river, find us a place to cross.

1438
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,727
We haven't got any time.

1439
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,928
That minefield caused a delay
in our operations timetable...

1440
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,368
now the Colonel is on my ass to
hump into ambush position by sunset...

1441
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,444
- so we can get some body counts.
- I understand that, sir.

1442
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,648
There's a risk factor involving
crossing the goddamn bridge.

1443
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,530
Don't you see it's a toss up anyway
we play it. Intelligence tells us...

1444
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,210
the road is mined, to stick with
the paddies.

1445
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,328
The paddies are mined, we're back
on the road. And you want me...

1446
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,051
- to send men back into the bush again.
- Yes, I do, sir. It's my opinion...

1447
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,441
Well, you forget your opinion,
because I'm in charge here...

1448
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,808
and it is my opinion that
the risk factor is minimal.

1449
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,601
I'll stake my bars on it.
I'll cross that goddamn bridge myself.

1450
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,611
Freeze!
You stay where you are.

1451
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,524
At least let me get the people
to clear the bridge for you!

1452
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,643
Goddamn that son of a...

1453
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,849
Give me two 60s on either flank
right now and four riflemen with them.

1454
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,967
Foster, Washington...

1455
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,724
C'mon, move out!

1456
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,370
Harry, get up here.

1457
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,402
Go!

1458
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,245
Let's go, Lieutenant!

1459
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,845
Bring them over.
Bring them over.

1460
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,846
Two at a time. Keep your interval,
do not bunch up on that bridge.

1461
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,131
Jesus, don't take all night.
Get them moving!

1462
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,930
- Let's go.
- Two at a time.

1463
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,329
Let's go!
Let's go!

1464
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,971
Goddamit, it's taking all night.
Move them over.

1465
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,162
All of them at a time.
Let's go!

1466
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,484
- Everybody, move it. Move it out.
- Hey, we gotta send them two at a time!

1467
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,126
You heard him!

1468
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,924
- That son of a goddamn bitch.
- [Machine gun fire.]

1469
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,160
[screams]

1470
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,847
- The M79!
- Yes, Sir! It's right here.

1471
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,290
Give it to me right now!

1472
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,764
[multiple shots]

1473
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,485
- Over there!
- Yes, yes.

1474
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,007
[yells]

1475
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,642
Pike!

1476
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,290
Move your ass out of there.
Go on!

1477
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,723
Move your ass out of there!

1478
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,610
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1479
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,402
- Get that.
- Niner.

1480
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,845
[explosion]

1481
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,287
Let's see what we got, Washington.
Let's move!

1482
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,927
Hold fire! Hold fire!

1483
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,600
Hold fire!

1484
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,247
Lieutenant!

1485
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,529
I want you to give me a body count
on the double! Let's go, go, go!

1486
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,321
All right. My IDO has been hit.
Get battalion on the line.

1487
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,647
Pike, how are you doing?
Are you all right?

1488
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,845
Hurry it up, Lieutenant!

1489
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,446
Goddamit. I could
kick the shit out of him.

1490
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,804
All right, here you are.

1491
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,281
All right, Colonel, we've engaged
the enemy on the bridge and we're...

1492
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,125
expecting a big body count.
If you just hold it a minute, Sir.

1493
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,366
What's going on? Come on!

1494
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,523
- I need that body count, goddamit!
- It's a tunnel!

1495
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,411
Colonel, we'll delay on that body count,
we've got a tunnel.

1496
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,051
We're gonna have to track it down
and I'll be right back to you...

1497
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,845
as soon as we find the source.
I got a good idea where they're going.

1498
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,649
Yes, sir.
Yes.

1499
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,601
Shit!

1500
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,967
- Where do you think they're going?
- I've got a goddamn...

1501
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,361
good idea where.
Right over there...

1502
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,808
we got us a VC village and we're gonna
light it up like the fourth of July.

1503
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,042
You get me artillery,
I'll feed you some coordinates.

1504
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,804
Sir, there are probably
a couple hundred people in there...

1505
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,770
Jesus Christ! That is an enemy village.
Will you get me artillery?!

1506
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,763
Where the hell am I?
3... 3-3-6.

1507
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,525
- Sorry, sir, I can't do that.
- 4-7-2. What can't you do?

1508
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,729
- 3-3-5.
- I'm not gonna do it with a rifle...

1509
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,484
and I'm not gonna do it
with the radio, sir.

1510
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,643
- What wouldn't you do?
- Murder another human being, sir.

1511
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,722
Bisbee, you get me that artillery...

1512
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,929
or your ass is in the brig
in Da Nang and that is a direct order.

1513
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,924
Sir, I must respectfully
refuse to obey that order.

1514
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,480
Goddamit, you're in big trouble!

1515
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,768
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

1516
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,082
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

1517
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,362
War Eagle, I got
a firing mission for you.

1518
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,684
Request 105 assistance.
Coordinates are 3-3-5, 4-7-2.

1519
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,609
The target is an enemy village.

1520
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,802
I want this man placed
under field arrest.

1521
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,967
What happened now?

1522
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,290
He refused to obey my direct order
to call artillery on an enemy position.

1523
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,851
I had to do it myself,
the son of a bitch.

1524
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,200
What enemy position, Captain?

1525
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,806
Goddamit, that village,
that is a VC village!

1526
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,844
- What in the fuck are you talking about?
- That is where the tunnels come out.

1527
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,247
It's right where
the tunnels come out.

1528
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,803
Bisbee, get on the horn, call artillery
and tell them to disregard that order.

1529
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,729
Now, just wait a fucking minute.
You're in trouble!

1530
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,888
Goddamit, you're going
out of your mind, man!

1531
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,647
- You're going out of your mind!
- I don't need to take that shit from you!

1532
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,842
- We don't need to take that village!
- We got to take that reaper out??

1533
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,122
I want a body count, goddamit!

1534
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,482
[continuous explosions]

1535
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,767
Holy shit...

1536
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,684
Washington, would you mind
getting your ass on the point?

1537
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,406
Lieutenant, I want you to keep
a running body count.

1538
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,689
All right, keep alert, I want you to
all be watching for a tunnel opening.

1539
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,290
Keep watching all over!

1540
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,245
[ducks quacking]

1541
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,161
That tunnel's around here somewhere.
The man who finds it...

1542
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,171
gets an in-country R&R,
three days at China Beach.

1543
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,931
Goddamit, will you put that down?
Everything could be boobied.

1544
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,646
Put it down!
Come on, back in the line.

1545
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,767
Lieutenant, you get a count yet?

1546
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,525
Yes, sir, two chickens and a duck.

1547
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,923
All right, Gunny, let's break
the men into details.

1548
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,611
We'll search and clear all the hooches,
the rice piles, everything.

1549
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,165
Let's see what we can uncover.

1550
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,251
- You got anything, Lieutenant?
- The village is deserted, sir.

1551
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,443
The hell it is. You just
don't know where to look yet.

1552
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,326
- What do you got up there?
- It's snakes, sir.

1553
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,566
Shit.

1554
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,365
- Captain?
- Yeah.

1555
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,128
We got some bodies here, sir.

1556
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,970
He's got his goddamn bodies.

1557
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,129
Here's your body count, Captain.

1558
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,329
But I guess it doesn't really count.

1559
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,242
All these people are alive.

1560
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,762
Hey, Skipper,
look what I found out here.

1561
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,365
All right, you little gook.

1562
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,681
I wanna know where that tunnel is and
wanna know where your friends are...

1563
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,644
'cause you did not blow
the shit out of us by yourself.

1564
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,848
- He can't understand a goddamn thing.
- He can talk English...

1565
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,445
as good as you or me.
Let me work on him.

1566
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,722
Harry, get on the radio
and get someone from S2.

1567
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,531
I wanna interrogate a prisoner on the
double. Get out there, go on.

1568
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,324
Jesus Christ.

1569
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,569
All right, did he have a weapon?

1570
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,960
It's just this club.

1571
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,041
Captain.

1572
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,964
Forget it. If this man had been digging
a tunnel before coming here...

1573
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,247
...his hands wouldn't be as clean as
they are, but dirtier than mine.

1574
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,322
Shit, we took so long to get here
and he could have a shower.

1575
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,607
Captain, this ain't a weapon,
it looks like a baseball bat.

1576
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,523
They know from baseball like
I know from polo.

1577
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,921
Who do you think won
the Little League World series?

1578
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,809
Damn chinks from Taiwan.

1579
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,167
Hey buddy, do you play baseball?

1580
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,805
- Grenade!!
- Grenade!

1581
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,564
Hey, let me see this.

1582
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,642
Hey, you play baseball!

1583
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,882
Come on, buddy.
Come on, little buddy, let's go.

1584
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,440
Here's the bat.
All right, buddy.

1585
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,442
All right. Let's go.

1586
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,440
Come on! You're pitching
like your granny, Fazio.

1587
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,851
Hit that ball!

1588
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,171
Colonel Trang.

1589
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,966
He's out!
He's out!

1590
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:07,328
He's out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

1591
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,927
It's over!

1592
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,927
All right, men, this is Colonel Trang
from the National Police Field Force.

1593
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,368
And this is Major Royal, Special
Forces adviser. They are here...

1594
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,602
- to take care of the interrogation.
- What interrogation?

1595
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,170
Hell, he ain't no VC!

1596
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,561
He's just a kid who plays baseball
better than most.

1597
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Don't worry!
Don't worry!

1598
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,046
Shut it up!

1599
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,605
Don't worry.

1600
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,649
Nothing will happen to him.

1601
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,769
If he is no VC, no worry.

1602
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,561
-I'm telling you he's not the enemy.
.-That's right, I'm with him.

1603
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,605
Relax!

1604
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,251
Look, these are
Colonel Trang's people.

1605
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,609
He understands how to deal with them.
We just take the kid, check his story out.

1606
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,006
That's strictly routine.

1607
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,004
That good enough for you, Pike?
You got the Major's word as an officer.

1608
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,811
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1609
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,809
All right, we're gonna move it out.
Gunny, get them going.

1610
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,724
Washington, you're on the point.
Let's get moving! Out! Let's go!

1611
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,164
Goddamn body count. We'll have
to be out here again tomorrow.

1612
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,844
Let's fill those ranks in.

1613
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,610
[distant painful yell]

1614
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,089
Hey, wait a minute.
What was that?

1615
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,122
Let's move.

1616
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,646
I heard something, dammit.
Hootie, shut that radio off.

1617
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,046
Pike...

1618
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,369
Would you get your ass back
into the column. Come on.

1619
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,090
[distant screaming]

1620
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,241
- I'm going back.
- You just wait a minute!

1621
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,127
Now, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

1622
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,602
I want you to take these back
and we'll forget about this morning.

1623
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,648
Come on, take them,
because I've got big plans for you.

1624
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,165
Now, don't you blow it.
Come on!

1625
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,367
- I ain't playing soccer for you.
- Yeah?

1626
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,330
Well, you do that and you're gonna
let down the whole goddamn team!

1627
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,722
You think what that could do for morale
if we beat the dragons. Don't blow it!

1628
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,642
Take these.

1629
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,563
I wouldn't play for you
if my life depended on it.

1630
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,688
Well, it does.
You need me, Pike.

1631
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,526
A junkie needs all the help he can get.
Now, you do exactly what I tell you...

1632
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,729
or else you're a dead man. Now stuff
some of these down your throat. Go on!

1633
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,565
You're the one who's dead,
goddamit!

1634
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,322
[distant gunshot]

1635
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,646
You wouldn't have done that
if that was a white boy back there.

1636
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,281
Yeah, but to you he's just nothing but
a gook. He's just a yellow nigger.

1637
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,091
- He is the enemy.
- No, you're the enemy!

1638
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,483
Well, he finally did it, didn't he, Al?

1639
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,403
That son of a bitch
finally got a body count.

1640
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,728
And you're an asshole.

1641
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,007
If you're gonna be dumb enough
to pull a gun on a man...

1642
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,289
you better be smart enough
to pull the trigger.

1643
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,889

01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,526
to participate
in a saving's bonds program.

1650

01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,686
Gonna be joining the combined
action platoon, Tam Bak Hamlet.

1667
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,444
You're gonna be guarding the rice.

1668
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,841
Get your stuff, get on the jeep,
you move it out right now.

1669
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,570
Thank you, Captain.

1670
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,771
They're taking them away.

1671
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,810
You got anymore of this pound cake
in your C rations there? I'm almost out.

1672
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,565
Didn't you hear me? They're taking
Pike and Bisbee away in a jeep.

1673
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,967
Yeah, I heard you, Alvin.
Now, did you hear me?

1674
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,044
I want more pound cake
in your C rations there.

1675
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,648
Hey, you think they'll drive them
all the way to Da Nang in a jeep?

1676
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,605
I don't know.

1677
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,725
I'll tell you one thing I do know though.
Old Fazio over here is gonna...

1678
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,327
get himself a jug and drink his money
down before gun gets his mitts into it.

1679
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,801
That's what I'm talking about.
You coming?

1680
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,200
No.

1681
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,410
I wanna write down everything
that happened today.

1682
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,331
But who the fuck would believe it?

1683
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,566
Well...

1684
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,120
I told the Colonel not
to send them to the brig.

1685
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,329
Wouldn't mind if we got
a discipline problem around here.

1686
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,446
The old Captain jumps in
and sends them to guard the rice...

1687
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,443
in Tam Bak Hamlet.

1688
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,324
Well...

1689
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,241
At least that's better
than going to the brig.

1690
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,844
Do you happen to notice those guys in
the bags over there they were placing?

1691
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,967
Charlie mines the paddy every night.

1692
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,323
And every morning someone else
gets blown to shit.

1693
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,930
They're lucky if they last a week.

1694
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,845
Hey, buddy.

1695
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,610
Moon juice. Check it out.

1696
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,287
- They've got a still over there.
- I see you found your jug.

1697
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,725
That ain't all I found.

1698
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,923
You know those guys in Delta company
got down in their hooch?

1699
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,445
- A hooker.
- You're kidding!

1700
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,127
I swear to god. She's 15 and she's
a knockout and I may be in love.

1701
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,282
Hey, Superman,
let's you and me get laid, huh?

1702
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,408
Why don't you go?
I'm sort of busy.

1703
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,208
You can't let a chance like this pass you
by. You owe it to Pike and Bisbee.

1704
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,726
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, "What do I mean?"

1705
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,529
Remember what I told you.
It ain't like you got forever.

1706
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,762
- You grab it as it goes by, Al.
- Nah, nah, nah.

1707
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,491
I don't feel like
grabbing anything today.

1708
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,408
- What is that shit you got on?
- Oh, thinking about recipes for C rations.

1709
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,443
You know, like cooking.
Stuff like that.

1710
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,363
- Cooking?
- Yeah.

1711
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,051
Hey...

1712
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,523
- You got checked up by the doc yet?
- No, I told you I feel fine.

1713
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,162
Hey, I'm pissing razor blades over here
and I just biffed one of them.

1714
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,050
You fucked three of them,
you feel fine?

1715
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,966
Boy... you must be the wonder
of the medical world, Al.

1716
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,847
Either that or maybe you
didn't even touch them, huh?

1717
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,327
- Swapping recipes with them in there?
- No!

1718
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,290
- Hey, Vinnie, I never said anything...
- I don't think you fucked any of them.

1719
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,601
I don't think girls turn you on.
Hey!

1720
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,445
I think you might be a little
hotel-motel, right?

1721
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,285
What are you talking about?
I thought you were my friend.

1722
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,968
I don't care what you thought.
I ain't that kind of friend, you know?

1723
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,206
Just stay the fuck away from me,
Foster. And I mean it.

1724
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,011
Yes, sir, Captain.
I think I see the enemy out there.

1725
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,684
Yes, sir. OP4.

1726
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,684
Be right down?
Thank you, sir.

1727
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,561
[starts shooting]

1728
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,244
VC! Down right there!

1729
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,721
Here comes the enemy.
Come on.

1730
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,723
Come on, Captain,
you motherfucker.

1731
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,122
Clear the boxes. Come on.
A little bit more. Yeah!

1732
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,361
You think that's gonna get
Pike and Bisbee back?

1733
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:12,482
I'm gonna get that motherfucker. I'm
gonna kill that sadistic son of a bitch.

1734
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,846
You probably would.

1735
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,686
But I'm not gonna watch it.
Because it's bullshit.

1736
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,003
Bullshit! Like everything else that's
going on around this goddamn place.

1737
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,890
[Radio Speaker]: Radio Hanoi.

1738
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,527
And just a reminder that the weather
is sweet at this time of year.

1739
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,166
It's really cool, boy.

1740
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,843
Your two minions say you
wanna see me.

1741
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,647
Well, you see me.

1742
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,690
I'm sorry I did not see you
at the village.

1743
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,446
When your company was there today.

1744
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,724
But you see...

1745
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,051
I was indisposed [chuckles].

1746
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,165
I'm Colonel Trang, district chief.

1747
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,283
My brother-in-law has told me
of your proposition.

1748
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,363
Fascinating...

1749
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,371
this little tag mark...

1750
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,326
"remains non-viewable".

1751
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:28,322
It will help us to keep prying eyes
from intervening with our business.

1752
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:34,007
So as soon as your contact deposits
the capital, we can begin.

1753
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,128
Unless, of course, we run out
of non-viewable remains.

1754
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,446
[chuckles]

1755
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,683
You jive ass motherfucker.

1756
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,603
What kind of games
you trying to run on me?

1757
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,208
I don't understand.

1758
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,482
- Is your name not Washington?
- Yeah, man, my name is Washington.

1759
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,770
Half the niggers in the Marine Corps
name is Washington.

1760
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,320
You got the wrong man.

1761
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,006
[foreign language]

1762
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,929
The son of a bitch
is stuck in the goddamn sand!

1763
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,408
Everybody out right now, people.

1764
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,523
On the beach. Spread out.

1765
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,400
January 23, 1968.
For once we know where we're going.

1766
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,370
Intelligence located
a Vietcong tactical operation center...

1767
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,885
and we're supposed to knock it out.

1768
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,088
The Captain thinks we 're
gonna ring up a big body count.

1769
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,607
But he's not going with us. I guess
after what happened the other day...

1770
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:55,605
he wants to be sure that when we start
counting bodies, his isn't one of them.

1771
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,650
Vinnie isn't still talking to me,
but I can understand that.

1772
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,122
I think he was really upset about Pike
and Bisbee going down to that village.

1773
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,682
And he was drunk and all. So I guess
he had to take it out on somebody.

1774
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,489
- He wants to go on foot, Harry?
- Yeah.

1775
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,206
That's a goddamn minesweeper
without a three quarter-inch armour...

1776
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,089
through a goddamned coconut grove!

1777
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,607
- I don't like the way it smells, it stink's!
- You keep these people here and down.

1778
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,887
I'm gonna take Washington in there
and sniff around there. You got that?

1779
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,325
- You be careful.
- All right.

1780
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,289
Washington, let's move out!

1781
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,730
Get your asses down there.
Down! Down!

1782
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,686
All right, Washington.

1783
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,048
You keep your eyes on the tree tops,
I'm gonna watch the ground.

1784
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,131
This is nice, sir.
I'm gonna take a picture.

1785
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,487
Down! Get your ass down!

1786
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,525
Hey, Vinnie, isn't that beautiful?

1792
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,848
Get your fucking cover here,
right now!

1793
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,202
- Get him a medic.
- How is he?

- Get us a Cobra in here.

- Fuck. There's one over there.
- Take it easy.

1798

01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,124
Get out! Go!

01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,969
Colonel, you let my buddy die,
I'll out your fucking heart out!

1801
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,289
Goddamn bomb, I cant believe...

1802
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,243
Harry, shut up. Dammit!

1803
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,080
That's it, Washington.

1804
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,130
All right, squad leaders.

1805
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,601
Detail your people to envelope
and contain that position...

1806
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,001
according to bravo plan,
you got that?

1807
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,842
Washington, let's reconnoiter.

1808
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,247
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna be fine.

1809
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,802
Goddamit, I need a...
I need a corpsman up here.

1810
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,451
Goddamit I... I need
a corpsman...

1811
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,091
[Sobs]

1812
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,966
All right.

1813
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,808
Third squad's in position,
fourth squad's got the back door.

1814
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,441
People?

1815
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,129
We'll flush them out now.

1816
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,726
I want you to keep
your goddamn eyes wide open...

1817
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,402
'cause Charlie may have
a network of tunnels up here...

1818
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,530
and he could come out anywhere.
I want you to be ready for anything.

1819
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,324
All right, Washington,
light that son of a bitch up.

1820
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,449
[detonation]

1821
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,091
All right, people, talk to me now.
Talk to me!

1822
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,721
God...!

1823
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,962
That looks like nobody's home.

1824
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,608
May not be anybody home,
Washington.

1825
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,251
Some schmuck's gonna have
to walk over there and prove it.

1826
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,446
Let's go.

1827
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,566
[automatic fire]

1828
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,728
[low radio music]

1829
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,885
[Female Speaker]: You're listening
to the cool sound of radio Hanoi.

1830
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,849
Radio Hanoi?

1831
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,049
God fuck it!!

1832
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,041
All the people we lost today, for what,
for a goddamn relay booster...

1833
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,044
for motherfucking Radio Hanoi?

1834
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,324
Intelligence swore it was a goddamn
enemy communications center!

1835
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,890
Hire ups and goofballs tell them
any goddamn thing they want to hear...

1836
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,601
and they listen to him because they're
fuck heads. Goddamn fuck-heads!

1837
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,323
Washington, do you know why
we're on this goddamn mission?

1838
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,688
You have a battalion sitting on top
of that hill watching down at us...

1839
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,289
...because we're gonna draw fire,
Washington. We're bait.

1840
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,165
We're goddamn
motherfucking live bait!

1841
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,091
It's all we are.

1842
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,243
We draw them out of the bush
and those bastards on that hill...

1843
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,211
...are gonna let loose with that big
fancy ass million dollar hardware.

1844
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,045
They can get a nice, big,
juicy body count.

1845
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,886
Washington...

1846
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,129
if that's what those
motherfuckers want...

1847
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,283
that is precisely what those
motherfuckers are going to get!

1848
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,044
Come on, Washington.

1849
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,328
Come on out here, Washington.

1850
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,408
Give me the coordinates
of that hill over there.

1851
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,845
Ain't nothing on that hill.

1852
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,729
You have been out in the bush
too long, 'cause I can clearly see...

1853
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,609
a whole tactical operation centre
up there.

1854
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,808
An enemy communication centre too
and it's all being defended...

1855
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,201
by an entire battalion
of MVA regulars...

1856
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,248
- You can see that now, can't you?
- That's right!

1857
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,924
- thought you would.
- I see it.

1858
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,004
You ever think what it would be like
to spend a million goddamn dollars?

1859
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,289
You know something?
I think about it all the time.

1860
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,250
You'll find out what it's like right now
Washington, today.

1861
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,722
Washington, what in the fuck does it
smells so bad around here?

1862
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,564
[laughs]

1863
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,288
Sir, you and me.

1864
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,409
We ain't taken a bath
since Da Nang!

1865
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,687
[continuous cannon fire]

1866
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,291
[multiple detonations]

1867
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,407
That's it!

1868
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,848
I want more of that goddamn stuff.
More of it. Beautiful!

1869
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,204
Oh, I love that, goddamn!

1870
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,800
It's a shame the Captain
isn't here to see all those fireworks.

1871
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,531
And it's also a shame that he wasn't
here to catch one of those bullets...

1872
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,251
- fragged up his ass in this fireworks...
- You know something, Washington?

1873
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,561
It's about time we stopped talking about
blowing out someone's nuts off...

1874
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,404
and start listening
to what he's saying.

1875
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,845
- Listen to the Captain?
- The Captain.

1876
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,008
And that bullshit he's been talking
about playing soccer to understand...

1877
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,684
what the enemy thinks?

1878
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,604
And all that bullshit about
beating that gook team, the Dragons...

1879
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,125
- so we'd be the soccer champs?
- Right.

1880
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,727
Be good for morale. Do you have any
idea how good for morale that'd be?

1881
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,847
No.

1882
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,765
Washington, if we're
the soccer champs...

1883
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,161
we don't find our ass
in combat no more.

1884
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,082
Right.

1885
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,606
If we're the soccer champs, we don't
tour around the country fighting.

1886
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,843
We tour around the country playing
and behind the lines.

1887
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,170
Now you can call that son of a bitch
yellow bellied coward if you want.

1888
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,762
But you don't call in MEDEVAC
for bruised shin or damaged knee.

1889
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,327
And maybe that's the one thing
what we're out here for.

1890
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,131
Maybe it's the only goddamn thing
we can accomplish out here.

1891
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,443
Just get these little peckerwoods
out of here in one piece.

1892
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:51,241
Yeah, but you see you're talking
about a soccer team now.

1893
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,249
And we ain't got Pike.

1894
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,087
And you got to face the fact.
Pike is the soccer team.

1895
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,562
[incoming helicopter]

1896
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,685
WOW!!!

1897
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,891
Pike ain't gonna play
for the Captain.

1898
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,291
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1899
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,442
- You don't. We need Pike.
- We need Pike...

1900
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,931
- and he's not gonna play for the Captain.
- Right.

1901
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,367
But you're gonna talk
to him into playing for us.

1902
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,408
- You.
- I'm gonna talk him into...

1903
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:20,451
You, Tyrone Washington, is gonna talk
him into playing for us. That's your job.

1904

[explosion]

1905
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,887
- My job?
- Yeah, that's your job, Washington.

1906
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,610
Now let's just watch the show
and stop talking now, man.

It's not for eating, no, no, no. ♫

1911
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,084
♫ This is what we call the soap
on a cold and frosty morning. ♫

- I don't know. What are you doing?

- You're making soap commercials, man.

- This is great.

- This isn't happening. I love it.

Come here...

I'd like you to meet these people.

- And her brother Koi.
- Koi. What's happening, man?

1921
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,848
This is a very good friend of mine.
Don't need to be shy, he's a great guy.

1922
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,083
Where's a...
Where's Dipshit? Where's Pike?

1923
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,771
He's out there in the fields.

1924
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,646
The dumb farmer looks right at home.

1925
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:48,644
How'd you like to take a trip
to the big city, old country ass boy?

1926
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,087
Damn, what the cat dragged in..

1927
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:55,529
The Captain's got a big soccer game
set up for us. For the championship.

1928
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,002
Us against those bad ass Dragons.

1929
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,811
And all we have to do is kick
the shit out of them...

1930
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,009
and we'll be out of this shooting gallery
for the rest of our lives.

1931
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,889
Well fuck him, man.

1932
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:10,768
- I ain't playing for that son of a bitch.
- It's not for the Captain, Dipshit.

1933
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,407
It's for us. It's for the guys.
It's for the Company.

1934
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,764
The Lieutenant has fixed a way
so the whole fucking company...

[explosions]

1936
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,530
Not just the soccer team, the whole
company can get out of combat.

1937
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,445
If we win.

1938
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,406
But how in the hell can we win
if you don't play in the game?

1939
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,010
It don't matter.

1940
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,050
We're all dead anyway.

1941
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,531
That's bullshit.

1942
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,481
We're gonna be sliding in and
out man. From one game to another.

1943
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,688
Okinawa, Taiwan, Japan.

1944
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,326
We got a chance to get out
of this goddamn Vietnam!

1945
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,051
But what the hell do you know, huh?
You're smoking that shit.

1946
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,487
You're so high on that shit
you don't understand nothing!

1947
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,171
That's right.

1948
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,926
And when I get hit man,
I ain't feeling nothing.

1949
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,846
Yeah?

1950
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,445

Hey, man, I'm gonna be a father!

She's gonna have my kid!

- I did!

1960
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:50,361
I mean, I did, but I didn't.
I mean, she didn't go!

01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,324
- Congratulations!
- Don't you know?

1962
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,051
No matter what happens, there's gonna
be something left of me in this world.

1963
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,088
A little Billy Ray Junior!

1964
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,483
- God bless you man.
- Don't stand there drooling...

1965
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,528
like Pavlov's pups, come on,
let's get moving!

1966
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,408
What?

1967
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,687
Hell, we got a soccer game
with the Dragons, man.

1968
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,121
If we win we're out of combat.

1969
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,282
Can I take Missy and Koi?

1970
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,528
- Get them.
- All right!

1971
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:15,211
This is the luckiest day
of our lives, man.

1972
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,646
Damn, that's something, ain't it?

1973
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,046
Pike, if you can be a father...

1974
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,371
...I guess there's hope for the world.

1975
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,804
Let's move it!

1976
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,326
Here you go, buddy.
Kick some ass!

1977
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,289
Bring them little yellow
piss-ants on! Go!

1978
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,486
[marching music]

1979
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,403
Forward march!

1980
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,046
Vinnie...

1981
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,203
We need you out there
today, man.

1982
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,089
You gotta understand that what
happened to Foster is not your fault.

1983
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,646
Hell, it ain't.

1984
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,170
- We're gotta win this goddamn game...
- Look, I'll play okay.

1985
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,730
I'll play. Just get off me.

1986
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,081
[cheering]

1987
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,848
You think we got a hope in hell?

1988
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,682
I don't know shit about this game,
Captain.

1989
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,089
Goddamn, I ain't done
with you, man!

1990
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:23,642
Hardcore championship soccer,
the Muthuhs and the Dragons.

1991
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,570
And so far, the Muthuhs are off
to a slow start. Gunny?

1992
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:30,042
I knew there was gonna be a slow
start, but they're strong on the finish.

1993
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,884
Shit!
Pass the motherfucker here!

1994
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,402
Fuck you!

1995
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,244
OK, Fazio, that's good!

1996
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,402
Hey, Vinnie! Vinnie Fazio!

1997
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,691
Which one is the Dago Fazio?!

1998
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,084
- Alvin!
- Smile!

1999
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,004
Alvin, you're beautiful.
Look at you.

2000
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,162
I can't believe it,
look at his face.

2001
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,968
The ball is still in play.

2002
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,206
[cheering]

2003
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,769
We've got a game! We're playing
a game! Get the fuck out of here!

2004
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,003
Hey, Alvin!
Al, this one's for you...

2005
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,206
- my man!
- What?!

2006
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,045
- Come on, do it!
- Goddamn, will you play the game?!

2007
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,888
When I was in the hospital, I heard
about this game. I couldn't believe it!

2008
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,566
How did the Captain get a game
with the Dragons?

2009
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,326
- Remember that day you got hit?
- Yeah.

2010
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,880
Well, we stormed up
that hill that day.

2011
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,281
We wiped out an entire battalion
of MVA regulars.

2012
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,483
We got the highest body count
in Division for the whole month.

2013
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,688
The general was so pleased with us.
Well, he just pulled a few strings...

2014
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,046
we got the match.

2015
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,441
You wiped out a whole battalion?

2016
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,087
You believe that Foster?

2017
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,764
Yeah, yes, sir.

2018
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,610
Then they probably
ought to make you a general too.

2019
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,330
Hell, yeah, that's terrific!

2020
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,522
- Hey, Metcalfe, that's more like it.
- These are my boys, sir.

2021
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:08,730
- They worked very hard for this.
- Where's the goddamn photographer?

2022
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,689
There he is, sir, right here.

2023
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,489
That'll look good for you, sir.

2024
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,328
Pike, I'm in the clear!
Come on!

2025
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,368
[cheers]

2026
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,247
We're in the lead!
We're in the lead!

2027
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,527
That's it!
That's it! Go, Pike!

2028
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,965
Goddamn it.

2029
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,487
What a terrific play
by Pike out there on the field.

2030
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:56,848
The score is now 3-1.
The whistle blows, it's half time.

2031
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:59,241
Like I told you, the boy starts slow,
the other side doesn't win.

2032
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,364
We have got them by the balls
and that is the name of the game.

2033
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,920
Jesus, get them to the locker room
and I'm gonna go see Gen. Sloan.

2034
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,405
Goddamn!

2035
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,081
[marching music]

2036
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,567
Let's check your package!

2037
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,045
There seems to be some strange body
language going out there in the field.

2038
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,087
What is that?

2039
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:28,004
Well, it's probably the most intelligent
question that you've ever asked me.

2040
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,845
Lieutenant, we got the point.
Check your package!

2041
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:34,527
See, when Washington sees a good
looking woman point at his hot bottom...

2042
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,931
he checks his package.

2043
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,321
That shot was like
a good looking woman.

2044
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,323
A thing of beauty,
so he checked his package.

2045
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,482
Checked his package.

2046
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,930
Washington checks his package.
The boys check their packages.

2047
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,169
And I'm checking my package.
Now you little white face...

2048
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,447
disloyal fuck,
are you checking your package?

2049
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,931
Or do you have a package?

2050
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,327
I want to talk to General Sloan.
Bring me to General Sloan!

2051
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,922
Well, Colonel, I think we'll find him
right over here in the grand stand.

2052
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,723
Dragons, 1.

2053
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,051
Let's go, Muthuhs!
Let's hear it for the Muthuhs!

2054
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,645
Hooray for the Muthuhs!

2055
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,324
A little Buddha, huh?

2056
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,529
You rub his belly, you say,
for good luck?

2057
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,406
All right.

2058
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,847
Everybody, listen up!
Gather around, listen up!

2059
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,923
All right, now, Gen. Sloan...

2060
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,243
is so proud the way the Muthuhs
played the first half...

2061
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,800
that he's gone ahead and arranged
the exhibition tour and the first stop...

2062
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,167
- is Saigon.
- All right!

2063
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,451
After that it's Bangkok
and then Tokyo!

2064
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,245
All right, that's what I'm
talking about, Tokyo.

2065
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:55,041
Now, there's only one small change
in plans: We're not supposed to win.

2066
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,086
- What are you talking about?
- What the hell does that mean?!

2067
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,650
We throw the goddamn game?!

2068
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,610
Now, you just wait a minute.
There's another way of looking at this.

2069
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:06,890
Now, the Vietnamese go for winners.
And right now they happen to think...

2070
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,008
-that that's the Vietcong.
That's a crock of shit.

2071
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,602
Now, it's our responsibility to build up
their confidence in their government...

2072
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,364
and their army
and their athletic teams.

2073
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:17,444
- So we go around losing.
- That is a wrong way to look at it!

2074
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,124
They go around winning!

2075
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,202
Now, what's good
for the Allies is good for us.

2076
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,204
I know this is not easy
because we're Marines.

2077
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,566
But this is a question of priorities.

2078
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,850
Now if you're gonna disappoint
the General by beating them...

2079
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:31,002
then we will rejoin the battalion.

2080
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,526
And they're being called up
to an area called Khe Sanh.

2081
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,841
- Khe Sanh? Where the fuck is it?
- I heard about it.

2082
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,729
- What about it?
- It's a meat grinder.

2083
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,847
A meat grinder?

2084
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,367
All right.

2085
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,681
Now we got a job to do.
We gotta be out of here by 4:00.

2086
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,684
That's all the time the General has.
Let's go.

2087
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,007
Go!

2088
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,920
Who gives a shit who kicks
the little ball into the net more times?

2089
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,321
Come on, are you playing?

2090
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,006
Come on.

2091
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,888
If he's playing, I'm playing.
Let's go.

2092
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,441
Weren't you the man that said...

2093
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,609
...that getting your guys out
in one piece...

2094
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,488
...that's all that counts?

2095
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,731
Washington...

2096
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,490
You gotta do what's right for you.

2097
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,160
Me?

2098
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:45,366
Man, do you really believe
that I'm doing this for me?

2099
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,368
I never lost at anything
in my goddamn life.

2100
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,601
Don't fall down!
You're making it look too obvious!

2101
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,925
Oh, Jesus! You're making it
look too easy!

2102
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:26,802
Come on. Make them work for it!
Make it look that way!

2103
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,881
I tell you what, I'm gonna give them
one more, you hear me?

2104
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,611
- Make it 4:3 and we hold it.
- That's good enough for me.

2105
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,367
The Dragons have tied it up
at 3:3.

2106
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,523
Send my compliments to Cpt. Collins
for doing a beautiful job.

2107
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:56,291
All right, that's more like it.
That is more like it.

2108
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,361
All right, listen, Pike!

2109
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,967
It's gorgeous, fine. Everything
just fine, don't worry about it.

2110
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,008
They're gonna make one more goal.
2 would be great...

2111
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,686
- 3 would be the best we could get.
- Like hell I am.

2112
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,249
Wait a minute, Pike. I don't want you
to make this into a personal problem.

2113
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,527
You get that?
No personal problems.

2114
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,205
Alvin, get me some water.

2115
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,441
Shit, man, the Dragons is...

2116
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,045
- his fucking team.
- Who?

2117
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:22,011
That's the son of a bitch who killed
the kid I was playing ball with!

2118
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,724
Doping kids.

2119
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,409
- Look man, don't do nothing stupid.
- Stupid?

2120
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,967
If winning this game is good for him,
how can it be good for us?

2121
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,010
I know, I know, I know. Let's just
lose this game and go home.

2122
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,323
Dammit, man, I'm a dumb ass, right?
I'm a dumb ass.

2123
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,882
I've done some stupid things since I've
been here. I was scared shitless.

2124
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,048
The pills and all that man, I know.

2125
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,361
But I ain't never in my life done
something I'd be this ashamed of.

2126
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:48,125
Every guy in Nam is listening
to us, man, on the radio.

2127
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,567
- Gettin' out ass whupped every game?
- Hey, man...

2128
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,847
I know how you feel. OK?

2129
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,283
- I don't wanna lose.
- Damn, its hard man.

2130
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,885
I know it's hard.

2131
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,082
But what you gonna do?
You want us to die?

2132
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:03,721
You want to lose people in the fucking
war, or do you wanna lose the game?

2133
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,201
Just lose the game, OK?
It's OK.

2134
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,048
- Goddamit, it's hard, man!
- I know.

2135
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,484
We lose the game.

2136
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,841
I heard about teamwork,
but his is ridiculous, right?

2137
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,365
- Come on.
- OK.

2138
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,965
- Think of your baby, OK?
- All right.

2139
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,849
Think of your baby,
you're already a winner.

2140
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,843
- Let's lose!
- All right!

2141
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,364
All right. Let's lose this game then.

2142
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,446
All right, now they got the lead,
let's give them some insurance.

2143
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,529
Hey, look at that!
They're making fools of us.

2144
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,447
You think you got us whipped?
Come on, you little yellow piss-ants!

2145
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,762
Pike!

2146
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,807
Jesus!

2147
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,166
What is he doing?

2148
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,641
Little bastard!
How many times I've gotta tell ya?!

2149
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,568
Pike!

2150
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:00,687
You see that?! You beat that!
You piss-ants!

2151
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,246
All right, all right!
Coolidge, you get ready to play!

2152
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,321
Pike, you've had it!

2153
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,323
Major, get the General!

2154
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,727
He seems to have
forgotten something!

2155
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,411
Wait, Coach Collins,
is substituting for Pike.

2156
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,131
The Muthuhs will have to go ahead,
without their star player...

2157
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,090
You beautiful, disloyal fuck.

2158
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,362
Just couldn't resist it,
could you, twinkle toes?

2159
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,205
Well you just pulled a hamstring and
you're on your way to Khe Sanh.

2160
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,044
- Just fine!
- How do you like that?!

2161
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,691
And the rest of you, you wanna play like
Pike again, you can join him there too!

2162
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,764
You know a tie was not in the deal.
The Dragon need another goal...

2163
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,922
let's go and give it to them!
And, Washington...

2164
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,241
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

2165
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,964
Hey, Captain, how much
you got put in the game?

2166
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,540
- We don't wanna blow the point spread.
- Are you taking him out?

2167
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:44,166
Just 'cause he's the only guy
in this team with some principles?!

2168
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,641
- Fuck him! That's why I hate that guy.
- You idiot!

2169
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,166
Why don't we just make the goals
for them? It's easier.

2170
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:51,208
You really liked it
when he made that score.

2171
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,406
You're fucking right!

2172
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,211
I felt really good. How about you?
You're gonna bullshit everybody here...

2173
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,807
telling them you didn't dig it?
We can kick their ass like that!

2174
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,202
Tell everybody here, you big fucking
tree trunk, how you feel?

2175
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,801
You know, I had you guys
all pegged wrong.

2176
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,484
You're not smart enough
to be fools and fuck-ups!

2177
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,127
But you're just about dumb enough
to try and be fucking heroes.

2178
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,202
Okay, we can look at it this way.

2179
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:19,928
Uncle Sam is paying us a 137 bucks
a month, to kick some ass. Right?

2180
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,005
- Huh?!
- Yeah.

2181
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,606
OK.

2182
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,488
- Let's kick some ass!
- Yeah!

2183
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,407
It's coming down to the wire. The team
that scores next will be the champs!

2184
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,091
Jesus, Bisbee, let it go in!
Goddamit!

2185
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,721
Bisbee saves, the Muthuhs have
the ball, with only 20 seconds to play!

2186
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,486
Wait a minute.

2187
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,410
Oh, Christ, almighty!

2188
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,481
- Come on, that's it!
- Do it, Washington, baby!

2189
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,686
Come on, do it.

2190
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,361
Yeah!

2191
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,521
Washington!
[foreign language]

2192
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,206
Missy, Koi, did you see that?
I'll be right back! I'll be right back!

2193
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,131
That's our man there!

2194
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,523
[machine-gun fire]

2195
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,128
Just listen to that fireworks.

2196
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,884
Fireworks, hell! It's incoming!

2197
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:24,121
Incoming!
Move, move, move!

2198
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:28,451
All officer's into the air raid
shelter, now! Go, go!

2199
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,728
Protect Colonel Trang!
Form a human shield!

2200
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,645
Grab someone!
Protect Colonel Trang!

2201
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,405
Don't let him die!
Form a human shield!

2202
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,931
[explosion]

2203
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,087
Squad leaders,
get your people weapons.

2204
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,891
There's one on that roof top!
And another over there!

2205
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,446
- Hey, you seen Missy and Koi?
- No, man.

2206
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,249
Look, we can't find anybody
in this mess!

2207
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,486
I ain't seen nobody.

2208
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,251
- Hey there, man!
- I can't find them!

2209
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,129
[explosion]

2210
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,245
[people screaming]

2211
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:05,921
Get away from Col. Trang!
Get away, or I'll shoot!

2212
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:08,009
Stop that girl! Stop her!

2213
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,690
[gun shot]

2214
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,325
[explosion]

2215
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,723
- Where the fuck are they?
- Up there, Lieutenant!

2216
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,171
On the building.

2217
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:16,885
- Lieutenant!
- Where?

2218
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,809
Over there!

2219
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,246
[explosion]

2220
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,165
[explosion]

2221
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,967
- Captain Collins!
- Pike, get back to your squad!

2222
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,208
Collins, goddamit, stop running!

2223
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,322
I gave you an order, goddamn it!
Now go and do it!

2224
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,807
You're trying to save our own ass
by selling us out!

2225
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,604
Now you're gonna go into
that goddamned hole?!

2226
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,809
I gave all of you a chance to save
yourselves! What more can I do?!

2227
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,610
You can fight.
Stay with your men!

2228
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,805
Collins!

2229
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,530
[explosion]

2230
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,405
Oh, Jesus.

2231
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,882
You son-of-a-bitches!

2232
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:58,002
Oh, please, god, no!
Oh, god, Missy ....

2233
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,165
And that bastard did it!
That fat man!

2234
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:08,284
- Who did it?!
- That man!

2235
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,810
[yells]

2236
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:17,169
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you son-of-a-bitch!

2237
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:19,004
[shoots]

2238
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,845
Doctor said, before he died he wanted
somebody tell his Mama what happened.

2239
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,163
And how he couldn't have
done all this in Canada.

2240
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,801
I don't get it, what did he mean?

2241
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:38,006
No matter what he meant,
the man's dead.

2242
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,850
Come on, keep writing now.

2243
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,201
Get everything down,
don't leave nothing out.

2244
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,162
You're gonna get it published too, you
got Vinnie Fazio's personal guarantee.

2245
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,611
What are you writing
in my book right now?

2246
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:54,044
- See that ambulance over there?
- Yup.

2247
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:58,330
You're getting on it, you get to a
hospital... and you just disappear.

2248
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:01,330
I told you once and I meant it.

2249
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,611
I ain't gonna do nothing
I'm gonna be ashamed of.

2250
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:07,127
I'm gonna tell you
what you got to be ashamed of.

2251
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,447
You're gonna have a little bastard
running around calling...

2252
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:13,690
somebody else "daddy". Now that's
what you've got to be ashamed of.

2253
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,008
- Gunny!
- Uh-uh.

2254
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,924
- Gunny!
- Tyrone...

2255
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,971
We got a man here with brain damage,
he's got a concussion.

2256
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:23,765
- And he won't go to a hospital.
- That's cute, man, that's real cute.

2257
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,484
You leave me no other choice.

2258
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,568
I just gotta tell them there ain't
nothing wrong with me.

2259
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,728
Nobody listens to a man
with brain damage.

2260
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,605
I can't use no man
with a bruised brain.

2261
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,884
Now get on the ambulance...

2262
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,283
disloyal fuck.

2263
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,130
- You got it?
- Yes, sir!

2264
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,642
You big lummox.

2265
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,647
Now you don't deserve this.
You son-of-a-bitch.

2266
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,687
Now you take care of it.

2267
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,362
You take care of it, too.

2268
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:13,320
Old country ass boy.

2269
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,841
- Hey, Vinnie, what's his name?
- You're not gonna believe this...

2270
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,042
the guy's name is Hung.
What kind of a name is Hung?

2271
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,891
We'll name him Tony, something
like that. You put that down there.

2272
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,407
"Hung is now Tony."
You listen to this one, are you ready?

2273
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,087
Hey, I think there's a grenade down!
Get those kids out of the way!

2274
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,565
[explosion]

2275
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,161
Al, are you all right?
Al?

2276
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:36,891
Al?

2277
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,406
Alvin!

2278
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,167
What did you do to yourself, Alvin?

2279
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:45,602
Oh, Alvin, no, no, no!

2280
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,006
God...

2281
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,920
Oh, no!

2282
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,762
Oh, god...

2283
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,084
Oh, no!

2284
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:13,130
Please.

2285
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:16,405
Vinnie, you're gonna go
with Washington now.

2286
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,046
Wh're gonna round up our people,
and wh're moving out.

2287
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,401
You're still alive, you hear me?

2288
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,685
All right...

2289
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,762
Bring him along, Tyrone.

2290
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,681
- Gunny!
- Yes, Sir?

2291
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:32,128
Get our goddamn people together,
we're moving out!

2292
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,247
Yes, sir.

2293
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,968
Oh, please, don't let them see me.
Please don't.

2294
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:41,647
Boy, you're a man. You can cry
any goddamn time, you get ready.

2295
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,366
January 30, 1968.

2296
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,689
I don't know why I should even bother
to write in this journal anymore.

2297
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,566
Because after what happened today,
who the hell is ever gonna believe it.

2298
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,809
We actually had a chance
to get out of this goddamn war.

2299
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,890
All we had to do is
throw the game and walk away.

2300
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,129
But for some reason we just
couldn't. For some reason...

2301
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:05,643
winning that stupid game was
more important than saving our ass.

2302
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,607
So I guess we just keep on walking
into one bloody mess after another...

2303
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,803
until somebody finally figures out
that living...

2304
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:16,685
has got to be more
important than winning.

2305
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,326
Left right, right and left.

2306
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:22,371
