1
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,311
Inspired by real events.

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,719
In the winter of 1940 
the Brits and Germans fought in Norway.

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,353
The goal was to gain control over
yhe iron ore supply in Norway.

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,593
There was fighting between German bombers
and British fighter planes.

5
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,157
- Is there any casualties? Strunk?
- No.

6
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,551
- Schwartz?
- I have been hit in the elbow.

7
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,438
Hauk?

8
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,477
- Hauk!
- Hauk is dead.

9
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,358
Sergeant, take some of Overkonstablens
wounds. Disinfect and suture it.

10
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,717
I go over and find out
which way to go.

11
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,509
Am I going to die?
I will surely not die?

12
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,310
They have been injured in the elbow,
Overkonstabel. In the elbow.

13
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,590
Ready?

14
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,910
Why did he fly so far? 
They said we all had to turn back.

15
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,629
We should not let it hang down.

16
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,549
Mr. Lieutenant? Lieutenant!

17
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,432
Lieutenant!

18
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,080
- Schopis!
- I'm down here!

19
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,555
In the snow!

20
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,990
What happened?

21
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,796
I fell down there.
That was what happened.

22
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,076
Excellent.

23
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,199
- Joseph, your book.
- What have you got?

24
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,875
I waited for six hours
at Alexanderplatz.

25
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,716
Finally, Hitler came by.
It's his autograph.

26
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,872
Biscuits, chocolate, sausage,
sauerkraut and beer.

27
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,589
- Beer?
- You never know, Mr. Lieutenant.

28
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,355
Yes. You are right.

29
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,635
What do we do now?

30
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,638
We march to the coast,
find our army and go to war again.

31
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,229
Hauk fell for his country.

32
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,713
"In time of need
raises as heroes -

33
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,998
- Filled with contempt for death,
determination and a cool head. "

34
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,680
"But ..."

35
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,879
"But there must be an external
incident to call genius. "

36
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,192
"Fate auction,
forcing one man to their knees -

37
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,996
- Makes sudden another
for a determined completely. "

38
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,754
It is as if Hitler speaks to me.

39
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,956
Speaking to us.

40
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,749
Do you understand it?

41
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,198
We were alone against three enemy planes,
and we survived.

42
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,195
And we got shot one of them. It is
Minus 20 degrees, and we do not freeze.

43
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,273
Turn off the light.
We are use up the battery.

44
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,878
We can not just go
in a random direction.

45
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,758
Beware!

46
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,512
Strunk!

47
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,155
- The sled is too heavy!
- Loosen the belt.

48
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,110
- What?
- Loosen the belt!

49
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,708
Oatmeal.

50
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,677
Do we have water?

51
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,954
Strunk, turn up the oven.

52
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,151
Norwegians are thorough people.

53
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,633
shit.

54
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,756
There are only two.

55
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,874
Can you hear it?

58
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,719
- Stop!

59
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,793
Stop! Stand!

61
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,235
Englishmen.

68
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,592
- Mr. Lieutenant?

69
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,915
Thank you.

71
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,993
Lieutenant Horst Schopis.

72
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,635
Sergeant Wolfgang Strunk
and Constable Joseph Schwartz.

94
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,835
Lieutenant, we should not shoot them?

95
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,236
- No.

96
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,115
- Why not?
- We are not wild Hottentots.

97
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,316
- In English.
- Quiet.

98
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,792
They kill us if they get the chance.
I'm sure.

99
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,679
Well, then go ahead.

100
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,190
- Should I shoot them?
- Yes.

101
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,035
Yes. You have my permission.

102
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,668
Come on.

104
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,796
But they would also
be useful as hostages.

105
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,556
They can lay a false trail in the snow,
when we go from here.

106
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,878
- So I should let them live?
- Yes.

107
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,235
It is probably the best.

158
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,748
- Strunk.

165
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,515
Are you okay?

166
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,033
Yes.

176
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,956
It's nothing.

217
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,914
- What?
- Girls.

253
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,273
Our position is 62 degrees,
0 minutes and 33 seconds.

254
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,674
- So are we ...
- Four kilometers.

257
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,959
- Two kilometers ...

271
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,150
Strunk? Strunk?

272
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,919
It is two o'clock.
It's your turn to keep watch.

273
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,278
No!

274
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,078
No! No.

275
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,271
- Joseph ...
- No!

276
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,156
I dreamed Brits ate me.
They laughed as they ate me.

277
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,834
- They sleep.
- I do not trust them.

278
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,992
That we do not need.
We are armed.

279
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,391
We bombed British ships
and shot down British planes.

280
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,953
- Why can't we just shoot them?
- They are useful as hostages.

281
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,873
Lieutenant?

282
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,030
Where is your gun?

283
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,988
I have it in my hand.

300
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,919
Strunk, I can not.

301
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,394
Up.

302
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,195
Lieutenant!

303
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,199
Lieutenant!

305
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,076
Strunk!

306
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,114
Lieutenant!

307
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,597
Follow the trail.

308
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,274
Over here!

309
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,479
We have to go back.

310
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,558
Go back to the hut.

313
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,830
Lieutenant, why did we not?

314
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,076
I do not understand.

315
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,516
- All the other ...
- Enough, Overkonstabel.

316
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,319
Why did we not?

317
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,075
We had our orders.
I made a decision.

318
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,277
- But ...
- There is nothing more to say about it.

336
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,354
Yes, come on, Schwartz.

345
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,397
You should see your face.

362
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,236
I'll kill you.

363
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,358
- Move!
- Joseph! Give me your weapon.

364
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,399
- Move!
- I said, put the weapon.

365
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,199
- You're a dead man.

366
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,239
You are completely out of control.
Give me the weapon.

369
00:47:408,160 --> 00:47:41,550
- Move!

370
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,794
- You're a dead man!

389
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,839
Do it.

514
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,232
We found Schnapps,
and we must all drink

515
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,277
Come on.

518
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,239
We must win.
Drink some more.

519
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,312
- Yes, we will win.

520
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,512
- Come, Smith, they will win.

521
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,069
Drink for Germany.

522
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,950
<i> Germany Germany </ i>
<i> above all, </ i>

523
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,557
<i> above all in the world </ i>

524
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,996
<i> when it is always in defense and despite </ i>

525
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,438
<i> fraternal stick together </ i>


528
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,396
Did we win?

529
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,272
Yes. Just go back to sleep.

530
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,912
- Everything is in order.
- What are you doing?

531
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,753
Will you just ...?

548
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,311
NORWEGIAN
MILITARY
CAMP AT STRYN

550
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,430
I came across a dead German aircraft.

551
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,717
Here at Heilstuguvatn.

552
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,918
Well, that's where they went.

553
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,150
And the crew?

554
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,356
I do not know.

555
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,750
We must look for them tomorrow.

630
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,957
What happened?

631
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,271
- Is it gone?
- They turned gangrene.

632
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,479
- You would otherwise be dead.
- I am terribly sorry.

633
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,154
Look at me!

634
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,517
You have sacrificed your arm to the master.

635
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,070
He would be proud of you.

636
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,117
Here. Eat some chocolate.
There is plenty.

637
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,150
Can we go home now?

638
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,596
Yes, we're going home now.

676
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,918
Beautiful.

693
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,237
Frisk him.

694
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,748
It's okay.

699
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,395
No!

700
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,994
Stand up!

721
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,990
The lieutenant would like to say something.

723
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,389
- It's just a lighter.

745
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,272
Horst Schopis spent seven years
as a prisoner of war in Canada.

746
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,718
A few days after his release
they returned to England, -

747
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:48,713
- Drew Davenport and Smith
were sent on the Mission of Trondheim.

748
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,070
Once again, they were shot down.

749
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,718
Davenport was captured and spent
the rest of the war in a German prison camp.

750
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,992
Smith died in the attack.

751
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,679
Strunk is buried in a
war cemetery in Trondheim.

752
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,671
Joseph spent the rest of the war
in a Canadian prison camp.

753
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,990
In 1977, Horst received a call
at his home in Munich.

754
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:26,039
It was Davenport.

755
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:30,591
He invited Horst to London.

756
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,475
Soon after, the two former enemies met

757
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:45,194
as friends.
