<i>"But what is it that will make
people happy?" continued Giovanni.</i>

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,930
<i>"I don't know,"
Campanella muttered.</i>

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,060
<i>"Anyway, we're going to hold on!" said
Giovanni with an explosion of breath</i>

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,390
<i>as if his chest were brimming
with new-found energy.</i>

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,440
<i>from Kenji Miyazawa's</i>
<i>"Night on the Galactic Railroad"</i>

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,880
<i>How many years
have passed since then?</i>

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,010
<i>That was the year
we traveled to Shikotan,</i>

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,160
<i>the island where
we once lived.</i>

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,410
<i>To our old home,
full of so many memories.</i>

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,000
<i>To our lost island.</i>

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,190
Miss Sawako, we're almost
at the island.

13
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,210
So we are.

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,410
We've finally come back.
What's it been, 50 years?

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,100
It brings back a lot
of memories, doesn't it?

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,080
Not for me.

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,980
I get rid of things I don't want
to remember with an eraser.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,230
Can you, though?

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,630
I suppose not.

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,930
You can't get rid of them.

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,060
I can't forget,
even if I want to.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,890
I'm sure it's the same
for you, Junpei.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,210
I suppose it is.

24
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,630
<i>Our old home. The island
where stars fall to Earth.</i>

25
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,700
<i>The island of the Galactic Railroad.
Giovanni and Campanella’s island.</i>

26
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,540
- <i>July, 1945...</i>
- July, 1945.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,940
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs—

28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,410
Over here! Look at me!
Look at me!

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,500
No one's home!

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,460
- You can have the floaters, Kanta!
- No fair, Brother!

31
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,140
Got 'em.

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,350
The floaters are the ones
that are about to hatch!

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,410
Here's your eggs back!

34
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,810
Sorry to bother you...

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,480
July 4,1945

36
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,200
- Hey, wait!
- Hurry!

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,560
- Good afternoon, ladies!
- Hi, Junpei!

38
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,560
- Delivery, ma'am!
- It's so big! Look!

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
- Delivery, ma'am!
- Thank you, Kanta.

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,520
Have a good day, everyone!

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,820
- Hello!
- Hello!

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,140
- Hey, boys!
- I wish I had their energy!

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,940
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

44
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,900
- We're home!
- We're home!

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,220
- Oh, there you are.
- That smells so good!

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,380
- I'll cook you up some.
- I'll help!

47
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,530
Good boy.

48
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,220
Galactic Railroad, now departing!

49
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,930
All board who's coming aboard!

50
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,940
Hurry, we're now departing!

51
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,900
Depart station!

52
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,830
Campanella, hop on!
Hurry!

53
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,860
Wait for me, Giovanni!

54
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,380
Next stop is Cygnus Station!

55
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,200
Cygnus Station!

56
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,670
GIOVANNI'S ISLAND

57
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,930
Air raid alert!
This is an air raid alert!

58
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,950
More than 120 dive bombers
are advancing towards Nemuro!

59
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,540
Make for the air raid
shelter immediately!

60
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,650
Air raid alert!
This is an air raid alert!

61
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,550
I wonder if the Dawn Corps boys up in
the mountains will shoot them down?

62
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,680
Darn it all.

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,520
I think they're up too high
for their guns to reach.

64
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,150
- Let's go to the shelter.
- Hurry.

65
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,200
- Dad!
- Dad!

66
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,790
- Hurry and get to the shelter.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,980
Father, look after the boys.

68
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,310
Don't worry, son.

69
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,780
<i>My father was the commander
of the island's defense force.</i>

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,050
<i>Well, in fact the real soldiers,
called the Dawn Corps,</i>

71
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,290
<i>are holed up
in the mountains.</i>

72
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,140
<i>He was basically the head of
the village's fire brigade.</i>

73
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,730
The war's finally come
all the way up here...

74
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,510
Nemuro is burning...

75
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,360
August 15, 1945

76
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,620
- What did His Majesty say?
- I couldn't hear very well...

77
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,390
- It's over...
- The war is over.

78
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,900
<i>August 15th.</i>

79
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,860
<i>Japan... was defeated.</i>

80
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,490
Dad...

81
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,810
Don't worry.

82
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,480
Even if the war is lost, as long
as we have our island...

83
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,380
As long as our people are still alive,
the country will never fall.

84
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,410
What's going to happen
to the country now?

85
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
The Americans will come
and make everybody into slaves.

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,370
What?

87
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,370
Those Yanks are
red devils, after all.

88
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,620
You're joking...

89
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,710
There's no telling what they'll do
to you womenfolk if you don't hide.

90
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,970
You better paint your faces black
to look like men.

91
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,930
Stop trying to scare me!

92
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,090
Well, I'm off.

93
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,060
Even if we've lost the war,
a fisherman has to fish.

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,520
I'll have Kanta
do it today.

95
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,960
Kanta, will you
read this for us?

96
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,150
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,190
"'What on earth can I do
for their happiness?'

98
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,700
Giovanni, completely despondent,
hung his head.

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,310
'Who's to say it wasn't for the best?
However painful a thing might be...'"

100
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,500
<i>Our father loved Kenji Miyazawa's
"Night on the Galactic Railroad"</i>

101
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,060
<i>After I started primary school,</i>

102
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>he had me read it out loud
almost every day, too.</i>

103
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,390
<i>He said that our mother loved
this book when she was alive.</i>

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,020
<i>We were named after
the characters, too.</i>

105
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:29,150
<i>Junpei comes from "Giovanni",
and Kanta from "Campanella".</i>

106
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,200
September 1, 1945

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,930
- Miss Sawako, good morning!
- Good morning!

108
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,560
Good morning, Junpei, Kanta.

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,110
Ma'am, do you think the
Americans will come?

110
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,940
Our grandpa said that the women
should run and hide!

111
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,100
Miss Sawako doesn't have to worry!
They're only after young girls!

112
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,700
What's that supposed
to mean, Junpei?

113
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,330
- Stay down, everyone!
- Junpei!

114
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,880
It's blanks!
They're firing blanks!

115
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,510
Stay calm, everyone!
We're fine!

116
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,070
Look at that flag!

117
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,260
That's not the Americans!
It's the Soviets!

118
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,690
Soviet soldiers are called "Russkies"!
They kill bears with their bare hands!

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,420
- Take your seats, everyone.
- Yes, ma'am.

120
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,550
- Ma'am!
- Yes, what is it?

121
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,270
I hear the Iwasakis and Komanos fled.
Shouldn't we run away, too?

122
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,460
It's all right. In times like this,
we must remain calm and collected.

123
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,250
We mustn't panic.

124
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,330
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
Miss Sawako! Look!

126
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,020
- It's the Russkies!
- Look at that gun!

127
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,420
Miss Sawako...

128
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,230
Everything will be fine. Stay calm.
Children, take your seats!

129
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,360
Focus only on me.

130
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,840
Can you do that?

131
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,700
0.5...

132
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,960
Go outside! All of you!

133
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,740
Please leave the room.
We're in the middle of a lesson.

134
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,200
All right, can anyone
solve this problem?

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,380
Junpei, then...

136
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,550
Please come up to the board
and solve this problem.

137
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,300
Junpei?

138
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,930
Do you know the answer, Junpei?

139
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,140
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,550
Stop right now!

141
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,780
What's the matter?

142
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,990
These people aren't obeying,
Comrade Major.

143
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
What do you want?!

144
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,150
Here you are, lad.

145
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,780
Thank you...

146
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,990
- We're leaving.
- Comrade Major?

147
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,450
It's so fast!

148
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,780
Kanta, don't!

149
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,020
Junpei...

150
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,770
<i>The Dawn Corps
had been disarmed</i>

151
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,740
<i>and had come down
to the village.</i>

152
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,010
Poor devils. If they're sent to Siberia,
they're never coming home.

153
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,430
The defense of the island
rests with you now.

154
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,390
Company, STOP!

155
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,770
They're in your hands now.

156
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,020
Company, march!

157
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,920
Surrender your valuables!

158
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,280
What's this garbage?!
Your valuables! Hurry up!

159
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,660
There's nothing left for you to take!
You people keep coming and coming!

160
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,870
Go away!
Go away, I said!

161
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,530
First I can't fish, and now look at
what they did to the house.

162
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,990
- Grandpa!
- Here, take good care of this.

163
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,700
You can come out!

164
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,690
Mitchan!

165
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,900
- What's so funny?
- Your face is all black!

166
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,360
But I had to pretend
to be a man!

167
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,550
Oops! Sorry!

168
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,290
Hey!

169
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,870
- Uncle Hideo!
- Uncle! You're back!

170
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,020
Uncle!

171
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,630
Look at you! I go away for a
while, and you grow up on me!

172
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,050
Where were you?

173
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,550
Off fighting, of course!

174
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,800
I come back, and Japan's nothing
but ashes. Burned to the ground.

175
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,220
And when I'm finally home,
what do I find? Russians, no less!

176
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,100
What's this country coming to?

177
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,360
It's good to have you home, Hideo.
Let's celebrate with a drink.

178
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,650
Oh, by the way.
I have a souvenir for you two.

179
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,550
Really?

180
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,780
And what have we here?
Ta-dah!

181
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,740
- It's the latest train engine!
- You've never seen the real thing.

182
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,750
- Where's mine?
- Play with it together.

183
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,940
You have that locomotive that
Dad bought you, remember?

184
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,180
I'm amazed you got your hands
on something like that.

185
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,700
There are empty houses all over.
I found it in one of those.

186
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,640
- You mean... you stole it?
- Welcome home, sir.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,810
W-Welcome home!

188
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,020
Good, you're all fine.

189
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,280
- Long time no see, Big Brother!
- Hideo, you're alive...

190
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,450
- You bet! Alive and kicking!
- I'm glad to hear it.

191
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,660
The devil's children
have the devil's luck!

192
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,720
- This man isn't dying for his country!
- Hideo!

193
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,520
Oh, this sake is good!

194
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,550
No, I'm staying.

195
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,850
I have a duty as the island's
defense force commander.

196
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,520
Face up to reality, Brother!

197
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,820
Japan lost! The island's been
occupied by the Red Army!

198
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,900
We should just pack up
and leave!

199
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,880
If you want to run,
I'm not stopping you.

200
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,740
Man, what am I gonna
do with you?

201
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,160
Come on, Pops!
Say something!

202
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,580
A fisherman who can't fish might
as well be dead! Am I right?

203
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,710
The Soviet patrol boats won't
be out in a storm like this.

204
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,050
This is the perfect chance
to get off the island.

205
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,430
The storm is just as
dangerous for us, son.

206
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,640
Do you have any other way to avoid
those patrol boats?! Damn it!

207
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,270
They say the boat
washed up this morning.

208
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,440
And the Noguchis had
a little kid, too... That's terrible.

209
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,180
<i>Noguchi's family fled the island
in the storm last night.</i>

210
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,970
<i>They were lost at sea.</i>

211
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,440
Pray silently.

212
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,490
Be seated.

213
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,470
I had planned to spend first period
today on Japanese history,

214
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,310
but the study of Japanese history has
been prohibited for the time being.

215
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,390
What do we study, then?

216
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,560
Today, we will be moving a few desks
into the classroom next door.

217
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,690
That's the lower graders' room!

218
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,780
The families of the Soviet soldiers
will be coming to the island.

219
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,800
We must vacate
this classroom.

220
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,190
Are the Russkie kids
gonna study Japanese?

221
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,980
Or are we gonna have
to learn Russian?

222
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,350
What's that?

223
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,590
- It's electricity!
- Wow! The island's getting electricity?

224
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,630
Fly!

225
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,550
Junpei, look at it go!

226
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,660
Awesome!

227
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,980
Fly all the way to the sky!

228
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,060
Who's she?

229
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,730
Excuse me, who are you?
What brings you to our house?

230
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,200
That book!

231
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,910
That's Dad's book!

232
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,680
Give it back!
Give back our book!

233
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,210
Hey! Open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!

234
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,370
- Kanta, stop!
- Open up!

235
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,170
Hey! Over here!

236
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,560
The Russkies claimed the main house.
Starting today, we're living here.

237
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,230
Thanks for having us, Hana!

238
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,290
No way!

239
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,190
Why us?! Why is this
happening to us?!

240
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,420
Try some of your uncle's
special burnt rice. It's good stuff!

241
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,280
- We'll run out of rice soon, though.
- Where's Mitchan?

242
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,620
She fled the island with the rest
of the workers.

243
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,830
- I hope she's okay.
- Oh.

244
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,960
- Mitchan's not coming back?
- I guess not.

245
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,880
I brought you something amazing.
This is round two!

246
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,360
Pretty cool, huh?

247
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,220
Amazing, huh?
And you have Uncle Hideo to thank.

248
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,810
For round three, we'll make
it move with batteries!

249
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,730
- Really?
- Oh, wow!

250
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,100
Thanks, Uncle!

251
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,820
Actually, Junpei, I have
a favour to ask you.

252
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,280
At 10pm tomorrow, can you make sure
there's no Russkie boats around?

253
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,780
If there aren't, can you light a
bonfire at the top of the cape?

254
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,950
Don't let the Russkies
find out what you're doing.

255
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,000
I can't do that!

256
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,960
Sure you can.
You're a man, aren't you?

257
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,170
But I...

258
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,380
We'll run out of rice if we don't do
something. We'll starve, you know?

259
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,160
Look! This was left behind by
the Takashimas when they fled.

260
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,470
It's like they're asking us to
put it to good use, don't you think?

261
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,250
Better to use the proceeds to buy rice
than let the Russkies have it, right?

262
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,770
No one will miss it, right?

263
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,820
This will let our own
family survive.

264
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,550
Here! Special treat!

265
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm home.

266
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,700
Look at you, the war is over,
but you're busier than ever!

267
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I bid you good day, young men! Toil hard
with grand ambitions in your hearts!

268
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm counting on you!

269
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,980
Later!

270
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,970
"Tickets, please."

271
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,000
"Thank you, sir."

272
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,940
- "Here!"
- "Thank you, sir."

273
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,090
"Is... this all right?"

274
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,740
"Did you bring this from
the third dimension, sir?"

275
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,700
"I'm not really sure."

276
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,290
"Your ticket is in order. We will
arrive at the Southern Cross

277
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,460
at around the third
hour tomorrow."

278
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,300
"Wow, would you look at this!

279
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,760
You could even go to the
real Heaven with this ticket!

280
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,010
And not just Heaven! This is
a free pass to go anywhere!

281
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,100
With this ticket, I bet you
could go wherever you wanted

282
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,190
aboard this imperfect, imaginary,
fourth dimensional galactic rail road.

283
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,710
You're one lucky fella!"

284
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,390
I was dreaming?

285
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,610
Dad?

286
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,590
Oh, no!

287
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,200
- Junpei!
- Ow!

288
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,030
What are you doing
out here?

289
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,700
Don't sneak up on me like that!
I burned myself!

290
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,370
Beat it, kid!

291
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,170
- You're a kid, too!
- You wet the bed!

292
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,070
All right, fine...
Here.

293
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,730
Don't tell Dad
about this, okay?

294
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay.

295
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:20,370
<i>Red dragonfly in sunset sky</i>

296
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,880
<i>I saw it one day from nanny's back
so long ago now.</i>

297
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:37,680
<i>Picking mulberries
in mountain fields,</i>

298
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:46,230
<i>put 'em in our little basket,
was that all but a dream?</i>

299
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:54,300
<i>Just fifteen,
nanny went away to marry...</i>

300
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,040
Hey, that's our organ!

301
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:12,090
<i>Red dragonfly in sunset sky</i>

302
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:20,430
<i>. . .about her true love,
whose letters she was keeping.</i>

303
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:28,900
<i>Picking mulberries
in mountain fields,</i>

304
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:37,590
<i>. . .about her true love,
whose letters she was keeping.</i>

305
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,620
<i>- Red dragonfly in sunset sky...
- Apple and pear trees were blooming...</i>

306
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,110
<i>- ...resting at the top of a thin pole...
- Katyusha set out on the banks...</i>

307
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,840
We're home!

308
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
Uncle!

309
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,180
I went ahead and laid out the tracks.
It's just about finished.

310
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,600
Will it work, Uncle?

311
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,100
It would be a lot simpler if those
Russkies would wire up the house.

312
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,420
Okay, all done!

313
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,710
Okay, you two.
The train drivers sit here.

314
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,530
Let's see, when is
the next one?

315
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,320
Junpei, my next run
is next week!

316
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,100
Make sure the coast
is clear, boy!

317
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,390
- How do we work this?
- What do we do?

318
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,190
It's simple! It'll move when
Junpei twists that dial!

319
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,300
- This makes it move?
- Wow!

320
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,630
And now, I must away!

321
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,620
Don't try to stop me!

322
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,330
It's moving!

323
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,690
Look!

324
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,730
It's the same kind of track!

325
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,260
- Should we?
- Yeah!

326
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,310
We are about to depart!

327
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,050
All aboard!

328
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,480
Look, it's got a ribbon on it!

329
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,650
"The fine little train went on
through the fields

330
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,240
of heavenly marsh grass
waving in the breeze,

331
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,390
on through the faint blue light
of the triangular beacons,

332
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,000
on by the water
of the great river..."

333
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,460
"The fields outside looked like
a magic lantern.

334
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,290
Triangular beacons - a hundred,
no, a thousand..."

335
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,700
"Campanella still whistled
lonesomely to himself,

336
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,760
and the little girl looked off in
the same direction as Giovanni..."

337
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,020
"And they saw that on the
shimmering edge of the Milky Way,

338
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,400
heavenly fields of marsh grass
were glistening silver

339
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,550
and murmuring wavelike
in the wind."

340
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:12,640
May 28,1946

341
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,660
So, what shall we
sing today?

342
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,750
- "The Village Blacksmith"!
- "We Are Children of the Sea"!

343
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,360
I want to sing
"The Monkey's Palanquin"!

344
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,680
Let's do math today.

345
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,480
<i>Katyusha set out on the banks,</i>

346
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,610
<i>on the steep and lofty bank.</i>

347
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,820
<i>Katyusha set out on the banks,</i>

348
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,830
<i>on the steep and lofty bank.</i>

349
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,040
<i>She was walking, singing a song</i>

350
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,250
<i>about a grey steppe eagle,</i>

351
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,760
<i>about her true love,</i>

352
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,720
<i>whose letters she was keeping.</i>

353
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,260
<i>About her true love,</i>

354
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,960
<i>whose letters she was keeping.</i>

355
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:36,910
<i>Red dragonfly in sunset sky</i>

356
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:45,340
<i>I saw it one day from nanny's back
so long ago now.</i>

357
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:53,640
<i>Picking mulberries
in mountain fields,</i>

358
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:02,330
<i>put 'em in our little basket,
was that all but a dream?</i>

359
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,110
Got you!

360
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,070
Oh, crap!

361
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,550
Try and catch me!

362
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,570
Sorry!

363
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,180
Playing with you guys was fun.

364
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,790
"Ice"

365
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,630
Tanya.

366
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,240
Tanya?

367
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,170
Yes, Tanya.

368
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,470
Tanya!

369
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,870
- What are your names?
- Us?

370
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,970
Giovanni.

371
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,930
Giovanni?

372
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,900
She wouldn't understand
our names in Japanese, anyway.

373
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,360
Campanella!

374
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,020
Campanella?

375
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,480
Da, da!

376
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,610
- Giovanni!
- Campanella!

377
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,530
- Hey! Get off my cart!
- Sorry!

378
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,080
Please come in.

379
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,510
Wow...

380
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,760
Kanta, quiet!

381
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,080
What's this?

382
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,290
This is huge!

383
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,250
This is Grandpa and Dad's room!

384
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,650
And this is our room!

385
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,380
Look at what they've
done to it...

386
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,890
This one is my room.

387
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,200
All of our things are gone...

388
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,580
I came from here.

389
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,400
From here...

390
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,610
to here.

391
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,710
This is our island?
It's so small...

392
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,090
Sure you came from
a long way away.

393
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,450
I've moved from one place
to another all my life.

394
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,620
And now, to this island
at the ends of the earth.

395
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,860
My papa is an officer, so we
have to go wherever he's sent.

396
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,900
Supper's ready.

397
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,230
Wow...

398
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,210
This looks so good!

399
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,400
Hey!

400
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm home.

401
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>That commander,
he's Tanya's dad?</i>

402
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,730
I see we have guests for dinner.
Good evening, lads.

403
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,500
Enjoy the meal.

404
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,980
Let's eat!

405
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,150
Let's eat—

406
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,910
- Oh, I get it!
- Here goes!

407
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,790
Oops!

408
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,730
That's hot!

409
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,840
Oh, poor thing!

410
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,600
Come, dance with me!

411
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
- That's my girl!
- One more time!

412
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,380
Let's dance!
Come on!

413
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,210
I'll dance with you!

414
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,730
All right, Campa!

415
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,840
Like this! Then this!
Then this and this and this!

416
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,810
<i>As I watched Kanta
dancing so happily,</i>

417
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,540
<i>it reminded me of when
Mum was still alive.</i>

418
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,920
<i>I was overcome by a warm feeling
that I hadn't had in a long time.</i>

419
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,240
- Maybe I'll join Tanya's family!
- You'll what?

420
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Then I'll get to eat great food
and dance all the time!

421
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,230
A Japanese can't become
a Russkie, dummy!

422
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,290
Why don't you
marry Tanya, then?

423
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,250
You like her, don't you?

424
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,380
I... I don't. Okay?

425
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,590
I'll marry her, then!

426
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,160
You can't do that!
You just... can't!

427
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,970
I'm glad you're here, Junpei!

428
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,450
- Where's Kanta?
- He has field chores today.

429
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,280
Too bad, I've got
some tasty treats.

430
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,950
- Look!
- Wow!

431
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,120
They've got everything
on the mainland.

432
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,170
I'm heading out again tonight.
I'll be counting on you!

433
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,290
- Please, no more...
- It's for the good of the country!

434
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,150
Endure the unendurable and
suffer the insufferable! Okay?

435
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,320
Better hide the rice. Can't be
too careful these days.

436
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,470
What do we have here?
Way to go, Big Bro.

437
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,460
Oh, well.

438
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,540
See ya. Don't forget
about tonight, little man!

439
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,610
- Oh why me?
- Hi, fair lady!

440
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,950
<i>Hello.</i>

441
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,870
Zdravstvujte, Madam!

442
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,060
Goodness, Campa,
your Russian is excellent!

443
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,750
Where's Tanya?

444
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,840
Oh, she left with Giovanni
to pick raspberries.

445
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,550
With Giovanni?

446
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,140
Not that way, Tanya!

447
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,510
There's lots of raspberries
over this way!

448
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,980
We'll do that later. Look at
all these flowers! Come on!

449
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,040
- We're not picking raspberries?
- So beautiful...

450
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,580
No, not like that!

451
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,330
So pretty...

452
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,880
"Pretty"?

453
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,200
The ice man is out here?

454
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,800
- Let's go!
- Da!

455
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,160
That's it.

456
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,370
That should be enough.

457
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,830
Dad?

458
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,650
Be careful.

459
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,300
Giova—

460
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,760
Thank you for everything.
But you've done enough.

461
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,160
If the Soviet soldiers find this,
it'll spell big trouble for you.

462
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,370
Please, let me help.

463
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,560
You can't distribute rice to
the whole village by yourself.

464
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,250
But it's only a matter of time
before we're discovered.

465
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,490
I mustn't ruin your life.

466
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,240
No!

467
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,030
Being useful to you
makes me happy, Tatsuo.

468
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,790
You know my feelings for you
ever since we were little.

469
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,350
I won't go.

470
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,320
Let's go!

471
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,190
Listen, Tanya. You can't tell
anyone what we saw here today.

472
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,540
I understand.

473
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,170
- Promise me!
- I promise!

474
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,390
- Go home, then!
- I won't go!

475
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,870
Go home! Go! Go!

476
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:06,600
No. I'll sit here until I rot, and the
animals will feed on my carcass.

477
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,230
What am I gonna do?

478
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,720
What's the matter, Giovanni?

479
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,370
I'm seeing if there are any
Russkie boats around.

480
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,950
Soviet. Boats.

481
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,790
Boats?

482
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:30,090
No, everyone is celebrating tonight.
There won't be a patrol.

483
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,650
Boats. No come.

484
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,150
Really?

485
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,130
Really.

486
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,620
There's a blanket in my bag.
Use it if you want.

487
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,470
Give it back! Give it back!

488
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,660
You want to draw me,
don't you, Giovanni?

489
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,870
Draw you?

490
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,090
Make me look pretty.

491
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,910
<i>I wished that time would stand still
and we could stay that way forever.</i>

492
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,650
That's Uncle Hideo's boat!

493
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,370
Junpei... Where did you go
with Tanya today?

494
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,170
Come on, what were you
doing with Tanya?

495
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,180
- What's the big idea?!
- Uncle!

496
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,120
Are you trying
to get me killed?!

497
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,730
Thank goodness, you're alive!

498
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,210
Of course I am! It'll take
more than that to knock me out!

499
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,250
I'm sorry, Tanya said
there was no patrol, so I —

500
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,740
- "Tanya"?
- Yeah.

501
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,764
Oh, that girl in the main house?
Now I see.

502
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,790
She's the Soviet commander's daughter.
Be careful, you hear?

503
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,890
Beware a pretty face, kiddo!

504
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,689
What? She's not like that, I —

505
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,900
- By the way, is your dad around?
- He's not home.

506
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,090
He left real early
this morning!

507
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,470
He's an early riser, my brother...

508
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,160
- What is it, Junpei?
- Something's been bothering me.

509
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,120
Like what?

510
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,830
Dad and Miss Sawako
were at the cave, and—

511
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,140
What? What about the cave?
Why were they together at the cave?

512
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,260
That's the Dawn Corps' emergency stores!
You can't just help yourself to them!

513
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,430
They belong to all of us. We need
them to keep from starving.

514
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,220
They mustn't fall into
the Soviets' hands!

515
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,480
Don't be stupid! I'll turn that
rice into money on the mainland.

516
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,020
- That's the smart move!
- I won't let you!

517
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,480
Try to stop me!

518
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,900
Enough. The folks next door
will hear.

519
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,820
I get it, you've been getting the rice
to the villagers through Sawako.

520
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,990
- Distributing it from the school...
- Not another word, I mean it.

521
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,270
So, are you two an item?

522
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,240
The war is over, Bro.

523
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,010
It's time to face up
to reality.

524
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,620
Hideo...

525
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,590
July 16, 1946

526
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,350
It's Sawako!
It's me, Sawako!

527
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,850
- It's Miss Sawako!
- What's going on?

528
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,560
Please open up!
Open the door!

529
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,420
- It's Hideo, he—
- What about Hideo?

530
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,380
Hideo was trying to smuggle out
the rice, and he was caught by a patrol!

531
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,390
If he talks—

532
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,540
Tatsuo, wait!

533
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,520
Look after the boys, Sawako!

534
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,870
Dad!

535
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,630
<i>She's the Soviet commander's daughter.
Be careful, you hear?</i>

536
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,390
Don't go, Dad!

537
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:38,350
Dad...

538
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,920
Dad... Dad...

539
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,110
Dad!

540
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,690
Dad!

541
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,630
Dad! Dad!

542
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,530
Dad!!

543
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,950
Tanya!

544
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,960
- Giovanni? What's the matter?
- Tanya! My dad's been taken!

545
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,610
What? Speak slowly.

546
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,520
Tanya, did you tell them?

547
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,110
Tell them what?

548
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:36,890
Your father arrested my dad!
Because you talked!

549
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,180
I didn't say anything...

550
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,890
Liar! How come your father
knew about the cave, then?!

551
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,830
- It wasn't me!
- You told him!

552
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,710
- It wasn't me!
- You told him!

553
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,920
I said nothing!

554
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,680
I said it wasn't me!

555
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,640
What's the matter, pumpkin?
Wasn't that Giovanni I heard outside?

556
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,090
But they took my dad...

557
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,890
Dad's been arrested
by the Russkies...

558
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,610
"'What kind of light is that?

559
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:43,080
What can they be burning
to get such red flames?'

560
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,730
asked Giovanni.

561
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:55,340
'It's the Fire of Scorpius,' said
Campanella, again referring to his map.

562
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:03,600
'O God, look into my heart,'
prayed the scorpion.

563
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,580
'Instead of throwing my life away
in vain like this,

564
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:16,990
grant that my body be used for
the true welfare of all.'

565
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,950
And then the scorpion's body
suddenly broke up

566
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,420
into beautiful crimson flames,

567
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,340
and he was placed in the heavens
to light the darkness of the night.

568
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,510
My father said that the fire
burns to this very day.'"

569
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,930
September 25, 1947

570
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,890
Genzo! Genzo!

571
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,170
Genzo!

572
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,710
What's all the ruckus?

573
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,670
Everyone on the island is being
sent back to the mainland!

574
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,680
They say to gather at the harbor
with only what we can carry!

575
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,140
Get a move on!

576
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,210
- Grandpa?
- Right.

577
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,100
- Will we be allowed back?
- Move it!

578
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:00,190
Put on every piece of clothing
you can and wait outside.

579
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,220
Miss Sawako will
be here for you soon.

580
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,220
Here you go.

581
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,540
You are a big boy now, Kanta.
Grin and bear it.

582
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,080
It's fine.

583
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,380
I'll catch up with you soon.
Until then, look after Kanta.

584
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,760
You can count on me, Grandpa.

585
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,300
Is everyone ready?

586
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,640
Miss Sawako!

587
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,520
Everyone's heading to the wharf.
We have to hurry.

588
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,640
Right.

589
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,150
- And your grandfather?
- He said to go, he'll catch up.

590
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:37,590
Uncle Genzo?

591
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,400
Uncle Genzo?

592
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,780
I'm an old man who doesn't
have many years left.

593
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,620
I'm sorry, but look after
Junpei and Kanta for me.

594
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,340
With us fishermen, we live,
we eat, we fish, and we die.

595
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,070
We're content with that.
That's a life we're proud of.

596
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,950
Hey! Miss Sawako!

597
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,710
- Kanta!
- Miss Sawako!

598
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,560
Junpei! Kanta!

599
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,590
It's Uncle!

600
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,420
- Hideo!
- You're okay!

601
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,840
You are speaking to an
indestructible wandering crow!

602
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,760
They interrogated you, right?

603
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,080
Sure, but your uncle
doesn't break easily.

604
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,060
Your dad is so stubborn.

605
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,870
If he'd played along,
they would've let him go.

606
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,280
It was you?!

607
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,510
Hey, It's not like I
sold him out or anything.

608
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,510
I tried to help him.

609
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,230
Oh, well.
Say, where's Pops?

610
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,550
<i>I asked Miss Sawako
about him afterwards.</i>

611
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,640
<i>She said my grandpa
had made up his mind</i>

612
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,600
<i>that his last moments
would be on the sea.</i>

613
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,030
I wonder if we'll ever be able
to come back to the island?

614
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,040
Junpei! Look!

615
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,730
Isn't that Tanya?

616
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,490
Tanya...

617
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,070
I'm sorry.
Tanya, I'm so sorry.

618
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,680
Tanya!

619
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:20,270
Tanya!

620
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,600
Tanya! Tanya!

621
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,590
Tanya!

622
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,420
Tanya! Tanya!

623
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:36,010
<i>And that was how
we left the island.</i>

624
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,160
- Haven't we reached Japan yet?
- We must be almost there.

625
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,500
It's freezing...

626
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,020
Need the loo...

627
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,320
Give her back!
Give back my baby!

628
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,050
Please!

629
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,280
Get off me!

630
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,660
Please! Give her back!

631
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,140
- We're not allowed!
- lt's the orders!

632
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,210
The baby's dead.
There's nothing else to do.

633
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,560
No!

634
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,050
Yasuko!

635
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,090
Yasuko! Yasuko!

636
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,910
Poor woman...

637
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,910
<i>Day after day,
the storm raged on.</i>

638
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,180
October 3, 1947

639
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,670
What is this place?

640
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,050
This doesn't seem like
Nemuro or Hakodate.

641
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,280
This isn't Japan!

642
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,170
Keep walking!

643
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:44,200
Sugar! Sugar!
Who wants sugar?

644
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,870
It's sweet!

645
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,830
I'm beat...
This is so heavy...

646
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,440
Kanta...

647
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,800
Are you okay, Kanta?

648
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,760
Sweet sugar, sir!

649
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,720
Wait here!

650
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,870
Three sugars, please!

651
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,080
Thanks.

652
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,100
Sugar!

653
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,060
Turn those frowns upside-down!

654
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,560
Wow, it's sugar!

655
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,170
Thanks, Uncle!

656
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,990
A token of my love, milady!

657
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,340
Be my guest!

658
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,370
The bottom is sand!

659
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,830
Sand? That little crook!

660
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,460
Where'd he go?!
Come back here!

661
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,500
- It's so fast!
- It's so big!

662
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:53,770
<i>For the first time in our lives,
we saw a real train.</i>

663
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,630
- Wow!
- That was the real thing!

664
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:07,410
<i>The internment camp was a
primary school at the top of a hilt.</i>

665
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,730
Hey, no cutting!

666
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,380
This is all?

667
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,270
It's gross...

668
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,030
Boo!

669
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,140
Ta-dah!

670
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,560
- Wow, biscuits!
- Eat up!

671
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,480
- Look, everybody!
- Let's share them.

672
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,650
Apparently, we're in Maoka,
in western Karafuto.

673
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,650
Oh.

674
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,990
Everybody from the islands
is being rounded up here.

675
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,090
Then a ship from Japan
will come pick us up, they say.

676
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,820
So we'll be able to
go back to Japan?

677
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,540
I'm not so sure. Something tells
me it won't be that simple.

678
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,640
Why?

679
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,220
- Junpei, I'm so cold...
- Kanta?

680
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,700
I'm so cold...

681
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,180
Everything will be okay.

682
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,690
I wonder what Tanya
is up to?

683
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,060
With everyone gone,
she must be lonely.

684
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,080
- Get moving!
- Get on the trucks!

685
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:40,650
<i>Every day, they took the adults
deep into the mountains to out wood.</i>

686
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,340
<i>It was back-breaking work,</i>

687
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,660
<i>and some of them got hurt
or got sick from the cold.</i>

688
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,400
Kanta...

689
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:14,020
Where is Dad?

690
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,960
Don't worry.
I'm sure he's fine.

691
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,610
Miss Sawako...
Were you and Dad—

692
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,360
Forget it.

693
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,530
I care a great deal
for your father.

694
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,750
He knew that he would be arrested
if he went to the cave.

695
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,900
He felt it was his duty.

696
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,360
I wonder if Dad has turned
into the Fire of Scorpius...

697
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,570
Well, I —
I'm sure that he has.

698
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,680
Your father lived
his life for others.

699
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,770
And for you boys.

700
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,440
I have to be strong now, too.

701
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:04,000
You gave me the courage
to go on, Junpei.

702
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,730
It's so cold...

703
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:28,740
Once they've taken everyone in
the girls' school, it'll be our turn.

704
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,200
- Hang in there.
- I can't...

705
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,750
I have great news!
I found out where Tatsuo is!

706
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,440
- Dad is alive?!
- Really?!

707
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,110
At the logging camp, I met a guy
who's housed in the same place!

708
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,470
He says he's in the
prison camp to the north!

709
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:53,620
Beyond those mountains!
It's just a stone's throw from here!

710
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,120
- Thank goodness...
- Kanta!

711
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,940
He didn't get sent to Siberia!

712
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,670
He said he's just past
those mountains, right?

713
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,460
- Did he mean those mountains?
- I guess.

714
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,400
Junpei, I'm gonna
go see Dad.

715
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,650
- Let's go!
- How?

716
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,350
We'd have to go way beyond
that train's final stop.

717
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,350
I don't care!

718
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,480
See? You have to
get better first.

719
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:43,100
I'd get better real quick
if I saw Dad!

720
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,480
Still...

721
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,190
Don't you want to ever
see Dad again?!

722
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,910
But how?

723
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,870
Let's take the
Galactic Railroad there!

724
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,750
Kanta...

725
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,630
I'm freezing...

726
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,760
What's the matter?

727
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,310
Those kids!

728
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,240
Kanta!

729
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,700
- Kanta! Hurry!
- Junpei!

730
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,570
Go on!

731
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:59,100
Real trains sure are bumpy, huh?

732
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,600
This will take us to Dad
in no time flat!

733
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,580
Kanta, are you okay?

734
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,700
This thing cost me
everything I had, damn it!

735
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,240
Will we catch them?

736
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,370
The end of the train line
is just ahead.

737
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,550
- I'm so sorry...
- Don't worry about it.

738
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:22,390
- Thanks.
- Are you okay?

739
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,390
I'm fine...

740
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:36,050
If they got off the train and walked,
they should be around here.

741
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,830
You two idiots!

742
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,160
Uncle Hideo!

743
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,840
If I were a Soviet soldier,
you'd be dead right now!

744
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,820
What were you thinking?!

745
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,130
We're sorry.

746
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,760
Come on, we're going back!

747
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,050
No! I'm gonna see Dad!

748
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,370
Kanta!

749
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,430
No! Put me down!

750
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,480
You dumb kid! Even if you
do see him, then what?!

751
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,230
I wanna see him!

752
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:16,570
We're going to see Dad!
Our minds are made up!

753
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:17,550
Ow!

754
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,780
You stubborn little kids!
That's the last thing he wants!

755
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,640
No! We're seeing him,
no matter what!

756
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,440
Of all the stupid...

757
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,260
Hey!

758
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,660
Come back here!

759
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:52,670
Uncle, please!
We want to see Dad!

760
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,810
No!

761
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:58,110
I can't let you two die
in a place like this!

762
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,690
No, I want to see him!

763
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:04,800
You're the one who said he was
just a stone's throw away!

764
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,870
Fine, I said that.
But I didn't mean it literally!

765
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,500
What am I gonna do
with you two'?

766
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,860
Come on, Sawako!
Talk sense into them!

767
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,090
- I'm going, too.
- Wha—?

768
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,790
Please, let us go.
I want to see Tatsuo, too.

769
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,830
Besides, we're closer to his camp
than we are to ours.

770
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,020
Guards might be
on our trail, too.

771
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,550
Oh, for crying out loud...

772
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,310
At a time like this,
what's a man supposed to do?

773
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,440
Could one of you tell me?

774
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,630
- Thank you, Uncle!
- Thank you!

775
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,880
- Cut it out, damn it!
- Thank you!

776
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,090
I wish I were as popular
as my brother...

777
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,090
Man, you two are heavy...

778
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,720
What's that?

779
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,740
A fortification?

780
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,130
It's so warm...

781
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,650
Thank goodness
for this pillbox.

782
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,080
- I'd love a hot bath right about now.
- Here.

783
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,060
Boy, this warms you right up!

784
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,520
Hideo!

785
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,770
Wow, it's freezing!

786
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,380
What's up, Sawako?

787
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,840
- Soldiers.
- What'?

788
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,800
Looks like they found
where I hid the car.

789
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,910
- Sawako, wake up the boys!
- Right!

790
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,770
What's wrong?

791
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,730
While I keep them distracted, you
and the boys make a break for it.

792
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,460
Here's the address of our
relatives on the mainland.

793
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,280
Junpei, look after Kanta
and Sawako, you hear?

794
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,200
Uncle...

795
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,740
Hideo...

796
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:56,560
If I were a Soviet soldier, I could give
you a big bear hug to say goodbye.

797
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,850
Maybe I will anyway.

798
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,240
Sawako. I always
loved you.

799
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,470
I hope you get to see
your dad, Kanta.

800
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,810
Uncle...

801
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,230
Hey, I'm an indestructible,
wandering crow!

802
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,840
And now, everyone,
I bid you farewell.

803
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,680
- Look, look!
- Halt!

804
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,030
Halt!

805
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:37,560
Stop, or we'll shoot!

806
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,960
Let's go, boys.

807
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:37,390
Just a little further, Kanta. Hold on
until the settlement up ahead.

808
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,720
Kanta...

809
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,270
"Wow, would you look at this!

810
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:47,440
You could even go to the
real Heaven with this ticket!

811
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,340
And not just Heaven! This is
a free pass to go anywhere!"

812
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,780
Kanta, this is a sign that
we can make it to see Dad!

813
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,990
We're almost there!

814
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,870
Junpei...

815
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,600
This is the Galactic Railroad,
isn't it'?

816
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,810
I have this free pass
to go anywhere!

817
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,460
Please take me to where
my father is!

818
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,710
Please!

819
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,380
Please! Let us on board!

820
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,850
Please let us on!

821
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:44,390
Let us on, please!

822
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:12,050
Eat this and go.
<i></i>

823
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:14,280
Thank you so much.

824
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:20,240
About that matter we discussed.
I do hope we can count on you.

825
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,890
I swear...

826
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,733
If we weren't talking about kids,

827
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:29,940
I wouldn't feel the least bit obligated to help a bunch of Japs.

828
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:34,420
Go on, move it!
There's nothing to see here.

829
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,430
It's so warm...

830
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,750
Junpei...

831
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,420
Take a look
out that window.

832
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,930
- What's this?
- My end of the bargain.

833
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:35,500
I only pulled it off because I'm on the camp's kitchen staff.

834
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,110
Thank you so much!

835
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:43,110
So kind of Japan to send ships for you,
but not bother to send us home to Korea.

836
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,660
Junpei!

837
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,580
<i>"Wait here tomorrow at midnight.
-T"</i>

838
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,520
Dad...!

839
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,730
<i>"Wait here tomorrow at midnight.
-T"</i>

840
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,790
<i>That day was the
Russian New Year.</i>

841
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,650
<i>The night of their
Yolka Festival.</i>

842
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,210
Junpei...

843
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:32,660
Happy New Year!

844
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:37,210
<i>A mail troika dashes
along the frozen Mother Volga...</i>

845
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:39,500
Hey, cool it!
We'll get in trouble!

846
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,030
Relax! The Commandant
will overlook it today!

847
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:53,370
<i>The coachman hums a sad tune
and shakes his head...</i>

848
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,600
Hey, come down here
and drink with us!

849
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,490
As you command!

850
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,860
There!

851
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,470
No, wait!

852
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,300
It's Dad!

853
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,660
Kanta! Kanta!

854
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,040
Dad!

855
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,400
What were you thinking?!
What if you're caught?!

856
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,110
It's not safe here!
Go back this instant!

857
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,090
Go back.

858
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,640
Go back right now!

859
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:01,880
Junpei!

860
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,800
- Kanta!
- Dad!

861
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,510
Thank you.
I'm so glad you came.

862
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,770
I'm so glad!

863
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:18,310
We came on the
Galactic Railroad!

864
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,020
You did?
You did, did you?

865
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,220
Dad!

866
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,010
Dad!

867
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,180
Junpei!

868
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,240
Dad!

869
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,450
Kanta!

870
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,290
Dad!

871
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:50,760
Wait for me! I'll come
home alive, no matter what!

872
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:10,280
Thank you, Sawako.
Please look after the boys.

873
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,990
I will.

874
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,240
Dad...

875
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,700
Let's go.

876
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,310
Kanta!

877
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,650
Kanta!

878
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,190
- Kanta!
- Kanta!

879
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,680
Kanta!

880
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,870
- Kanta! Kanta!
- Are you all right, Kanta?

881
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,060
Kanta!

882
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,270
Tomorrow? Then...

883
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,380
Yes. Of course.

884
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,820
Kanta...

885
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,360
Here.

886
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,740
Thank you.

887
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:19,540
Put them on a truck
and take them to Kholmsk.

888
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,160
Comrade Commandant?

889
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:26,190
A Japanese repatriation ship is
leaving from Kholmsk tomorrow.

890
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,590
- Make sure they're on it.
- At once!

891
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:31,420
Happy New Year!

892
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:52,820
Kanta! We're going home!
We're going back to Japan!

893
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,160
I told you to keep quiet!

894
01:21:55,450 --> 01:22:00,370
Can't you see that he's sick?
Be kind and let them talk.

895
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,170
The stars are so pretty...

896
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,700
Are we riding
the Galactic Railroad?

897
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:18,990
That's right! We're Giovanni
and Campanella!

898
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:20,970
You and me,
together forever!

899
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,770
Look, Kanta! The Indian and
the Bird Catcher are here, too!

900
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,360
I can see the Southern Cross
and the big Coalsack!

901
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,570
Junpei...

902
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,760
Am I gonna die?

903
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:46,880
No way! You're not
gonna die, not here!

904
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,550
We have this magic ticket to go
wherever we want, remember?

905
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:57,140
See, Kanta? It's a ticket
for the Galactic Railroad!

906
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,510
It is...

907
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:07,480
It's a magic ticket that will let you go
anywhere you want in the whole universe!

908
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,110
Kanta, let's go home to Japan.

909
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:17,360
We'll head straight home and
eat a whole bunch of tasty food!

910
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:22,310
We can do anything.
What do you want to be, Kanta?

911
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:27,770
I know! A conductor on the
Galactic Railroad, right?

912
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,750
An airplane pilot?

913
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,320
You could even be a sailor or
own a toy store or a bookshop!

914
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,300
You can be anything!

915
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,840
When you grow up, you can even
get married and have kids!

916
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,830
You can ride in cars,
sing songs,

917
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,890
go swimming, see movies,
go fishing!

918
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,780
You're right, Junpei...

919
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:59,700
I can see a light...

920
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,760
I wonder if it's
the final stop?

921
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,770
No! Don't go there!

922
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,170
I can see a lovely field...

923
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:16,090
It's such a lovely field...

924
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:20,050
This has to be

925
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:25,350
the final stop on the line.

926
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,270
Dummy!

927
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,080
We're supposed to stick
together forever!

928
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,900
Right, Kanta?!

929
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,530
Kanta?

930
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,030
Kanta?

931
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,610
Kanta!

932
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,620
Kanta...

933
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,090
Kanta!

934
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,720
Kanta!

935
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,330
Hey!

936
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,750
- Uncle?!
- Hideo!

937
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,080
I'm an indestructible,
wandering crow, you know!

938
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,000
Hideo, what happened
to your leg?

939
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,630
The Russkies are rusty,
but their bullets have bite.

940
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:04,820
Did you see Tatsuo?

941
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,510
Hey, Kanta.
What's the matter?

942
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,940
He didn't make it, huh?
Damn.

943
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,510
Come on, let's all
go home together.

944
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,860
Honey!

945
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,640
If you die, you get thrown
by the wayside.

946
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,330
Junpei! Prop up Kanta!

947
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:38,690
Make it look like he's alive!
Talk to him! About anything!

948
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,300
There has to be something!
Think!

949
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:47,220
I know! Kenji Miyazawa!
Wasn't the Galactic Railroad born here?

950
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,970
It was! Kenji Miyazawa
came to Karafuto

951
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:52,890
because he wanted to talk
to his late sister.

952
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,790
The Galactic Railroad was his way of
communicating with his sister in space!

953
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:00,900
That story was born right here!
On this very spot!

954
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,550
Junpei!

955
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,590
Kanta. Let's go home together.

956
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:11,220
Back to Japan!

957
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,980
"It was at that precise moment
that it happened.

958
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,670
In the far distance of the
Milky Way's downstream course,

959
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:26,170
a cross, bejeweled with bright
orange and blue lights,

960
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:32,120
appeared, standing shimmering
in the midst of the river."

961
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,350
Kanta, can you see it?
Can you see the cross?

962
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,940
"'Hallelujah! Hallelujah!'

963
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,860
Brightly and happily the passengers'
voices resounded together.

964
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:54,200
From far off in the distant,
cold depths of the sky

965
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,200
came the clear, bracing,
indescribable blast of a trumpet."

966
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,250
Kanta, can you hear it?
Can you hear it?

967
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:04,380
Just a little further.
Just ten more meters!

968
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,650
There's the border!
It's Japan!

969
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:12,180
"I'll no longer be afraid
of that vast darkness.

970
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:16,890
I'd go looking in there for what
would make people happy.

971
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:20,810
You and me, always together!
Always together!

972
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,900
Always together!
Always together!

973
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:26,130
Always together,
forward we go!"

974
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,890
"Together!

975
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:38,060
Hey! Don't those fields
look so lovely?

976
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:45,250
And everybody's gathered there!
That must be the real Heaven!

977
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,780
Look! She's there!
There's my mother!"

978
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,220
Kanta, we're home!

979
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,620
We've come home to Japan!

980
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,550
Kanta...

981
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:35,410
<i>More than fifty years have
passed since all that happened.</i>

982
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:41,960
<i>The island where my family lived...
The island where I met Tanya...</i>

983
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:48,630
<i>Our island stood before us,
looking exactly the same.</i>

984
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:53,300
<i>"Seno Family Grave"</i>

985
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:59,100
We've finally managed
to come back.

986
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,890
Kanta.

987
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,190
Tatsuo.

988
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,930
<i>That day, a primary school
graduation ceremony was held.</i>

989
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:23,770
<i>For those of us who weren't
able to graduate back then.</i>

990
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:25,850
<i>"Welcome, Visitation Group!"</i>

991
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:33,820
I hereby certify you have completed
your primary school education

992
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:42,310
at Shikotan National People's School
after a 56 year course of study.

993
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:52,280
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, ma'am.

994
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:03,770
- I'll never forget that.
- Me, neither.

995
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:07,230
Wait, did that happen?

996
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,430
Tanya!

997
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:19,800
Giovanni?

998
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:36,170
My grandma told me
to give that to you.

999
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:38,510
Is Tanya here?

1000
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:41,800
This is Nina.
She is Tanya's granddaughter.

1001
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:46,250
Tanya was my mother.
She passed away last year.

1002
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,560
She always said that she
hoped to see you again.

1003
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,210
So, she's gone...

1004
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,420
Then this is for you.

1005
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,840
<i>"Night on the Galactic Railroad"</i>

1006
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:20,530
What's it about?

1007
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:29,350
When people die, they rise up
into the heavens

1008
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,810
and become stars
in the night sky.

1009
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:39,610
Those countless stars fill the sky,
shining brightly and eternally,

1010
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:47,140
and we live our lives down here,
basking in their light.

1011
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:50,250
That's what the story is about.

1012
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,750
That's very beautiful.

1013
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:33,310
Giovanni? Shall we dance, too?

1014
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,270
Thank you.

1015
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,780
Hold this, Mum!
