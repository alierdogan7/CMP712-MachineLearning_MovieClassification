1
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:57,876
You're up early.

2
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:03,058
- More bad dreams?
- No, no. It's the goddamn church bells.

3
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,719
I hope you haven't been to the loo.
I need a morning specimen.

4
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,993
Actually, it's a good thing you're up.

5
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,294
You've got a busy morning of tests ahead.

6
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,393
But if everything checks out,
it looks like we'll be letting you go today.

7
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,199
- No kidding.
- Don't talk.

8
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,238
And don't smile.

9
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:20,905
You're well on the mend,
and we need the bed.

10
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,308
Your squadron leader
will see to your billeting and transport.

11
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,971
Peter. Good.

12
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,481
You are really that anxious
to get back to the war, are you?

13
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,747
No. Not the war.
But I wanna try out this retread of a leg...

14
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,582
you guys fixed me up with.

15
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,953
Make sure it can still do all the old things
that it used to.

16
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,184
You know...

17
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:41,687
I'd hold off on the tap-dancing
for a while, David.

18
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,255
I think you may be right there, Ginger.

19
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,097
The mattress is all new.

20
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,367
And a room with a bath
is an unheard of luxury...

21
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,271
in Jerusalem nowadays.

22
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:01,305
- There.
- Very nice.

23
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:07,077
- There's no water.
- It's rationed, old chap.

24
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:10,382
Half the city is supplied on even days
and the other half on odd ones.

25
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,121
Well, included in the price
you'll have two eggs every morning.

26
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:17,961
They alone cost me a shilling.
I have to buy them at the black market.

27
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,691
Well, David, what do you say?

28
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,964
Well, I've been living
in a boarding house for 10 days.

29
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,504
This is paradise. Where do I sign?

30
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:27,632
Oh, good. Would you know
how long you'll be staying?

31
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm afraid not. We could be relocated
anywhere more or less anytime.

32
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:33,112
How awful this war is.

33
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,706
May Hitler burn in hell.

34
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,286
Okay. If this place is so terrific...

35
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,890
why are you letting go of it?
What's the catch?

36
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,190
There's no bloody catch, you ingrate.

37
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:50,094
- Want one?
- No.

38
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,556
Was that true?

39
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:54,124
Or just for public consumption
about us not knowing...

40
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:55,829
how long we're gonna be here?

41
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,461
It's absolutely true.

42
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,839
The whole bloody war
is bogged down in the desert.

43
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:04,241
Rommel's been stopped,
but he's pretty well dug in by now.

44
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,907
So, pushing him back's
not gonna be all that much fun.

45
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,609
So that's why they're holding us in reserves.

46
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,943
God knows.

47
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:14,483
There's no end of rumors.
I even heard Burma mentioned.

48
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,718
By the way, there's been
an American military attaché...

49
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,893
inquiring if you might like
to change uniforms...

50
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,724
now that you Yanks are in it officially.

51
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:23,161
Tell him I'm not interested.

52
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,722
Of course you're a bloody awful wingman,
but I'm used to you.

53
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,859
Still haven't told me
why you're moving out of here.

54
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,336
- Well, I've met this girl who...
- Oh, no.

55
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,806
Don't tell me that girls are off-limits up here.

56
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,240
No, no.

57
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,373
As long as you're discreet.

58
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,576
I just thought I'd be more comfortable
in a flat.

59
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,639
Because of this girl?

60
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,681
- What girl?
- The girl you almost told me about.

61
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:47,220
Why are you being so cagey about this?

62
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:48,812
I'll tell you all about it, but later.

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,121
In the meantime,
if you have any interest in washing today...

64
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:54,127
Well, I thought there was no water.

65
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,925
Yeah, but that's only on this side of the city.

66
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,963
You mean black market showers?

67
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,334
Victoria, you know I'm your friend.

68
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,641
But you always overdramatize.

69
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,339
Not this time.

70
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,749
Sarah, they take turns
spying on me.

71
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,719
You have to help me.

72
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,553
Oh, God, there's my father.
Laugh, Sarah.

73
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,753
He mustn't suspect anything.

74
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,297
Come on. At least smile.

75
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,234
This is silly.

76
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,532
My cousin Nessim
is already suspicious.

77
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:12,573
Who cares about your cousin?

78
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,576
Unless you're afraid
to be seen with me.

79
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,976
Of course not.

80
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,345
I told Nessim
I'd go to the movies with him.

81
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:26,114
I must see Peter.
He's waiting for me.

82
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,985
Sarah, please!
Only you can help me!

83
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,322
All right.

84
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,793
Go and be nice to your father.

85
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:37,092
I'll figure out something.

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,403
I got tickets for the Carmen Miranda film
with The Ritz Brothers.

87
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:51,604
I prefer The Marx Brothers.

88
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,339
Nessim, dear, don't be difficult.

89
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,442
- Victoria needs to talk to me.
- What about me? Don't I need you?

90
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,117
- To go to the movies?
- What am I to tell your parents?

91
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,953
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.

92
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,721
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You know I love you.

93
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:07,783
I know.

94
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,659
- But you don't care.
- I do.

95
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,932
But Victoria's waiting.

96
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:35,385
David, I'm getting married next Monday.
I want you to be my best man.

97
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,923
- Will you do it?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

98
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,459
- Good. Thank you.
- Are you nuts?

99
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,764
Isn't that what people in love
are supposed to do?

100
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:46,163
Crazy things like get married?

101
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,929
Peter, you can make love to a woman...

102
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,028
without marrying her
and without being a bastard about it.

103
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:55,701
- Look, David, I'm crazy about this girl.
- But marriage? Peter, Jesus Christ!

104
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:59,337
There's not one single aspect of our lives
that we control right now.

105
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,348
- The war can't go on forever.
- So wait.

106
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,817
It could be a bloody long wait.
Remember the Hundred Years' War?

107
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:09,115
Not personally. No.

108
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,125
This one doesn't have to go on
that long for all of us to wind up dead.

109
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:13,387
Have you thought about that?

110
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,794
Look, all I want to do
is a bit of normal living before I die.

111
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:18,923
- What is so wrong with that?
- Is that fair to her?

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,730
Luckily, she wants to do
a bit of normal living before I die, too.

113
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:24,293
- So it could work out quite nicely.
- So live together.

114
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:27,535
I can't ask her to do that.
She's from a very respectable Jewish family.

115
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,940
They're already less than thrilled
that she's seeing a Gentile.

116
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,239
Well, that's great. That's just great.

117
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,677
You really know how to pick them, Peter.

118
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:33,805
Hold it, here she comes.

119
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,439
- What's her name?
- Victoria.

120
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:38,349
Oh, well, won't the folks at home
be pleased.

121
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,622
Peter.

122
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,455
I nearly didn't make it.

123
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,461
Oh, this is Sarah. She's my alibi.

124
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,057
- And an absolute angel.
- Sarah, Victoria, this is David.

125
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,897
Oh, you are the American.

126
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:58,997
Peter's told me how madly brave
you were when you were shot down.

127
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:02,133
But of course it was madly brave of you
to go all the way to England...

128
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,676
to enlist when you didn't have to.

129
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,974
Well, it was Canada, actually.

130
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,042
Peter, darling, please tell me. Right now.
Even if the news is bad.

131
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:14,246
How does a week from Monday
strike you as a wedding day?

132
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,158
Peter and I are going to be married.

133
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,716
We've just been waiting
for him to get permission.

134
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:22,456
Sarah, be happy for me, please.

135
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,057
Be happy?
When you've lost your mind?

136
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,193
I'm 21! I can do what I want!

137
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm entitled to be happy.

138
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,399
You had no right to use me this way!
No right at all.

139
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,978
Sarah, I've ordered some champagne
to celebrate.

140
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,470
- I hope you'll join us.
- Please.

141
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,412
David's agreed to be our best man, darling.

142
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,425
I hope you'll come, too, Sarah.
I know it'd mean a lot to Victoria.

143
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,017
Yes, it would.

144
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,086
Peter, darling, we have so little time.

145
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,824
- Can't we dance?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,923
Sarah and David will understand.

147
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:15,441
Well, they certainly do look good together.
I'll give them that.

148
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:19,985
- Is that a good reason to get married?
- No.

149
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:24,784
But I think they might say something
about being in love.

150
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,950
Yes.

151
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,954
People do seem to talk about that a lot.

152
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,798
But you're a skeptic
when it comes to love, is that it?

153
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:33,891
No.

154
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:37,896
But it is not something
I know very much about.

155
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,491
What was that language
you and Victoria were speaking?

156
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,595
- Spanish.
- Spanish, yeah.

157
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,140
How is it that you happen
to speak Spanish?

158
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,800
It's what we speak at home.

159
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,674
- Your family came from Spain?
- Yes.

160
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,573
- Recently?
- About 400 years ago.

161
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,077
I see.

162
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,880
- They must have some terrific memories.
- Yes.

163
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,386
Why are you staring at me?

164
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,925
Am I staring?

165
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,694
Yeah, I am. I'm sorry. Yes, I was staring.

166
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,934
It's just that you have
the most extraordinary eyes.

167
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,072
Like to dance, little lady?

168
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,875
If you've no objections, mate.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,639
It's up to the young lady.

170
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,166
I'm sorry, I didn't realize he was that drunk.

171
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,072
If you knew he'd been drinking,
why didn't you say anything?

172
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,203
Well, he's probably just on a short leave,
and he's in a tank division now.

173
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,146
And anybody facing going back
inside one of those little metal ovens...

174
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,411
probably has a right
to have a couple of drinks...

175
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,282
and a dance with a pretty girl.

176
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,754
You think I should let a drunken soldier
maul me to show I'm grateful?

177
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,950
No, I'm not implying that.

178
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,516
Look, I would've asked you myself,
except I can't...

179
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,291
because of my leg.

180
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,131
I'm sorry if it was unpleasant for you.

181
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,292
It doesn't matter.

182
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,239
I must be getting home.

183
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,135
Would you explain to them?

184
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,268
Sarah, don't go away mad.
In fact, don't go away at all.

185
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,812
Please, sit. Come on.

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,905
I must. Really.

187
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,432
Where are you off to, love? Just one kiss.

188
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,697
- Leave me alone!
- One little kiss.

189
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,671
- Hey, hey, leave her alone!
- Leave me alone.

190
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,273
- Leave me alone, leave me alone.
- One little kiss.

191
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,641
My God. You killed him.

192
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,438
No, I'm afraid not.

193
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,009
Nessim.

194
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,384
- You know this man?
- No, I just happened along.

195
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,690
- How did you happen to be here?
- You know, I just...

196
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,425
- You followed me, didn't you?
- No, no.

197
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,796
- You were spying on me.
- No, no.

198
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,768
- How dare you? How could you?
- Sarah, please, listen to me.

199
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,169
No, I don't want to hear it.
And I don't want to see you again.

200
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,142
- Not as long as I live.
- Why? Sarah, please, why?

201
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,709
I apologize for Sarah.

202
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,875
- I'm sure she meant to thank you.
- It's all right.

203
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,146
You must let me buy you a drink
to show our appreciation.

204
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,483
- No, no, it's okay.
- Yes, yes, yes. I must.

205
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,614
- It's fine.
- And I must buy you another walking stick.

206
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,318
It's not important, really.

207
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,190
Sarah came in here with another girl.

208
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,127
Are you serious about this drink?

209
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,529
- Yes, yes, I know just the place. Come.
- Good.

210
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,626
- Thank you very much.
- It's all right, it's all right.

211
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,664
You know how many times I tried to enlist?

212
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,843
Every time they tell me I'm underweight.

213
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,108
- It's not for lack of appetite.
- Oh, no, I eat all the time.

214
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,012
I am a bottomless pit.

215
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,452
Where does it all go, you wonder, huh?
Doctor says I burn it all up.

216
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,181
Maybe I worry too much.

217
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,348
Tell me, David.
May I call you David, Lieutenant?

218
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,292
- Yes, yes. Sure.
- Good. Then you must call me Nessim.

219
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,430
- Nessim.
- Nessim. Nessim.

220
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,391
David, what shall I do?

221
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,969
If I don't see my cousin,
it's like not seeing the sun.

222
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,937
- Your cousin?
- Sarah.

223
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,975
The girl you saved from the Australian.
She's my cousin.

224
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,409
I've known her practically all my life.
At least all her life.

225
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,243
She is only 18, and I'm 28.

226
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:27,453
David, I loved her the first time I saw her.

227
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,019
She was only one day old.

228
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,449
I'm the right man for her, David.

229
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,686
No one can love her more than I do.

230
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,954
You don't think I'm too old for her?

231
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:41,523
- Sarah, what does she think?
- I wish I knew.

232
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,895
Everybody thinks she'll be my wife.
I thought so, too.

233
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,996
Now I don't know.

234
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,270
She was so angry.

235
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,675
You think she meant that?
About never seeing me again?

236
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,373
If she does, I'll die.

237
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,382
Well, before you die,
I'm sure that she will forgive you.

238
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,113
Oh, no, no, no. She can be very stubborn.

239
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,552
And very fierce.

240
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,921
Well, you are right.
Where there is life, there is hope.

241
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:10,088
- Tell you what, David, are you Jewish?
- No.

242
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,560
It's not so unlikely. The name, David.
And I know there are many Jews in America.

243
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,761
Yeah, but not in Missoula, Montana,
there aren't.

244
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:21,432
The reason I was laughing is because
my father is a Christian minister.

245
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,441
Well, it doesn't matter.
You can still come for the Sabbath dinner.

246
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,538
- That's very nice of you, but I don't think so.
- No, no, no, no. You must come.

247
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,209
You must give Sarah a chance
to thank you properly.

248
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,752
I'm not taking no for an answer.

249
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,687
Then let's just say
that one of these Sabbaths...

250
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,055
Friday. Sabbath dinner is every Friday.

251
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,690
Friday.

252
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,920
You sure you've had enough, David?

253
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,728
Oh, good heavens, yes. It was all wonderful.

254
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,868
Mama, the officer complimented you.

255
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,372
Thank you very much. I pleased you like it.

256
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,568
When is the Sabbath dinner
not delicious?

257
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,637
No, no, "liked" isn't the word.
I usually don't make such a pig of myself.

258
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,079
What is he saying?

259
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,447
He's ashamed because he ate so much.

260
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,782
To his good health.

261
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,379
One never eats too much
on a Sabbath.

262
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,447
Tell him it pleases the Lord.

263
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,926
Hear that? No need to be ashamed.
The Lord is pleased.

264
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,520
Tell me, do you think Rommel will get here?

265
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,991
Only if we let him.

266
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,933
Well, he can come for all I care.
We are ready for him.

267
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,165
- Right, we will show Hitler a trick or two.
- Yeah.

268
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,766
But the British won't,
I mean, they will not let Rommel through.

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,941
- There is no reason to worry?
- Elie's a tough guy.

270
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,605
As soon as he smells danger...

271
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,810
he takes his courage in both feet
and runs for dear life.

272
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,951
I can feel a draft.

273
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,787
You are the only one.
Every single door and window is shut.

274
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,886
- The heat is killing all of us.
- Albert is a boxer.

275
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,430
We are very proud of him.

276
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,762
He is fighting the "Ogre of Aleppo"
next week at the Y.M.C.A.

277
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:06,003
- You must come.
- Tell me, how is Mr. Winston Churchill?

278
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,198
The lieutenant is an American, Papa.

279
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,869
What does that matter? I mean,
he wears a British uniform, doesn't he?

280
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,413
- You have something against the British?
- No, no, no. On the contrary.

281
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,679
- We love everything British, yeah?
- Absolutely. English breakfasts.

282
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,984
Crosse and Blackwell marmalade.
Huntley and Palmer biscuits.

283
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,116
- The King, the Queen.
- Fish and chips.

284
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,025
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

285
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,084
Soccer.

286
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,324
- Craven "A" cigarettes.
- Habeas corpus.

287
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,196
But we don't like British rule.

288
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,668
And one day we will throw
all British troops out of Palestine.

289
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,432
Are you from anywhere
near Chicago, perhaps?

290
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,975
Not really. I grew up in Montana.

291
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,537
Is that near Seattle, perhaps?

292
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,445
It's nearer than Chicago, yes.

293
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,952
Oh, then we have relatives you must know.
The Peres Shoe Store.

294
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,749
- It's run by two brothers, my cousins.
- Well, it's a fairly big country.

295
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,486
Peres Shoes are well known, I believe.
A very large store.

296
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,521
- And we have other cousins, too.
- Peres, yes, I think I've heard of them.

297
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,833
His father is a priest, right?

298
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,099
How can a priest have a son?

299
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,334
Papa, I love you.

300
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,000
He's a Protestant.

301
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,238
Their priests are allowed
to have wives.

302
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,246
How many?

303
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,254
Papa was asking about your father.

304
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,082
Will he be a priest too?

305
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,092
Papa, all these questions.

306
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,684
David doesn't mind.

307
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,786
Do you?

308
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:42,163
Uncle Raphael wants to know
if you'll be a priest like your father.

309
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,299
- No.
- No.

310
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,339
Grandma Rosa
knows everything about you now.

311
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,139
Oh, really? Can she tell my future?

312
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,645
He wants his fortune told.

313
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,511
He needn't worry.

314
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,817
Nothing bad will happen to him.

315
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,913
He is a good man.

316
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,959
She says you'll live to be a 120,
you'll be rich and famous...

317
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,495
and the most beautiful girls
will be at your feet.

318
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,223
- Nessim.
- What?

319
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,662
What did she really say?

320
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,965
That you are a good man.

321
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,735
And nothing bad will happen to you.

322
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,620
I want to thank you.

323
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,755
What for?

324
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,422
Oh, for breaking my stick
over the head of a drunken Australian.

325
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,191
That also.

326
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,964
For not telling Nessim how we met,
or about Victoria.

327
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,207
Is it like this every Friday? All these people?

328
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,302
And on high holidays, even more.

329
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,514
The grandparents from the other side and...

330
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,143
The aunts and the uncles,
and the nieces and the nephews...

331
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,982
and the brothers and the sisters.

332
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,646
We are really a tribe.

333
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,286
What's it like being part of a tribe?

334
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:17,192
It has good points and bad points,
like everything else.

335
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,194
- Did you like them?
- Yeah. Well, they're a little...

336
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,964
overwhelming at first, but...

337
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,873
At the café, when you left...

338
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,708
I was following you because I wanted
to ask you if you'd be interested...

339
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,679
in going out with me sometime.

340
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,911
If the Aussie hadn't gotten in the way,
what would you have said?

341
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:39,973
No.

342
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,513
- What if I asked you right now?
- Still, no.

343
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,818
Well, why not?

344
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:49,721
The rumor has it, I'm a very good man
with a very promising future.

345
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,997
Is it Nessim?

346
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,765
I know that he assumes that one of these
days you and he are going to...

347
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,669
What Nessim assumes
has nothing to do with me.

348
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,599
Okay.

349
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,479
Am I supposed to ask your parents
their permission first, is that it?

350
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,809
No, don't.

351
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,510
Oh, there you are.

352
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,647
You're keeping our guest of honor
for yourself, Sarah?

353
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,120
No, I'm not.

354
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,994
She forgave me, just as I said she would.

355
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,402
Lovely night, isn't it?

356
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,676
- Lieutenant.
- Hello.

357
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,837
I hope I'm not intruding.

358
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,051
I brought these
as a token of my appreciation...

359
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,211
for the dinner last Friday night.

360
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,522
Thank you very much.

361
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,163
He thinks we need charity?

362
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,222
Bring us some coffee.

363
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,063
And these are for your grandmother.

364
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,365
Could you also explain to your mother...

365
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:47,640
that I am here to ask her permission
to take Sarah out sometime.

366
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,819
Sarah can do as she wishes.

367
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,284
Then would you like to go out
one day this week?

368
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,485
No, Sarah is busy this week.

369
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,494
- Perhaps next week, then?
- I am busy next week, also.

370
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,200
- I seem to have made a mistake.
- I think so.

371
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:17,135
Kindly thank your mother once again
for her hospitality. Goodbye.

372
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,601
That boy is in love with you.

373
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,544
That's ridiculous.

374
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,014
For once, listen to your mother.

375
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,950
I forbid you to see him again.

376
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,080
I never intended to see him again.

377
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,592
But don't give me orders!

378
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,234
Who wants coffee?

379
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:51,006
...take thee, Peter Ross...
- To be my lawful wedded husband.

380
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,406
...to be my lawful wedded husband.

381
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:59,746
By virtue of the powers vested in me
under The Foreign Marriage Act...

382
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,010
I now pronounce you man and wife.

383
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,524
Thank you.

384
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,959
- You may kiss the bride.
- Thank you.

385
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:27,008
Yes. You are married. Congratulations.

386
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,608
- Well, how's it feel?
- It feels great.

387
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,058
Okay, now, make a wish.

388
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,066
Okay, now, who would like a bit of cake?

389
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,232
Here, here, here. Wonderful. Wonderful!
None for me.

390
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:05,983
Thank you for coming.

391
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:29,150
A wedding with no parents. It seems odd.

392
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:30,480
Maybe it's better like this.

393
00:28:30,552 --> 00:28:33,043
Nobody's losing a daughter
or gaining a son.

394
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:35,886
You think Victoria's not losing anything?

395
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,521
You're supposed to get drunk at a wedding.

396
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,297
It's not like you to drink like that.

397
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:50,194
- How do you know?
- I know.

398
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:59,112
Look, I wouldn't mind getting out of here
and you're uncomfortable as all get-out.

399
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,115
Would you like to take a walk?

400
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,012
Yes.

401
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:30,735
That over there is King David's tomb...

402
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,712
so they say.

403
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:38,310
- Would you like to see it?
- Do I have to?

404
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,186
- No.
- Good.

405
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,402
What did your family think
about you joining the RAF?

406
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:02,573
Well, my mother died long before that.

407
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,669
My brother and sister
didn't have an opinion.

408
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:07,271
My father was disappointed. He's a pacifist.

409
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,915
I was bound to disappoint my father.

410
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:12,920
Joining up just got it over with
nice and quick.

411
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:19,792
- This is very beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

412
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,736
When you told me
that you were too busy to see me...

413
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:39,804
was that because of your mother,
or were you speaking for yourself?

414
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,246
For myself.

415
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:44,848
Then why the hell didn't you just say so
that night after dinner...

416
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,353
that you weren't interested?

417
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,445
I did.

418
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:50,514
No, you implied that it was
because of your family.

419
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,719
And that's why I made
such a jackass out of myself...

420
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:56,093
- coming to ask their permission.
- I told you not to.

421
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:02,503
All you had to say was that you, Sarah,
didn't want to see me again.

422
00:31:05,274 --> 00:31:07,742
So, why did you come
to the wedding today?

423
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:11,345
For Victoria.

424
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,614
You think I came because of you?

425
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:23,252
- You are very conceited, aren't you?
- No. No, I'm not.

426
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,720
Look, you think I don't feel it?

427
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,830
I was hoping like crazy
you were going to come today.

428
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,391
But I was half hoping that you wouldn't...

429
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:38,571
'cause I knew that if I saw you again
I would want to go on seeing you.

430
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,640
Again and again. And again and again.

431
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,646
It's not possible. And you know it's not.

432
00:31:47,249 --> 00:31:51,185
Okay, I can think of some reasons
for myself. But I'd like to hear yours.

433
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:04,831
You are in Jerusalem for how long?

434
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:09,031
Not very long, I think.

435
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,299
Why should I want to get involved with you?

436
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:13,966
And there's your family.

437
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,239
Why would I want to get involved
in anything so complicated?

438
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,075
Well, there you are.

439
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,780
I guess we should
just stay out of each other's way.

440
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:25,252
I think so.

441
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:28,454
Well, come on.

442
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,786
I'll take you home in a cab.

443
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,694
No. It's not a good idea.

444
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:41,963
Then I guess this is goodbye.

445
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,304
Goodbye, Sarah.

446
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,707
Goodbye.

447
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:14,293
- What is it, Sarah? What's bothering you?
- Nothing.

448
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:18,328
You can't fool me.
Everyone else, yes, but not me.

449
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,171
Something is making you depressed.

450
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,338
You know I love you.

451
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:25,112
What's funny?

452
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:29,177
You are. I know you love me.
You tell me every day.

453
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:31,276
And you have no feelings for me?

454
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,287
I love you. Like a brother.

455
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:37,387
That will change once we are married.

456
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,491
What if I met someone else?

457
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,496
Someone that I don't love like a brother?

458
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,305
- What if I have already?
- You can't have.

459
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:55,537
You would have told me.
Who else can you talk to about such things?

460
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,346
Oh, Nessim, you are such a foolish man.

461
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:13,292
The first night was fine. Lovely, in fact.

462
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:15,056
It all started the next morning.

463
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,657
A few tears at first,
and then a never-ending flood.

464
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,394
It took me hours to get it out of her.

465
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,369
- Get what?
- Her family.

466
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:25,171
She can't bear the thought
of never seeing them again.

467
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,300
Well, that's funny. I didn't think Victoria
gave two hoots about her family.

468
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,503
Yeah, she was pretty casual about it,
wasn't she?

469
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,171
Damn her all to hell!

470
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:34,943
Now, come on, Peter,
Victoria is crazy about you!

471
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:37,541
Well, be that as it may. Right now,
she seems to regard our marriage...

472
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,110
as a mild form of eternal damnation.

473
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:42,549
Christ, I'd be willing to let her off the hook.

474
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,717
Maybe look into an annulment.

475
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,887
But the real hell of it is,
it wouldn't do any damn good...

476
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,989
because her family
would still regard her as a pariah.

477
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,828
- That's some family.
- Well, mine's just the same, David.

478
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:56,803
They're as suspicious of Jews
as hers are of Gentiles.

479
00:34:56,872 --> 00:34:59,272
That's why making it legal was so important.

480
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:02,777
If I bought it, well,
they'd be honor bound to accept my widow.

481
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,778
Raised eyebrows or not.

482
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:07,872
It's ironic, isn't it?

483
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,941
- Bloody hell.
- Yeah, isn't it, just?

484
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:13,944
Well, come on.

485
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:16,049
No more sulking.

486
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,025
It's time for some constructive activities.

487
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:23,892
I don't need a bloody glove
to catch a ball, David.

488
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,626
You will for this one.

489
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,365
Oh, God! What's in that thing?

490
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:33,602
- Catch.
- No, come on, overhand, like this!

491
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:37,468
All right. Get ready.

492
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:46,042
- What the hell is that, David?
- That is the wind-up.

493
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,914
Pure poetry is what it is.

494
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,566
Don't worry, Sarah.
He'll kill him yet. Just wait and see.

495
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,062
- Where are you going?
- Home.

496
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,472
Wait, wait, wait!

497
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:09,987
Get up! Get up and fight! Come on!

498
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,840
Don't look at me like that.

499
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:34,747
It makes me feel drunk.

500
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:38,513
I feel I could look at you forever.

501
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:08,648
- Don't tell me you have to get home.
- But I do.

502
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,019
Sarah, every time we meet,
it's just to say goodbye.

503
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,651
If I am too late, they will ask questions.

504
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:20,961
All right, but this time, I'm taking you.

505
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:45,839
This is as far as we can go together.

506
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:48,381
When can I see you again?
I have to see you again.

507
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:50,041
How about the weekend?

508
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:53,347
I can't leave my house on the Sabbath.

509
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,182
- Which Sabbath?
- My Sabbath. Saturday.

510
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:57,451
Sunday, then. That's perfect.

511
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:59,425
They never schedule operations
for a Sunday.

512
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:00,688
- What operations?
- Oh, nothing.

513
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:02,923
We just take the planes up
to make sure they can still fly.

514
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,692
I think I can get a car.

515
00:42:04,932 --> 00:42:06,832
- David...
- No, Sunday.

516
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:09,802
In front of the café. I'll be there at 9:00.
You get there when you can.

517
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,236
I'll wait for you.

518
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:07,024
What's the matter, little dove?

519
00:43:07,095 --> 00:43:10,064
Nothing.
I love you, that's all.

520
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:14,034
Get up now.

521
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:18,198
You're too old
to be sitting on my lap.

522
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:20,672
You're back.

523
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:22,937
Where have you been?

524
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,671
Nowhere.

525
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:27,214
Where's this nowhere?

526
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:29,372
Nessim was looking for you.

527
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,884
He said you left the match
before the end.

528
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:33,921
It was horrible!

529
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:36,115
I couldn't stand it.
Who won?

530
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,715
Your brother. Who else?

531
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:40,954
These fights will be the death of me.

532
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:44,964
Did you see his eye?
It's all black and swollen.

533
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:46,659
Where's everybody?

534
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:48,258
Gone to celebrate.

535
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:52,238
- What about you?
- I'm celebrating here with Grandma.

536
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,939
Have something to eat.
I'll bet you're hungry.

537
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:59,103
No. I'm not.

538
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,741
I'm going to bed.
Good night.

539
00:44:08,156 --> 00:44:10,056
Your daughter needs a husband.

540
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:12,718
What are you saying, my soul?

541
00:44:12,794 --> 00:44:15,024
She's barely 18.

542
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:18,293
I was carrying your child
at her age.

543
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:20,391
If we don't watch out...

544
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:23,904
she'll come home one day
with her belly full.

545
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:45,830
It's you, little bird?

546
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:48,957
I couldn't sleep, Grandma.

547
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,127
It's too hot.

548
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:58,440
You sit out here for hours on end.

549
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,444
What do you think about?

550
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:05,108
Nothing.
Things just go 'round in my head.

551
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:07,242
That's all.

552
00:45:08,353 --> 00:45:12,153
- What is it, little one?
- Nothing.

553
00:45:12,224 --> 00:45:17,059
No. It's not nothing.
You know it's not.

554
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:19,359
Does it show?

555
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:22,059
Who is he? The American?

556
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:26,132
I was afraid of that.

557
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,536
What should I do?

558
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:30,905
What is there to do?

559
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:33,601
He's going away soon.

560
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,307
Would it be wrong to see him again?

561
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:40,044
Don't ask me what's right
and what's wrong.

562
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:42,211
I never could tell.

563
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:45,017
And don't expect anyone
to understand.

564
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,921
But you understand.

565
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:48,687
Don't you, Grandma?

566
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,024
I understand all too well.

567
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:54,896
My heart aches for you, little one.

568
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:59,800
Why is life so difficult?

569
00:45:59,871 --> 00:46:03,136
Why do I feel happy,
just the same?

570
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,388
This is beautiful. And cold.

571
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:59,294
- Yes, it's very cold.
- Yes, it is. This is very, very cold.

572
00:47:00,098 --> 00:47:01,793
Where are you taking me?

573
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,629
- You'll see.
- Where?

574
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:15,042
See, it is cold. Sorry. Told you. It's cold.

575
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,248
Oh, you're wet.

576
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:29,683
Is it very strange
being so far away from home?

577
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:32,286
No. Felt like a stranger there, too.

578
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:36,092
Like I was living in a country
with only one citizen.

579
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:38,295
As of now, two citizens today.

580
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:40,398
Well, I'm honored.

581
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,498
- Does this place have a name?
- Ein Gedi. It's biblical.

582
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:48,276
Everything here is biblical.

583
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:51,281
Ein Gedi, that's Saul and David.

584
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:57,284
- We Presbyterians, we know our Bible.
- Especially the son of a priest.

585
00:47:57,355 --> 00:48:01,621
- I forgot about that.
- Yeah. Well, we call them ministers.

586
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:04,991
Or parsons, or reverends.

587
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:08,897
The reverend.
The Reverend Thomas Bradley.

588
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:12,630
- Tell me about your father.
- My father?

589
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:16,399
He's a very admirable man.
He's very principled.

590
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:19,835
I don't suppose you know
what The Grange Movement is.

591
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:21,811
Do you? No, of course not.

592
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,144
He's a socialist.

593
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:26,748
- You know what that is, right?
- Really?

594
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:30,879
Every Russian and Polish Jew
in Palestine is a socialist.

595
00:48:30,956 --> 00:48:34,983
- Yeah, well, not your family.
- Good heavens, no.

596
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,689
To share everything and be poor together,
this is madness.

597
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:45,161
Why were you bound to disappoint him?

598
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:47,028
Well, he...

599
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:54,336
Because my father believes
that God is just and merciful.

600
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:58,778
And that the world
can be remade in his image.

601
00:49:00,452 --> 00:49:01,942
And you don't?

602
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,750
I think God has a lot to answer for.

603
00:49:09,094 --> 00:49:12,461
And I don't think you can change the world.
Not much, anyway.

604
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:33,177
Well, this is the place.

605
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:37,053
Are you sure it's all right?

606
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:40,285
Well, you're the one who said
you couldn't go home looking like this.

607
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,124
The bath is completely private.
No one will disturb you. Not even me.

608
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,473
If you need anything, just holler.

609
00:52:17,315 --> 00:52:19,146
Don't be angry. Please.

610
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:30,461
- But I have to.
- I know. I know.

611
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:33,087
You have to get back home.

612
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:40,968
- You're angry.
- No, I'm not angry.

613
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:56,245
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

614
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,782
When?

615
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:03,992
After work.

616
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:10,526
Here?

617
00:53:20,378 --> 00:53:21,436
Yes.

618
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:37,294
- No!
- Wait. Hey.

619
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:38,386
No!

620
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:46,727
No!

621
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:58,911
What is this? What are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it!

622
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,951
Vandals! Hooligans!

623
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,451
Oh, my God! Lieutenant.

624
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:22,400
Is it true, child?
Tell your papa.

625
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,608
Speak up!

626
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:31,510
What were you doing in his room?

627
00:54:33,084 --> 00:54:35,143
How long has this been going on?

628
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:39,380
Oh, God! Why do this to me?

629
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:42,255
What did he do to you?

630
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,055
Answer me, bitch!

631
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:49,565
Stop me, or by God, I'll kill her!

632
00:54:51,836 --> 00:54:56,102
Where's the swine?
I'll tear his eyes out!

633
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:59,610
- Where's the assassin?
- Sarah, I beg you!

634
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:01,645
Tell them it's not true!

635
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:04,271
The son of a priest too.

636
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:05,644
A curse on him.

637
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:08,618
I'll fix him good! Just wait!

638
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,247
It's not true!
I don't believe it! It's impossible!

639
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:14,085
It's a mistake!

640
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:16,592
Tell them it's a mistake!

641
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:19,162
An American in a British uniform.

642
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,492
What can you expect?

643
00:55:24,168 --> 00:55:26,693
How far did you go?

644
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:28,136
Look at me!

645
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,707
Are you still pure?

646
00:55:30,775 --> 00:55:32,174
Have you slept with him?

647
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:34,267
Please, Mama, I love him!

648
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,143
Did you hear that?

649
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,655
She's lost! She's dishonoured!

650
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:46,986
My own daughter, a whore!

651
00:55:47,091 --> 00:55:49,821
She's without shame!

652
00:55:49,894 --> 00:55:51,862
Stop, woman!

653
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:55,490
I'll kill you!
I'll tear your heart out with my hands!

654
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:56,692
Enough, woman!

655
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:59,531
You call this love?

656
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:01,834
You've lost all sense of decency!

657
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:03,838
I'll root this "love"...

658
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:06,170
out of your body...

659
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:08,735
with a red-hot iron!

660
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:10,713
I'll teach you to behave...

661
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:12,975
like a prostitute!

662
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:22,058
You're no longer my daughter!
You're dead!

663
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:24,060
I'll never forgive you!

664
00:56:24,128 --> 00:56:26,062
You've ruined my life!

665
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:35,866
Have you all gone mad?

666
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,373
Why are you torturing her?

667
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:40,877
So what if she loves an American?

668
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:43,572
Why not stone her while you're at it?

669
00:56:43,648 --> 00:56:47,015
Shut up, idiot!
You just don't understand.

670
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:49,779
I understand you're a stool pigeon.

671
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:54,018
That's enough!
Go to your rooms, all of you!

672
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:56,922
You, woman, get your mother to bed!

673
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:06,436
I did nothing wrong, Father.

674
00:57:06,504 --> 00:57:08,995
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes, I do.

675
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:13,736
- I love him.
- You've already said that.

676
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:17,337
It's the truth. I can't help it.

677
00:57:18,683 --> 00:57:21,516
True love is marriage.

678
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:25,545
Could you be his wife?
Would he marry you?

679
00:57:25,623 --> 00:57:28,148
I don't know.

680
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:30,751
A man is made for one woman only...

681
00:57:30,862 --> 00:57:34,593
and to be the father of her children.

682
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:36,632
You hardly know him.

683
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:41,169
I know him with my heart.

684
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,639
I'm sure he's a good man.

685
00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:46,141
He's good-looking too.

686
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,237
A lover is always better-looking
than a husband.

687
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:52,714
Poor Nessim.

688
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:55,650
How can I marry Nessim?

689
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,484
He's like a brother to me.

690
00:57:58,556 --> 00:58:03,084
"Oh, if only you were
my own true brother...

691
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,821
then I would kiss you...

692
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:10,730
and no man would despise me."

693
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:13,597
The Song of Solomon.

694
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:16,037
You see, my little dove...

695
00:58:16,107 --> 00:58:19,338
true love means coming home...

696
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:21,707
to find him waiting for you.

697
00:58:21,879 --> 00:58:24,507
He takes your hand, talks to you...

698
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:26,606
gives you strength.

699
00:58:26,684 --> 00:58:29,414
Young women are lead to believe...

700
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,648
that love is pure spring water...

701
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:36,090
and marriage a sewer.

702
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:40,958
Papa, I'm so tired.

703
00:58:41,032 --> 00:58:43,865
I can't think any more.

704
00:58:46,003 --> 00:58:48,369
All I want to do is sleep.

705
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:49,732
What are they gonna do to her?

706
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:52,367
Those guys
did a really professional job on you.

707
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:53,933
There's hardly a mark.

708
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:55,979
- Don't you think you should see a doctor?
- No!

709
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,914
Victoria, I've asked you three times now.
What are they gonna do to her?

710
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:01,713
And I've told you. They'll scream a lot.

711
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:05,620
- And maybe beat her up a bit.
- Beat her up?

712
00:59:06,057 --> 00:59:08,787
David, you don't understand these things.

713
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,192
They will be very, very angry.
So, maybe give her a few slaps.

714
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,823
But they'd never injure her.
They really do love her.

715
00:59:17,034 --> 00:59:20,094
Yeah, I could tell that by the way
they dragged her out of the room.

716
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:22,002
I know what her brothers think,
but they're wrong.

717
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:25,270
- If I could just go and explain to them...
- Oh, David, don't be an ass.

718
00:59:25,343 --> 00:59:26,571
It's bound to make it worse.

719
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:29,511
David, forget about doing anything
for a week.

720
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,480
- Maybe two.
- He doesn't have a week.

721
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,676
Why doesn't he have a week?

722
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:39,187
Because we're pulling out of Jerusalem
the day after tomorrow.

723
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:41,320
- Where to?
- Egypt.

724
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,826
- Oh, please, Peter, let me come with you.
- Darling, that's impossible.

725
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:50,130
Let me go to England to be with your family.

726
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:53,136
- There's a war on in England as well.
- I don't care.

727
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:55,365
I can't stay here alone with no more family.

728
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:57,430
Damn it,
I've told your bloody family I'll come back.

729
00:59:57,508 --> 01:00:00,477
Christ, I'm willing
to become a Jew tomorrow.

730
01:00:01,078 --> 01:00:02,340
Peter...

731
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,411
let me come to Egypt.

732
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:06,448
Or send me to England.

733
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,514
Or give me a divorce!

734
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:19,193
I think England is the answer
if you can arrange the transport.

735
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:22,255
Davey, can you imagine the sort of reception
she'll get there from my family?

736
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,324
What the hell were you planning on doing
after the war?

737
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:26,734
I was planning on being there with her.

738
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,534
Listen, why don't you stay here tonight...

739
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,942
in case the brothers decide
to pay you another visit.

740
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:36,138
Sure.

741
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:37,708
Thanks.

742
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:29,022
- Where are my clothes?
- You don't need clothes.

743
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:31,156
You're not going anywhere.

744
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:32,530
Who says so?

745
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:37,332
I say so. Your brothers say so.

746
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,839
I can't believe it!

747
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:42,675
Perhaps you'd like to go out naked.

748
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:46,215
Not that it would surprise me
if you did.

749
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,554
Who can that be?

750
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:34,494
Go and see, Clara.

751
01:02:49,346 --> 01:02:50,836
Hello, Clara.

752
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:54,448
- Who is it?
- It's him, Mother.

753
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:58,487
The American! He's at the door!

754
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:01,922
Just open the door!
I just wanna talk to Mr. Perrera.

755
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:05,655
No, he is not home! Go away! Go away!

756
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:09,559
Have you no shame?

757
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:12,261
You ruin my daughter
and you dare knock on our door! Go away!

758
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:15,600
Mrs. Perrera, it's not what you think.
Please let me just speak with Sarah.

759
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:18,539
- Go away before I call the police.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

760
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:21,406
Would you give this to her, then? Please?

761
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,108
No, no, you can't see Sarah.
My sons are close by.

762
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:29,708
Go away or they will come here and kill you!

763
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:32,949
Go! Go! Go! Get your brothers! Go!

764
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:37,088
- She's upstairs?
- Please, just go on.

765
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,957
Get them and my husband.

766
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,186
He's crazy, this one!

767
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:46,296
Sarah, just listen to me.
I have to leave in the morning.

768
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,360
But I'll be back. I promise you, I'll be back...

769
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:50,269
and then we'll straighten
this whole mess out.

770
01:03:58,048 --> 01:03:59,481
David!

771
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:02,379
Give me the key!

772
01:04:02,485 --> 01:04:04,419
Go back to your room at once!

773
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:09,118
David!

774
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:27,376
He's gone.

775
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,538
Who is it?

776
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:34,879
Mama, open the door.

777
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:45,924
What's going on?

778
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:49,361
Nothing.

779
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:21,124
What are you doing here?

780
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,923
Nothing.

781
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:27,162
Go to the kitchen.

782
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,429
Dinner is ready.

783
01:06:55,024 --> 01:06:58,221
- Quick, my clothes!
- I couldn't get to them.

784
01:07:00,997 --> 01:07:03,989
I got some clothes
from my girlfriend.

785
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,034
She's about your size.

786
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,071
I love you, brother!

787
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,605
Oh, Lieutenant!

788
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:49,909
I hope I did the right thing.

789
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:51,206
Lieutenant...

790
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:55,473
I took the liberty of letting the young lady
into your room.

791
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,021
You see, I couldn't have her in the lobby.
She had no shoes on!

792
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:19,074
I almost didn't come back here.

793
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:23,872
- I almost went out and got drunk instead.
- But you didn't.

794
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:32,918
They took my clothes.

795
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:37,120
- You walked here like that?
- I had to see you one last time.

796
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:40,462
- I must look...
- Adorable.

797
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:42,487
Damn it, why can't you look terrible?

798
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:43,896
I've been out walking the streets...

799
01:08:43,967 --> 01:08:45,901
trying to convince myself
I wasn't in love with you.

800
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:50,303
And I come back here
and you're barefoot and you're adorable.

801
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:57,245
Today was the worst day I've ever spent.
I think of not seeing you again.

802
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,071
Sarah, I love you...

803
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:02,447
I wanted to tell you last night,
when you were still here.

804
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:07,989
Are they really sending you back to the war?

805
01:09:08,358 --> 01:09:09,552
Egypt.

806
01:09:09,993 --> 01:09:11,187
But it's not that far away.

807
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,490
I'll come back as often as I can.
I'll write you every day.

808
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:15,793
- I'll dream of you every...
- No, don't.

809
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:17,229
What do you mean? What's wrong?

810
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,824
- Promise me.
- What? Anything!

811
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,198
Promise me you won't come back.

812
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:22,328
- What are you talking about?
- You said "anything."

813
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:23,736
Sarah, I just told you that I love you.

814
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:26,400
- I can't stay...
- Are you trying to drive me crazy?

815
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:28,239
Please, promise me!

816
01:09:30,235 --> 01:09:33,261
All right, if that's what you want, I promise.

817
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,002
Don't look so miserable.

818
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:45,115
I'm here and I can stay all night.

819
01:09:47,786 --> 01:09:50,516
If you really knew how much I love you.

820
01:10:25,957 --> 01:10:27,219
Sarah...

821
01:10:27,492 --> 01:10:29,119
No, don't say it.

822
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:32,395
- But, how do you know?
- I know.

823
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:37,525
Just a postcard.

824
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:40,196
When the war's over.
So you'll know I made it.

825
01:10:40,505 --> 01:10:44,032
I already know you will.
I don't need a postcard.

826
01:10:45,077 --> 01:10:47,136
But, after the war is over.

827
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,740
By then, you won't even remember.

828
01:10:53,718 --> 01:10:56,551
You're nuts, you know that?
You're just plain nuts!

829
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:01,983
- But you still love me anyway.
- Yes.

830
01:11:03,895 --> 01:11:05,157
Say it, then.

831
01:11:06,932 --> 01:11:08,297
I love you.

832
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:11,192
And, I love you.

833
01:11:14,506 --> 01:11:16,667
- Now, go to sleep.
- No.

834
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:17,935
- Yes.
- No.

835
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,243
- I can see you're sleepy.
- I'm afraid to.

836
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:24,975
- I'm afraid you'll slip away.
- Not without saying goodbye.

837
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,081
I promise.

838
01:11:27,853 --> 01:11:29,480
Now, go to sleep.

839
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:45,723
Sarah?

840
01:12:47,566 --> 01:12:49,659
Good morning, Uncle.

841
01:12:49,868 --> 01:12:52,894
What are you doing out so early?

842
01:12:53,038 --> 01:12:55,768
Has anything happened, God forbid?

843
01:12:56,007 --> 01:12:57,406
What is it, Saltiel?

844
01:12:57,509 --> 01:12:59,272
Nothing! It's Sarah.

845
01:12:59,344 --> 01:13:01,312
What Sarah?

846
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,970
Great heavens!

847
01:13:04,082 --> 01:13:08,041
Please, Auntie, Uncle,
I'm sorry to wake you up.

848
01:13:08,153 --> 01:13:12,283
- I'd like to see Nessim.
- At this ungodly hour?

849
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:15,893
What has happened to your shoes?

850
01:13:16,027 --> 01:13:17,995
Is Raphael so poor...

851
01:13:18,063 --> 01:13:21,294
that he can't buy you
a pair of shoes?

852
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:25,129
And what is this disguise?
You think it's Purim?

853
01:13:25,237 --> 01:13:28,673
Can't you see
the poor girl is upset?

854
01:13:31,543 --> 01:13:32,703
Sarah?

855
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:38,515
- What's going on?
- I must talk with you.

856
01:13:39,784 --> 01:13:42,719
Haven't you caused him
enough trouble?

857
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:44,149
Quiet, woman!

858
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:46,486
Make us some coffee.

859
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:49,583
Let's leave them alone.

860
01:13:49,694 --> 01:13:51,594
Go, go.

861
01:13:53,798 --> 01:13:56,961
I had to see it to believe it.

862
01:13:57,035 --> 01:13:59,663
What is the world coming to?

863
01:14:04,342 --> 01:14:06,401
What is it, Sarah?
Is it your mother? Did she...

864
01:14:06,478 --> 01:14:07,467
No.

865
01:14:09,814 --> 01:14:11,111
Sit down.

866
01:14:15,754 --> 01:14:19,656
I want you to answer me without thinking.
Would you marry me?

867
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:21,857
Marry you?

868
01:14:22,927 --> 01:14:25,452
- You want me to marry you?
- Yes.

869
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:32,399
- I'll gladly die for you, Sarah, you know that.
- I'm not asking you to die.

870
01:14:32,637 --> 01:14:33,729
Yes.

871
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:36,200
Yes, I'll marry you.

872
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:40,071
- Even after what happened?
- Nothing happened, Sarah.

873
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:42,477
Something did, and you know it.

874
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:46,442
All I know is that I love you.

875
01:14:51,656 --> 01:14:53,647
What if I don't love you?

876
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:55,457
You don't?

877
01:14:57,228 --> 01:14:59,093
Not even a little bit?

878
01:15:04,102 --> 01:15:07,833
So what if you don't love me?
It's not the end of the world.

879
01:15:08,506 --> 01:15:10,474
What is love, after all?

880
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:15,906
I'll be a good husband, Sarah.
And I'm sure you'll be a good wife.

881
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:19,476
I have enough love for the two of us.

882
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:23,721
You might, perhaps, one day.

883
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:26,855
Who knows?

884
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,784
Sarah?

885
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,494
Sarah?

886
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:19,303
Sarah?

887
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:20,861
- You all right, sir?
- Yeah. Baxter bought it.

888
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:22,694
- Bailed out?
- Burned.

889
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:41,609
Peter, what do you say?

890
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:44,916
I think you're mad.

891
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:47,884
You'll be spending two days
out of three days traveling...

892
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,550
just to spend one day in Jerusalem.

893
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:52,322
Why don't we spend three days
on the beach at Alexandria?

894
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:55,490
Because, you've got a wife in Jerusalem,
to start with.

895
01:18:55,566 --> 01:18:59,400
Actually, as it happens, I haven't.
Or, not for long, anyway.

896
01:18:59,703 --> 01:19:01,534
Vicky and I are gonna pack it in, David.

897
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:03,630
Her father's arranged
some kind of bogus annulment...

898
01:19:03,707 --> 01:19:06,699
she's gonna go back to her family
and I'm gonna be a happy bachelor again.

899
01:19:06,777 --> 01:19:08,870
You just gonna sit there
and let that happen?

900
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:10,937
I'm rather surprised
to hear this coming from you, David.

901
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:13,414
You were the one that told me
marriage was crazy and selfish.

902
01:19:13,484 --> 01:19:15,918
I think you're taking this awfully easy, Peter.

903
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:18,546
Believe me,
nothing between Victoria and me...

904
01:19:18,622 --> 01:19:19,816
has been easy, David.

905
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,484
I think you're feeling more down about this
than you're letting on.

906
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:23,821
And I really want to see Sarah.

907
01:19:23,894 --> 01:19:25,987
And if we're going off to Burma
like everyone is saying...

908
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:28,896
this may be the last chance I'll have
in a long, long while.

909
01:19:28,966 --> 01:19:32,424
You're absolutely sure, are you,
that Sarah wants to see you?

910
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:35,902
And just what makes you say that?

911
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:39,374
This might be the last chance we get
in a long while to have some fun, David.

912
01:19:39,443 --> 01:19:41,502
If you're not sure, then why waste the time?

913
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:44,138
Peter, I'm going back to Jerusalem.

914
01:19:44,214 --> 01:19:46,205
What if I were to order you not to go
on the basis...

915
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:48,843
of three days not being long enough
to make it there and back?

916
01:19:48,919 --> 01:19:51,717
Then I'd probably tell you to go to hell.

917
01:19:52,923 --> 01:19:54,891
What is with you, Peter?

918
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:58,125
Sarah's getting married, David.

919
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:02,163
Victoria wrote to me about it.
She didn't give many details.

920
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:06,066
Not even what the man's name is.
But you're welcome to read the letter.

921
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,690
Isn't it beautiful?

922
01:20:33,764 --> 01:20:35,732
Gorgeous.

923
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:38,427
I'm so happy for you.

924
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:41,367
- Where's the veil?
- It's ready.

925
01:20:41,438 --> 01:20:43,338
Let's have a look.

926
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,347
You look lovely, child.

927
01:21:05,062 --> 01:21:06,586
What day is it?

928
01:21:06,663 --> 01:21:09,689
It's only Tuesday.

929
01:21:09,766 --> 01:21:11,859
Why isn't it Thursday?

930
01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:13,799
Are you in a hurry?

931
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:18,473
No second thoughts?

932
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:20,543
Why should I have second thoughts?

933
01:21:20,711 --> 01:21:23,145
It's not for me to say.

934
01:21:23,247 --> 01:21:25,772
This was my own decision.

935
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:28,340
If you feel you're making a mistake...

936
01:21:28,418 --> 01:21:33,117
better to admit it now
than to ruin the rest of your life.

937
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:35,555
I'm not making a mistake.

938
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:45,134
I'm only drowning.

939
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:21,690
Wait, please.

940
01:23:22,599 --> 01:23:24,499
Wait a minute. Please.

941
01:23:50,594 --> 01:23:53,028
- Leave it be. Can't you, David?
- No, I can't.

942
01:23:53,096 --> 01:23:55,462
You think it would make any difference
whether you see her or not?

943
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:56,897
I don't know what I think anymore!

944
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:58,662
But I do know
that she's not marrying Nessim...

945
01:23:58,735 --> 01:23:59,724
of her own free will!

946
01:23:59,803 --> 01:24:00,895
You are wrong, David.

947
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:03,838
Her family would do anything to stop her
from marrying a Gentile.

948
01:24:03,907 --> 01:24:06,341
But they'd never force her to marry someone
she doesn't want!

949
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:10,870
No! No! You're wrong! It's not possible.

950
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:12,244
She cannot marry Nessim!

951
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:14,613
- She doesn't love Nessim!
- So what?

952
01:24:14,685 --> 01:24:18,485
Love's so wonderful?
It makes you so happy or me or Peter?

953
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:21,817
She is going to marry Nessim.
You can't stop it.

954
01:24:22,325 --> 01:24:24,259
I'm not here to stop it.

955
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:26,318
But I do want to talk to her.
I want her to explain.

956
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:28,489
God damn it, she owes me that!

957
01:24:28,565 --> 01:24:31,864
Look, this isn't your problem, Victoria.
It's mine.

958
01:24:33,904 --> 01:24:35,337
David, wait.

959
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,706
He only wants to talk to you.

960
01:24:37,774 --> 01:24:39,401
- No, I can't!
- Why?

961
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:42,070
He promised he'd go away
and never come back!

962
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:43,305
I don't understand.

963
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,610
- It doesn't matter.
- He loves you.

964
01:24:45,682 --> 01:24:47,673
No, I don't want to hear.

965
01:24:49,853 --> 01:24:53,846
He's at a café down the street.
We can pretend to take a walk.

966
01:24:53,924 --> 01:24:54,982
No.

967
01:24:55,392 --> 01:25:00,022
- Sarah, he only wants to understand!
- I don't care what he wants! I hate him!

968
01:25:00,097 --> 01:25:01,758
You can tell him that!

969
01:25:02,299 --> 01:25:03,630
No, don't.

970
01:25:05,302 --> 01:25:07,497
Tell him there is nothing to understand.

971
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:10,734
Tell him to forget me
like he forgot his promise.

972
01:25:12,843 --> 01:25:15,437
If she changes her mind,
she knows where to find you.

973
01:25:15,512 --> 01:25:19,778
Jesus Christ. What am I doing here anyway?
I should've just stayed in Alexandria.

974
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:22,944
I should've gone to the beach.
Should've drowned myself.

975
01:25:43,857 --> 01:25:48,351
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe Sarah isn't really so special.

976
01:25:48,428 --> 01:25:50,988
Maybe she's just peculiar.
What do you think?

977
01:25:51,064 --> 01:25:54,966
I think if it helps you to think that,
then you should think it.

978
01:25:56,503 --> 01:25:58,300
You haven't said a word about how Peter is.

979
01:25:58,372 --> 01:26:00,465
- You didn't ask.
- How is he?

980
01:26:01,108 --> 01:26:05,101
- He's like you, I guess.
- Good. I don't like suffering alone.

981
01:26:05,178 --> 01:26:09,376
Well, D. H. Lawrence said
that all love has to offer us is pain.

982
01:26:09,449 --> 01:26:11,440
Let's not talk sad, David.

983
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:16,018
No, let's not. Let's have another.

984
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:33,098
- She knows that I'm leaving at 6:00?
- She knows.

985
01:26:38,345 --> 01:26:39,903
She won't come.

986
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:44,172
Even as a child...

987
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:46,617
you always knew
the right thing to do.

988
01:26:46,753 --> 01:26:50,655
It made me proud of you.

989
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:54,318
Now I'm not so sure.

990
01:26:54,394 --> 01:26:56,624
I saw the American with Victoria.

991
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:00,163
Did you meet with him?

992
01:27:00,267 --> 01:27:04,067
No, I swear I didn't.

993
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:08,938
Is he the reason
you're rushing to marry Nessim?

994
01:27:09,009 --> 01:27:10,909
I'm not rushing.

995
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:14,372
Yes, you are.

996
01:27:14,514 --> 01:27:17,745
No one is forcing you into it.

997
01:27:17,818 --> 01:27:19,752
Why didn't you come to me?

998
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,655
I would have said nothing about
whatever might have already happened.

999
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:29,251
Only that I mustn't see David any more.

1000
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:31,387
Yes, I would have insisted on it.

1001
01:27:31,465 --> 01:27:34,298
But I wouldn't have forced you
to marry Nessim.

1002
01:27:38,305 --> 01:27:40,739
Nessim loves me.

1003
01:27:40,841 --> 01:27:43,207
And he's such a good man.

1004
01:27:45,078 --> 01:27:46,602
Papa, help me.

1005
01:27:47,881 --> 01:27:50,315
I feel like I'm drowning.

1006
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:55,551
Suffering has no use.

1007
01:27:55,655 --> 01:27:58,123
No use at all.

1008
01:27:59,559 --> 01:28:02,551
You must understand one thing.

1009
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:05,597
If you choose the American...

1010
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:07,428
I cannot help you.

1011
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:10,436
You will be alone then...

1012
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:12,027
outside of the law...

1013
01:28:12,105 --> 01:28:14,266
outside of the family.

1014
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:17,776
You will no longer be my daughter.

1015
01:28:19,146 --> 01:28:20,807
No, this must be said...

1016
01:28:20,881 --> 01:28:23,645
and it must be understood!

1017
01:28:23,783 --> 01:28:27,583
Tell me that you understand.

1018
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:30,587
Yes, I understand.

1019
01:30:03,683 --> 01:30:05,583
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

1020
01:30:05,652 --> 01:30:07,847
- Where?
- To Atarot airport.

1021
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:10,412
He said he had to take a plane back
to Alexandria.

1022
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:14,620
- But you said he'd be here in the morning.
- He must've left earlier.

1023
01:30:14,694 --> 01:30:16,924
His plane takes off only at 6:00.

1024
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:49,348
David!

1025
01:32:02,235 --> 01:32:05,636
Look, I've realized
that I don't want an explanation.

1026
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,268
I don't have any.

1027
01:32:12,712 --> 01:32:14,145
Well, that's good.

1028
01:32:22,088 --> 01:32:23,521
That's good.

1029
01:32:24,657 --> 01:32:25,783
Fine.

1030
01:32:29,562 --> 01:32:33,225
Well, I'd like to stay and chat,
but I have to go catch a plane.

1031
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:51,211
You cannot marry anybody else.
Do you hear me? You can't!

1032
01:32:51,284 --> 01:32:52,717
No, I can't.

1033
01:32:56,689 --> 01:32:59,123
Don't say that unless you mean it!

1034
01:33:14,774 --> 01:33:16,366
I'll be here waiting for you.

1035
01:33:16,443 --> 01:33:19,435
I'll come back as soon as I can
from wherever it is they send me.

1036
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:23,243
Burma, Australia, Antarctica!
I wish I could tell you when.

1037
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,750
It doesn't matter when.

1038
01:33:26,119 --> 01:33:29,282
If it takes a hundred years, I'll be here.

1039
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:38,458
I know. You have to go.

1040
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:40,795
- I'll write you every day.
- I'll write you, too. But where?

1041
01:33:40,867 --> 01:33:43,062
I don't know.
I'll have to send that to you in my first letter.

1042
01:33:43,136 --> 01:33:45,400
What about you? Where will you live?
Do you need any money?

1043
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:48,407
Stop worrying about me. I'll be fine.
You take care of yourself.

1044
01:33:48,475 --> 01:33:52,206
Oh, don't worry. Nothing bad can happen.
Your grandmother promised.

1045
01:33:54,314 --> 01:33:56,748
- I have to...
- Go.

1046
01:33:56,816 --> 01:33:58,374
- Come with me to the field?
- Yes.

1047
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:00,510
Come on! Come on!
