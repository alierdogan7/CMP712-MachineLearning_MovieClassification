1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,140
Marge's gift shop.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,440
Marge? Molly blane.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,680
Monkey: marge? Molly blane.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,770
I remember you.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,730
Woman: what's up?

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,740
It's that old monkey
that you sold me.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,860
Monkey see,monkey say.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,920
I toy. I gave you that toy.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,630
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,490
Yeah,i accept
your apology.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,960
I got your mirror
right here.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,870
Mom... mom,can i have this?

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,140
Not now,honey.

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,830
Ok.

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,580
Please ring these up

16
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,140
And put 'em in a bag
so lissy won't see 'em.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,370
Hold on. Hold on,molly.
I've got tiffy here.

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,030
They're sending mack out
so frequently,

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,760
He wanted
to get a few gifts

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,300
And keep 'em
in the closet

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,290
So he could bring 'em back to
the girls when he came home.

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,790
Where'd they send him
this time?

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,180
Oh,that's nice. What?

24
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,990
Where are they
sending him this time?

25
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,560
Oh,they've got him
working

26
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,830
Down on something
in st. Louis.

27
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,810
Nangahar province afghanistan

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,490
Hello,welcome

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,110
A coffee large and sweet
for the commander

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,780
Now,who are you?

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,640
With your permission,sir

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,890
We are two businessmen

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,150
On the way to tirbiz

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,610
Sir,i am sure

35
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,490
Our papers are in order

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,790
I do myself the honor of paying

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,720
For the commander's drink

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,195
We've got uninvited guests.

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,760
You wanna wait
till they're gone,boss?

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,730
No. The plane
only gets one shot.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,830
We don't know where our
weapons dealer is headed next.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
We've got to go now.

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,650
Boy,find yourself something better to do

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,600
Block the alley
with the mule.

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,030
The commander can see
the label designator.

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,860
Let them know
the target vehicle's arriving.

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,360
Come on. Come on.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,640
Move,mule,move

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,230
Get that son-Of-A-Dog-Mule out of my way

50
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,040
You might want to reconsider
your tone of speech

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,960
Got it.

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,360
Target locked.
Firing missile.

53
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,360
Focus,guys.

54
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,570
Do not insult my mule

55
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,440
Here's a lesson for you

56
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,960
How do you like your precious mule now?

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,340
It's better than a show

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,460
Find those men

59
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,600
Look for them

60
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,790
Where are they?!

61
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,080
? The one for jen says,"i love you.

62
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll see you soon.
Love,daddy. "

63
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,380
And lissy's says,"what do you want
me to bring you back from the trip?

64
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,810
Love,daddy. "

65
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,080
What am i bringing her back
from my business trip?

66
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,250
A doll.

67
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,280
Mack. Tiffy.

68
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,800
Sorry to take him away so soon
when you just got him back.

69
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,990
No,you aren't,tom.

70
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,450
Nobody likes a liar.

71
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,110
Well,she could have
married a banker.

72
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,510
I didn't want a banker.
I wanted you.

73
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,810
I'll meet you in the cave
in 5 minutes

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,280
To go over orders.

75
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,380
Bye.

76
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,910
I love you.

77
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,910
What brings you
down here,colonel?

78
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Got a new man on the team.

79
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,180
He's out in the field
with jonas,

80
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,050
But his wife just arrived
ahead of him.

81
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,050
This kim brown?

82
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,210
Yes,ma'am.

83
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,480
We were waiting for
her over at molly's.

84
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,580
I got her a house
across the street.

85
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,910
Well,she's in
getting her gig basket.

86
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,310
You come pick her up?

87
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,150
Pocatello idaho

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,850
Ruthie.
Jonas.

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,110
How are you?

90
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,080
The place looks lovely.

91
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,210
I don't want you riling him
all up about coming back.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,310
Wouldn't think of it.

93
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,710
No,i know you wouldn't
think of it,

94
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,050
But you'd do it.

95
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,150
This here
is bob brown.

96
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,210
Ma'am.

97
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,150
How do you take
your coffee,bob?

98
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,410
Black,please,ma'am.

99
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
How's molly?

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,520
She specially asked me
to ask you to call her.

101
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,080
He's happy here,jonas.

102
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,810
You a married man,bob?

103
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes,ma'am,i am.

104
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,710
Fine institution,
marriage.

105
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I believe it even
mentions it in the bible.

106
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,110
Something in proverbs

107
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,580
About not coming between
a man and his wife.

108
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,630
Molly: i used to have
a little girl

109
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,850
That coincidentally
used to be your age,serena.

110
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,050
She's all grown now,
in college.

111
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,710
But do you know
what i did yesterday?

112
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,810
What?

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,180
I went through
her abandoned things,

114
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,580
Laid them out in her
old room,and later today

115
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,410
You can have your pick of
some of her outstanding toys.

116
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,380
Toys?

117
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,350
Any help you neád
- Hanging things,storing things.

118
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,610
That's sweet,but my husband's
about as handy as can be.

119
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,280
Then you're one lucky woman,

120
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,550
Because my husband can pound
sand with a plastic shovel.

121
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,380
Your husband's bob.

122
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,150
Who do i ask
for the date of his return?

123
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,650
The commander
will be with you soon.

124
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,610
Explain what he can.
Until then...

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,610
You two must be
traveled out.

126
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,780
How'd you like to
see you new home?

127
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,410
Our new home?

128
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,380
I got you a place
right on our street.

129
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,580
Are these the other
members of the unit?

130
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,250
They used to be.

131
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,350
Th're on deployment,
which means-

132
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,110
Bob did two tours in iraq.

133
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,010
I know what deployment is.

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,450
Where is he?
How can i contact him?

135
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,850
He's in idaho on a training
mission with my husband jonas.

136
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,380
||The commander's the only
one who can get ahold of him.

137
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,780
You know,i think i'd like
to talk to the commander now.

138
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,350
Ruthie: here you go.

139
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,350
Thank you,ma'am.

140
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,450
You have
lovely manners,bob.

141
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,750
My wife trained me.

142
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,180
How's she like the unit?

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,280
She just went down.

144
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,680
Bob's new to the unit.

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
Passed selection,
did induction training.

146
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,280
This is his
first time out.

147
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,510
We always sent
the new man out

148
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,730
To bird dog the team leader.

149
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,950
Yeah,put a goat
in the stall

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,580
To quiet
the young colt down.

151
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,980
Welcome to the unit,bob.

152
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,980
Thank you,sergeant.

153
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,710
Oh,just ron will do.

154
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,250
Welcome. And should your
friend the sergeant major

155
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,750
Try to lure my husband
back to boys town,

156
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,180
I hope you'll intercede
on my behalf.

157
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,210
Why shouldn't he
come back?

158
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,410
Because we've got
a new house,

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,050
Because he's making
a fine living,

160
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,850
Because they didn't appreciate
him when they had him,

161
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,110
An because he's doing better
than being paid 12.50 an hour

162
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,110
As a civilian contractor
building guns

163
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,250
For a fi||ional agency
of the government.

164
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,050
He'd be back with
his friends,ruthie.

165
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,510
What in the world,for real,

166
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,550
Are you boys doing up here?

167
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,910
We are on a top secret
mission in your fair state

168
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,780
Laying out a new course for extended
deployment with pack animals.

169
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,910
Mules.

170
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,910
You're kidding me.

171
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,010
Nope. Scout's honor.

172
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
We are to learn
to work with mules.

173
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,650
We had an incident
with one.

174
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,410
Sent us back
to first principles.

175
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Then you sign up your mules
and you leave me mine.

176
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,250
What we got here
is a u. S. Government issue

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,080
.22 caliber silenced
semi-Automatic weapon.

178
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,250
It just happened
to evaporate

179
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,980
From company stores
a few years back,

180
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,710
And which i have been
restoring for my personal use.

181
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,310
Thieves. All of them
disappeared.

182
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
That is correct. They did,

183
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,550
As fellows in the unit carried them
off home to deal with squirrels.

184
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,150
But our young friend here
came too late to that party,

185
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,780
And don't we think he ought
to have one,too?

186
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,180
This is for me?

187
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,680
May all your troubles
be small ones,son.

188
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,580
Mrs. Gerhardt. And you
must be mrs. Brown.

189
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,810
Colonel tom ryan.

190
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,610
No time to provide
anctual welcome.

191
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,110
Usually the family
readiness group...

192
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,380
Thank you,colonel.

193
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,450
They met me,and they
were most helpful.

194
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,810
Good. Now you know the
men are deployed as needed.

195
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,210
Tiffy here...

196
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,150
My mack's been out 4 times.

197
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,640
He comes in,colonel bounces him
back out like a ping-Pong ball.

198
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,350
Because he's needed.

199
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,970
- I understand that.
- Then-

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,550
My plan,colonel,which as
you know is within the regs,

201
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,150
For a family
of my husband's rank

202
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,050
To elect to live off base.

203
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,330
That's fine after
a period of adjustment,

204
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,290
Bu i find families do better
with some support early.

205
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,080
But my husband...
we agreed...

206
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,710
Mrs. Brown,i understand that
you're under considerable pressure-

207
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,550
No,i understand my husband's
just on training mission.

208
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,250
And who told you that,
please?

209
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,680
This is why
i'm here,colonel.

210
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,480
I need to get a message to him
regarding our living arrangement.

211
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,780
Who told you,please,that
he's on a training mission?

212
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,080
Molly was just explaining why
he wasn't here as expected.

213
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,850
Because-

214
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,210
Excuse me,
please,ladies.

215
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,610
You want to just take
a look at the place?

216
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,510
You know,some of your range
records are still standing.

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,080
That's because the guns
i set those records with

218
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,110
Have been mothballed.

219
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,550
Just a few of 'em.

220
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,710
Ron here went from being
the best shot in the unit

221
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,150
To the best gunsmith
in the world.

222
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,550
Ladies man to being
ladies maid.

223
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,350
Tv reporter: breaking news

Wyndam-Where is it?

229

What's your closest
airfield?

230
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,940
Forest service got

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,810

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,810

I need you to run someoys

Wait. Is the forest service
plane there?

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,810
We need that wheels up
and flight ready now.

247
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Well,yeah,a pilot would be good,
but a key in the ignition will suffice.

248
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,980
That's right.
Yeah,i'm looking at it,too.

249
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,310

Yes,you got it.

254
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,510
Might need the ammo
to go with that.

255
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,810
You don't wish it
anymore than i do.

256

Unit compound "the cave"

257
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,380
Nice work

258
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,010
We've got a medium-Sized
charter plane

259
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,250
Hijacked on a runway
in wyndam,idaho.

260
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,050
Blane and the new guy

261
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,050
They're en route
90 minutes out.

262
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,380
What do we know?

263
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,410
Hostiles are middle eastern.
Beyond that,nothing.

264
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,210
Most of our team
is out of country.

265
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,680
Remaining 50 unit members
are converging here.

266
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,550
Their 737 is leaving
in 30 minutes.

267
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,410
You two are leaving
on a biz jet immediately.

268
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,050
On the ground,
you'll hook up with jonas,

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,480
Gather intelligence.

270
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,410

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Posse comitatus
will be suspended

272
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,310
And you'll be given command
of the situation.

273
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,880
Yes,sir.

274
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,480
Suits in washington
wouldn't mind

275
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,980
Keeping one or two of these
guys alive for a little chat,

276
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,580
But do what you need to
to come home.

I take classes.

289
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,450
Off-Base is tough
in this market.

290
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,250
I work in real estate-

291
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,580

Well,ma'am,if

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,550
This is your address.

296
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,680
Well,base housing will
be down most rikki-Tik.

297
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,410
Before your main
shipment comes in,

298
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,210
Molly arranged
- You did do that,right?

299
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,780
We intend to live off-Base.

300
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,280
Well,molly arranged
a temporary-

301
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,810
Mattresses. They were short
bed frames,but i figured-

302
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,110
Wait,wait,wait,wait.

303
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,510
What is the 303rd
logistical studies group?

304
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,180
Wod you excuse us

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,150
What is the 303rd-

306
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,010
The 303rd logistical
studies unit

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,580
Is where
your husband works.

308
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,150
That is his cover.

309
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,810
It is your cover.

310
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,080
Other than that,
this unit has no name.

311
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,050
Other than that,
it doesn't exist.

312
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,710
You will live that cover

313
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,810
As if your husband's
life depended on it.

314
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,650
As believe me,
it does.

315
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,180
Every person who knows one
more piece of information

316
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,380
Is one more person who could
get our husbands killed.

317
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,580
You do not||ell
your mother,

318
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,380
||Ur best fr end,
your priest,

319
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,910

320
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,150
I need to talk to someone.

321
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,810
Would you like to talk
to the chaplain?

322
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,050
What denomination is he?

323
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,850
He is the unit chaplain.

324
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,750
He's your
denomination now.

325
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,780
Please take those boxes away.

326
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm not living here.

327
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,650
I'm free to live off-Base
if i choose.

328
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,080
Army regulations state-

329
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,450
You aren't in the army.

330
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,610
You're in the unit.

331
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,680
Pilot: 45 minutes out.

332
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,580

My wife and kid.

335
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,610
You put those pictures away,

336
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,210
You stand a better chance
of going home to them.

337
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,410
Jonas: delta blane.

338
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,180
Affirmative.

339
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,010
We've got a charter aircraft

340
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Being held by an unknown
number of hostiles.

341
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,380
Conf||ured for 125 passengers.

342
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,380
This is a short field
commercial jet.

343
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,250
One,two main cabin doors,
one rear air stairs.

344
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,750
One emergency hatch
for the pilot.

345
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,850
You with me?

346
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,980
You got any questions
about me,top?

347
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,610
You passed selection,
didn't you?

348
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,410
Well,then,i figure you're
gonna come back as a hero,h

349
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,850
Or as a real good anecdote.

350
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,150
Now,when i flip
the switch oh his back,

351
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,580
I want you
to say something,ok?

That's funny.

354
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,380
This used to be
my betsy's room.

355
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,110
Now that she's gone,i'm gonna
turn it into a sitting room.

00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,680
Do you thi your daddy

straight for me?

358
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,210
Of course.

359
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,380
They've got fans
in her house airing it out.

360
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,880
You're most welcome
|| stay here overnight.

Thank you. I've-
Serena,honey,come with me.

362
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,280
We'll just-I'm gonna take my
daughter and go to a motel.

363
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,810
She's already made quite an
impression on the colonel.

364
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,610
Listen to me. I know
this has been a shocn

365
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,910
This is neither
whr you expected or-

366
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,050
I'm not feeling well.
I need to lie down.

367
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,990
You can lie down here.

368
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,760
Someplace that's mine.

369
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,810
I'm not feeling well.

370
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,360
What appears to be a serious
hostage situation unfolding.

371
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,750
Idaho.

372
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,550
The 727,grounde||
behind me on the tarmac...

373
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,550
That's where your
husband and bob are.

374
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,180
Yes.

375
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,180
Authorities say
they have yet to make demands...

376
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,650
This is what they do.

377
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,980
Yes.

378
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,810
Will result
in immediate retaliation.

379
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,610
I'm receiving word right now

380
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,180
That there's some kind
of activity going on.

381
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,880
What we're seeing now is-

382
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,010
Oh,my god.
What we've just seen

383
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Is more gunfire. We've seen 3
national guardsmen were gun down.

384
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,410
I'm really
not feeling well.

385
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,150
Tiffy,ctil dr. Farris.

386
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,910
Right here
on live television,folks.

387
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,180
The attempt to assault
that airplane

388
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,060
Winds out of the north-

389
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,260
I don't care
where the wind is.

390
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,360
You have to come in
aft of that aircraft.

391
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,700
Put us down
in their blind spot.

392
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,100
Now,i will reportl
to the c. O. Of the guard unit.

393
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,700
You can "yes,sir" them
all day long,

394
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,060
But wherever i go,
you go.

395
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,860
Whatever i do,you do.
How you holding?

396
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,100
Finest kind.

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,030
You don't mind learning
on||he f,do you?

398
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,060
No,top,i do not.

399
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,530
Good.

400
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,130
Pack up that ammo.

401
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
I want you with 12 mags
for the mp-5.

402
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,030
8 for the pistol.

403
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,600
You can tuck that hushpuppy
in your brassier somewhere.

404
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,400
Coming up
aft of the aircraft.

405
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,060
Terrorists
shot the assault team.

406
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,160
What?

407
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,430
National guard sent out
an assault.

408
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,830
Team 3 approaching
plane from aft.

409
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,060
Net control,this is
||lu 6 x-Ray inbound.

410
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,760
I need conformation
your team of assaulters

411
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,430
Were approaching aft.

412
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,530
Making our approach.

413
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,900
Your team assaulters

414
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,830
Were approaching
from their blind spot.

415
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,260
Hijackers got a spotter.

416
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,100
They have to have a hotter.

417
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,300
3 men were shot ing the
blind spot of the plane.

418
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,830
There it is.
There it is.

419
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,560
Abort! Abort!
Bank left! Bank left now!

420
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,230
Take a bearing on that.

421
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,030
It'll bear 2-6-5 magnetic from
the midpoint of the airfield.

422
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,400
We are about
to eat a rocket.

423
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,460
Can you sideslip me
and put it on the road?

424
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,660
I didn't exactly faint,
but i felt-

425
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,760
Pregnant?

426
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,560
Congratulations.

427
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm pregnant?

428
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,530
Ho||about that?

429
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,830
Why did i feel-

430
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,730
Faint? Happens to a lot
of women in your condition.

431
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,100
It didn't with my first one.

432
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,560
Uh-Huh. Have you been under
a lot of stress lately?

433
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,560
My husband-

434
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,840
Her husband's a little late
getting back tg the base.

435
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,180
What's the punch line,bill?

436
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,160
Punch line's r&r.

437
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,260
You got a pretty good
group to take care of you.

438
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,610
Promise me you'll
let them do that.

439
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,800
I had a miscarriage befo||.

440
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,040
When?

441
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,950
Last year.

442
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,560
Are you sure everything's
all r||ht with this one?

443
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,100
You can do a couple of
tests,can't you,bill?

444
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,600
Put her mind at ease.

445
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,260
Of course.

446
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,120
Wyndam regional airport

447
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,400
Tv reporter: just moment||ago,
the body of one hostage

448
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,860
||Was unceremoniously thwn
out the passenger door.

449
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,960
It is becoming abundantly clea

450
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,830
That these terrorists
have a well conceived plan

451
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,940
To take the life
of one hostage every hour.

452
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,060
Update.

453
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,120
They just shot
another hostage.

454
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,400
Where's blane and brown?

455
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
Just arrived on scene.

456
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,570
Williams and grey?

457
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,530
20 minutes out. The rest of the
team's 20 minutes behind them.

458
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,460
And they're shoo||ng
a hostage every hour?

459
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,660

460

Eric?

461
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,160
Sir,we sucked up some radio
and they're speaking arabic.

462
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,500
What is he saying?
Can we hear it again?

463
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,260
Yes,sir. He's saying-
Wait. He's saying...

464
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,700
Yaalah halan.

465
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
What else?

466
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,260
Uh... the other fellow
iswaying...

467
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,360
Don't set it off until
the news trucks come.

468
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,600
They're suckering in
the first responders.

469
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,030
They're gonna shoot ||e
rescue plane out of the sky. ||

470
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,630
They get enough
on||okers on the ground,

471
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,900
Th||'re gonna
blow up the aircraft. ||

472
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,730
Give me a secure line
with blane.

473
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,100
After that,i'll need
to talk to washington.

474
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,500
Tv reporter: the passengers
are part of a trade delegation

475
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,930
G the western states
in an effort to promote

476
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,100
New european imports
to this country.

477
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,430
They could not have
anticipated...

478
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,330
Gentlemen,
as per my orders

479
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,860
You have no authorization until
your entire team is in place.

480
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,830
||I'm sure that authorization
is for||coming.

481
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,160
This ope||tion's under the
control of the bol|| asac.

482
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,500
As its representative,and on
behalf of the justice department-

483
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,700
Would you excuse me,please.

484
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,400
And on behalf of
the justice department,

485
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,630
I just want to advise you that
any further action on your part

486
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,000
Will be treated as a
violation of federal law.

487
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,860
Yes. We heard you.

488
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,760
We take down the plane,
he takes credit.

489
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,060
We get everyone killed,
he told us so,

490
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,360
We get court-Martialed.

491
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,400
So let's not get
everyone kil||d.

492
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,240
Most of the wives in the special
forces community have girls.

493
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,620
What does yours feel like?

494
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,140
The women
mostly have girls?

495
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,800
Why? No one knows.

496
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,720
No one knows.

497
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Oh,honey,we're gonna
spiritualize you

498
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,230
To all sorts of mysteries.

499
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
Tv reporter: authorities say
they have yet to||ake demands.

500
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,030
5 minutes out.

501
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,460
Saddle up.

502
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,760
Targets have spotters.

503
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,860
No quick drop.
We gotta haho.

504
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,260
What's our altitude?

505
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,460
30,000 feet.

506
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,330
Take it up to 35,please.

507
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Thank you.

508
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,200
Jonas: roger that. We're gonna
have to step things up a bit.

509
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,230
The bad guys,it seems,are
waiting for a full scale assault.

510
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,460
They want to lure more troops
and more media to the area.

511
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,900
They don't care about
the businessmen.

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,060
They want to kill
the first responders. Rs

513
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,900
They got some sort
of cute bomb on the plane.

514
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,760
And these chuckleheads
waiting for authorization

515
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,060
Are gonna get
a lot of people killed.

516
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,360
Now,we are gonna
take down this plane.

517
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,730
Yaalah halan.
||Say it.

518
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,960
Yaalah halan.

519
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,730
Meaning look out
or get ready.

520
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,460
It's what the lookout says when
assaulters approach the plane.

521
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,530
It's the spotter's signal to lower
the air stairs to repel an assault.

522
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
Say it again.

523
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,760
Yaalah halan.

524
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,100
My name is black,united
states special forces.

525
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Who can show me
a ranger tab?

526
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,700
Grab your beer,gentlemen.
Come with me.

527
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,560
You. You are now
spotter for the sniper.

528
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,660
You go with and will
answer to mr. White.

529
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,400
You two with your shotguns,
on my command,

530
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,500
We're gonnae
take down that plane.

531
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,800
Team,

532
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,460
You are to approach
from the north.

533
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,630
I count a minimum
of 3potters.

534
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,930
When you neutralize them,

535
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,130
You are to break squelch
3 times.

536
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
That is my signal
for standby.

537
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,360
When you've done that,
you will pick up their radio

538
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,330
And signal them yaalah halan.

539
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,460
Sergeant white,
||you're the sniper.

540
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,230
Sergeant,you're
under my command

541
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
And i'm ordering you
to stand down,

542
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,430
Awaiting further orders should
they be forthcoming. Is that clear?

543
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,030
Yes,sir.
It is clear.

544
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Angers,

545
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,900
Did you sign on
to get out gf the house?

546
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,400
Or do you want to come with me
and kick the door down?

547
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Take down the spotters.

548
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,560
3 clicks. Yaalah halan.

549
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,560
How's the world||
look to you?

550
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,200
Li||t and bright.

551
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,130
You've been training for
th|| moment your entire life.

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,500
The universe
has been conspiring,

553
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,800
If you think about it,to
put you right here right now.

554
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,160
Off you go. We're
all waiting on you.

555
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,910
||||Events on this airfield|||
appear to be unfolding

556
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
At a dramatic pace.

557
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,110
Ma doesn't let the
girls watch the neh.

558
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,780
Lissy: we're not allowed
to watch the news.

559
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,880
Mack says...

560
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,880
No truth in the news,

561
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,710
And no news in the truth.

562
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Yo|| second? Well,
you know what they s||:

563
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,580
2 times the kids,
10 times t|| work.

564
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,580
Are you excited?

565
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,680
Of course.

566
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,940
So what's it like here
on the base?

567
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,980
Well,it's like
it is anywhere.

568
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
The life is
what you make of it.

569
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,810
We've got the kids.
I've goti'ack me of the time.

570
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,840
And there's work. Maybe

571
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,310
But i teach school here

572
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,310
And,you know,

573
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,310
Molly sells real estate

574
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,510

What a|| you gonna do?

576
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,240
You said you wanted
to tak||some classes.

577
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,310
I,uh,i'm getting
my degree.

578
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,980
Well,there you go then.

579
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,280
I,uh...

580
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,580
I'd like
to call my sister.

581
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,940
Tell her the news.

582
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,410
Of course.

583
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,510
I... i...

584
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,740
No,i just almost fainted,
zazie,that's all.

585
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm fine,but-
No,no,no. The baby's fine.

586
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,180
||'S just the housing
situation's al||screwed up.

587
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,180
Bob's no||gonna be happy.
I'm not happy.

588
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,940
He's out on deployment.

589
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,140
Where? You wanna know where?
Just turn on your television.

590
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,940
Just turn it on.

591
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,410
You hang up that photh.

592
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,380
What would you do if a woman camominto
your home to harm your family? F

593
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
You hang up that phone.

594
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,280
Your unit is restricted
by the posse comitatus act

595
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,080
From||ny action until released
by the justice department,

596
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,340
Which will be when your
compl||e team is on the ground.

597
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,040
By then,another hostage
or two will be dead.

598
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,320
Do i have to
place you in custody?

599
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,280
Sir,that won't be necessary.

600
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,820
So you're stepping down?

601
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,280
That won't
be necessary either.

602
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,210
Nobody shoot.
They're friendlies.

603
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,880
Who the hell are they?

604
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,610
That's black
and that's white.

605
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,340
I thought those
we|| your names.

606
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,340
They're our brothers.

607
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,780
Where you going
in the middle of the night?

608
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,410
Running away?

609
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,980
I'm not running awayin put
that down,sweetie. Our seat.

610
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm going
to my sister's

611
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,240
Because i need her help.

612
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,310
I mean,y'all been
real nice to me,

613
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,140
But i need
my family and-

614
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,410
We'r||your family.

615
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,610
Don't tell me
you're my fa||ly now,

616
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,140
||Cause my husband
gets shot in idaho||

617
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,180
||D in 90 days
i'm off the base

618
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
And you can't
remember my name.

619
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
So if you'll excuse me-

620
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,180
I swear,if you walk out,that's the
end of your marriage. Your husband-

621
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,810
They'll send him back
to the cav.

622
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,410
And do you know what he'll
think every tim he looks at you?

623
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,690
E woman who ruined his dream.

624
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,900
Do you know how hard it was
for him to get here?

625
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,080
You're willing
to throw that away?

626
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,380
You said you love him.

627
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,350
Now,are you brave enough
to act on it?

628
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,400
Here you are||

629
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,970
Pretty little girl,
a ||ne daughter,

630
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,570
A child on the way,||
a man in combat.

631
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,870
You're frightened
and you want him home.

632
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,860
This is not your own
special circumstance.

633
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,640
You know what this is?

634
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,220
It is the history
world.

635
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,930
You want to think
about that for a moment.

636
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,810
T

637
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,540
That's the signal.

638
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,710
Hey,mort.

639
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,910
Sergeant,where
do you think you're going?

640
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,310
I'm gonna take down
that plane||

641
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,280
And i've got my
best man in the ||ods.

642
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,010
If you give me up,

643
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,440
He will come down afterwards
and shoot you dead.

644
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,740
You,you,and you,

645
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,410
Panic. The rest of you
come with me.

646
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,030
Yaalah halan.

647
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,490
Nobody move.

648
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,390
Nobody move.

649
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,760
It's all over.

650
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,990
This is the united states army.

651
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,930
Put your hands on your head
and get out of this plane.

652
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,060
Proceed pr the stairs
toward the vehiclesic

653
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,960
With your hands on your head.
Get off this plane!

654
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,030
Get off this plane!
Get off this plane!

655
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,460
Keep it moving!
Let's go!

656
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,190
Le||s go!
Keep it moving!

657
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,690
Hurry up! Hurry up!

658
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,260
Let's go! Hurry up!||

659
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,290
Get off this plane now!

660
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,790
We're clear here.

661
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,690
I'm just gonna pluck
the detonator out.

662
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,070
Tell the first responders to
stand clear of the aircraft

663
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,660
For the next minute or so.

664
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,690
Coming out.

665
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,420
Tv reporter: what an ordeal for
every member of this tr||e delegation.

666
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,880
Within a matter of hou||,they finally
find themselves ||ee of ruthless terrorists

667
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,520
With a mission to kill.

668
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,090
Some observers say
it is remarkable,

669
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,680
Perhaps miraculous,
that only 3 hostages-

670
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,560
Where's our 737
with the rest of the team?

671
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,790
Still half an hour out.

672
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,090
As far as washington's
concerned,

673
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,230
This was one hell of an
operatioop by the national guard.

674
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,530
Yes,sir.

675
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,180
They have witnessed
what can only be described

676
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,690
As one horrific day

677
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,110
For a group of visiting
businessmen and women.

678
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,560
And it||ppears,
as you can see behind me,||

679
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,960
That all the hostages
are safe.

680
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,920
It's not much
to look at,

681
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,710
But it's ours.

682
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,430
You kidding? Get to shoot
guns,jump out of airplanes,

683
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,830
Come home to your family.
That's damn near perfect.

684
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,730
This is my house here,

685
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,990
Which means
that's your house there.

686
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,160
I don't even
have a key.

687
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,590
2kd||

688
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,890
Welldone.

689
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,490
Tv reporter: the reaction of the
fbi was,in the president's words,

690
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,130
A perfect example of coordinated
interagency cooperation.

691
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,330
How'd you know
i was comi|| home?

692
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,290
I figured they'd
have you back for debriefing.

693
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,630
How are things
at the office?

694
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,360
About the same as usual.

695
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,090
That's nice.

696
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,790
Trash needs
to be taken out.

697
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,030
Mm-Hmm.

698
