[Children screaming]

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Oh, no!

4
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,659
What is happening here?

5
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,956
Who is making
that abominable noise?

6
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:44,832
I'm sorry, Monsieur,
we have struck a child, I believe.

7
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,300
The child, Monsieur le Marquis,
is dead.

8
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,215
The coach struck him.
This man is the father.

9
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,425
Really, it is extraordinary to me

10
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,396
that you people cannot
take care of yourselves.

11
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:00,971
Or your children.

12
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,189
Always in the way.

13
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,607
How do I know what injury
you may have done to my horses?

14
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,031
Here. Give him that!

15
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,954
Be brave, Gaspard.

16
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,081
It is better for the poor little one
to die so

17
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:20,701
than to live in times such as these.

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,253
He died quickly, without pain.

19
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,766
Could he have lived an hour
as happily.

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,209
Oh, you're a philosopher, Monsieur?

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,917
How do they call you?

22
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,304
Defarge.

23
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,464
Of what trade?

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,184
A vendor of wine.
That is my shop.

25
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:44,849
Well, philosopher and vendor of wine,
pick up that...

26
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,694
And spend it as you will.

27
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,741

35
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,975
<i>It was the epoch of incredulity.</i>

36
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,599
<i>It was the season of light.</i>

37
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,443
<i>It was the season of darkness.</i>

38
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,739

Royal George.

42
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,630
Thank you, sir.

43
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,444
Good morning to you, sir.

44
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,772
I am Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank.

45
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,525
I'm looking for a young lady,
Miss Lucie Manette.

46
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,026
- Can you tell me where...?
- There, sir.

47
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,027
I beg your pardon?

48
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,987
There, sir.

49
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,160
Directly behind you.

50
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,284
Taking a tea with her companion.

51
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,292
Miss Lucie?

52
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,834
Mr. Lorry.

53
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,924
Won't you sit down?

54
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,890
Thank you.

55
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:43,804
Um...

56
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:44,927
You know Miss Pross, don't you?

57
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,181
A pleasure, Ma'am.
As always.

58
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,027
What is this all about, Mr. Lorry?

59
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,159
The letter said
it was of the utmost importance.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,569
Quite true.

61
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,200
Although, I must confess it's such
an astounding revelation that I...

62
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:08,409
Indeed, I hardly know how to tell you.

63
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,081
Is it something so dreadful?

64
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,042
On the contrary, it's wonderful news.

65
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:14,166
You were too young to remember,
of course,

66
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,792
your father being thrown into prison.

67
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:21,014
At that time, any French nobleman
could imprison any French citizen

68
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:23,475
with no questions asked.

69
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,598
Does this concern my father's estate?

70
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,438
No, not his estate.

71
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,983
He left you enough to live comfortably,
as we both know...

72
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:34,728
Oh, Miss Lucie...

73
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,613
Courage, Mr. Lorry.

74
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,944
Your father, my dear child...

75
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,692
Your father has been found!

76
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,235
What?

77
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,278
Alive.

78
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,203
He was left to die in prison.
He did not die.

79
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,412
Where is he?

80
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,083
He's been taken to the house
of an old servant of his, in Paris.

81
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:54,126
A man by the name of Defarge.

82
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,171
It is in this house above a wine shop
that we can find him.

83
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:01,763
Will you be able to leave with me
on the packet boat tomorrow?

84
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,213
Oh, Miss Lucie.

85
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,466
Oh, dear heavens.
Look what you've done.

86
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,890
Did you have to frighten the child
to death?

87
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:10,763
What sort of a banker are you?

88
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,016
Fetch the vinegar!

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,826

90
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,759
Gaspard!

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,012
What are you doing?

92
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,637
Do you want to go
to the mad hospital?

93
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,060
Move on!

94
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,994
The wine's outside.

95
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,413
There was an accident.

96
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,961
Did you hear me?

97
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,711
They are here.

98
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,760
Monsieur Lorry?

99
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:28,758
Indeed.

100
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,807
The lodging you wish to see
is on the second floor,

101
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,726
if you will come with me.

102
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,584
Is he alone?

103
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,625
Alone.

104
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,594
God help them, sir.
Who should be with him?

105
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,004
Is the door locked?

106
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,422
Always.

107
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,423
Why?

108
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,507
Why?

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,769
Because he's lived so long
locked up alone in prison

110
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,359
that he would rave and tear himself
to pieces if this door were left open.

111
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,614
Doctor?

112
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,874
Good day, Dr. Manette.

113
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,159
Still hard at work, I see.

114
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,704
Yes, I am working.

115
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,709
May I let in a little more light, Doctor?

116
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,926
Doctor?

117
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,270
You have visitors.

118
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,932
What?

119
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,856
What is that?

120
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,566
There is someone here to see you.

121
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,115
Tell this gentleman
what kind of shoes you make.

122
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,401
Shoes?

123
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,872
Can you describe the shoes
for this gentleman?

124
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,035
They are ladies' shoes.

125
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,455
And the maker's name?

126
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,708
Name?

127
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,710
You ask my name?

128
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,805
Yes.

129
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,057
One hundred and five north tower.

130
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,471
Sir?

131
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,270
Do you not remember me?

132
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,883
You.

133
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,213
Yes.

134
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,304
You are the jailer's daughter?

135
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,304
No.

136
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,916
Who are you?

137
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,348
I don't...

138
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:02,349
I don't...

139
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,648
What?

140
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,166
In the sun...

141
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,746
it is the same.

142
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,841
How can this be?

143
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,509
It's so long ago
when they came to take me away.

144
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,300
We held each other...
My little girl, she was in my arms.

145
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,844
And when I arrived in prison,

146
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,566
I found these on my sleeve,
and I've...

147
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,103
I've... kept them ever since.

148
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,443
How is this?

149
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,900
Was it you?

150
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,901
Oh, please.

151
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,790
It cannot be.

152
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,118
We've come to take you away with us.

153
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,370
We've come to help you.

154
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,789
Please trust us, my dear.

155
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,258
Please trust me.

Oh, my clear, please trust me.

00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,424
Thank God I have found you...

158
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,725
I have found you again.

160
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,690
My tools.

161
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,690
What?

162
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,612
What's that?

163
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,153
He wants his tools to make the shoes.

164
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:39,528
- Ah...
- One moment, Doctor.

165
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,621
I shall be right back.

166
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,036
Shall we, Doctor?

167
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,713
What is that?

168
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,673
Some writings of his.

169
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,008
A diary, perhaps.

170
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,134
I'll put it in with his tools.

171
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,307
FIE?

172
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,691
Give it to me.

173
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,647
We shall keep it here.

174
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,269
Why?

175
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,568
To read, you fool.

176
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,066
Godspeed.

177
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,115

Excuse me, Monseigneur,
but your nephew is here to see you.

Be quick about it. I'm busy.

I'm here to say good-bye.

183

00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,708
Dogs?

189
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,961
You're shooting pigeon.
Who fetches them?

190
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:26,935
[Thunder] Oh, yes, well,
I really don't care much for pigeon.

191
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,187
I would be hard-pressed
to think of anything in this world

192
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,680
you do care for.

193
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,350
- Except yourself.
- Yes, perhaps.

194
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,149
Really, that's quite true.

195
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,068
It is no wonder the family
is looked on with nothing

196
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,862
but thoughts of fear and slavery.

197
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,026
That I take to be a compliment.

198
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,279
Get away! Get away!

199
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,540
Let me tell you, my dear nephew...

200
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:54,619
[Thunder] Fear and slavery
keep the scum obedient.

201
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,706
As long as the roof shuts out the sky.

202
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,459
That may not be as long
as you would suppose.

203
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,671
The tide is turning.
There's a new philosophy in the air.

204
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,592
The people are going to rise up
in righteous vengeance.

205
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,346
Well, I shall continue to uphold
the honor of our family,

206
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,642
even if you will not.

207
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:16,484
Honor?
You can speak of honor?

208
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,775
Sir, we have done wrong,

209
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,905
and we are about to reap
the fruits of that wrong.

210
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,900
Never.

211
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,069
In any case, I shan't be here to see it.

212
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,825
[Thunder]
France is your natural destiny.

213
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,789
Accept it or be lost.

214
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,704
I regret to say that France
is already lost to me now.

215
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,999
A wilderness of misery and ruin.

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,219
I'm going to live elsewhere.

217
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,712
By what means?

218
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,131
By my own labor.

219
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,009
Really?

220
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,343
Where?

221
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,220
England.

222
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,142
I daresay if I stay here any longer,

223
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:57,858
you might contrive to have me
put in prison.

224
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:01,070
Indeed.
Would that I still had the power.

225
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,524
Good-bye, Monseigneur.

226
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,368
I hope never to see you again.

227
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,237
[Thunder]

228
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,168
Be careful, Charles.

229
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,090
They're not fond of spies in England,
you know.

230
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,099
Monsieur...

231
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,726
Monsieur.

232
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,146
I beg you, take me with you
to England.

233
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,694
I can't work here any longer, with him.

234
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,738
And if the people rise up
against the family...

235
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,737
My dear Gabelle,
you're perfectly safe here.

236
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,489
You're a servant,
not a member of the family.

237
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,618
But I've served the family for so long.

238
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,249
Indeed, you have, my good friend.

239
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,955
For as long as I can remember.

240
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,802
But, you see, I'm no longer
in any position to keep a servant.

241
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,089
I must try to make a living for myself.

242
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,016
I am sorry, Gabelle.

243
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,477
But you have my promise...

244
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:19,565
My sacred promise,
that no harm will ever come to you.

245
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,860
Good-bye, my good friend.

246
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,150
[Birds chirping]

247
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,906
It's just a few steps, Father.

248
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,700
There's a packet boat waiting.

249
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,197
I feel so tired.

250
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,198
Mr. Lorry!

251
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,372
Miss Pross!

252
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,964
May I be of any help?

253
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,878
Monsieur, thank you.

254
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,759
My father, he's been very ill, and he...

255
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,224
Come. Allow me, please.

256
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,306
Ah, there you are.

257
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,850
I've taken Miss Pross safely aboard.

258
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,024
Mr. Lorry, I'd like to introduce...

259
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,646
Darnay. Charles Darnay.

260
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,647
Your servant, sir.

261
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,363
If I can be of any further assistance,
please call upon me.

262
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,859
- Oh...
- Here, let me take him.

263
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,985
You're so kind, Monsieur.
Thank you.

264
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,408
Come along, Doctor.

265
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,783
Come on, you can trust me.

266
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,619
Turn around. That's it.

267
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
Right, one foot up.

268
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,541
Yes, that's it.

269
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,590
One step at a time.

270
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,295
Very good, Doctor, yes.

271
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,507
Mr. Darnay, you're so very kind.
Thank you.

272
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,478
If I can be of any further assist...

273
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,440
Good evening.

CREWMAN: All ashore, please!

276
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,057
With these papers,
I relinquish all of my property

277
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,675
and my titles here in France.

278
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,725
We shall see that they are delivered
to the proper authorities, Monsieur.

279
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,265
Godspeed, and a safe journey.

280

Here we are, sir.

284

[Bell rings]
Thank you, Jerry.

285
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,099
I'm not looking forward to this.
It's a sad business.

286
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,345
It is, sir.

287
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,554
Mmh...

288
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,394
- All right?
- All set now, sir.

289
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,061
- Thank you.
- Got the carriage outside.

290
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:51,902
- All right, thank you.
- Right, sir.

291
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,363
What's going on, Jerry?
Where are you off to?

292
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:58,608
The Old Bailey.

293
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,610
Trial for treason...
You know what that means, don't you?

294
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,988
They'll hang him up,
slice him down,

295
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,738
burn up his insides
and chop off his head.

296
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,787
You mean, if they find him guilty.

297
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:10,459
Oh, they will.
They always find 'em guilty.

298

[Courtroom crowd chatter]

299
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:41,109
The prisoner is charged with being
a traitor to our Lord the King,

300
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,533
by reason of his having assisted
the French King Louis

301
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:47,079
in his wars against England
in North America.

George Washington,

305
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,718
in his hopeless struggle
against our noble countrymen.

306
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:06,175
Your Lordship, I will prove to this court
that this man, Charles Darnay,

307
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,554
is a contemptible spy!

308
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:15,768
The prisoner has been passing
and repassing from France to England

309
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,866
on secret business of which
he can give no good account.

- Get hold of yourself!
- Late night.

313
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:31,161
Sorry.

314
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,958
I have witnesses
in this courtroom today

315
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:42,847
who saw the prisoner on a trip
from France nine months ago.

316
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,300
It is my information
that they saw the prisoner confer

317
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:52,728
with fellow conspirators
on a packet out of Le Havre.

318
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,568
I propose to call
one of these witnesses at this time.

319
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,062
Dr. Manette.

320
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,703
Dr. Manette.

321
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,752
Can you identify the prisoner as your
fellow traveler, returning from France?

322
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:23,755
Unfortunately, I was recovering
from a long illness at the time.

323
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,303
My mind was a blank, you see,
for a long period.

324
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,843
And I can only thank
a gracious God now

325
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,685
for restoring my faculties once again.

326
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,938
Once again,
can you identify the prisoner?

327
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,598
No.

328
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,600
Were you traveling alone?

Mr. Jarvis Lorry and my daughter.

with two other men aboard the packet

between these men that night?

I saw papers.
I could not hear what was said.

- The prisoner...

The prisoner... Yes.

00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:49,299
He was very kind to me
and to my father, very considerate.

348
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:57,305
I do hope that nothing I say here today
will repay him by doing him any harm.

349
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,150
Now, you may not wish to testify
against the prisoner, Miss Manette,

350
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:03,362
but be that as it may,
is this the man you saw?

on secret information

to the two French gentlemen
on three different occasions.

You are absolutely certain that it was
the prisoner here, Charles Darnay,

who passed on this vital and important
government information

about our military strength
to these... these spies?

amplify your public-spirited gesture

364
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,746
even further by telling the court
in more detail about the events

365
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,086
which surrounded the passing

366
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:08,632
of this vitally important government
information that he...?

367
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,176
Yes, sir, I'd be delighted.

368
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,216
It was during the month of February,
when I had occasion to travel...

369
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,016
Well, what do you have,
my wicked fellow?

370
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:21,389
I'll have two crown,
if you don't mind please.

371
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,361
But, of course, the money first,
always.

372
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,238
He works for the French, him.

373
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,276
He's a paid informer.

374
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:37,407
Real name "Guillermin".

375
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:43,452
Spies for the French everywhere,
nasty reputation.

376
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,956
Just mention his real name, that's all.

377
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,712
You do that, and he'll suddenly forget
what he's here for.

378
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:52,008
Who paid him this time?

379
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,254
Who knows?

380
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,054
Someone in France, doesn't matter.

381
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:01,685
You want him to shut up,
mention his real name.

382
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,518
Then the papers were passed
between them,

383
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,396
the two Frenchmen disembarked,
and the prisoner went to his cabin,

384
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:11,069
where he stayed
for the rest of the journey.

385
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,945
I thank you for your testimony, sir,
and I wish to commend you now,

386
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:19,322
in this courtroom,
for the noble and patriotic duty

387
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,452
of coming forward
to identify this traitor.

388
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,121
Allowed the defense
will question the witness?

389
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,089
You may proceed.

390
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,714
What do you live upon, sir?

391
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Property.

392
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,177
What property?

393
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,352
I can't precisely remember where.

394
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,806
This information
that you say you saw passed on...

395
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,229
Did you actually read it?

396
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,070
Yes, sir, but I didn't study on it.

397
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,026
Marked secret, you know.

398
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,110
How much did you receive
to give this evidence today?

399
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,028
Nothing.

400
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,406
Nothing at all to lay a trap
for this prisoner?

401
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,616
No.

402
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,119
You swear to that?

403
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,630
I do.

404
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,591
M'lord, I have no further questions
for this witness.

405
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,720
Sir, just one moment, M'lord,
if I may?

406
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,225
If I may, sir?

407
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,232
I do have just one more question.

408
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,489
You tell this court
that you're absolutely certain

409
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,488
in your identification of this prisoner.

410
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,204
Yes, sir.

411
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,832
Have you ever seen anyone
who looked like the prisoner?

412
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,840
Not so much as I'd be mistaken.

413
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:58,423
I ask you then to look upon my learned
colleague here, Mr. Sydney Carton.

414
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,222
Would you stand next to the prisoner?

415
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,939
[Crowd reacting]

416
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,614
Would you lay aside your wig, sir?

417
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,874
[Gasps]

418
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,838
Are they not very much
like each other?

419
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,626
Look closely, sir.

420
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,553
Well, yes, there's a certain similarity.

421
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,181
But I'm not mistaken.

422
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,099
The man I saw on the wharf
was the prisoner, Charles Darnay.

423
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:55,688
I should like to probe your memory
a little further, Mr. Guillermin.

424
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,230
Yes.

425
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,447
Would you like a closer look perhaps,
Mr. Guillermin?

426
00:31:01,448 --> 00:31:03,444
The name of the witness is Barsad.

427
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,030
Oh, yes, yes, of course, forgive me.

428
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,031
Speak up, sir!

429
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:11,420
Do you remain certain
in your identification?

430
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,375
No.

431
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,293
Louder, please, sir.

432
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,138
I don't believe
the court heard your answer.

433
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,136
No.

434
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,518
No!
[Crowd reacting]

435
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,645
You can no longer identify the prisoner
as the man you saw, correct?

436
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,157
It could have been someone else,
correct?

437
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,988
- Correct.
- Thank you, sir.

438
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:49,333
I have not further questions
of this patriotic witness.

439
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,965
I don't understand
what happened to him.

440
00:31:56,966 --> 00:32:02,214
What happens to all men when their
past catches up to their present.

441
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,505
M'Lord.

442
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,971
The jury desires,
with your lordship's permission,

443
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:09,470
to retire and deliberate the verdict.

444
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,053
You may proceed.

445
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:30,072
If I may inquire Mr. Lorry, the young
lady seemed quite distressed.

446
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,040
How is she faring now?

447
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,625
She's recovering, thank you.

448
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,243
I'll tell the prisoner.

449
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,995
He seemed to be quite concerned
for her...

450
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,664
Or perhaps you might tell him
yourself.

451
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,874
Well, I...

452
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,096
Oh, well, of course, a respectable
bank gentleman, such as you...

453
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:49,344
It wouldn't do to be speaking
to the prisoner in public, would it?

454
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,690
Has the jury reached a verdict?

455
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,204
We have, M'lord.

456
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,257
We find the prisoner, Charles Darnay,
innocent of all charges.

457
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,502
[Crowd reacting]

458
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,050
Well, Mr. Darnay, I'm happy to have
brought you off with honor.

459
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,507
Indeed, sir.

460
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,508
You have saved my life.

461
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,801
Thank you, sir.

462
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,761
I did my best.

463
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,436
My congratulations, sir,
upon your vindication.

464
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:21,559
And you have my regret, good Doctor,

465
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,987
that I brought you
and your lovely daughter into this.

466
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,984
Thank you, Doctor.

467
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,531
Well, come along, my dear.

468
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,001
Good fortune to you, sir.

469
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,504
So, Mr. Lorry.

470
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,835
It seems that men of business
may now speak to Mr. Darnay.

471
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:47,585
Men of business
are not their own master, sir.

472
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,258
We must think of the house we serve
more than ourselves.

473
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:51,507
Don't be nettled, Mr. Lorry.

474
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,258
I am certainly not nettled!

475
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,636
And I am not certain what you have to
do with this matter at all!

476
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,934
As far as I can see,
it's none of your business!

477
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,939
Quite right.

478
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:00,894
I have no business.

479
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,147
It's a pity you haven't, sir,

480
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:04,190
because if you had,
you might leave us and attend to it!

481
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,524
God love you, sir, no I...

482
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,146
Then, perhaps you might realize

483
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,694
that business is a good
and respectable thing.

484
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,238
[Cane clicks on floor]

485
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,988
Mr. Darnay, I hope you've been
preserved for a prosperous life.

486
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:16,954
Good day to you, sir.

487
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:17,870
Good day.

488
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:19,459
Well, if you excuse me, gentlemen...

489
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,913
I have work to do.

490
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,839
It's a strange chance,
wouldn't you say?

491
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,509
I beg your pardon.

492
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,926
That you and I...

493
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,966
Two lookalikes...

494
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,682
should be thrown together
on such an occasion.

495
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,940
Frankly, I don't see
all that much resemblance, but...

496
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,692
I hardly feel part
of this world again, as yet.

497
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,898
Yes.

498
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,269
It's just a few moments ago

499
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,510
that you were pretty far advanced
on your way to another.

500
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,607
Come.

501
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,406
Let me show you to the nearest tavern.

502
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,779
Oh, do come along, Mr. Darnay.

503
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,370
I've done nothing
but dream of a good wine

504
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,585
while these numbskulls
were deliberating

505
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,999
which world you should belong to.

506
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,397
Drink up, Darnay.

507
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,315
Drink!

508
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,036
You may be grateful
to be among us again,

509
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:40,537
but as for myself,
I wish only to forget this world.

510
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:45,830
It has no good in it for me,
except perhaps this wine.

511
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:51,293
A toast.
Let us have a toast.

512
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,178
What toast would you have?

513
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,974
Wait, wait,
it's on the tip of my tongue.

514
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,802
It ought to be... It must be...

515
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,687
I swear it's there.

516
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,640
To Miss Manette.

517
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,643
Ah-ha-ha!

518
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,313
To Miss Manette.

519
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,322
[Glass breaks]

520
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:21,285
There's a fair young lady
to hand to a coach in the dark.

521
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,200
Yes.

522
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:29,374
Tell me, how does it feel
to be pitied by and wept for

523
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,998
by such an angel?

524
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,344
Is it worth being tried
for one's life?

525
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,550
Is it, Darnay?

526
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,425
Yes, I daresay it is.

527
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,595
I would even suggest
that an angel such as this

528
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,641
is worth giving up
a life of dissipation for.

529
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,851
Oh, dear, did I say that?

530
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,811
Well, I mean it, yes.

531
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,861
For this particular angel.
Oh, yes.

532
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,620
Another question.

533
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,824
The truth, sir.

534
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,494
Do you think I particularly like you?

535
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,539
Really, Mr. Carton, I have not
asked myself that question.

536
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,128
Ask it now.

537
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,799
You have acted as if you do,
but I doubt that you do.

538
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,934
Indeed, I doubt it, too.

539
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,267
But I begin to understand you.

540
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,691
Nevertheless, I want you to know
how grateful I am

541
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,902
for all that you and Mr. Stryver
have done for me.

542
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:40,619
Good.
Let's have a drink to that.

543
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,451
You'll forgive my saying so,
Mr. Carton,

544
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,615
but I think you have been
drinking too much.

545
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,034
You think, sir?

546
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,077
You know, sir.

547
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,539
I always drink too much.

548
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,710
In fact, I do nothing in moderation
except work. Correct?

549
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,344
If you say so, Mr. Carton.

550
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:04,518
Then, you shall also know
that I am a disappointed drudge, sir.

551
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:10,061
I care for no man on earth,
and no man cares for me.

552
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,979
That is much to be regretted.

553
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,067
You might have used
your talents better.

554
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,576
Maybe so, Mr. Darnay.

555
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,741
But don't be too confident.

556
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,202
You never know
what it may come to.

557
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,703
I bid you good night, sir.

558
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,766
Miss Pross!
Miss Pross, hurry!

559
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,147
[Knocking]

560
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,695
Come in.
Come in, please.

561
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,198
Lucie will be here in a moment.

562
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,026
I understand that you are doing
quite well now

563
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,911
as a tutor of the French language.

564
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,664
Yes. I've been most fortunate
in that respect,

565
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,622
and I expect to have a post soon
at the university.

566
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,168
What a lovely day, Mr. Darnay.

567
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,125
I'm so looking forward
to our drive in the country.

568
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:22,546
- No more than I.
- And I.

569
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,345
Yes, indeed, Miss Pross.
What would I do without you?

570
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,601
You shan't, I promise you.

571
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,647
Enjoy yourselves.

572
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,316
We're going for a stroll, Miss Pross.

573
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,950
May I ask you, sir,
to remain where I can see you?

574
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,615
Of course, Miss Pross.

575
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,342
Good evening, Monseigneur.

576
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,887
- You think I'm drunk, don't you?
- No, Monseigneur.

577
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,023
Ah, let go of me.

578
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,193
[Drunken mumbling]

579
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,820
[Horse neighing]

580
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:31,363
Take your hands off me!

581
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,779
[Drunken mumbling continues]

582
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,252
[Grunts]

583
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,545
[Screams]

584
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,547
[Knocking]

585
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,472
Why, Mr. Carton.

586
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,106
Do come in.

587
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,075
What a pleasant surprise.

588
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,876
I just stopped by for a moment
to inquire of...

589
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,914
That is to say, I've been invited
to a regatta in Devon on Friday,

590
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,378
and I was wondering... hoping...

591
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,885
perhaps you might be able
to join me?

592
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,841
Oh, dear.

593
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,307
I'm sorry, Mr. Carton,

594
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,515
but I promised Father that I would go
with him to Hastings on Friday.

595
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,179
A medical conference.

596
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,432
Oh, I see.

597
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,354
Well, perhaps some other time, then.

598
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,614
I'm sorry.

599
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,359
Won't you have some tea?

600
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,075
No, no, thank you.
I'd best be moving on.

601
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,578
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

602
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,740
No, thank you.

603
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,455
My warmest regards to your father.

604
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,468
Sir, I do not doubt
your loving Lucie.

605
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,137
You may be satisfied on it.

606
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,481
Have you spoken to her?

607
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,313
- No.
- Why?

608
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,150
In deference to her father?

609
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,823
I have seen you, Doctor.

610
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,987
I have watched
the two of you together.

611
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:50,832
I have seen an affection so unique,
so touching, that I...

612
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,132
That is why I hesitate.

613
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,543
She is devoted to you
with all of her heart.

614
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,170
You were lost to her,

615
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,056
and your return has brought her
nothing but happiness.

616
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:09,053
How can I, then,
bring my love between you?

617
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,186
- And yet...
- Yes?

618
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,852
I beg you to believe

619
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,354
that I would never put a separation
between you.

620
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:25,704
I look only to loving your daughter,
and serving both of you,

621
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,746
to the death.

622
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,827
You speak so feelingly
that I thank you with all my heart.

623
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,752
Do you have reason to believe
that Lucy loves you?

624
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,707
I think it possible,

625
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,299
but without your permission,
I could have no hope at all.

626
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,088
Well, there is no question.

627
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,226
She is everything to me,
far more than life itself.

628
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,387
And knowing you, sir...

629
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm delighted to say
that you have my consent.

630
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,726
I thank you.

631
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,193
But in truth...

632
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,863
You don't know me.
Not really.

633
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,615
You see, my present name
is not as my own.

634
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,911
- I came here to England because...
- No.

635
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,247
I wish only to better deserve
your confidence.

636
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,711
No.

637
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,592
- Later.
- Sir.

638
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,128
You may tell me
when I ask it of you.

639
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,131
If Lucie should give her consent,

640
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,100
then, you may tell me
on your wedding day.

641
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,346
As you wish.

642
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:38,318
May your hopes, then, find success.

643
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,570
Thank you.

644
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:41,900
Thank you, sir.

645
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,359
Are you going to work
on the Harrison case?

646
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,948
It doesn't interest me.

647
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,957
We're not paid to express
our interest, Sydney.

648
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,824
- Stryver.
- Hm.

649
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,168
Have a drink.

650
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,672
A drink at this hour?
Are you serious?

651
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,083
Now, look, Sydney,

652
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,377
I must tell you to your face
that you concern me.

653
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,466
- I worry about you.
- Thank you.

654
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,132
You're certain to end up
without position in a debtor's prison.

655
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,298
I quite agree.

656
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,181
You've spent all of your money
on simple pursuits.

657
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,729
Exactly.

658
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,142
You know, Sydney,

659
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,859
you really should consider
putting an end to this dissolution.

660
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,822
- Any suggestions?
- Hm.

661
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,024
HOW?

662
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,693
Marriage.

663
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,693
Marriage?

664
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,784
Look the situation
in the eye, Sydney.

665
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:35,124
It would be very beneficial for you.

666
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,660
A man in your profession at the bar,
to have a wife.

667
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,292
Am I not mistaken...

668
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,206
Are you not unmarried yourself?

669
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,920
[Chuckles]

670
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,836
- Oh, I intend to get married.
- When?

671
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,127
Very shortly.

672
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,846
Congratulations.

673
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,596
And may I ask the name
of this most fortunate lady?

674
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,681
Well...

675
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,971
I hope this revelation
won't make you uncomfortable,

676
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,560
but I speak of Miss Lucie Manette.

677
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,651
Now, I know you visited her
on occasion,

678
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,609
and we both know
she has no great fortune.

679
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,650
So, she's a...
She's a charming creature.

680
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,614
And I've made up my mind
to please myself.

681
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,489
She will have in me
a man already quite well off,

682
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,501
and a rapidly rising man
of some distinction.

683
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,582
Yes, it will be a very good
piece of fortune for her.

684
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,744
<i>I Laughing 1</i>

685
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,419
But then, she is worthy of fortune.

686
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,750
What's the matter?

687
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,846
[Continues laughing]

688
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,720
Now, look here,
I find your reaction most annoying.

689
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,850
Stop it!

690
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,348
Sorry.

691
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,394
You'll see.

692
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,399
You'll see.

693
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,811
<i>I Laughing 1</i>

694
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,797
Absolutely.

695
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,307
The situation in France
gets worse every day.

696
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,434
Or better, as the case may be.

697
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,142
Better? Are you serious, sir?

698
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,774
I think that France
has been ruled too long by tyrants.

699
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,560
Perhaps, something better
will come out of this turmoil.

700
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,729
I must say, I very much doubt it.

701
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,898
You don't have a drink, Mr. Carton.

702
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,575
Oh, no, thank you,
I don't care for one.

703
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,906
They tell me there's going to be
an afternoon of cricket

704
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,531
in Hyde Park on Saturday.

705
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,917
I was wondering if perhaps
you might be free on this occasion?

706
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,794
Mr. Carton,
I don't know what to say.

707
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,799
You're so kind and so thoughtful.

708
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,214
But to tell you the truth,
I'm not at liberty.

709
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,513
- I see.
- No, I'm afraid you don't.

710
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,895
Actually, it's something more
than that.

711
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,976
It's that...

712
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,354
Well, you shall know very shortly,
I promise.

713
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,770
Before the evening is over.

714
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,941
There we are.
One more glass of champagne.

715
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,525
Who doesn't have a glass?

716
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,410
I think Mr. Carton.

717
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,860
No, thank you.

718
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:22,241
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear fellow,
but I'm afraid you cannot refuse.

719
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,496
I have an announcement to make,

720
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:31,088
and I would like everybody
to listen very carefully.

721
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,971
I wish to announce the engagement
of my beloved daughter Lucie

722
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,968
to this wonderful young man.

723
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,516
MAN: How marvelous!
My congratulations, sir.

724
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:43,805
A toast, if you will,
to a long and happy life together.

725
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,598
To a long and happy life together.

726
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,641
A long a happy life.

727
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,436
[Applause]

728
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,824
I simply can't believe it. I can't.

729
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:03,162
That charming creature
married to him.

730
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,919
Don't you agree. Sydney?

731
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,127
It isn't as though that Darnay
fellow's a man of business.

732
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,420
There's no comparison between
his position in life and mine.

733
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,304
None whatsoever.

734
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,056
Do you hear me, Sydney?

735
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,228
Damned difficult to understand.

736
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:29,684
Yes, perhaps I should have made
my intentions known sooner.

737
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,775
Yes, that must be it.
I delayed too long.

738
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,408
Still, to throw herself away
on that... French tutor.

739
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,948
Oh, well, women have committed
similar follies before

740
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,663
and have repented in poverty.

741
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,495
It's just as well, I suppose.

742
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,786
I should have gained nothing
by such a liaison.

743
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,125
- Careful.
- Huh?

744
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,499
<i>“Mm?</i>

745
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,465
Be careful of how you speak
of Miss Manette.

746
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,299
Do you understand me?

747
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,240
Prisoner and escort, halt!

748
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,201
Move!

749
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,625
Escort, at ease!

750
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,052
Who did he kill?

751
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,346
The Marquis St. Evremonde.

752
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,264
An excellent choice.

753
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,183
The Marquis killed his son.
He ran over him in the street.

754
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,521
I would not require such a reason.

755
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,985
The House of Evremonde,

756
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,696
they are recorded, all of them.

757
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,070
They are recorded,
here, in my stitches,

758
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,119
as plain to me as the sun.

759
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,805
Escort... forward, march!

760
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,103
Well, it is over.

761
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,015
And worth the price.

762
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,380
Have the goodness to give me
a glass of old cognac, Madame.

763
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,166
You knit with great skill, Madame.

764
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,673
I am accustomed to it.

765
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,959
May I ask what it is for?

766
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,299
A shroud.

767
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,756
Pardon?

768
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,673
[Chuckles]

769
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,847
It is only a pastime.

770
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,636
Not for use.

771
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,396
One day...

772
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:58,604
I may find a use for it... one day.

773
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:02,522
Did you see the hanging today,
Madame?

774
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,191
- A bad business.
- Why?

775
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,451
If people kill other people
with knives,

776
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,198
they deserve to pay the price.

777
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,947
But surely you must feel
some sympathy for him?

778
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,038
My husband.

779
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,748
Oh, good day, Monsieur.

780
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:22,257
I was just talking about the unhappy
fate of poor Monsieur Gaspard.

781
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,510
I know nothing of it.

782
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,545
You are Monsieur DeFarge?

783
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,139
I am.

784
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,427
I have the honor of sharing
a mutual friend with you, Monsieur.

785
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:37,439
Dr. Manette, yes?

786
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,934
When he was released from prison,

787
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,230
I understand
that you had charge of him.

788
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,319
Such is the fact.

789
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,075
His daughter came to you here.

790
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,328
Such is the fact.

791
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,948
Have you heard about them recently?

792
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,537
We have not, sir.

793
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,415
- She's going to be married.
- Excellent.

794
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:01,960
She should have been married
years ago.

795
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:07,007
The English are cold,
it seems to me.

796
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,592
It's a curious thing, she's going
to be married to the nephew

797
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,099
of the Marquis St. Evremonde.

798
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,553
You know, the man who was killed
by poor Gaspard.

799
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,391
He's called Charles Darnay,

800
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,227
but he's an Evremonde,
make no mistake.

801
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,648
Well...

802
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,701
Thank you for the cognac.

803
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,325
Good evening.

804
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,259
- Who is he?
- How should I know?

805
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,138
Barsad.
The name is Barsad.

806
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,799
He's a new spy
commissioned to the district.

807
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:54,807
Register his name.

808
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,014
- Two names.
- Two?

809
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,887
The spy Barsad,

810
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:04,234
and the nephew of St. Evremonde,
Charles Darnay.

811
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,769
It is strange.

812
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,904
After all the sympathy
we showed for her father

813
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,567
that she should marry
such a despicable dog.

814
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,907
For her sake,
he'd better stay out of France.

815
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,449
His destiny will take him
where he has to go,

816
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,251
and we shall be waiting.

817
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,711
Only a moment, gentlemen.

818
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,626
Well, if they don't hurry,
we shall have to delay the wedding.

819
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,717
One more moment.

820
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,722
And so, it became necessary

821
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,760
to renounce everything
I once held dear.

822
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,055
My property, my country,

823
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,972
even my name.

824
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,317
Your name?

825
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,854
I tried to tell you long before this.

826
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,614
I wanted to forget my past.

827
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,990
Now, I feel it's only fair
to tell you that...

828
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,781
My name is St. Evremonde.

829
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,783
Charles St. Evremonde...

830
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:07,298
A name that I detest
for all that it stands for in France.

831
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,753
Excuse me, it's getting very late
if we are to...

832
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,764
Fetch the carriage, Miss Pross.
We're coming at once.

833
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,272
- LUCIE: I, Lucie.
- PRIEST: Take thee, Charles.

834
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,439
- Take thee, Charles.
- To my wedded husband.

835
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,273
- LUCIE: To my wedded husband.
- PRIEST: To have and to hold.

836
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,073
- To have and to hold.
- PRIEST: From this day forward.

837
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,487
From this day forward.

838
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,744
- For better, for worse.
- For better, for worse.

839
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,497
- For richer, for poorer.
- For richer, for poorer.

840
01:01:44,498 --> 01:01:47,792
- In sickness and in health.
- In sickness and in health.

841
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,628
- To love and to cherish.
- To love and to cherish.

842
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,667
Till death do us part.

843
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,177
Till death do us part.

844
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,464
- And there to...
- And there to...

845
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:01,472
- I plight thee my troth.
- I plight thee my troth.

846
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,814
- PRIEST: In the name of the Father.
- CHARLES: In the name of the Father.

847
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,395
- And of the Son.
- And of the Son.

848
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,528
- And of the Holy Spirit.
- And of the Holy Spirit.

849
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,322
- Amen.
- Amen.

850
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:26,334
<i>Dominus vobiscum
et cum spiritu tuo...</i>

851
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,171
[Knocking]

852
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,761
Oh!

853
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,180
Oh, bless me! Bless me! I...

854
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,060
Dear God, I don't know what to do.

855
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:50,058
Calm yourself, Miss Pross.
Calm yourself.

856
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,568
He doesn't know me.

857
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,816
Dr. Manette doesn't know me.

858
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,324
- What are you talking about?
- Come with me, please.

859
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,391
My dear friend.

860
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,268
Dr. Manette.

861
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,309
Look at me, please.

862
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:33,728
Sir, this is not
your proper occupation.

863
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:37,568
Think, my dear friend, think.

864
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:56,717
Lucie, is anything wrong?

865
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,101
Are you all right?

866
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:14,484
I've been thinking about Mr. Carton.

867
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,394
Oh.

868
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,371
I know he's a difficult man.

869
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,873
But I would ask you
to be lenient with his faults.

870
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,216
I think he has a heart
he very seldom reveals.

871
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,222
A heart with deep wounds in it.

872
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,384
I know.

873
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,595
Oh, Lucie.

874
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:55,609
Here we are,
so strong in our happiness.

875
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,112
And yet,
if you had turned away from me,

876
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:03,025
if you had rejected
my proposal of marriage,

877
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,488
I might have found myself

878
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,158
in the same position
as Sydney Carton.

879
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,707
He loves you.

880
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,955
I'm certain of it.

881
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,201
Doctor?

882
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,079
Good morning, Miss Pross.

883
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,411
Oh, do you suppose
I might have some breakfast?

884
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:53,791
I, uh...

885
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:57,292
Yes, of course. At once.

886
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,297
Thank you.

887
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,926
[Knocking]

888
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,928
Come in.

889
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:10,054
- Mr. Lorry is here, Doctor.
- Oh.

890
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,718
Don't get up, Doctor.

891
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,519
Don't get up.
Finish your breakfast.

892
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:17,273
I'll join you for a cup of tea.
Miss Pross.

893
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,817
My dear friend.
My dear, clear friend.

894
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,941
All but finished.

895
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,982
- You're well this morning?
- I am, yes.

896
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,821
Mm-hmm.

897
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,913
If I may, Doctor,
I am anxious for your opinion.

898
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,917
A curious case. It involves
a very dear friend of mine.

899
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:40,296
Advise me well,
for his sake and his daughter's.

900
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,833
What are you suggesting?

901
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:45,760
An affliction.

902
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,338
It has borne this gentleman down
in the past,

903
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,849
and yet, he apparently recovered.

904
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,428
And now, it's returned.

905
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,062
Hmm...

906
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:01,477
You spoke of his daughter.

907
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,738
Does she know of this relapse?

908
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,739
- No.
- Oh, thank heaven.

909
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:10,402
- Can you tell me how it came about?
- An association from the past.

910
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,493
It was strong, intense,
and lurking in the mind.

911
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,750
- Is it likely to happen again?
- Oh, no.

912
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,002
That is good comfort, sir.

913
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,662
- And yet...
- Yes?

914
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,001
This occupation...

915
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,666
During the affliction.

916
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,960
This making of shoes.

917
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,847
If perhaps the necessary tools
could be...

918
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:36,395
Well, if they were gone,
could not the fear go with them?

919
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,976
- They are old companions.
- I know.

920
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,768
I know.

921
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,612
But I inquire
for your daughter's sake as well.

922
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,736
Can it not be done?

923
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,105
It could never happen in this country.
The monarchy is far too stable.

924
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,273
Don't you agree, Doctor?

925
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,692
Frenchmen!

926
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,031
Forgive me, Charles, but, oh, really.

927
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,866
I can't understand it.

928
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,289
Scoundrels...
absolute scoundrels.

929
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,418
Forgive me, Charles. I can only
thank God that I'm not French.

930
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,954
- Things will settle down eventually.
- Eventually?

931
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,584
Oh, "eventually".

932
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,875
They've had years now,
and it's worse than ever.

933
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:52,091
It's more than your life's worth
to set foot in the damn country.

934
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,300
Where is she? Did you see her?
Did she come by this way?

935
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:58,301
I thought the child was with you,
Miss Pross.

936
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,641
- She took a biscuit and she ran away.
- Oh.

937
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,182
It's time, I think,
to apply the paddle.

938
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,939
Not guilty!

939
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,645
Who took the biscuit?

940
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,899
I am the counsel
for this beautiful creature,

941
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,734
and I say to the court
that she is not guilty.

942
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,819
- Who took the biscuit?
- I did.

943
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,074
You are a gentleman, sir,
but you are also a liar.

944
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,789
Miss Pross!

945
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,704
- Come, little one, change horses.
- Father.

946
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,465
- It's time to take your afternoon nap.
- No.

947
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,547
Ooh-wah.

948
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:32,835
[Horse clop sounds]

949
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:33,798
Good-bye, Mr. Carton.

950
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,510
Well, that's an excellent suggestion
if I ever heard one.

951
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,768
- What do you say, Mr. Lorry?
- I am at your service, sir.

952
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,805
If you will excuse us, my dear.

953
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,124
You know, I don't think
I've ever told you

954
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:08,459
how much I appreciate
these visits with your family.

955
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,173
We enjoy them, too, Mr. Carton.

956
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,336
Indeed, you are like a part
of the family to us.

957
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,721
I worry about you, you know.

958
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:25,055
You are looking so pale these days.

959
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,061
Indeed. Well...

960
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:31,270
The life I lead, you see,
is not conducive to good health.

961
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,063
Can you not change your life?

962
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,148
Too late, I'm afraid.

963
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,908
I shall never be better than I am.

964
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,409
There, you have it.

965
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,001
I'm like one who has died young,
you see.

966
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,955
All my life...

967
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,590
might have been.

968
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,501
No.

969
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,591
No. I refuse to believe that.

970
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,099
Oh, I may once have had ideas
about striving fresh,

971
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,846
beginning anew,

972
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,683
shaking off this sloth,

973
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,894
fighting out the abandoned fight.

974
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,518
A dream...

975
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,316
All a dream.

976
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,745
But I do wish you to know that...

977
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:36,005
- You inspired it.
- Mr. Carton.

978
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,671
Oh, if you could have returned
the love I have for you,

979
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,135
I might well have brought you
nothing but disgrace...

980
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,933
and misery.

981
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,265
Indeed, the low habits
that I scorn at this very moment

982
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,851
I will yield to, again and again.

983
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,686
Is there no way that I...

984
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:05,329
that I can turn your affection for me
into some good account?

985
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:11,328
All that you could ever do for me...

986
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,622
has been done.

987
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,709
But you must believe me
when I say

988
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,925
that I would embrace
any sacrifice for you in this world.

989
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,938
Indeed.

990
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,397

is quite remarkable.

01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,051
In the hope, I gather, that the bank
might be able to forward it.

1069
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,953
- From Paris.
- Yes.

1070
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,252
- May I?
- Of course.

1071
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,859
I hope I haven't brought you
unwelcome news.

1072
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:17,353
Monsieur Gabelle.

1073
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,903
A man who worked for my uncle.

1074
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,285
He wanted to come to England
with me, but I couldn't manage it.

1075
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:27,244
And now
he's been placed under arrest.

1076
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,079
But why?

1077
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,664
For working in the house
of St. Evremonde.

1078
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,292
All those who served St. Evremonde
are now in prison.

1079
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,923
Good heavens.

1080
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:40,877
"I entreat you, please, to release me
from this prison of horror.

1081
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:44,382
For the love of justice
and the honor of your noble name.

1082
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:48,769
I have done nothing
but to serve and honor your family.

1083
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:54,229
I beg you,
before the hour of my destruction.

1084
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,189
Help me."

1085
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:00,989
- It is signed: "Gabelle".
- Mmh.

1086
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:04,152
There's nothing you can do,
of course.

1087
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,504
I must go to Paris.

1088
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,915
That would be far too dangerous.

1089
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,676
If there's anything I can do
to save this man, then, I must go!

1090
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,303
- But, please, Charles!
- I gave him my promise...

1091
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:28,184
my sacred promise,
that no harm would come to him.

1092
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,185
But, please, think of your family.

1093
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,975
They mustn't know.

1094
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,565
Not until after I have gone,
or my resolution might weaken.

1095
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,480
- When do you intend to leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

1096
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,482
Too soon.
I shan't be able to join you.

1097
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,113
Well, think about it.
I beg of you, reconsider.

1098
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:53,455
I have only to look at this letter,
and my mind is made up.

1099
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,003
I have no other course.

1100
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,874
Good-bye, Mr. Lorry.

1101
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,459
Godspeed on your journey.

1102
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,253
And yours, sir.

1103
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,423
And yours.

1104
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,010
[Harpsichord playing]

1105
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,256
Are you going out?

1106
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,262
Yes.

1107
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,891
I have an engagement.
One of my classes.

1108
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,147
There's a chill tonight.
Keep a scarf about you.

1109
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,609
I shall.

1110
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:39,825
Your papers, citizen.

1111
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,301
I'll give you an escort to Paris.

1112
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:56,433
An escort? Whatever for?
I don't need one.

1113
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,766
Silence, aristocrat.

1114
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,397
You'll have an escort,
and you'll pay for it.

1115
01:25:02,398 --> 01:25:04,517
I have no choice?

1116
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,811
Choice...
Listen to him!

1117
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,896
You'll pay dearly.

1118
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,404
And you will thank your God
for our protection.

1119
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:15,818
Can't you see I'm here
under my own free will?

1120
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:19,494
- You are a cursed aristocrat.
- Leave him be.

1121
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,535
He'll be judged in Paris.

1122
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,749
Judged?
What are you talking about?

1123
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,504
Yes, judged and condemned
as a traitor.

1124
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,917
My friends, you deceive yourselves.
I am no traitor!

1125
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,083
Enough!

1126
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,220
You will very quickly discover,
Monsieur,

1127
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,881
that we have a decree
banning all aristocrats

1128
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:39,059
and condemning to death
those that return.

1129
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,978
Now...

1130
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,649
About the money for the escort.

1131
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,859
One hundred Louis!

1132
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,501
Send him on.

1133
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,723
Get out!

1134
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:10,854
Where are the papers
of this prisoner?

1135
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,691
I ask you, sir, to take notice
that I am a free traveler

1136
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,151
and a French citizen.

1137
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:18,408
Where are the papers
of this prisoner?

1138
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,332
[Reads silently]

1139
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,377
- All right.
- Come with me.

1140
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,163
Defarge?

1141
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,501
Defarge!

1142
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,712
We have another one.

1143
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,927
You will come with me.

1144
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,808
Come on.

1145
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:10,585
You are the aristocrat,
St. Evremonde?

1146
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,838
I am St. Evremonde.

1147
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,291
- Married?
- Yes.

1148
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,676
Where is your wife?

1149
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:18,926
In England.

1150
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:23,135
- We were married in England.
- Without doubt.

1151
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,891
You are now consigned, Evremonde,
to the prison of La Force.

1152
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,397
For what reason?!

1153
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,818
- Haven't I the right at least...?
- Aristocrats have no rights!

1154
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,029
Take him away.

1155
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,844
You. It is you?

1156
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,128
Sir?

1157
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,056
Your wife is the daughter
of Dr. Manette?

1158
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:06,467
You know him?

1159
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:09,603
The doctor is known
by all good patriots.

1160
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,595
My name is Defarge.

1161
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,940
I keep a wine shop on St. Antoine.

1162
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,942
You have heard of me?

1163
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,195
It was your house, Monsieur,

1164
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:20,193
where Dr. Manette
was found by my wife.

1165
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:21,856
I must ask you...

1166
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:26,033
Why, in the name of heaven and hell,
did you ever come back to France?

1167
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,368
To save the life
of a devoted servant.

1168
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,284
That is all.
That is the truth.

1169
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,000
It is a bad truth,
and you are a fool, Monsieur.

1170
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,633
We have a newly-born female here
called "La Guillotine".

1171
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,429
Can you render me
some assistance?

1172
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,431
None.

1173
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,510
Can you answer a single question?

1174
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:51,553
Say what it is.

1175
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:55,436
Am I to have any communication here
with the outside world?

1176
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:57,067
No.

1177
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,446
There is an English gentleman here
in Paris,

1178
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:04,905
a banker by the name
of Jarvis Lorry.

1179
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,160
Would you please tell him

1180
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,660
that I have been thrown
into the prison of La Force?

1181
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,665
Just that, that only.

1182
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,246
I will do nothing for you.

1183
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,704
My duty is to my country
and the people.

1184
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:20,591
I am the sworn servant of the people
against you.

1185
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,051
1 will do nothing.

1186
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,382
[Rats screeching]

1187
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,278
[Crowd cheers]

1188
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,578
[Door opens]

1189
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,536
Excuse me, sir.

1190
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,951
Well, what did you find out?

1191
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,919
Bad news, sir.

1192
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,331
The information's reliable,
they assured me that.

1193
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,170
Tell me, tell me.

1194
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:29,176
They've taken him prisoner
and locked him up.

1195
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,882
Oh, my God!

1196
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,344
He's under the name
of St. Evremonde,

1197
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:34,720
marked in secret.

1198
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,305
What does that mean?

1199
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:39,058
I'm afraid,
it means solitary confinement.

1200
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,565
There is no way we can reach him.
Not now.

1201
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:45,694
- Sorry, sir.
- All right, Jerry.

1202
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:48,947
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, that's all.

1203
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:51,984
Oh, dear.

1204
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,661
Oh.

1205
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:08,209
<i>"My dear Dr. Manette.</i>

1206
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,626
<i>It is with the utmost regret</i>

1207
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,257
<i>that I bring you
this most unfortunate news."</i>

1208
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,681
What can we do?

1209
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:27,815
- I shall go to Paris immediately.
- Mr. Lorry said that...

1210
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:30,856
I was a prisoner in the Bastille
for over 16 years.

1211
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,569
They know me.

1212
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:35,281
They know what I endured
at the hands of the nobility.

1213
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:38,951
They will listen to me.
I am certain of it.

1214
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,166
- I'll go with you.
- Oh, no.

1215
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,577
Father, don't you see,

1216
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:47,043
I can't possibly stay here
without knowing?

1217
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:48,878
That I...

1218
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,911
I've got to go with you.
There's no question about it.

1219
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,055
I'll tell Miss Pross.
How soon can we leave?

1220
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:56,886
Father!

1221
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:55,614
Oh, no, sir.

1222
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,821
Mr. Lorry left for France
over three weeks ago.

1223
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:00,328
- I don't know when he'll be back.
- France?

1224
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:01,954
Yes, sir.

1225
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,081
Do you know if the Darnays
traveled with him?

1226
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,993
No, sir, he was traveling alone.

1227
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,340
They're here! They're here!

1228
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:15,377
What are you talking about?
Who's here? You might knock...

1229
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,795
Lucie!

1230
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,087
Dr. Manette!

1231
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,471
I don't understand.

1232
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,299
We received your letter.

1233
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:23,218
But I had no thought
of you coming here.

1234
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:25,933
We simply couldn't remain in London
under the circumstances.

1235
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,223
I assure you, I've done everything
I possibly could.

1236
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:31,188
You, my dear friend,
are not Alexandre Manette.

1237
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:33,979
There is no patriot in Paris
who does not know my name,

1238
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,443
and none who would touch me.

1239
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:39,780
I shall use that influence now
for whatever it is worth.

1240
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,241
[Distant screaming]

1241
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,952
There is still some killing
in the streets.

1242
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:47,037
They drag the prisoners
from their cells and...

1243
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,996
What?!

1244
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,839
Oh, it's all right my dear.
It's all right.

1245
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,917
Charles is quite safe, as yet.

1246
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:56,468
And, Doctor, if you have the power
you say you have,

1247
01:35:56,626 --> 01:36:00,051
then, make yourself known
to these devils, for God's sake.

1248
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:03,843
- Make them take you to La Force.
- I shall do so at once.

1249
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,806
Father!

1250
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:10,189
Have faith, my dear.

1251
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:16,071
WOMAN: Who is he?
Kill him!

1252
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,982
Listen to me!
Please, I beg you.

1253
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,446
- Listen to me!
- WOMAN: Kill him!

1254
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,031
Give the knife to him!

1255
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:27,199
Look at me! Listen to me!

1256
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:35,416
I am Alexandre Manette.
Do you know the name?

1257
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:40,257
For 16 years,
a prisoner in the Bastille.

1258
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,720
MAN: Manette? Manette?
You are the physician!

1259
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,100
Yes, Dr. Manette.

1260
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,429
Locked in a solitary cell,

1261
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:54,146
without sight of one human being
for over 16 years.

1262
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:58,815
I know the pain.
I know the suffering you endure.

1263
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,153
I am a victim, as all of you.

1264
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:01,908
[Cheers]

1265
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,865
I am one of you!

1266
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,655
WOMAN: What do you want?

1267
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,827
Freedom!

1268
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,368
For my own daughter's
dear husband.

1269
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,662
A terrible mistake,
they have taken him to La Force.

1270
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,382
I beg you to take me there.

1271
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,009
[Crowd reaction]

1272
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,887
Help me to set him free!

1273
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,765
Take the prisoner and La Force!

1274
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:28,426
[Crowd cheers]

1275
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,095
Take the prisoner!

1276
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:32,434
To La Force!

1277
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,181
Make way!

1278
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,435
Make way!

1279
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,140
I have a message from Dr. Manette.

1280
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,180
Just a moment.

1281
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,156
Monsieur Defarge?

1282
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,700
The same, Monsieur.

1283
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,910
I bring you a message
from Dr. Manette.

1284
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:40,875
Believe me, I'd only do this
for the good doctor.

1285
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:44,215
I have another message
for Miss Lucie Manette.

1286
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,130
- Can you take me to her?
- We'll go at once. I'll just get...

1287
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,719
My wife, Monsieur.
She will join us.

1288
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,092
For what purpose?

1289
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:55,688
So that she might recognize
the faces better, Monsieur.

1290
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,016
For their own safety.

1291
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:00,852
I see.

1292
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,569
It's from Charles.

1293
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,072
He...

1294
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,286
He says that he...

1295
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,004
Well...

1296
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:26,553
He says that my father has influence.

1297
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,964
- Let us hope so.
- It is enough.

1298
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,258
I have seen them.
We may go.

1299
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:34,143
Please, Madame, you will help me
to see him if you can.

1300
01:39:34,144 --> 01:39:37,685
Your husband is not my business.
It is you.

1301
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:41,226
Then, for my sake,
please be merciful to my husband.

1302
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:44,979
What does your husband say
in the letter?

1303
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:46,648
"Influence?"

1304
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,033
- Influence?
- Yes!

1305
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:51,069
Then, let that release him.

1306
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,409
I implore you, Madame.

1307
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:04,210
As a woman.

1308
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,796
- As a wife.
- Oh, yes.

1309
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:09,178
We've all seen our women suffer.

1310
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,172
And our husbands,
and our children.

1311
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:16,519
Our children, dying in the street
of poverty and hunger,

1312
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,395
thirst and misery.

1313
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:26,609
Do you think the troubles of one wife
means anything to us now?

1314
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,133
You have, Dr. Manette,
been a secret prisoner in the Bastille

1315
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:53,551
for a period of over 16 years.

1316
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,257
That is true.

1317
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:57,352
And now, today,
you appear before us

1318
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,434
to seek the release
of Monseigneur St. Evermonde,

1319
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:03,065
who calls himself Charles Darnay.

1320
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:04,692
Yes.

1321
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,568
<i>Hmm.</i>

1322
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:09,822
We have, good citizen,
considered your request,

1323
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,775
and we've made our decision.

1324
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,411
The prisoner must remain in custody.

1325
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,282
For how long?

1326
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:21,917
You've heard our decision.
That is all.

1327
01:41:21,918 --> 01:41:23,456
For how long?

1328
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:28,045
There will be a trial in the future,
Monsieur. Good day.

1329
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:30,301
But prisoners are being dragged
out of their cells

1330
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:31,836
and slaughtered in the streets.

1331
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:36,049
St. Evremonde will be held
in safe custody, I promise you.

1332
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:40,011
And I promise you,
Monsieur le President,

1333
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:41,303
that I shall not leave Paris

1334
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,313
until his freedom
has been accomplished.

1335
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:59,663
They will not release him.

1336
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:04,544
Oh, frightful. It's frightful.

1337
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,000
They've already beheaded
the King and Queen,

1338
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:09,757
and still they have tribunals
springing up all over the country.

1339
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,293
The revolution keeps growing.

1340
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,632
L-Hmm...

1341
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,422
Do you know they speak
of the guillotine as a female figure,

1342
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:19,257
even make jokes about it?

1343
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:21,306
They say it's the best cure
for a headache.

1344
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:23,346
Prevents the hair from going grey.

1345
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,935
Madness. Madness!

1346
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,359
What in God's name do we do now?

1347
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:30,736
- Wait for his trial.
- And then?

1348
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,646
1 will speak.

1349
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:35,491
Indeed, I will speak.

1350
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,572
Take heed, sir.

1351
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:43,161
I beg your pardon.

1352
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:46,544
If I was you, sir, I wouldn't put
one foot on France at this moment.

1353
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:49,125
Not for a million shillings,
I wouldn't.

1354
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,172
Know what I mean, sir?

1355
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,099
Thank you for the warning.

1356
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,769
[Bell ringing]

1357
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,747
Oh, Lucy!
Look! Look!

1358
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,162
At the highest window.

1359
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:31,001
I can see someone waving.

1360
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:32,331
It's father!

1361
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:33,841
Yes, I think it is.

1362
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:36,923
Oh, wave to him, darling!
Wave, wave!

1363
01:43:37,086 --> 01:43:38,759
There you are!

1364
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:55,522
[Crowd following cart]

1365
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:58,237
[Drumbeat]

1366
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:11,788
Hey, milady!

1367
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,967
Why don't you come
and see the execution, milady?

1368
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:22,636
WOMAN: Straight to the guillotine!

1369
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,568
I salute you, citizeness.

1370
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,563
I salute you.

1371
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:39,778
Tomorrow.

1372
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,068
What?

1373
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,950
Tomorrow, we shall see.

1374
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:59,043
And, therefore,
for crimes against the Republic

1375
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,879
and crimes against
the citizens of the Republic,

1376
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,674
you are sentenced to death
by the guillotine.

1377
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,639
- Take him away.
- ALL: Off with his head!

1378
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:12,102
Off with his head!

1379
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,650
[Crowd jeering]

1380

[Bell ringing]

1381
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:25,362
Charles St. Evremonde,
called Darnay!

1382
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:27,997
[Yelling]

1383
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:46,514
Kill him!

1384
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,847
Death to Evermonde!

1385
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,977
Charles St. Evremonde.

1386
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:53,680
You are accused as an aristocrat,

1387
01:45:53,681 --> 01:45:55,683
whose life is forfeit
to the Republic.

1388
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:59,984
Kill him! Off with his head!
Kill him!

1389
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,864
[Bell ringing]

1390
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,490
Silence! Silence!

1391
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:11,783
The prisoner may speak
if he so desires. Monsieur?

1392
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:16,253
Your Honor.

1393
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:19,757
I no longer feel myself
to be an aristocrat.

1394
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:20,915
[Crowd reaction]

1395
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:23,586
I have voluntarily
relinquished a title,

1396
01:46:23,752 --> 01:46:26,881
that I assure you,
was distasteful to me.

1397
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:30,142
I gave up all my property long ago.

1398
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:34,679
And I have been living
by my own industry in England.

1399
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,934
Yes. Is there anything else?

1400
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,819
I've married a woman in England.

1401
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:41,978
CROWD: Oh!

1402
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:45,032
Who is the daughter
of citizen Alexandre Manette,

1403
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:47,784
who sits with us here today.

1404
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:50,153
Why have you returned to France?

1405
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,624
To try to save the life
of a prisoner here.

1406
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:55,955
Is that a crime
in the eyes of the Republic?

1407
01:46:56,118 --> 01:47:00,294
This tribunal will ask the questions,
Monsieur.

1408
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:03,458
Have you any more statements
to make?

1409
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:08,761
This prisoner, this man,
has already met his fate.

1410
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:12,427
I simply wish now
to return to England.

1411
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:16,856
And I should like to call
upon Dr. Manette,

1412
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:19,608
so that this tribunal
might hear his words.

1413

[Crowd murmurs]

01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:38,420
This prisoner stands before you
as one of my own family,

1415
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:43,299
as one dear to my heart
as my own flesh and blood would be.

1416
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:47,212
He has been honorable to me
and devoted to my daughter.

1417
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:50,681
He has never once spoken
in favor of the aristocracy,

1418
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:53,092
to me or to anyone else.

1419
01:47:53,258 --> 01:47:57,513
On the contrary, he has renounced it
before the world.

1420
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,680
CROWD: Oh!

1421
01:47:58,764 --> 01:48:01,859
He has given up his title,
his worldly goods,

1422
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:05,567
and I ask you not to take his life.

1423
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:14,535
I ask you, I beg you,
as a citizen, as a patriot.

1424
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:17,621
Do not take his life.

1425
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:22,250
Have you anything more to say?

1426
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,792
No.

1427
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,543
The jury will render its verdict.

1428
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,297
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

1429
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:32,722
Not guilty.

1430
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,849
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

1431
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,010
Not guilty.

1432
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:37,760
Not guilty.

1433
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:40,184
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

1434
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:41,690
Not guilty.

1435
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:43,066
Not guilty.

1436
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,359
[Bell ringing]

1437
01:48:48,731 --> 01:48:51,325
You've heard the verdict of the jury.

1438
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:55,280
The prisoner is declared
by this tribunal to be free.

1439
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,080
[Crowd reaction]

1440
01:48:57,239 --> 01:49:00,914
Well, it is done.

1441
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:02,293
Is it?

1442
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:04,622
Have you not heard?

1443
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:06,290
I am a patient woman.

1444
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:09,336
The time will come.

1445
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,878
What is that?

1446
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:13,594
- The writings of Dr. Manette.
- Hm?

1447
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,726
Oh, yes, his very own words.

1448
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:21,105
We found his diary in his room,
did we not, my good husband?

1449
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,932
Patience.

1450
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,356
Not long now.

1451
01:49:29,021 --> 01:49:31,615
Not long now.

1452
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:07,692
Now, Mr. Cruncher,
I'm ready if you are.

1453
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,694
As your service, Miss Pross.

1454
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,698
We are going out for food and wine.

1455
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,612
We shall be back shortly.

1456
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:21,282
It's dark, Miss Pross.
Do you think it's safe?

1457
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:25,294
- I have Mr. Cruncher to protect me.
- Absolutely.

1458
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:29,958
But we shall be careful, mind you.
I don't trust any of these savages.

1459
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:32,001
They have two thoughts
in their mind,

1460
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:33,293
murder and mischief!

1461
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:34,928
I can vouch for that.

1462
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:36,801
The short and long of it is

1463
01:50:36,802 --> 01:50:39,346
that I am a subject
of his most gracious majesty,

1464
01:50:39,508 --> 01:50:41,636
King George the Third.

1465
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:44,851
And I say, confound the French
and their politics,

1466
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:47,107
and their knavish tricks.

1467
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:49,769
On George, our hopes we fix.

1468
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:51,482
God Save the King!

1469
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:53,735
Be cautious, Miss Pross.

1470
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,695
We're not out of France as yet.

1471
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:58,657
Speaking for myself,
it can't be soon enough.

1472
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:01,072
We shall make arrangements
tomorrow.

1473
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:04,037
I don't think any of us wish
to stay here longer than we have to.

1474
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,997
- What is that?
- I beg your pardon.

1475
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,878
I thought I heard someone
on the stairs.

1476
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,036
I heard no one.

1477
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:10,164
[Knocking]

1478
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:13,049
It's them.
They're coming back for you.

1479
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:16,879
- Quickly, hide.
- It's all right, Miss Pross.

1480
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:19,719
Charles has been set free now.

1481
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:26,012
What is this?

1482
01:51:26,138 --> 01:51:29,142
Citizen St. Evremonde,
called Darnay?

1483
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:30,434
Yes!

1484
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:32,815
- You are Evremonde.
- I am.

1485
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,272
You are once again, Monsieur,
a prisoner of the Republic.

1486
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,775
Hold him!

1487
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,827
Why?

1488
01:51:40,986 --> 01:51:43,455
Tell me why am I again a prisoner?

1489
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,953
You'll find out tomorrow.
You're summoned for tomorrow.

1490
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:49,336
Sir, I do not understand.
How can this happen?

1491
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:51,622
He's been denounced,
Citizen Doctor.

1492
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:53,381
- He's been accused.
- By whom?

1493
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,540
Ask no more.

1494
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,305
If the Republic
demands a sacrifice of you,

1495
01:51:56,418 --> 01:51:59,968
then, you, as a good patriot,
will be happy to make it.

1496
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,132
The Republic goes before all.

1497
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,893
- The people are supreme.
- Sir!

1498
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:09,055
I beg of you to tell me at least
who denounced him.

1499
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:11,150
It is against the rules, good Doctor.

1500
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:12,434
But the prisoner
has been denounced

1501
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:14,569
by the Citizen
and Citizeness Defarge.

1502
01:52:15,938 --> 01:52:16,938
FIE?

1503
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:20,534
- There was one other.
- What other?

1504
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:23,738
You'll find out tomorrow.
Now, come along!

1505
01:52:24,321 --> 01:52:25,163
- No!
- Lucie!

1506
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:28,201
No! No! Leave him alone!

1507
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:30,540
Leave him alone!

1508
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,508
Savages!

1509
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:08,908
[Knocking]

1510
01:53:09,074 --> 01:53:11,076
Who is it?

1511
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:13,746
It's me, sir.

1512
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,210
A gentleman to see you, sir.
An English gentleman.

1513
01:53:16,373 --> 01:53:17,374
English?

1514
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:19,839
Bless me soul,
if it isn't Sydney Carton.

1515
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:23,006
Good heavens!
Show him in at once.

1516
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:26,967
My dear fellow.

1517
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,512
You are the last person
I'd expect to find in France.

1518
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:31,305
Darnay is in prison, is he not?

1519
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:35,851
Yes. And there's nothing you can do
to help him. Nothing.

1520
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,520
We shall see about that.

1521
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:39,404
Dr. Manette has done all he can,

1522
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:43,443
and he has more influence
with these people than you or I.

1523
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:46,737
Believe me, Charles Darnay
remains in prison.

1524
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:50,658
And I don't think the good Lord
Himself could set him free now.

1525
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:57,294
In that case, maybe the Devil
can accomplish it.

1526
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:03,428
Miss Pross?

1527
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,011
Miss Pross?

1528
01:54:13,805 --> 01:54:15,022
Here we are.

1529
01:54:15,182 --> 01:54:17,150
Oh, there you are.

1530
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:19,982
Mommy! Mommy!

1531
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:18,128
- Good morning, citizen.
- Good morning.

1532
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:20,960
I believe the name is Barsad,
John Barsad,

1533
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:23,672
sometimes called Guillerman.

1534
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:24,875
What do you want?

1535
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:28,676
I saw you testify at the Old Bailey
against Charles Darnay.

1536
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,632
- What of it?
- Indeed.

1537
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:33,518
Once a spy, always a spy.

1538
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,976
And now I see you work here
in the prison.

1539
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:38,937
A spy once again
for the prison guards.

1540
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:41,443
Do you like working in prison?

1541
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:45,151
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, not so quickly, citizen.

1542
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:48,157
I think I might well use
a friend in prison such as you.

1543
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:49,567
I'm no friend of yours.

1544
01:55:49,568 --> 01:55:53,038
Oh, but you are,
whether you like it or not.

1545
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:57,410
Don't you understand?

1546
01:55:57,576 --> 01:55:59,954
I hold all the cards.

1547
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:03,798
What are you talking about?

1548
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:07,302
Mr. Barsad.

1549
01:56:07,461 --> 01:56:09,714
My dear fellow.

1550
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:13,516
I think for your own sake,
you had better come with me.

1551
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:18,101
And we shall discuss it.

1552
01:56:30,358 --> 01:56:32,656
Well, Mr. Lorry.

1553
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,653
What do you think?

1554
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:38,625
I agree with you.
Once a spy, always a spy.

1555
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:42,413
- You can't prove a thing.
- Prove?

1556
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:44,581
What do I need of proof?

1557
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:51,128
I shall simply denounce you
to the nearest Citizen's Committee.

1558
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:54,724
John Barsad, alias Guillerman,

1559
01:56:54,883 --> 01:56:59,059
who once worked
for the noble Lords of France.

1560
01:57:00,055 --> 01:57:02,774
Can you stand such an investigation?

1561
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:08,405
Will they discover
unpleasant things about you?

1562
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,367
- It's blackmail.
- Ah!

1563
01:57:12,526 --> 01:57:16,695
Now, there you have it, at last.

1564
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:18,164
My ace.

1565
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:22,327
Well...

1566
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,957
Look over your own cards
and see what you have.

1567
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:29,125
Look into your unsavory past

1568
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:32,466
and tell me
what your chances are now.

1569
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:36,675
- I...
- Yes?

1570
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:38,388
Did you say something?

1571
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:42,139
About your cards, perhaps?

1572
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:44,607
Or mine?

1573
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:48,979
You have a good hand, sir.

1574
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,615
You might even call it
a guillotine hand.

1575
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,447
<i>Do you DRY?</i>

1576
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:03,744
What do you want of me?

1577
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:06,254
It's a very simple request.

1578
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:09,007
If things should go ill
with the prisoner, Charles Darnay,

1579
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:10,542
then, I must have access to him.

1580
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:13,212
- Impossible!
- Just once.

1581
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:22,308
Or do you prefer that I play my hand?

1582
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,020
Having access to the prisoner
will not save him.

1583
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:28,610
Just once.

1584
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:32,739
I tell you, there's no such thing
as escape from La Force.

1585
01:58:34,983 --> 01:58:36,735
Just once.

1586
01:58:47,287 --> 01:58:49,164
Very well.

1587
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:53,627
Thank you, Mr. Barsad.

1588
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:57,468
You may be certain that I shall be
in touch with you very shortly.

1589
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,767
In fact...

1590
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:02,552
sooner than you might think.

1591
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,346
Good day, sir.

1592
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,731
Hmm...

1593
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:17,780
I don't understand.

1594
01:59:17,942 --> 01:59:19,068
The man's quite right.

1595
01:59:19,235 --> 01:59:22,455
There's no way of escape,
so what good would it do?

1596
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:24,907
My dear Mr. Lorry...

1597
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:29,539
Please, I ask only
that you do not tell the Manettes

1598
01:59:29,704 --> 01:59:30,704
of this arrangement.

1599
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:33,834
In fact, I think it best
if I do not see them

1600
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,968
while I'm herein Paris at all.

1601
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:38,171
As you wish.

1602
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:42,926
Bear up, Mr. Lorry.

1603
01:59:44,636 --> 01:59:46,354
Courage!

1604
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:14,249
Good evening, citizen.

1605
02:00:23,341 --> 02:00:25,594
Good evening, citizen.

1606
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,307
How goes the Republic?

1607
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:30,639
Excellent. It is very good.

1608
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,938
63 today.

1609
02:00:33,768 --> 02:00:35,686
Do you watch them?

1610
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:38,440
Always. I never miss them.

1611
02:00:38,606 --> 02:00:42,702
You ought to go and see for yourself
when there's a good day.

1612
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:47,495
Good night, citizen.

1613
02:01:20,899 --> 02:01:22,401
Forgive me, citizen,

1614
02:01:22,567 --> 02:01:25,036
but may I keep you open
for another moment or two?

1615
02:01:25,236 --> 02:01:27,284
Come in, come in.

1616
02:01:27,447 --> 02:01:29,324
What can we do for you?

1617
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:41,795
For you, Monsieur?

1618
02:01:41,961 --> 02:01:43,383
For me.

1619
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:06,662
You must be careful, Monsieur,
to keep them separate.

1620
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:11,791
You know the consequences
of mixing them?

1621
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,076
Perfectly.

1622
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:17,710
Here we are.

1623
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:20,417
14 Louis.

1624
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:33,430
Be careful, citizen.

1625
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:39,319
I will try.

1626
02:02:48,236 --> 02:02:51,160
[Steel being sharpened]

1627
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:17,348
[Crowd murmuring]

1628
02:03:30,612 --> 02:03:32,785
[Bell ringing]

1629
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:38,787
The Public Prosecutor
announces to this tribunal

1630
02:03:38,953 --> 02:03:42,002
that the prisoner
Charles St. Evermonde,

1631
02:03:42,165 --> 02:03:44,543
called Darnay,
has been denounced.

1632
02:03:44,709 --> 02:03:46,757
[Crowd jeers]

1633
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,015
He has been denounced
by three voices.

1634
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:53,426
They are: Ernest Defarge,

1635
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:58,102
Therese Defarge...

1636
02:04:00,725 --> 02:04:04,150
Well? Who is the third voice?

1637
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:06,980
Alexandre Manette.

1638
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:08,198
[Crowd gasps]

1639
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:09,399
FIE?

[Bell ringing]

1641
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:15,999
Quiet!
I will have quiet in the chamber!

1642
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:17,704
Monsieur le President,

1643
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:21,212
what the Public Prosecutor
has stated is impossible.

1644
02:04:21,371 --> 02:04:24,841
I have never denounced the prisoner.
Never!

1645
02:04:24,999 --> 02:04:29,095
I call upon Madame Defarge
to speak to this tribunal.

1646
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:31,676
[Crowd uproar]

1647
02:04:35,927 --> 02:04:39,846
Patriots! Listen to me!

1648
02:04:39,847 --> 02:04:42,942
I have something to read to you.

1649
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:45,103
I have in hand the diary

1650
02:04:45,269 --> 02:04:48,022
in the handwriting
of our good Doctor Manette.

1651
02:04:48,773 --> 02:04:53,074
He wrote this diary from the moment
he was put into prison.

1652
02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:56,160
And do you know
why he was imprisoned?

1653
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:59,997
For trying to save the life
of a dying woman.

1654
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:03,129
Yes, a woman who had been abused

1655
02:05:03,287 --> 02:05:07,508
by Monseigneur
Philippe St. Evremonde,

1656
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:09,544
uncle of the prisoner.

1657
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:11,805
[Crowd reaction]

1658
02:05:11,963 --> 02:05:14,136
This woman died from the injuries

1659
02:05:14,298 --> 02:05:17,017
she received
at the hand of St. Evremonde.

1660
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:20,146
The good doctor could not save her.

1661
02:05:20,304 --> 02:05:23,649
But for reporting her death
to the authorities,

1662
02:05:23,808 --> 02:05:25,435
and for that alone,

1663
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:29,651
he was thrown into prison
by St. Evremonde.

1664
02:05:30,481 --> 02:05:34,202
Thrown into prison to rot, Monsieur.

1665
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,202
WOMAN: Death!

1666
02:05:35,203 --> 02:05:37,322
Listen to me!

1667
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:40,158
The words of Doctor Manette:

1668
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:46,540
"And so, to the Evremondes
and their descendants,

1669
02:05:46,706 --> 02:05:50,631
to the last of their race,

1670
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:53,012
I, Alexandre Manette,

1671
02:05:53,171 --> 02:05:57,017
do, this last night
of the year 1761,

1672
02:05:57,175 --> 02:05:59,143
in my unbearable agony,

1673
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:02,181
denounce the Evremondes.

1674
02:06:02,346 --> 02:06:10,346
I denounce the House of Evremonde
to heaven and to hell!

Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

1678
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:23,243
Save him now, good Doctor.

1679
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,333
Save him now.

1680
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,715

Off with his head!

1682
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:34,129
I call for the verdict.

1683
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,093
Monsieur le President, please!

Let's have the verdict.

1688
02:06:42,386 --> 02:06:43,888
Guilty.

1689
02:06:44,055 --> 02:06:45,227

- Charles!
- No, get out!

- Please let me see him, I beg you!
- No!

1702
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,660
Just for one moment.

1703
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:42,993
- Please, I beg you, sir.
- One moment.

1704
02:07:43,156 --> 02:07:44,874
Charles!

1705
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:05,144
Believe me, sir, I didn't know.

1706
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:07,601
I had no idea my uncle
was responsible for...

1707
02:08:07,763 --> 02:08:10,061
- I know.
- Forgive me.

1708
02:08:11,684 --> 02:08:13,937
There is nothing to forgive.

1709
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:21,327
May God protect you.

1710
02:08:21,485 --> 02:08:23,908

I'll take her to your coach.
Show me the way.

- Mr. Carton!
- Please, Doctor, now is not the time.

She'll be all right, I think.

Hey, what's the matter with you?

- I am disturbed.
- Why?

Dr. Manette...

1723
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:19,729
He's already suffered so much
in his life.

1724
02:10:19,895 --> 02:10:21,522
And he will suffer more.

1725

There are more lives here than one,
Monsieur.

What are you talking about?

There is another St. Evremonde.

Surely, you wouldn't.

1729
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:34,869
Not the little girl.

1730
02:10:35,036 --> 02:10:37,789

Let us put an end to it now.
I beg you.

Let's stop it here.

1734
02:10:45,421 --> 02:10:47,970
Tell the fire and the wind
where to stop.

1735
02:10:47,971 --> 02:10:50,639

You know why.

1740
02:10:59,935 --> 02:11:01,653
Tell them.

1741
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:04,198
Tell them why.

- Who's there?
- Carton.

02:11:36,138 --> 02:11:37,230
Mr. Carton.

1751
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:40,860
I must speak to you alone.
It's urgent, I...

1752
02:11:42,436 --> 02:11:44,154
I'm afraid it's the shock.

1753
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:46,407
His mind has gone again.

1754
02:11:46,565 --> 02:11:48,533
Oh, Mr. Carton, we're lost.

1755
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:50,911
Our last hope is gone.

- I must hold you to a promise, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

- Keep it for me until tomorrow.
- But why?

1761
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:06,885
Because I would rather not
have it with me

when I visit Charles in prison.

1763
02:12:09,422 --> 02:12:11,220

a doctor's certificate,

the barrier of the city.

1766
02:12:15,386 --> 02:12:18,265
But surely you don't think
they're in danger, too?

1767
02:12:18,266 --> 02:12:21,564
No one in the House
of St. Evremonde is safe.

1768
02:12:21,725 --> 02:12:24,023
Not anymore.

1769
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:26,530
Their certificates can be recalled.

1770
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:30,568
Don't look so horrified, Mr. Lorry.

1771
02:12:30,734 --> 02:12:33,908
- You have the chance to save them.
- I?

1772
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:35,994
Heaven grant that I may, but how?

1773
02:12:36,157 --> 02:12:38,205
Get coach and horses
early tomorrow morning,

1774
02:12:38,367 --> 02:12:40,586
so that they might be ready
by 2:00 in the afternoon.

1775
02:12:40,744 --> 02:12:43,293
- Arrange it as soon as possible.
- It shall be clone.

1776
02:12:43,456 --> 02:12:45,174
Tell Lucie of the great danger,

1777
02:12:45,332 --> 02:12:47,255
that she must leave Paris
immediately.

1778
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:50,467
Be sure that Miss Pross'
and Mr. Cruncher's papers in order.

1779
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:53,348
- I will.
- Have the coach standing by.

1780
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:57,218
The moment I arrive,
take me in and drive away.

1781
02:12:57,219 --> 02:13:00,439
- And then, for England.
- For England.

1782
02:13:00,598 --> 02:13:04,102
Promise me solemnly
that nothing will alter the course

1783
02:13:04,268 --> 02:13:06,691
on which we now stand pledged
to one another.

1784
02:13:06,854 --> 02:13:08,356
Nothing.

1785
02:13:10,649 --> 02:13:13,610
Do you know, Mr. Lorry,

1786
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:17,741
when we first met,
I looked upon you with contempt.

1787
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:21,043
Yes, I daresay
I wasn't quite fond of you either.

1788
02:13:24,413 --> 02:13:26,040
I'll take the old gentleman home.

1789
02:13:43,307 --> 02:13:45,059
Tell me...

1790
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:51,532
If you could look back and say
I have done nothing good at all...

1791
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,994
I have secured no one's love,

1792
02:13:55,152 --> 02:13:57,405
or affection,

1793
02:13:57,571 --> 02:14:00,370
or even regard,

1794
02:14:00,533 --> 02:14:04,163
would not all of your years, then,
be years wasted?

1795
02:14:04,328 --> 02:14:07,707
Why do you speak of such things?
You're still young.

1796
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:10,755
True.

1797
02:14:11,794 --> 02:14:14,422
But my young way
was never the way to age.

1798
02:14:17,383 --> 02:14:21,013
Doctor. We're leaving now.

1799
02:14:21,178 --> 02:14:23,397
Come, let me help you.

1800
02:14:36,735 --> 02:14:37,861
Good-bye, Mr. Lorry.

1801
02:14:39,113 --> 02:14:41,332
You're a kind and good man.

1802
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:43,618
I envy you.

1803
02:14:43,784 --> 02:14:46,128
But I can't be like you.

1804
02:15:24,908 --> 02:15:26,330
Keys.

1805
02:15:37,212 --> 02:15:40,466
Be quick about it.
I'll wait here.

1806
02:15:43,344 --> 02:15:45,221
[Door opens]

1807
02:15:52,686 --> 02:15:55,405
I know. Of all the people
on this Earth,

1808
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:57,737
I'm the last one
you expected to see.

1809
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,119
I pray to God, sir,
that you are not a prisoner.

1810
02:16:00,277 --> 02:16:02,780
No, I come here only on a request
from your wife.

1811
02:16:02,946 --> 02:16:05,916
But there's no time now to tell you
why I bring it or what it means.

1812
02:16:06,116 --> 02:16:08,414
Take off your coat.

1813
02:16:08,577 --> 02:16:10,955
- My coat?
- No questions.

1814
02:16:11,121 --> 02:16:13,749
- Can't you tell me at least what...?
- No.

1815
02:16:20,047 --> 02:16:22,641
If you have escape in mind,
I can tell you that it's hopeless.

1816
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,430
- You will only die with me.
- I do not ask you to escape.

1817
02:16:26,431 --> 02:16:28,101
I make no such requests.

1818
02:16:28,263 --> 02:16:33,611
Here. Change this waistcoat of yours
for mine.

1819
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:36,731
Believe me, it's not going to work.

1820
02:16:36,897 --> 02:16:39,491
- The ribbon.
- It can't be done.

1821
02:16:40,693 --> 02:16:42,570
Take my coat. Hurry!

1822
02:16:42,736 --> 02:16:44,454
Don't you know,

1823
02:16:44,613 --> 02:16:48,584
every attempt to escape
from this prison has failed?

1824
02:16:48,742 --> 02:16:50,210
I implore you,

1825
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:53,213
do not add your death
to the bitterness of mine.

1826
02:16:53,956 --> 02:16:56,505
Do I ask you to walk out that door?

1827
02:16:56,667 --> 02:16:59,671
If I should ask that, then, refuse.

1828
02:16:59,837 --> 02:17:02,380
Now, sit down.

1829
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:05,134
I have something for you to write.

1830
02:17:06,802 --> 02:17:08,645
Sit.

1831
02:17:11,974 --> 02:17:13,942
Is your hand steady enough?

1832
02:17:14,101 --> 02:17:16,320
I was just writing
a last note to Lucie.

1833
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:17,479
Good.

1834
02:17:17,646 --> 02:17:21,071
Now you will write what I dictate,
exactly as I speak.

1835
02:17:21,275 --> 02:17:23,949
- To whom?
- To no one. Write.

1836
02:17:31,285 --> 02:17:32,582
Well, that's what he said.

1837
02:17:32,745 --> 02:17:34,588
- I may need you and Lebec shortly.
- Why?

1838
02:17:34,747 --> 02:17:36,374
This visitor looks quite ill.

1839
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:43,344
That I do so is no subject
for regret or grief.

1840
02:18:45,275 --> 02:18:46,322
Barsad.

1841
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:56,082
Well, look at me.

1842
02:18:56,245 --> 02:18:58,213
Now, do you think your hazard's
so great?

1843
02:18:58,372 --> 02:19:00,340
Not if you keep
your part of the bargain.

1844
02:19:00,499 --> 02:19:02,376
Take me to the coach.

1845
02:19:04,294 --> 02:19:06,717
- You?
- I, him, we are the same.

1846
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,723
I have merely exchanged my life.

1847
02:19:08,882 --> 02:19:11,977
You must leave
by the same gate we entered.

1848
02:19:14,012 --> 02:19:15,605
Right.

1849
02:19:21,812 --> 02:19:23,655
- He's unconscious!
- Of course.

1850
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:26,112
- You told me he might be weak...
- Didn't you notice?

1851
02:19:26,316 --> 02:19:28,944
I was weak and faint
when I arrived here,

1852
02:19:29,111 --> 02:19:30,791
and I am fainter
now that you bring me out.

1853
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:33,745
In fact, I am overcome.
Now hurry, man!

1854
02:19:44,126 --> 02:19:46,379
Guards!

1855
02:19:46,545 --> 02:19:48,462
You swear not to betray me?

1856
02:19:48,463 --> 02:19:52,343
I've come this far,
I will not stop now.

1857
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,893
Here he is, the fool.

1858
02:19:57,055 --> 02:19:58,855
He should know better
than to visit a prisoner

1859
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,735
if he can't bear up
upon seeing him.

1860
02:20:20,495 --> 02:20:22,839
- Are you ready, Miss Pross?
- Yes.

1861
02:20:22,998 --> 02:20:24,341
How is Dr. Manette?

1862
02:20:24,499 --> 02:20:25,716
He's all right now.

1863
02:20:25,876 --> 02:20:27,378
He understands what's happening.

1864
02:20:27,544 --> 02:20:29,064
- I think you better fetch them.
- Yes.

1865
02:20:31,089 --> 02:20:34,844
We won't be moving very quickly, sir,
if we all take this one coach.

1866
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:38,059
Hmm. What do you suggest?

1867
02:20:38,221 --> 02:20:40,019
Me and Miss Pross,
we'll hire another coach,

1868
02:20:40,182 --> 02:20:41,775
catch up with you later at the coast.

1869
02:20:41,934 --> 02:20:43,652
Yes. Have you got your papers?

1870
02:20:43,810 --> 02:20:44,857
We've got everything we'll need.

1871
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:47,523
- They won't be wanting us anyway.
- Hm.

1872
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,867
I think it's time we told them.

1873
02:20:51,026 --> 02:20:53,245
No need.
They'll find out for themselves.

1874
02:20:55,656 --> 02:20:56,873
Where is Mr. Carton?

1875
02:20:57,032 --> 02:20:59,376
In the coach.
Come, Doctor.

1876
02:21:08,043 --> 02:21:11,587
Dear God, do we have to leave now?
I can't bear it!

1877
02:21:11,588 --> 02:21:13,386
Please, my dear, in the coach.

1878
02:21:13,548 --> 02:21:15,016
Quick!

1879
02:21:16,718 --> 02:21:17,970
Charles!

1880
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:19,183
Yes, it's Charles.

1881
02:21:19,346 --> 02:21:21,474
He's all right, he's just drugged.

1882
02:21:23,141 --> 02:21:25,439
If you please, Doctor,
we must leave at once.

1883
02:21:25,602 --> 02:21:27,696
There's no time to lose.
Come on, quickly.

1884
02:21:27,854 --> 02:21:29,777
Help the child, Jerry.

1885
02:22:05,934 --> 02:22:08,904
- Your papers.
- Here you are.

1886
02:22:14,609 --> 02:22:16,486
Is he sick?

1887
02:22:16,653 --> 02:22:18,781
Asleep.

1888
02:22:26,371 --> 02:22:27,964
Thank you.

1889
02:22:32,169 --> 02:22:33,887
Move on.

1890
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:42,887
What do I care, eh?

1891
02:22:42,888 --> 02:22:45,983
What do I care for this Dr. Manette?

1892
02:22:46,141 --> 02:22:51,318
And I tell you, his daughter,
she is now an Evremonde.

1893
02:22:51,521 --> 02:22:53,364
And she will be the next to die.

1894
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:55,238
[Chuckles]

1895
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,653
She has a fine head for it.

1896
02:22:57,819 --> 02:23:00,072
Brown eyes and golden hair.

1897
02:23:00,238 --> 02:23:04,334
I cannot trust my husband in this.
I must act for myself.

1898
02:23:05,619 --> 02:23:07,747
I must act for myself, and quickly.

1899
02:23:07,913 --> 02:23:09,836
- Where do you go?
- To her, to the Manettes.

1900
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:12,592
She will be there,
waiting for her husband's death.

1901
02:23:12,751 --> 02:23:13,968
Ready to impeach anyone,

1902
02:23:14,127 --> 02:23:16,971
full of sympathy
for the enemies of the Republic.

1903
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:19,758
I shall then report
every word she says.

1904
02:23:19,925 --> 02:23:21,427
Wonderful. Marvelous.

1905
02:23:21,635 --> 02:23:22,761
Here, take this.

1906
02:23:22,928 --> 02:23:24,851
Have it at the guillotine for me
this afternoon.

1907
02:23:25,013 --> 02:23:26,936
I shall take my usual place.

1908
02:23:27,099 --> 02:23:28,942
He dies today.

1909
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:31,274
Be certain you are there.

1910
02:23:32,395 --> 02:23:34,818
Do you think I would miss it?

1911
02:23:40,237 --> 02:23:43,741
I'll leave you now, Miss Pross,
and fetch the coach.

1912
02:23:43,907 --> 02:23:46,751
I'll be ready when you return.

1913
02:23:55,627 --> 02:23:57,254
Oh!

1914
02:24:01,591 --> 02:24:04,219
I wish to speak
to the wife of Evremonde.

1915
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:05,433
Where is she?

1916
02:24:05,637 --> 02:24:06,980
She...

1917
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:10,734
She is resting now,
and she can't be disturbed.

1918
02:24:10,892 --> 02:24:12,143
I would see her.

1919
02:24:12,144 --> 02:24:14,363
And I say you will not disturb her.

1920
02:24:14,521 --> 02:24:16,615
Out of my way.

1921
02:24:16,773 --> 02:24:17,899
Madame.

1922
02:24:18,066 --> 02:24:20,237
You might be the wife
of the Devil himself,

1923
02:24:20,238 --> 02:24:22,112
but you will not get the best of me.

1924
02:24:22,279 --> 02:24:23,872
I am an Englishwoman.

1925
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:27,034
We have no quarrel.
I have come to pay my respects.

1926
02:24:27,035 --> 02:24:30,458
You have come here, Madame,
because your intentions are evil.

1927
02:24:30,662 --> 02:24:33,381
And you may depend
I shall hold my own against them.

1928
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:36,259
You will tell her
that I wish to see her.

1929
02:24:36,418 --> 02:24:39,342
I will not,
you wicked foreign woman.

1930
02:24:39,504 --> 02:24:40,756
I am your match.

1931
02:24:40,922 --> 02:24:45,678
Imbecile.
I will not take answers from you.

1932
02:24:45,844 --> 02:24:46,845
Get out of my way.

1933
02:24:47,012 --> 02:24:49,606
You will not have a handful
of that dark hair left

1934
02:24:49,764 --> 02:24:51,232
if you put a finger on me.

1935
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:56,228
Wife of Evremonde!

1936
02:24:56,229 --> 02:24:58,948
Answer me!

1937
02:25:01,067 --> 02:25:02,319
If she is gone from here,

1938
02:25:02,485 --> 02:25:04,085
I can have her followed
and brought back.

1939
02:25:04,237 --> 02:25:05,454
I can have her pursued.

1940
02:25:05,455 --> 02:25:06,915
They are not gone.

1941
02:25:07,073 --> 02:25:09,246
She's resting within
and shall remain there.

1942
02:25:10,076 --> 02:25:11,919
Listen to me, woman.

1943
02:25:12,078 --> 02:25:14,206
I have killed men
with knife and pistol,

1944
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:17,296
and I shall tear you to pieces
if you do not get out of the way.

1945
02:25:17,459 --> 02:25:18,881
Try it, Madame.

1946
02:25:19,044 --> 02:25:21,547
I am an Englishwoman.
Try it.

1947
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:26,723
[Sounds of struggle]

1948
02:25:38,104 --> 02:25:39,697
[Groaning]

1949
02:25:45,904 --> 02:25:48,748
Miss Pross! Miss Pross!

1950
02:25:48,907 --> 02:25:51,285
I've brought the coach!

1951
02:26:02,295 --> 02:26:04,093
Got everything?

1952
02:26:04,256 --> 02:26:07,180
- I'd best go in and check.
- No.

1953
02:26:07,342 --> 02:26:09,811
Are you all right, Miss Pross?

1954
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,688
I feel...

1955
02:26:11,846 --> 02:26:15,099
I feel as though
there had been a crash.

1956
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:18,980
And now, a stillness.

1957
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:22,194
A stillness for the rest of my life.

1958
02:26:56,558 --> 02:26:58,310
Outside!

1959
02:26:58,476 --> 02:27:01,400
Move! Keep moving! Come on!

1960
02:27:01,563 --> 02:27:03,406
Fall in, you men.

1961
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:05,190
Move along.

1962
02:27:10,697 --> 02:27:12,495
Come on.

1963
02:27:25,795 --> 02:27:27,422
Hang there!

1964
02:27:31,176 --> 02:27:32,598
I've done nothing.

1965
02:27:34,262 --> 02:27:36,390
I'm a seamstress.

1966
02:27:38,433 --> 02:27:40,811
It's not that I am afraid to die,
but...

1967
02:27:40,977 --> 02:27:42,354
I don't know why.

1968
02:27:43,897 --> 02:27:45,695
Yes, I know.

1969
02:27:47,233 --> 02:27:51,488
Monsieur, would you ride with me
in the tumbril?

1970
02:27:51,654 --> 02:27:54,248
- Would you hold my hand?
- Move it!

1971
02:27:56,659 --> 02:27:59,287
Yes, of course.

1972
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:03,091
I am only a little weak.

1973
02:28:03,249 --> 02:28:05,468
It will give me courage.

1974
02:28:06,336 --> 02:28:08,930
I would be proud to hold your hand.

1975
02:28:16,012 --> 02:28:17,685
Come on!

1976
02:28:23,103 --> 02:28:26,198
[Drumbeat]

1977
02:28:27,357 --> 02:28:29,701
Forward... march!

1978
02:28:33,196 --> 02:28:35,699
Traitors! Murderers!

1979
02:31:29,872 --> 02:31:31,124
[Crowd jeering]

1980
02:31:34,043 --> 02:31:35,545
FIE?

1981
02:31:35,712 --> 02:31:38,431
Keep your eyes upon me
and nothing else.

1982
02:32:06,701 --> 02:32:11,081
<i>"If you remember the words
that passed between us long ago,</i>

1983
02:32:11,247 --> 02:32:15,167
<i>you will readily comprehend this
when you see it.</i>

1984
02:32:15,168 --> 02:32:20,550
<i>I am thankful that the time has come
when I can prove those words.</i>

1985
02:32:20,715 --> 02:32:27,189
<i>That I do so
is no subject for regret or grief."</i>

1986
02:32:38,566 --> 02:32:40,739
[Crowd frenzy]

1987
02:32:53,081 --> 02:32:54,674
- Have you seen her?
- Who?

1988
02:32:54,832 --> 02:32:56,675
- Therese Defarge.
- No!

1989
02:32:56,834 --> 02:33:00,555
She's never late.
Today especially.

1990
02:33:03,299 --> 02:33:05,552
[Crowd screaming]

1991
02:33:58,521 --> 02:34:00,819
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

1992
02:34:01,441 --> 02:34:05,867
Kill him! Kill him! Yes!

1993
02:34:08,948 --> 02:34:12,168
It is a far, far better thing
that I do

1994
02:34:12,326 --> 02:34:14,579
than I have ever done.

1995
02:34:14,746 --> 02:34:19,422
It is a far, far better rest
that I go to

1996
02:34:19,584 --> 02:34:21,757
than I have ever known.
