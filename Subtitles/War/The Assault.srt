1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,300
THE ASSAULT

2
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,114
Far into the Second World War...

3
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,119
live Anton Steenwijk, his parents
and his brother Peter...

4
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,191
on the edge of Haarlem.

5
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,150
It's January 1945.
Almost all of Europe is liberated...

6
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,074
celebrating, eating, drinking
and making love.

7
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,118
But here in Haarlem
it's still war.

8
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,272
And winter.
The winter of starvation.

9
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,037
You always bring so many earthworms.
- From my bird cemetery.

10
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,590
I bury all the dead birds
that I find.

11
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,035
Open it.
I have my hands full.

12
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,715
What you put into Mother Nature,
you will also get back.

13
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,190
The banisters and the door
of the visitor's room.

14
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,998
The whole house will go.

15
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,754
My dad stokes the stove
with novels.

16
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,957
The heavy ones should weigh
the most.

17
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,195
Anton, you're forgetting the soup kitchen.
- Oh, yuck. Let Peter do it for a change.

18
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,239
Peter can't do it.
Imagine if there's a sudden raid.

19
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,875
We will go together, alright?
I have to go anyway.

20
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,479
I may not be on duty, but
it impresses people.

21
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,594
Hello, Mr. Aarts.
Hello, Madam.

22
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,712
Karin, Tonny, wait up.
Can you hold up for a moment?

23
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,115
You sure walk fast.

24
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,798
Do you mind if I walk with you?
- Of course not, Madam.

25
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,155
Then allow me to carry your bag, Madam.

26
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,517
There walks the Aarts woman
with her husband.

27
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,071
They always treat you like dirt.
- A little, yes.

28
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,268
Surely because he's in insurance.
That doesn't amount to anything in a war.

29
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Hello, Mrs. Aarts. Hello, Sir.
Nice weather, isn't it? For January.

30
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,715
Stir first. I want some of that
thick stuff from the bottom.

31
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,552
Of course, nurse.

32
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,510
And for my neighbours the same recipe.

33
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,999
I wish you'd go with us every day.

34
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,515
Hey, boys. Get out of there.
Are you mad?

35
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,796
Bunch of slobs.

36
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,108
Did you see how they greeted me, those Aartsen?
Pathetic.

37
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,869
Hey, it's your friend.

38
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,112
Hello, Anton.
Hello, Fake.

39
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,351
Say, do you know him?
Do you know that bastard?

40
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,191
That Ploeg is the beastliest
killer of whole Haarlem.

41
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,112
And you are greeting him, Tonny?

42
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,592
I only greeted Fake.
He's in my class.

43
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,998
Would you like a biscuit?
- Yes please, Mr. Beumer.

44
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,869
Home-baked from bean flour.
By Mina Bakgraag.

45
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,831
Do you like it?

46
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,039
Do you still have vacation?
- The school is closed. Coal scarcity.

47
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,156
I'm sure you don't have a problem with that.

48
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,276
Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,998
Listen. 'At the World Exhibition
in New York, a cylinder was buried...

50
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,232
containing a complete summary
of our technology.

51
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,795
Such as the Lord's Prayer, movie sequences,
novels and a 1938 lady's hat.

52
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,748
The cylinder will be opened again
in 5000 years.'

53
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,435
That's in the year 6938, dad.

54
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,673
I wish they'd buried that Homer
along with it. The damn translating.

55
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,070
I don't want to hear you say such things.

56
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,151
I think that's sensible.

57
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,156
Then the people of 6938 will understand
their present day much better.

58
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,438
Those who don't know their past,
don't understand their future.

59
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,397
Remember that, Tonny.

60
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,472
Can we? The table is set.

61
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,072
Not so quick. And chew,
that's the best for you.

62
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,074
What's wrong, mom?
- What is it, dear?

63
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,872
A button.

64
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,670
Not even made of bone. Even the buttons
in the soup aren't any good.

65
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,671
Does it hurt, mom?

66
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,951
The crown is broken.

67
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,590
No dentist anymore who can
do anything about it.

68
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,679
What are you doing?
- I'm putting in a clove.

69
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,799
It takes away the pain.
I remember that from my grandmother.

70
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,917
It helps right away, boys.

71
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,119
If we'll just finish our meal,
we can play a game later on.

72
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,878
See you tomorrow.

73
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,160
Same place, same time,
same nothing.

74
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,029
Peter, your translation.

75
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,234
As when through rain and melted snow-
swollen rivers...

76
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,914
streaming down from the hills...

77
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,356
into a valley cavity
their tremendous mass of water...

78
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,956
originating from abundant
sources...

79
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,793
join in their hollow bed...

80
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,750
and far away in the mountains, the herdsman
hears their dim-thundering roaring...

81
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,593
That's how the screaming sounded...

82
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,038
and the laborious battle of soldiers
getting in a fight.

83
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,914
How beautiful.
- Yes, very.

84
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,153
Especially if you work on it for 1.5 hours.

85
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,074
You don't realize that yet.
A traditional education.

86
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,232
It will be of use to you for
the rest of your life.

87
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,469
With the exception of some small
matters: Perfect.

88
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,240
<i>Wie lacht niet, die de mens beziet.</i>

89
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,755
What does that refer to?
- Nothing.

90
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,230
<i>Sunt pueri pueri pueri
puerilia tractant.</i>

91
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,313
'Children are children, and
children do childish things.'

92
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,790
We will go to bed soon.
- It's not even curfew yet.

93
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,873
We don't have a lot of carbid anymore.
- I want green.

94
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,918
You think you will win sooner then?
- Yes.

95
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,039
We will see about that.
- Well, are we still playing?

96
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,032
Let's throw and see who starts.
- Me.

97
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,636
Someone is shot.
- Peter, here. Stay here.

98
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,909
It's Fake Ploeg.
- Tonny, move away from that window.

99
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,834
Dead as a doornail, if you ask me.
- Ploeg?

100
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,592
Look.

101
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,958
God damnit.
- Hey, calm down a little.

102
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,190
The Krauts will get us now.

103
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,716
We didn't do anything.
- They don't care.

104
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,475
What are you going to do?
- Put him at Mrs. Beumer.

105
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,996
Better the old woman than us.
- How dare you?

106
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,994
Why should he lay at our place then?
- You say something, Willem.

107
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,275
A few seconds later
and he would have laid at her place.

108
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,954
Yes, but that's not the case.

109
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,148
He wasn't laying here either,
yet that's the case now.

110
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,153
I'm gonna put him back.
- You're playing with your life.

111
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,833
Not me, you.

112
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,717
Stay here.

113
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,793
You're all crazy.
Retards, all of you.

114
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,435
Hold it, don't move.
Hands up.

115
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,718
What's that?

116
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,990
Are they shooting at Peter?

117
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,991
Where is he?
- Round the back.

118
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,158
Peter.

119
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,232
Peter, sonny boy?

120
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,911
What should we do now?

121
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,357
Maybe he hid himself somewhere.

122
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,189
Why don't you wake up finally.

123
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,035
They're shooting at Peter.
Maybe he's already been hit.

124
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,876
Forgive me, Thea.

125
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,071
Forgive me.

126
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,669
It has gone well for so long
and now at the last...

127
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,834
Anton, put on a coat.
God, where is that boy?

128
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,994
Maybe at Korteweg. That's where
he ran to with Ploeg's pistol.

129
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,115
Did you really see that?
- Just when he walked away, he grabbed it.

130
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,432
He wouldn't...
I'm going to Korteweg.

131
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,672
Be careful, there's the guy
who was shooting at Peter.

132
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,712
Get inside, mom.

133
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,117
Yes, I'm closing the doors.

134
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,879
Open it.
- Open the door immediately.

135
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,951
They have the key...

136
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,396
Three men go upstairs.
The rest spread out.

137
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,951
Papers, quickly. Everything.
- We have nothing to do with it.

138
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,076
Shut up.

139
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,436
Ethica, more demonstrata geometrico.
Benedictus de Spinoza.

140
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,793
Is that right?
Are Jew books being read here?

141
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,592
I...
- Take off your hat when you talk to me.

142
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,995
I am principal clerk
of the court.

143
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,038
Shut up, Jew friend.

144
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,036
Where is the fourth one?

145
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,755
My 17-year-old son, scared
by this terrible event...

146
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,996
suddenly left the parental house
without saying goodbye.

147
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,675
He went in that direction.

148
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,879
You don't say, Mr. principal clerk!
He did?

149
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,713
Suddenly? Really?

150
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,474
Absolutely.
- Take them.

151
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,358
Tonny.
- Mom.

152
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,032
Wait here.

153
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,273
Here, take this.

154
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,073
Come.

155
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,356
Are we locking up kids now, too?
- No bullshit, open it.

156
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,036
Will my parents be brought here as well?
- That's a concern of the Germans.

157
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,034
Where should I leave him? They're all full.
- With the one in cell six.

158
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,672
The SD said Einzelhaft would go there.
- I'm the guard commander.

159
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,749
Try to get some sleep,
it's only for one night.

160
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,473
Sir?

161
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,035
What brings you here?
- Madam...

162
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,279
They set our house on fire.
- When? Just now?

163
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,353
Yes, a man was shot in
front of our house.

164
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,116
I mean, not at our house. At the neighbours...
- Jesus.

165
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,837
Were you home alone?
- No, with my father and my mother...

166
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,798
and my brother... He escaped.

167
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,398
He wanted...

168
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,956
What now?

169
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,509
Come.
Come sit here with me.

170
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,192
Ok now?

171
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,351
My name is An...
- Hush, I don't want to know that.

172
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,636
I'm not going to tell you my name either.

173
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,949
But one thing you should never
forget for the rest of your life.

174
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,590
What?

175
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't forget that the Krauts
set your house on fire.

176
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,756
Who did it, did it.
And not someone else.

177
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,471
I do know that, I saw it with my
my own eyes. The Krauts.

178
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,077
Yes, but they will say that the
illegals are responsible for it.

179
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,268
They know that if you kill such a
lout, there will be reprisals.

180
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,280
Do you know the name of that guy?
- Ploeg.

181
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,158
Softly.

182
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,156
Fake Ploeg. A bastard, he was with the
police. His son was in my class.

183
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,474
Did you see him? Was he really dead?
- Dead as a doornail.

184
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,153
You know, if the illegals
wouldn't have done it...

185
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,472
that Ploeg would have killed
a lot of other people.

186
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,151
Why are you crying now?

187
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,037
It's all so horrible.

188
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,351
The world is a hell. It's hell.

189
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,838
I'm glad it will all be over
soon. I've had it.

190
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,395
What will be over soon?
- The war. The war, of course.

191
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,475
The Americans are at the Rhine
And the Russians at the Oder.

192
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,108
How do you know that so well?

193
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,477
Dark, isn't it?

194
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,995
May I touch your face for a moment?

195
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,319
What's wrong?
- It's nothing, never mind.

196
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,828
Are you in pain?
- It's nothing.

197
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,833
Trust me.

198
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,398
I've seen it even darker recently.

199
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,438
No way.
- Yes.

200
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,751
I was with a friend
till long after curfew.

201
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,914
I went home at night.
I thought no one would see me.

202
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,596
I've lived in that neighborhoud for 25 years.
I walked that road hundreds of times.

203
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,558
I thought: I'll get home.

204
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,156
But suddenly I didn't know
where I was anymore.

205
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,357
I was afraid that I would
be walking in the Singel.

206
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,279
I was crawling on my hands and feet,
but that didn't work out either.

207
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,556
I waited until it was bright.

208
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,157
Did you cry?
- No, I didn't. But I was scared nonetheless.

209
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,718
I was there for a long time.
The silence I disliked the most.

210
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,919
It seemed as if I was all alone
on the planet.

211
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,196
Then what?

212
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,992
What do you think? I was right at my own
house. Five steps and I was in.

213
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,550
I stayed with my uncle in Amsterdam...
- Hush.

214
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,756
What was that?

215
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,714
I don't know.

216
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,793
Let's think about other things
while we still can.

217
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,677
What do you mean?
- Well, as long as we're still here together.

218
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,589
You will be released again tomorrow.
- What about you?

219
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,716
I might not.

220
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,598
We've talked about the dark.

221
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,754
Can we talk about the light now?
Yes, after darkness comes light.

222
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,628
I wanted to write a poem once
in which I compared love to light.

223
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,920
The most beautiful light I know,
is the light just after sunset.

224
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,428
A person who loves someone,
radiates such light.

225
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,833
There's a man who loves me and
so he's radiating that light.

226
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,754
Me too, because I love him too.
Even though he doesn't know that.

227
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,191
He thinks not...

228
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,157
but I love him.

229
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,960
He's married and his children
need him. Just like your parents.

230
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,591
Where would they be now?
- They are propably held somewhere as well.

231
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,719
They will be released tomorrow.
And your brother too.

232
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,671
He took the pistol of Ploeg.
Would the Germans mind?

233
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,751
Jesus...

234
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,032
Come here.

235
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,591
Unbelievable. You put him
with that saboteur?

236
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,790
Have you gone crazy?

237
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,348
That communist whore is going straight
to Amsterdam. Euterpestraat.

238
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,149
You may count yourself lucky that
she hasn't been rescued already.

239
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,959
Or else there would be some
heads rolling here.

240
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,112
What is this nonsense?
Who ordered this?

241
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,191
Someone from the Sicherheitsdienst.

242
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,711
I bet he wanted to arrange some
things in Heemstede.

243
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,155
Play santa after the war as
a friend of the resistance.

244
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,591
The Gestapo will be interested in hearing this.

245
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,878
Where does that blood come from?

246
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,598
It's not mine.

247
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,399
Damnit. It's hers then.

248
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,599
Get a doctor. We still need her.
Hurry damnit.

249
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,557
Damn Dutch. No wonder so
many of them get shot.

250
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,475
Chief inspector Ploeg.
Biking in the dark.

251
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,358
Stupid idiot.

252
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,475
The boy stays here.
Tomorrow he'll go back to his family.

253
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,718
What's this?
- He will stay here tonight.

254
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,552
Mr. Korteweg.

255
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,952
I have something for you.

256
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,111
A lard sandwich.

257
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,677
Do you like it?

258
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,032
Wash.

259
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,076
Her blood.

260
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,430
You to family in Amsterdam.
For the moment.

261
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,433
All papers are ready, understand?

262
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,398
There, and now clothes for the trip.

263
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,913
There.

264
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,078
Papers.

265
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,750
Take cover.
- Hurry, get out.

266
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,277
Get out.

267
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,952
Get up. The bastard will come back.
Hurry, damnit.

268
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,758
Schulz is hit.

269
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,879
Careful.
- He's still alive.

270
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,315
Slowly.

271
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,790
Come on. Hurry, you.

272
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,278
Wait here.

273
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,875
This boy must be brought
to police headquarters.

274
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,675
Now this. Come.

275
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,031
Take him to police headquarters.

276
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,958
He must be coming from headquarters?

277
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,431
Move on, general.

278
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,233
That was still missing.

279
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,515
We're getting reinforcements, general.

280
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,196
I want to see his papers.

281
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,195
Pull out the crap first.

282
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,193
He looks like a mug from the
Bialystok ghetto.

283
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,670
Give the boy coffee and cookies.
- There are no cookies today.

284
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,557
After an assault in Haarlem...
- There, I think you'll like that.

285
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,757
In which
chief inspector Ploeg was killed...

286
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,836
the SD ordered to kill the Steenwijk
family and 19 others.

287
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,595
The 12-year-old son Anton Steenwijk...

288
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,469
staid in prison that night at
the Heemstede police station.

289
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,200
Isn't that just amazing?

290
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,750
He was in a prison cell with a saboteur...

291
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,516
then he was brought
to the Ortskommandatur.

292
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,956
Have they gone crazy?

293
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,953
Aren't there any orphanages
in Haarlem?

294
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,558
From there he was brought to
Amsterdam, where his uncle lives.

295
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,431
I can't believe it.
The place was bristling with fighter planes.

296
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,390
Have they all gone crazy
in Haarlem? Unbelievable.

297
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,189
Lousy organisation.
Go ahead and laugh about it.

298
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,870
Take this.
Let the uncle come here.

299
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,279
Uncle Peter.

300
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,430
Come, let's go.

301
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,875
I left my coat.
- Let's go.

302
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,354
After the liberation, Anton staid in
Amsterdam, living with his aunt and uncle.

303
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,513
The night of the attack seems
indefinitely long ago.

304
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,192
The Russians and the Americans...

305
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,238
allies
in the war against the fascism...

306
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,269
are opposed to each other.
The East-West conflict begins.

307
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,556
War in Korea.

308
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,714
Anton doesn't meddle with politics,
no more than he does with his past.

309
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,475
After his final examinations he
studies medicine.

310
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,918
Just in 1952, Anton goes back
to Haarlem for the first time...

311
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,870
because a friend passed for his
Master's degree dental surgery.

312
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,590
Hey, Steenwijk. You're here after all.
- Gerrit-Jan, congratulations.

313
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,276
Am I still on time a bit?
- A bit. Join us.

314
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,150
As I said before,
you are of course spoilt boys.

315
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,030
You're only thinking of ways
to stay out of the army.

316
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,988
They don't even want you.
- Listen, lout.

317
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,030
If you'd only have an ounce of guts,
you'd voluntarily report for Korea.

318
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,194
That's where the barbarians pound on the
gate of the Christian civilization.

319
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,999
The fascists were nothing compared to that.

320
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,517
Why don't you go yourself and drive into
their brains with your weird shoe?

321
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,398
Nice ball.

322
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,998
Just like the university, Korea is
being run down by bastards.

323
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,030
Let's drink to the downfall of
all red fascism in all countries.

324
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,758
I should join them.
- There are former SS members in the legion.

325
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,310
They will get exemption
from prosecution then.

326
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,473
You are behind the times.
In Korea they can make up.

327
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,436
<i>Zeker zacht ei staart thans
peinzend in de verte.</i>

328
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,431
Yes, you Steenwijk.

329
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,672
And? What's your conclusion?
- How do you mean?

330
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,479
Dodge it or check in? What should we do?

331
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,478
I'm getting another beer.

332
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,679
Are you having a good time?
- I'm doing my best.

333
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,630
Good. Though you're looking
rather shitty, young man.

334
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:22,433
Yes, I think I'll just go around the
square for a moment. Excuse me.

335
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,238
Hey, damn Steenwijk.
The registration bureau is that way.

336
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,073
Tonny.

337
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,358
Tonny.

338
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,714
Tonny...
- Hello, Mrs. Beumer.

339
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,149
Tonny, boy. I...

340
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,039
Come here.

341
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,351
Just look who we have here.

342
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,599
Anton.
You know: Tonny.

343
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,636
How are you doing, Kees?
- Fine, Mr. Beumer. Thank you.

344
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,631
You too?

345
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,669
Do you want coffee?
We were just going to have our evening coffee.

346
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,392
Thank you, Madam.
- Please sit down.

347
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,511
Will you be sitting there?
That's not very comfortable.

348
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,276
This used to be my fixed spot when your
husband used to read with me. Remember?

349
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,391
Shall I help you?
- No, it's alright. It's almost done.

350
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,836
And the coffee was already done.

351
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,149
Why have you never dropped by before, Tonny?

352
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,391
It's the first time that I'm visiting
Haarlem again.

353
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,118
Oh, yes?

354
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,910
You're just as tall as your father.
I recognized you immediately.

355
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,677
We've talked about you so many times.

356
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:11,998
Say, he's very ill lately.
Just act as if you don't notice.

357
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,309
That you never came back before.

358
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,519
Someone was standing and watching at
the opposite side a couple of times.

359
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,035
Who was it?
- I don't know.

360
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,398
A man with an old coat
and a lady's bike.

361
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,316
Biscuit?
- Thanks.

362
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,719
Does Mr. Korteweg still live here?
- Him?

363
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,634
He moved right after the liberation.

364
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,394
Gone.
Nobody knows to where.

365
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,270
He didn't say farewell either.
Karin neither.

366
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,557
That was very strange.
Right, Bert?

367
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,310
Do you remember that the sanitation
department came by to pick up the fish bins?

368
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,833
Aquariums.

369
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,790
Those were terrariums, for his lizards.
- Yes, glass objects.

370
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,758
He was a very unhappy man.

371
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,833
After the death of his wife,
he came by a couple of times.

372
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,390
The Aarts people are still living there though.

373
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,759
And still pretty much to themselves.
They will never just come by and have a chat.

374
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,957
Just recently the Groenevelds asked...

375
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,032
they are living
in Korteweg's house now...

376
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,718
if Mr. Aarts wanted to sign as well
in order to get those weeds removed.

377
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,952
That bare and ugly spot
gives such a mess.

378
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,156
Where our house used to be?

379
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,877
I do understand.
Life goes on.

380
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,032
You are such a smart boy.

381
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,399
And so gentle.
You're just like your brother Peter.

382
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,755
Peter was just as gentle.

383
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,750
I saw that night how he still tried
to help that wounded man.

384
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,831
That bastard, that Ploeg.

385
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,757
And to us he always was just
as sweet.

386
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,718
Always such a good heart.

387
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,111
What are you going to do?
- Put him at Mrs. Beumer.

388
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,229
Better the old woman than us.
- At Mrs. Beumer?

389
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,995
Why was Ploeg shot in front of
your house?

390
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,159
It might just as well have happened
at our place. Or at Korteweg.

391
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,273
My husband always told me
that God saved us.

392
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,876
But then why didn't He save you?

393
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,114
And then your husband said: God didn't
because we are heathens.

394
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,197
Why your father?

395
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,678
I can still see him in front of me,
with his bowler and his umbrella.

396
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,719
And your mother.
They never hurt anyone.

397
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,599
Gherkins are like crocodiles.

398
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,710
What they must have lived through.
Your uncle did tell you that, right?

399
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,111
When your mother attacked
that guy of the SD?

400
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,189
They were killed like animals.
- Mrs. Beumer, I ehm...

401
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,718
Tonny, it's all so terrible.
I surely understand that you...

402
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,429
No, it's not that.
I was just...

403
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,513
Is this really the first time
that you are in Haarlem again?

404
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,831
Then you should visit the monument.

405
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,479
Monument?

406
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,111
Yes, it was unveiled by the
 mayor three years ago.

407
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,475
Down the street there.

408
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,953
We really hoped that we would see you again.
My husband was still in good shape back then.

409
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,478
Didn't you get an invitation then?
- Oh yes, I think I have.

410
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,599
Shall I go along with you?
- Well, I'd rather...

411
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,117
Yes. Of course, Tonny.
You want to be there alone.

412
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,118
Bye, Tonny.

413
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,348
When he starts working as a houseman
after his Master's exam...

414
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,878
the distant winter of starvation fades away
more and more into the shrouds of time.

415
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,198
1956. During the 20th Party Congress in Moscow...

416
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,911
Nikita Khrushchev reveals
the crimes of Joseph Stalin.

417
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,755
During the same year:
Revolt in Budapest...

418
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,595
knocked down by
Russian tanks.

419
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,993
In Amsterdam masses of
people are gathering...

420
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,075
at communist institutes.
Anton's room is around the corner.

421
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,953
Here, I'll screw you up.
Communist. Dirty bastard.

422
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,553
Communist.

423
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,037
Hello, Ton.

424
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,717
Hello, Fake.

425
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,557
Wine? Beer?

426
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,193
Beer.

427
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,517
Student, I presume?

428
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,071
This chair sucks.
- Otherwise, it's highly modern.

429
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,753
Come, sit here.

430
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,434
You haven't changed a bit.
- That's what I hear more.

431
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,591
I knew it was you right away.

432
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,390
I needed some time.
I haven't seen your father that often.

433
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,913
What are you studying?
- Medicines.

434
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:02,680
I work in a shop of domestic
articles. Repairs and the like.

435
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,910
At Haarlem?
- Haarlem...

436
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,635
Did you think we were still living
in Haarlem? In Den Helder.

437
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,828
Did you come all the way from Den Helder to...
- Yes. Strange, isn't it?

438
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,317
How did you get into plumbing?
You finished grammar school, right?

439
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,712
After the war my mother was
put into an NSB camp.

440
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,196
I was sent to the
<i>Bisschoppelijke Nijverheidsschool</i>.

441
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,477
I'm not even Roman, god damnit.

442
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,270
What did your mother do then?
- She was married to my father.

443
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,793
When she was released, we were
lucky enough to stay in Den Helder.

444
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,272
I went to technical school.
- Why not grammar school again?

445
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,193
You know nothing, do you? You.

446
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,275
What are you really thinking?
My mother became worker.

447
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,195
From five till nine at the morning
and five till nine at the evening.

448
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:15,718
We got our food that way. My sisters and I
couldn't go to grammar school from that.

449
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,437
Now she's in the hospital.

450
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,593
One leg is already amputated, the right
one is yellow with brown stains.

451
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,595
Water is dripping out and they don't
know what it is, so they say.

452
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,355
There, are you happy now?

453
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,192
Doctor.

454
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,195
That's the difference, isn't it?

455
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:52,356
Your parents get shot and still
you are studying medicines.

456
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,479
But my father gets killed
and I'm repairing geysers.

457
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,751
But your mother is still alive.
And your sisters too.

458
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,429
Besided, isn't there a difference between
how they both died?

459
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,158
What difference?

460
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,989
My parents were innocent.
- My father was too.

461
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,955
I only know what was told to me.
- Exactly.

462
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,154
But if you see the difference between us
that way, I don't understand that stone.

463
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,153
Then you should just become a communist.

464
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,637
The communism
is the worst of all.

465
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,916
That's what you see now in Boedapest...

466
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,312
where the urge for liberty of an
entire nation is being smothered in blood.

467
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,393
You're just memorizing
headlines.

468
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:04,839
Sorry, smart doctor. There is a mass
slaughter going on. Better now?

469
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,877
Haven't you read the papers?

470
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,750
About the horrors that are committed
there by Mongolian soldiers.

471
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,913
What do you mean, Fake? Is it
time now to gas the Mongols?

472
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,798
No, bastard.

473
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,229
Look at that scum.

474
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,510
My father was right.

475
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,390
Everything they say about communists
now, he was already saying in the war.

476
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,838
And it's those damn communists
who killed him.

477
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,154
You defend them.

478
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:47,792
They knew all along of reprisals and still
they shoot him in front of your house.

479
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,719
And has the war ended 1 second earlier by it?

480
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,436
My family wasn't killed by communists,
but by friends of your father.

481
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,755
Are you saying that it's my father's
fault that your family was killed?

482
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,472
Fake, you can still love your father
without having to justify things?

483
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,839
Just say honestly: He was wrong, but
he was my father and I love him.

484
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,629
Wrong? Wrong? Was he so wrong
about the communists?

485
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,555
Those outside thing exactly the same
way about it. Just look at it.

486
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,598
And he never knew about the Jews.

487
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,150
He picked up the people from their homes.
That's what he always did.

488
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,440
During Colijn he had to shoot at workers.
He never wanted to do that again.

489
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,155
That heater will go soon.

490
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,957
Do you know when my father became a
member of the NSB? In September '44.

491
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,755
When all those sham fascists
fled to Germany.

492
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,397
Action had to be done,
so he thought.

493
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,913
And for that belief, they shot him.
Not for anything else.

494
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,999
If they wouldn't have done that,
your parents would still be alive.

495
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:35,154
Perhaps my dad would have done time
in prison for a couple of years.

496
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,390
Surely the name of your father should have
been written on the monument then as well.

497
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,159
What monument?
- For the 29 hostages and my family.

498
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,313
Should they have included
'Fake Ploeg' there too?

499
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,559
God damnit.

500
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,631
When your house was set on fire,
we received the news about my father.

501
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,553
Have you ever thought about that?

502
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,793
I did about what happened to you,
but did you think of me too?

503
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,552
God damnit.

504
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,953
Fake.

505
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,070
I just wanted to say to you that
I will never forget that moment.

506
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,071
What moment?

507
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,194
The moment you just greeted me and
weren't ignoring me like all the others.
