00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,626
Maybe.

177
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,091
Over 64 inches tall,
more than 18 months' time on station,

178
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,296
first class PFT, financially stable,

179
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,805
38 months
obligated service, and you're single.

180
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,390
Like a rolling stone, ma'am.

181
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,439
Yeah, you're all clear.

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,560
Aside from that high level of maturity,

183
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,355
judgment and sound moral character part.

184
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,074
That part we might
still need to work on a little.

185
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,485
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.

186
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,821
I'll bet you will.

187
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,945
Okay.

188
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,413
You're so barking
up the wrong tree right there, my friend.

189
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,120
Many have tried and many have failed.

190
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,334
-I do like a challenge.
-Whoa.

191
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,865
Hey, hey, boys. Um...

192
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,792
Great. Can I just ask you a few questions?

193
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,786
I'm shooting footage for the embassy blog.

194
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,836
You work here?

195
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,340
Yeah, Blake Laureano.
I work for the Ambassador.

196
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,474
Hey, you're filming this?

197
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,179
I'm filming everything.
Everything and everyone.

198
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,349
Just getting some thoughts on how it feels to
work a world away from home.

199
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,139
What have you learned so far? Anything?

200
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,062
Worship the Ambassador,
learn to like playing video games,

201
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,195
guard Post One, avoid the RSO,

202
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,980
and don't try to date the cute computer lady

203
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,652
because that's apparently a lost cause.

204
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,819
That's awesome. I gotta go.

205
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,815
Yeah, so do we.

206
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,706
There he is. In the flesh. Ambassador Cahill.

207
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,959
CAHILL: Please, take a seat.

208
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,501
You ever talk to him?

209
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,712
Yeah, man. All the time.

210
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,046
"Yes, Mr. Ambassador. No, Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador."

211
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,380
Practice that and you'll be fine.

212
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,552
-Tracking.
-All right.

213
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,300
Then you're ready.

214
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,557
For what?

215
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
For why you're wearing blues.

216
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,485
Your first mission.

217
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,603
CAHILL: ...that I did not have new shoes.

218
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,320
My parents said that we didn't have
enough money for new shoes.

219
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,738
And that made me sad.

220
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,244
But then one day,

221
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,784
I met a new friend who said
he liked my old shoes.

222
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:09,503
That's when I realized that new friendships
were better than new shoes.

223
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,377
Great. Well, thank you very much.

224
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,973
That's okay. Thanks.
It's great to see you. Thank you for coming.

225
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,377
And thank you, ma'am.

226
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,470
(CHUCKLING) Good
to see you. Thanks very much. Well done.

227
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,644
Thank you.

228
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,221
So, day two in the Kingdom,
correct, Corporal Albright?

229
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,266
Yes, Mr. Ambassador.

230
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,562
Well, nice job.

231
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,233
You'd be surprised
how far a bit of compassion goes.

232
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,814
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

233
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,734
All right, kids. Let's go.
Let's get some ice cream.

234
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,283
So, Stamper, tell me
what the best thing about embassy life is.

235
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,992
The best thing about embassy life? Showers.

236
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,001
When Sunshine comes
in with that coconut shampoo, man...

237
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,085
You got jokes, huh?
Man, pass me the goddamn salt, man.

238
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,258
Now, look,
this is the best part about embassy life.

239
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,761
This right here,
this is how you never leave home

240
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,053
no matter where you're at.

241
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,102
-Gumbo is ready, fellas! Come and get it.
-Gumbo.

242
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,655
Welcome to the bayou.

243
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,397
Oh, nah, I'm good, man.

244
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,942
What?

245
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,606
I'm allergic to gluten. So...

246
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,653
Uh, you're allergic to gluten, huh?

247
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,281
-Man, get your ass outta here, man.
-Hey, hey, man!

248
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,777
-(LAUGHING)
-Allergic to gluten.

249
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,920
BLAKE: Okay, okay.
Now, tell us, why did you join the Marines?

250
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,757
Why do you think?
'Cause I piss red, white and blue.

251
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,756
My dad served and my pawpaw before him.

252
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,215
I'm a gunfighter raised
in a family of gunfighters.

253
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:35,104
Seriously, man,
come on. Tell us. I want the truth.

254
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,815
You can't handle the truth!

255
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,685
No, another bad impersonation

256
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,981
of Jack Nicholson is what I can't handle.

257
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,863
Come on, just tell us.

258
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,374
I joined the Marines to prove myself.

259
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,787
I joined the Marines to be the best.

260
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,907
(GRUNTING)

261
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:54,996
Move.

262
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,550
BLAKE: Gunny. Gunny!

263
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,342
Hey, stow that shit. We got work to do.

264
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,644
BLAKE: These guys,
they think of you as like this Marine Buddha.

265
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,351
What makes a great Marine?
Just give us one thing.

266
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,642
-You really wanna know?
-Yeah.

267
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,774
High-fiber cereal.

268
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:17,892
What?

269
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,270
Because if you don't shit right,

270
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,314
then you don't sleep,
walk or fight right, either.

271
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,691
Healthy and regular defecation,
that is the key.

272
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,825
And no, I'm not shitting you.

273
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,284
-What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
-ALL: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

274
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,368
Chill, man, chill, man. Chill.

275
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,091
You hear it first. Sleep tight. Shit right.

276

GUNNY: All right, Marines.

279
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,600

00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,969
raggedy-ass old embassy you see behind me.

They now have the Ambassador
trapped somewhere on the second floor.

Mohammed and his Royal Guard,

283
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,897
who generously allowed us to use
their training facility as our own,

284
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,986
will be playing the roles of the terrorists.

285
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,445
Fucking typecasting.

286
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,446

00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,906
in the role of the Ambassador.

immediately turn, head on a swivel.

says "gat" anymore. It's a gun.

be all right with the government

as long as their assets are safe,

326

all right with me. Are we clear?

You don't always have to be first, Albright.

a good Marine means coming in last.

I got Dracula.

this kid comes by selling falafels,

00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,939
You keep shit locked down till we get there?

692
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,097
What do you mean "we," Major?

693
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,308
Come on, Pete,

694
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,396
you didn't think I was gonna let you have

695
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,482
a party down there without me now, did you?

696
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,109
Locked and loaded, then, sir.

697
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:51,819
See you within the hour, Gunny.

698
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,450
Okay. MARSOC is en route.

699
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,117
Mohammed said he'd get help, too.

700
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,664
He made it through?

701
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,957
They're still an hour away.
So until then we're on our own.

702
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:04,424
Who the hell are "they"? What's MARSOC?

703
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,131
Marine Corps Special Forces.

704
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,674
The bad asses who got our backs.

705
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,835
BLAKE: And what if we're
dead in the next hour? What happens then?

706
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,094
OLIVIA: Well, then we won't
need to worry about what ifs.

707
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,888
CAHILL: How did this happen?

708
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:19,851
Mr. Ambassador, the room will hold.

709
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,773
It's the safest place to be right now.

710
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,192
I can't say the rest of this place

711
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,560
will still be standing around us, though.

712
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,020
They're going through everything.

713
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,815
What the hell do they think they're doing?

(SHOUTING)

715
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,322
They want to show America and its allies

716
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,365
the face of what they have caused.

717
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,786
What,

718
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:42,711
you think men
like my brother just woke up one day

719
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,369
and decided to hate the West?

720
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,252
You think that they do
not feel like America is the terrorist?

721
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,957
Hey, suck it, Ali Baba.

722
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,217
Don't even try
to feed us that jihadi propaganda bullshit.

723

KHALED: (OVER SPEAKERS)
I know you hear me.

724
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:00,892
I know you think
you are under attack from evil invaders.

725
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:05,195
And yet it is my home that you have invaded.

726
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,482
And now you
have even invaded my own family.

727
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,570
My brother,

728
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,030
he was a true jihadist.

729
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,743
A warrior.

730
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,121
Until you poisoned him.

731
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:21,914
Until our blood is no longer the same.

732
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,252
You hear me, brother?

733
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,963
We are no longer the same.

734
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,629
You are dead to the father,

735
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,051
and dead to the son,

736
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,876
and will soon be dead to all.

737
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,854
Jesus, we're in the middle
of a goddamn civil war here.

738
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,930
No shit.

739
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,886
He knows
I provided the intel for the drone strike.

740
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,310
This is revenge for him against all of us.

741
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,864
Cause and effect, my friends.

742
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,453
Sir, we need to get out there.

743
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,569
What?

744
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,413
What part of "safe house"
is it that you don't understand?

745
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:02,289
You saw 'em just now. They're gonna take
this place apart piece by piece.

746
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,949
There's still classified materials out there,

747
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,617
things we haven't had the chance to get.

748
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,584
Miss Winston,
there's at least 40-plus armed militants

749
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,134
in between us and your office right now.

750
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,499
We'll never get anywhere near it.

751
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:11,626
He's right.

752
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,050
It's not in my office.

753
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,800
It's in the Ambassador's residence.

754
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,798
What's in there, sir?

755
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,925
Is it really that important?

756
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:27,641
In a safe, there's Khaled al-Asiri's cell phone.

757
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:29,353
Jamal gave it to us.

758
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,437
It has information
on Khaled's entire organization.

759
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,106
Names, whereabouts, plans, everything.

760
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:39,322
It could save lives, stop the next
9/11, take down the entire group.

761
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,236
We go out the south exit
at the rear of the embassy.

762
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,915
It's a quick sprint from there.

763
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,795
All right, boys, new plan.

764
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,960
Snatch and grab.

765
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,466
Seriously?

766
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,758
It has information
that needs to be uploaded to a data cloud

767
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,263
and then wiped clean immediately.

768
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,225
I'm the only person that knows how to do it.

769
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,346
I'm in.

770
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,193
Lopez, Hansen?

771
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,728
Shit.

772
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,614
What about us, sir?

773
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,820
Your job is to keep these people safe.

774
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,688
Speaking of which,
Olivia's gonna need your vest.

775

776
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,375
That's was a Royal Guard.

777
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,866
-Boots on the ground?
-Yes, sir,

778

779
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,711
They're sending in a platoon
to back our boys up now.

780
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,253
A platoon? That's it?
That's all you could get?

781
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,707
I couldn't get anything, sir.

782
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:37,875
The embassy Marines did this.

783
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,773
A Marine goes down on duty,
they call it an act of valor.

784
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:52,902
A civilian at the US Embassy,
that's a national tragedy.

Now, she's a civilian,
she's also your team now.

00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:17,063
-Get the fuck out of there!
-Roger that!

869
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,359
We gotta go, Olivia! Now!

870
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:23,191
(GRUNTING)

871
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:31,158
Yes!

872
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,401
Fuck!

873
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,831
Got it! Got it! Let's move!

874
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:14,744
Package in hand!

875
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:16,914
Then go, God damn it! Go!

876
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:18,707
Lopez! Come to me! Come to me!

877
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:20,384
Moving!

878
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:21,584
Move!

879
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:32,967
RPG!

880
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,017
Go, go, go!

881
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:36,098
Shit!

882
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:41,654
-Oh, shit!
-Jesus Christ!

883
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,398
Can they survive that?

884
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,744
We're out, but pinned down!

885
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:55,795
North side of the residence.

886
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,830
Where's the north side monitor?

887
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:00,957
Anyone see them?

888
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:05,841
Gunny, we're stuck. Where are you?

889
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,426
GUNNY: Now, Albright! Now! Go, go!

890
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,173
Christ!

891
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,880
Gunny?

892
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,144
Gunny, can you hear me?

893
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:58,012
Gunny!

894
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:03,853
(MOUTHING)

895
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,776
Come in, Gunny!

896
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,665
(OVER RADIO) Gunny, come in!

897
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,485
He's gone, man.

898
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,623
What?

899
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,292
HANSEN: He's dead.

900
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,334
Oh, man, fuck!

901
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,212
This is bullshit.

902
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,330
I said they're fucking gone!

903
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,626
Okay? They're all gone.
Fucking Mohammed, all of 'em.

904
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,633
What the fuck!

905
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:34,678
You happy now?

906
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:38,473
At least four of my friends are dead!

907
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:40,559
Is this fun for you?

908
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,483
Do you wish you could be out there,
and be a part of it?

909
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,902
Dave! Dave! Easy! Dave! Easy, Dave! Easy!

910
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,032
Listen to me!

911
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,397
That side shit doesn't matter now, okay?

912
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:54,534
They're coming for him, too.

913
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:57,571
Well, maybe we should
just hand him over, man.

914
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,490
See if they go away.

915
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:00,696
Look, man.

916
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:01,954
Chill.

917
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,583
We don't have time for that.

918
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,536
Today we gotta be on the same side.

919
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:11,415
This is it.
We're all gonna fucking die, aren't we?

920
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:14,762
Gunny was the only guy
that had his shit together.

921
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,300
If Billy Bad Ass
doesn't make it, how the hell are we?

922
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:19,468
We're all gonna fucking die!

923
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,805
No one's gonna die, Blake.

924
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:25,226
Corporal Albright?

925
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,690
Corporal, what do you want us to do?

926
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,273
What?

927
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,783
You're asking him?

928
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,779
No offense, Mr. Ambassador, he just got here.

929
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,200
He doesn't know shit.

930
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,370
Yet he was the only
one of you who saw this coming.

931
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:44,002
He was the only one of you who tried to do
anything to stop it from happening.

932
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,463
BLAKE: We are so dead.

933
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:53,594
What do you wanna do, Corporal?

934
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:03,814
Say again your last?

935
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,266
Say again your last?
You're coming in broken and stupid.

936
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,774
We got 'em.

937
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,192
This is Major Lincoln. Who is this?

938
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,820
Corporal Evan Albright, sir.

939
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:15,152
We're all clear.

940
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:17,952
Where's Gunny Raines?

941
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:19,572
Dead, sir.

942
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,245
We could really
use your help right around now, sir.

943
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,084
We're inbound in 20 mikes.

944
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:32,958
Twenty mikes?

945
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:34,878
LINCOLN: Hang in there, Marine.

946
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,379
We will be there.

947
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:38,005
We'll get there as fast as we can.

948
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:40,336
Yes, sir.

949
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:43,303
You just keep the Ambassador
and the rest of those civilians safe

950
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,847
until we get there.

951
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:47,517
Will do, sir.

952
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,034
CAHILL: He can't win.

953
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:02,366
We've worked too hard
to go back to what was.

954
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:04,741
I changed hearts and minds here.

955
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,167
You know, I honestly believe that.

956
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,286
I have to believe that.

957
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:18,214
Something's burning.

958
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:22,885
It's us.

959
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:31,982
Shit, it's probably
from the explosion on the roof.

960
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:33,981
What kind of safe room is this?

961
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,984
Well obviously, it's not safe anymore.

962
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,465
What are you doing?

963
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,129
This is classified, you shouldn't be here.

964
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:01,755
I said, what are you doing, Olivia?

965
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,011
I knew it.

966
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,676
I told you, this is classified.

967
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,063
You could be court-martialed
for even saying anything else.

968
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,429
Hey.

969
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:13,895
Gunny is dead. Ski is dead.
Mohammed is dead, Olivia.

970
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,437
You really think I give a shit about

971
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,650
being court-martialed right now?

972
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,323
How much money is in there?

973
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,651
It was enough to keep this place peaceful.

974
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,370
So that's the Ambassador's magic touch.

975
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,124
A pile of cash.

976
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,788
The Ambassador's a good man, Evan.

977
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:32,618
He was asked to come here
and cool off a hot zone, and he did that.

978
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,626
Yeah, 'cause it's just breezy
around here right now, isn't it?

979
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,417
Democracy's a big machine,
this keeps her wheels spinning.

980
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:42,799
Passion, dignity,
hope, and money. That's the way it works.

981
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,465
-And now you're just burning it?
-We don't have a choice.

982
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,426
If proof of this got out,
we'd lose all credibility in the region.

983
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:50,312
No honor amongst thieves?

984
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:54,141
I don't have the luxury
of looking at things as black and white, Evan.

985
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,266
Not out here. Nothing is.

986
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:57,943
It's a lot easier for the world to end

987
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,611
as we know it than most people believe.

988
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,320
We make the wrong move,

989
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,320
hesitate for a second
when we shouldn't, and it's over.

990
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,609
Oh, my God.

991
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,197
You're a fucking spook, aren't you?

992
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:10,329
I'm a fucking realist.

993
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:15,288
And my loyalty
is to my country, not my convictions.

994
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,515
(PANTING)

995
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:35,143
(BLAKE COUGHING)

996
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:37,305
They're all over the place out there.

997
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,479
All this smoke coming from the roof?

998
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:43,784
Yeah. We've done
the best we could to slow it down.

999
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:48,621
Stamper, come in.

1000
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:50,533
Albright?

1001
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,659
How's everybody doing there?

1002
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,537
Hansen just made it back, but we're fucked.

1003
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,618
The goddamned building's on fire.

1004
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,078
(OVER RADIO) We can hardly breathe in here.

1005
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,129
MARSOC's still 20 minutes out.

1006
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,381
Oh, shit.

1007
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:04,881
BLAKE: I know, right?
It's like what happened at Benghazi.

1008
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:06,515
Everyone died of smoke inhalation.

1009
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,593
Let me tell you something, Blake.

1010
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:11,098
If I go out here,

1011
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:15,233
it sure as hell
ain't gonna be from sucking in no smoke.

1012
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:17,056
We're gonna have to handle this ourselves.

1013
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:20,306
You know we're still way fucking
outnumbered here, right?

1014
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,727
Yeah, well, I'm not waiting to get
rescued and I'm not waiting to die.

1015
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,526
We're getting the hell out of here, all of us.

1016
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:26,899
How?

1017
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,528
We're gonna slip out the back.

1018
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,120
(SCOFFING) Oh, check out
the big brain on Brad.

1019
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,661
Why didn't I think of that?

1020
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:34,874
The rear gate's theirs.

1021
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:37,077
There's a team of hajis out there with an RPK

1022
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:38,872
just waiting for us to give that a try.

1023
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:40,921
Can you make it there?

1024
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:42,838
Not directly. No fucking way.

1025
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,710
Yeah, I hate to say it, man, but he's right.

1026
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:46,965
The whole place is infested.

1027
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,470
Our best option might be
the northeast fire exit.

1028
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:52,352
I don't know what the hell
you guys are talking about.

1029
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:53,429
You're just as fucked.

1030
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:56,602
You got tangos out front and two
tactical sitting on your back porch.

1031
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:58,599
The trucks are out back?

1032
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:00,603
All right, you gotta move.

1033
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:01,767
We're coming to you.

1034
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,395
Come to us? What the fuck
are you talking about, John Wayne?

1035
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:05,942
You gotta trust me, man.

1036
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:10,946
Stamper, you with me?

1037
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:14,704
Goddamn cowboy.

1038
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:16,085
Fucking right!

1039
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,119
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

1040
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,003
This is our house.

1041
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,634
Let's show these motherfuckers how we do it.

1042
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,960
Let's show 'em! Let's get some!

1043
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:27,515
