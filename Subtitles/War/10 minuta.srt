1
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,713
Memo, son, are you coming?!

2
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,915
Easy, easy...

3
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,629
Mum would not let you...

4
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,152
No, no... my sweet baby...

5
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,317
This is gonna burn, Memo!
Go and get some water.

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,438
Come on, dear! And bring some
bread. Dad will be coming soon.

7
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,751
Let us put the plates...
let us put...

8
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,594
don't, my honey,
don't my sweetheart...

9
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,033
Memo, get going, aren't you
listening to what I say!

10
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,070
Look, look...

11
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,637
Eh, why don't you go and get it?
- Ok.

12
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,233
Ok?!
- Ok, I'll go now.

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,993
No, my honey, no, my baby...
baby mine...

14
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,872
Where are you going?

15
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,157
What's up?
- Nothing much...

16
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,668
Leave that!

17
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,269
But you are going to show me?
- I will, once you come back.

18
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,948
You'll show me how to assemble
and dismantle it, all!

19
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,799
Come on, take care.
They are shelling like hell today.

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,515
Honey, come to me, honey!
- Come on, hold her for a minute.

21
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,072
Come on, sweetheart... Come on,
it's high time for you to go!

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,032
Take care, Memo!

23
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,033
Hey, boy...

24
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,360
Where is the video recorder?
- I'll get it to you!

25
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,240
What do you mean by that?
I'll pay for it.

26
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,600
What about the washing machine?
- I'll get that as well...

27
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,558
What about the spare part?
Fuck it...

28
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,634
Good afternoon, how are you!
- Good afternoon!

29
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,275
U want to get out?
- Later.

30
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
Halo!
- What is it?

31
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,549
Sniper...
- Let me go!

32
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,510
Hey, boy, has your dad
come from the trenches?

33
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,509
Tell him to come to Ahmo's.

34
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,033
They should introduce
the shifts... 24-48.

35
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,958
So that, when you come home...
you come home.

36
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,640
When I come home,
I have not time

37
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:12,880
to get the water warmed up
let alone use it all.

38
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,677
I mean it, trust me.
Leave the gun!

39
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,194
Look, there is Memo!
Where have you been, chap? What is up?

40
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,392
Listen! The guy with bread
will come now.

41
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,116
Here is a cigarette for you,
go and get us some bread, please

42
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,073
I want the gun!
- See Memo the merchant...

43
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,033
Come on, here are two for you,
I am left with one now...

44
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,151
Come on, get one loaf
for the two of us.

45
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,554
And what did your wife say?

46
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,672
Nothing, she told me to go to
the logistics... What did you play?

47
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,514
Come on, folks, go to the shelter.
They have started shelling again.

48
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,153
We have to eat!

49
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,318
Come on, you... why do you
always have to make trouble!

50
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,992
Don't get in!

51
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,313
Let me go!
