01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,797
Money and social standing
have got nothing to do with it.

695
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:28,341
A gentleman always tries to do
the right thing.

696
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,974
Where have you been?
School, of course.

697
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,894
What, with the dumb bugger, Pop-Eye?

698
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,445
Mum, I know you talked Mr Watts
into coming back.

699
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:49,408
(Both laugh)

700
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:53,700
TOM: This will remove Pip
from the protective comfort of home

701
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,573
to the unknown metropolis.

702
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,836
Metropolis. Uh... Alright.

703
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,832
Let's say that this here
is our little village.

704
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:10,213
In Pip's time, greater London
would be this immense metropolis.

705
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,135
We've got a new roof on our place.

706
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,600
(All laugh)

707
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,356

(Street vendor calls out)

709
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,653
Tag! Can't catch me!

710
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,746
(Women converse)

711
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,957
Pip'

712
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,172
Iii: I I

713
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,425
Sorry, would you excuse us, Herbert?

714
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,554
What's wrong?
It's nothing.

715
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,928
I'm just... I'm running late for
a meeting with Miss Havisham.

716
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,555
I'll walk with you.

717
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:07,357
No, it's the young Miss Havisham,
Estella.

718
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,947
Anyways, it was very nice to see you.

719
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,447
Who was that, Handel?
Nobody.

720
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,991
MATILDA: His name is Pip.

721
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:22,583
Or have you abandoned that too,
along with Joe and everyone else?

722
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,379
And you're so much better?

723
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,218
I'm sorry, Matilda, but you have no idea
what is expected of a gentleman.

724
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,259
I do. I just don't see one here.

725
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,787
Do you not <i>have</i> your own shadow
to play with?

726
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:05,502
Shit. Matilda. What are you doing
creeping around here?

727
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:10,749
What Estella says to Pip - do you not
have your own shadow to play with?

728
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,881
Yes. Very good.

729
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,804
Do you want to write this down?

730
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,992
Dxd Mrs Watts read Great Expectatxons?

731
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,952
Grace?

732
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,666
Sadly, no.

733
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,830
She tried.

734
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,546
Till finally she said
that she would reach the end

735
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:55,920
if I would do the same with the Bible,
and that was that.

736
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,633
The thing is, you can't really pretend
to read a book.

737
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,180
Your eyes will always give you away.
Your eyes and your breathing.

738
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:12,027
The house could be on fire
and a reader deep in a book

739
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:17,491
wouldn'l even notice
until the wallpaper was in ﬂames.

740
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:26,538
And for me,
Great Expectations was such a book.

741
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:33,256
It <i>gave</i> me permission to...
change my life.

742
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,005
Reinvent myself.

743
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,177
Matilda.

744
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:53,436
There's a boat leaving
the night after the full moon.

745
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,069
Gilbert's father could take us out
to meet it.

746
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,693
A few hours on the open sea
and you'd be in the Solomon Islands.

747
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,742
And Australia?

748
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:08,583
Well, in the Solomons,
it'd be up to you.

749
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,915
Your mum too, Matilda.

750
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,970
But it's very important that
you don't tell anyone about this,

751
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:24,637
not even Dolores,
uniil I give the word.

752
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,385
Understand?

753
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,484

We need medicines.

765

What medicines we had, you burned.

766
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,582
Lasi time we were here, you were
concealing a man named Pip.

767
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:42,677
Have you decided to hand him to me yet'?

768
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,685
I thought not.

769

771
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,046
I will ask you again for your name.

772
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:51,863
My father's family name being Pi rrip,
and my Christian name Philip,

773
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,956
my infant tongue
could make of both names

774
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,542
nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip.

775
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,913

and came to be called...

No, Daniel.

Sir, I saw your men chop up
the white man and feed him to the pigs.

814
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,236
He was a good man.
I'm here as God's witness.
