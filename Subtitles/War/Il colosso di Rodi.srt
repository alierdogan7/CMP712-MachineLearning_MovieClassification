1
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,420
Let's go. Hurry.

2
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,939
Come. This way. Hurry.

3
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,919
Sound the alarm.

4
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,319
Extraordinary spectacle, uncle.

5
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,430
Fit for an Oriental court.

6
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,199
Amuse you, Dario?

7
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,110
Spectacles always amuse me.

8
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,370
You like my island of Rhodes?
Even more than your native Greece?

9
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,980
After the fatigue of war, l knew you'd like
a short stay on the island of peace.

10
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,579
And this perfume. What is it, uncle?

11
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,379
Roses, my son.

12
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,480
Rhodes is also the island of flowers.

13
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,490
'
And beautiful women
from what l can see.

14
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,420
ln Rhodes, even the women
have a special fragrance.

15
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,889
A mixture made out of sunshine...

16
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,480
...petals of flowers, the sea--

17
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,680
And flesh.

18
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,560
At my age,
that's a superfluous ingredient, Dario.

19
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,730
You have designed and built...

20
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,550
...one of the greatest monuments
of all time, Carete.

21
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,009
You, Carete, have made it possible
for posterity to learn of the strength...

22
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,860
...and power of King Serse.

23
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,310
Rhodes now dominates the seas.

24
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,360
Perhaps our ceremony is not to the liking
of the gods.

25
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,649
The monument surely seems to be a threat
to their omnipotence.

26
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,060
l assure you both, it's not true.

27
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,459
l know the gods could only be delighted
that a monument so imposing...

28
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,470
...was built in their honor.

29
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,620
lt is a proud day
for the king of Rhodes.

30
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,549
For you, Apollo, god of the sun...

31
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,340
...we humbly dedicate
this magnificent statue...

32
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,590
...conceived and born
from the divine mind of our king...

33
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:54,720
...and gloriously realized
by the quiet labor of his loyal subjects.

34
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,190
May the sacred fire burn always
on this altar in the sky...

35
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,580
...and guide those who sail in the night.

36
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,990
And may it strike terror and awe...

37
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,379
...in the hearts of those
who would plot against Rhodes.

38
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,220
Burn, oh, fire.

39
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,720
May your flame be as eternal
as the glory of King Serse.

40
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,600
Very relaxing, your island of peace.

41
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,950
lf only he had talked to us about it.

42
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,590
What could he have hoped to do
all alone?

43
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,419
Poor Rianos.

44
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,230
What a great waste.

45
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
No, Mirte.

46
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,870
Our fight is more important now
because of Rianos.

47
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,419
The people in Rhodes do not want slavery.

48
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,070
This Colossus was erected in blood.

49
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,370
They worked and labored on it
for 10 years...

50
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,429
...because of the whim of a ruler.

51
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,700
Our brother hoped he could
inspire a rebellion.

52
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,159
That's not enough.

53
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,100
Our people need supplies and arms.

54
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,440
Not only inspiration.

55
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,860
The Greeks. They'd help us.

56
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,240
They'd be happy to aid our cause.

57
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,940
They don't even know our cause exists.

58
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,299
There's no help from them.

59
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,600
lf only we could talk to someone
who might persuade the Greeks to aid us...

60
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,299
...a man the Greeks respect,
a man like that visitor, Dario.

61
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,769
He's a great warrior in Greece.

62
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,840
l wonder if we dare approach him?

63
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,799
Brothers, if you like, l will go to Dario.

64
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,210
No, Mathos.
We could not appear at court.

65
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,240
All four of us are too well known
as opponents of the regime.

66
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,799
l'm sorry, Mathos.

67
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,429
Always fiddling with toys.

68
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,480
This might not be a toy at all.

69
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,500
Thar...

70
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,730
...the splendor of our court is pleasing,
don't you think...

71
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,419
...to the ambassador of Phoenicia?

72
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,960
He seems to be enjoying it.

73
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,950
However, sire, your great wealth
could propagate ill will, envy.

74
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,179
And you envy me?

75
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,440
l only admire.

76
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,370
My profound loyalty to you only permits me
one emotion, that of great admiration.

77
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,120
There's no doubt that you people know
how to amuse yourselves.

78
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,889
l think my mother was right when she said
this island was a wonderful place.

79
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,350
Your mother knows Rhodes?

80
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,590
She was born here, Diala.

81
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,200
lt's surprising when a stranger
admires the island as you do.

82
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,919
Oh, l'm only half a stranger.

83
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,100
l already know quite a few people here.

84
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,000
Take that man over there, for instance.

85
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,549
He's been staring at me
ever since the celebration began.

86
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,759
There's so little opportunity
to stare at great heroes here.

87
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,809
Nectar of the Euphrates.

88
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,039
An offering
from your humble palace servant.

89
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,250
l think you ought to reward these people.

90
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,750
Let us allow him the first drink
in gratitude for such devotion.

91
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,519
My boy...

92
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,049
...you drink it.

93
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,080
Drink or you'll be beheaded.

94
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,269
Somehow l've lost my desire for wine.

95
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,710
No need to do without wine, Dario.

96
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,700
Just never be the first one to drink.

97
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,000
Have the assassin taken away.

98
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,440
You seem to know Rhodes well.

99
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,059
Tell me something.
Is this a celebration or a massacre?

100
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,619
lt's not our affair. l'm not concerned.

101
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,450
Well.

102
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,279
l think we ought to watch out.

103
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,400
You must be used to death.

104
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,099
The second in one day
is too many in time of peace, l think.

105
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,660
l want to forget it.

106
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,109
Shall we go outside?

107
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,789
Noble sir...

108
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,450
...when may l speak to you?

109
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,890
l'm quite busy, right now.
Tomorrow, if you wish.

110
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,000
lt's beautiful.

111
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,589
A marvelous garden.
Of course, the enchantment of nature...

112
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,299
...is always enhanced
by the presence of a lovely lady.

113
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,720
Now you sound like a poet.

114
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,839
l shall have to be quite careful.

115
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,089
No more so than you are now.

116
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,390
You avoid my eye.

117
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,029
There.

118
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,880
What, you mean you haven't already
succumbed to my look?

119
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,500
Do all girls find you so irresistible?

120
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,349
Not all of them, but some of them
l commit the same error.

121
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,049
What?

122
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,220
Well, with some...

123
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,849
...l waste too much time.

124
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,549
Diala.

125
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,039
Diala?

126
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,059
Diala.

127
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,880
The whole dynasty is here.

128
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,349
Diala?

129
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,730
Dario.

130
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:40,950
''Emone.''

131
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,380
''Cleo.''

132
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,369
''Nestore.''

133
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,670
''Gerione.''

134
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,670
No name here.

135
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,859
''Artidorous.''

136
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,829
-''Filomena--''
-Dario.

137
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,250
Pardon me. Was that you?

138
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,420
Have you forgotten me already?

139
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,369
Well, l followed you here.
Isn't that enough?

140
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,960
Perhaps you need more
proof of my ardor.

141
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,099
Why did you bring me here?

142
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:36,670
To be alone with you. To speak.

143
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,599
l command you
to say something beautiful.

144
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,910
Being so close to you,
l've lost my voice...

145
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,690
...even my breath.

146
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:47,769
Then you shouldn't stay here.

147
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,430
Your cheek...

148
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,259
...is fresh as the morning dew.

149
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,660
Your ear, a flower about to bud.

150
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,529
And my lips?

151
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:05,930
Your lips--

152
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:17,940
Diala.

153
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,140
l'm sure you'll find
some good company in there.

154
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,480
Good company indeed.

155
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,000
The proposal as it is offered
does appeal to me.

156
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,690
As the ambassador states, Rhodes
and Phoenicia would control the sea.

157
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:06,319
But will not Greece protest an alliance
between us and their enemy, Phoenicia?

158
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,569
Yes, naturally.

159
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,029
And we have always been a friend
to Greece.

160
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,029
l think l should consider Rhodes
before l think of Greece.

161
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:18,089
The Colossus in our harbor makes us
the strongest port in the Mediterranean...

162
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,250
...for the reason that it provides
an impregnable harbor...

163
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,660
...for our ships
and the ships of our friends...

164
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,410
...beginning naturally with Phoenicia.

165
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,880
lmagine the surprise of the Greeks...

166
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,549
...when their ships are plundered
by the Phoenicians...

167
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,440
...who then take refuge in Rhodes.

168
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,490
What makes you think
the Greeks don't already suspect us?

169
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,380
Please.

170
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:05,250
l was hoping this doorway
would reveal the secrets of this labyrinth.

171
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,000
Can you explain how you got into it,
Dario?

172
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,660
Got in? Well, more exactly, l fell in.

173
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,930
l was standing, leaning against the wall.

174
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,849
Suddenly, the wall turned around.

175
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,400
And there l was
on the other side of the wall.

176
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,789
Well, that is, l was on this side.

177
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,970
l was chasing a girl.

178
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,910
l pray your pursuit be continued, Dario.

179
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,309
Thank you. Thank you.

180
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,849
l hope you'll accept my--

181
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,049
My apologies.

182
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,539
Thar, do you think that young Greek
meant to spy on us?

183
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,240
lt's likely.

184
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,930
However, no need to be alarmed.
l have foreseen something like this.

185
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:04,730
So much tension on Rhodes...

186
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,130
...l thought it wise to order that no one
be allowed to leave the island.

187
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,009
Especially a soldier of Greece.

188
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,960
-Now, shall we proceed?
-Yes, by all means. Proceed.

189
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,460
Your island from this point
on to the other side is impregnable.

190
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,119
The only spot accessible is your harbor.

191
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,799
Our Phoenician ships, loaded
with Greek booty, will take refuge there.

192
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,410
The Colossus pours out molten lead
on those who might pursue us here.

193
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,119
Your island, in its enviable position
in the middle of the sea...

194
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,180
...is more precious than gold.

195
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,700
We Phoenicians are happy
to split the booty in half.

196
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,619
Do you mean that?

197
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,440
Good counsel, Xenon.

198
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,859
ln order to accept,
l must make this one condition.

199
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,339
The port is open to no more than
three Phoenician ships at one time.

200
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,309
And no more than 200 men are to enter.

201
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,589
We would not want
the Mediterranean powers...

202
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,630
...to misinterpret
the intentions of this pact.

203
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,430
They must not think we are ruled
by Phoenicia.

204
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,740
l accept.
May this project benefit both you...

205
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,690
...and my king.

206
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,670
Thiel.

207
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,970
-Well, did you speak to Dario?
-No.

208
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,160
He was too concerned with a woman
tonight.

209
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,400
l'll try again.

210
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,910
-l'll try again in the morning.
-No.

211
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,089
We must see him tonight.

212
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,420
We'll get to him somehow, Thiel.

213
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,769
Now you must go.
You've risked enough already.

214
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,309
But--

215
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,079
Go. Hurry.

216
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,759
Carete and his daughter are Greeks,
aren't they?

217
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,359
No. He and Diala are from Lydia.

218
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:10,269
l thought only a Greek mind could have
created such a beautiful work of art.

219
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,160
Oh, you mean the Colossus?

220
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,539
These awful storms.

221
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,069
l've lived on this island all my life.

222
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,079
You'd think l would have
got used to them by now.

223
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,289
Are you afraid of thunder?

224
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,380
My dear nephew, you don't know
what a storm on this island can mean.

225
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,250
lt can bring havoc
from one moment to the next.

226
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,259
Here or at the center of the sea.

227
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,339
Rhodes is at the mercy of the elements,
my boy.

228
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,390
l've always found the best remedy
for thunder is to sleep.

229
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,380
l suppose you're right.

230
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,410
Well, thanks to my architect,
my room is better protected than most.

231
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,750
Up you go.

232
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,259
Blasted thunder.

233
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,009
As you say, sleep is indeed the remedy.

234
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,720
However, there are times
when sleep must be helped along.

235
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,400
Now the end of the world could come
and l wouldn't even hear it.

236
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,279
l imagine soldiering is not a simple job,
especially when you play the hero all day.

237
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,410
l don't play the hero.

238
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,700
ln fact, talking about this thunder...

239
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,380
...l owe a debt of gratitude to lightning.

240
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:59,039
lt was at the battle of Ipsies
where l surprised Calemathos.

241
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,670
Just because he'd been stunned by
a bolt of lightning that had struck nearby.

242
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:09,960
l shall never forget the look on his face
when, with one arm, l squeezed his-- Oh.

243
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:13,799
All right, let's go. Right now.

244
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,480
Who are you? What do you want?

245
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,869
We must speak to you.
It's extremely important.

246
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,779
Well, talk then.

247
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,859
No, not here.

248
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,940
-We have no wish to harm you, Dario.
-Come with us. You have no choice.

249
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,529
Come on.

250
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:33,269
We never meant to fight you,
but you forced us to fight.

251
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,599
lt looks like we'll have to carry him
back with us.

252
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,690
quickly, there's no time to lose.

253
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,130
Someone must have seen us.

254
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,340
Now, let's go.

255
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,929
Come.

256
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,059
Dario.

257
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,789
Dario.

258
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,699
Dario.

259
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,239
What happened?

260
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,250
So Rhodes is the island of peace?

261
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,340
Well, l prefer war.

262
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,440
Excuse me. Who are they?

263
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,400
They're Macedonian slaves,
furnished to us by the Phoenicians.

264
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,500
King Serse probably needs
the poor devils as laborers...

265
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:35,239
...to build more monuments to his pride.

266
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,469
That him?

267
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,389
l'm looking for passage to Athens.

268
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,829
Under orders of the king,
no one may sail from Rhodes.

269
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:11,780
But l have to get back home.

270
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,480
No sailings are allowed
unless properly authorized.

271
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,630
What if one were willing to pay
double the price?

272
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,960
l don't think you heard me.

273
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,500
No one sails.

274
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,429
Thank you.

275
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,889
-Let's go.
-You stay here.

276
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,250
-No, l should go.
-l must approach Dario alone.

277
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,550
A woman averts suspicion.

278
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,079
Gather around, my dear friends of Rhodes.
You are bidden to stop.

279
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,050
l have in my possession
the most excellent gift...

280
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,250
...the rarest of jewels.

281
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,650
The sacred birds
from the temples of Persia.

282
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,909
Bird, you see, now is as precious,
my friends, as a pearl or a ruby.

283
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,489
lt has a beak
that is as hard as the best iron.

284
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,289
Yet it is gentle as a lamb,
faithful as a dog.

285
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,179
Since your humble servant has already
trained these magnificent birds for you...

286
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:00,469
...they will act as guardians in your home.
Evil spirits, nay, even might....

287
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,849
Are you looking for someone?

288
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,469
l see l wasn't too subtle.

289
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,800
Well, in fact l was following you.

290
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,170
Now what should we do?

291
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,320
l can grant your most secret desire.

292
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,019
Which one?

293
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,909
l know you wish
to arrange passage from Rhodes.

294
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,050
l saw you at the pier
attempting to obtain this passage.

295
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,900
l know men who own a good vessel.

296
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,300
And the price?

297
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,679
Taking a small risk. You'll go?

298
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,190
l'd rather not risk if possible.

299
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,829
l can get help through the court.
l'm a stranger here.

300
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:31,119
Let us hope.
If you find you're wasting your time...

301
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,840
...go to the pier and look for a torch.
A man will be there as your guide.

302
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,110
Good day.

303
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,639
-And good luck.
-One moment.

304
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,340
Now l must go.

305
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,139
lf you succeed in developing
this new weapon of yours...

306
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,769
...we shall be invincible.

307
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,030
No one is ever that.

308
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:04,269
Our ancestors with their stone axes
also believed they were invincible.

309
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,920
We are nothing but sand.

310
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,250
A good sized wave
can still threaten to destroy us.

311
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,840
Our footprints are temporary.

312
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,300
The Colossus will stand.
Your genius will too.

313
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:19,320
Somehow l feel l've created nothing.

314
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,039
-How--
-Rhodes is certainly proud.

315
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,840
Especially Diala.

316
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:26,949
She's proud to call herself your daughter.

317
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,079
She's proud.

318
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,369
l'm sure.

319
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,570
Proud of the money and honor she enjoys
as a result of my inventions.

320
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,440
What are you saying?

321
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,960
When her mother had died...

322
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,119
...l brought her to my house
and took care of her as if she were mine.

323
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:46,469
l tried to the best of my ability...

324
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:49,139
...but l know l won't succeed...

325
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,380
...even though you think
l can accomplish anything...

326
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,199
...in producing blood ties
that do not exist.

327
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:11,690
Dario, l pray your youth and good spirits
can dispel Carete's depression.

328
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,019
A little while ago, l was prevented
from leaving Rhodes. Why?

329
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:19,199
Well, l only thought l should further extend
our hospitality to you.

330
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,210
Hospitality is not a prison.

331
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,139
At this time, it's impossible
to grant you a permit to leave.

332
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,739
You shall have to stay in Rhodes.

333
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,920
Very well.

334
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,239
l'll do it my own way.

335
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,940
Dario.

336
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,429
The conquering hero
honors us with a visit.

337
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,150
The visit is over.

338
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,920
And so is my interest in Rhodes.

339
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,969
ls it that your visit...

340
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,239
...was too dull for you?

341
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,309
l bore you?

342
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,300
On the contrary.

343
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,699
My visit was brief but exciting.

344
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:24,809
lt's awful that l love to play jokes on men.

345
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,690
l beg you to forgive it.

346
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,320
You don't think l'm leaving Rhodes
because you forced me...

347
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,099
...to explore the underground passages
of the palace, do you?

348
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,360
No.

349
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,550
lt's just that l'm anxious
to breathe the air of my own country.

350
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,940
But--

351
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,389
But you can't leave the island.

352
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,860
So they say.

353
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,909
l have been waiting a long time for you.

354
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,820
Follow me.

355
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,429
This is the ship. Go down.

356
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,940
Welcome. Welcome aboard my ship.

357
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,010
Thank you. When do we sail?

358
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,539
Just as soon as l assemble my men,
l'll cast off.

359
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,699
Who's there?

360
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,409
Who are you?

361
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,670
Just a woman. Don't be afraid.

362
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,989
lt must get lonesome here.

363
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,829
Who are you looking for?

364
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:17,250
A guard...

365
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,550
...to keep me company tonight.

366
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,230
Just a moment.

367
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:40,579
Send them the signal. Not too loud.

368
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,889
-There it is, the second one.
-Row.

369
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,769
Let's hope their soldiers sleep well.

370
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,420
-You've spoken to Dario?
-No.

371
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,900
When we get out to sea,
l'll speak to him then.

372
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,820
Slow.

373
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,070
Pull in the oars.

374
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,050
quickly.

375
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,889
Over the side.

376
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:22,159
Jump, men. In you go.

377
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,369
Jump in. Now.

378
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,969
Now l know why you were in a hurry
to sail back to your homeland.

379
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,219
This document.

380
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:17,320
You wanted to deliver this document.

381
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:21,449
-What is it?
-Don't tell me you've forgotten.

382
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:24,519
lt's useless, Dario, to go on pretending.

383
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:26,260
Our enemies in Rhodes...

384
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,090
...a small and vicious band
bent on opposing the government...

385
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,510
...are looking for foreign aid
to bolster their cause.

386
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,710
They hired you
to bring these lies to Greece.

387
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,519
They'd like the Greeks to help them
unleash a civil war on the island of Rhodes.

388
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,239
This treason shall not go unpunished.

389
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:48,110
l don't know what you're talking about.

390
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,000
l was only trying to get back to Athens.

391
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,130
The most astonishing slanders
appear in this document, Dario.

392
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,760
lt seems we're totally corrupt.
We're criminals.

393
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,289
lt also states that we're plotting
against Greece with Phoenicia.

394
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,010
What's more, you, Dario...

395
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,650
...are specifically named
as their representative.

396
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,960
l hardly need more proof
of your treachery.

397
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,860
And l tell you, l had nothing to do
with this whole affair.

398
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:21,929
You know, your own accomplices
may not agree with you.

399
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:56,849
You recognize your friends?

400
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,039
You know who they are?

401
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,010
The sailors from the boat.

402
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,050
l think you could be a bit more specific.

403
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,280
Tell me you don't know who this is.

404
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,880
Surely you recognize him.

405
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:51,570
l don't know him.

406
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,280
He also, in his way, is a man of a nobility.

407
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:55,750
Peliocles.

408
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:59,800
Eldest brother of a family which dares
pretend to the throne of Rhodes.

409
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,460
This man is the leader of traitors.

410
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,880
And it's apparent
that you have joined his ranks.

411
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:08,530
The Athenian is innocent.

412
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:11,710
He has never seen any of us before.
He knows nothing.

413
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,619
l want to know only one thing.

414
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:19,059
You'll tell me gladly
before l'm through with you.

415
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,679
Tell me where
the rest of your men are hiding.

416
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,219
You'll learn nothing.

417
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,289
The bell.

418
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:11,840
'
These vibrations, if continued
would shatter his eardrums.

419
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:15,320
However, l don't want him deaf just yet.

420
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,780
Pull it up.

421
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,190
Arouse him, guard.

422
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,869
l command you to talk.

423
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,219
-l'll get him to talk.
-No, it's a waste of time...

424
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,690
...to try to get anything
out of these jackals.

425
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:57,010
See that they're all kept in chains,
while l go and prepare for their execution.

426
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,000
Come ashore.

427
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,989
All right. Move.

428
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,380
Move.

429
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:35,920
Another boatload of slaves.

430
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,670
Serse must have great plans for Rhodes.

431
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,150
Something strange here.

432
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,480
Even Serse could not find use
for so many slaves.

433
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,559
-You go back.
-You're planning to stay here?

434
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,070
l'm going to follow those slaves.
Perhaps they'll be in whatever prison...

435
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,840
-...they're holding our brothers.
-That's not likely.

436
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:25,619
We've tried everything else.
l've got to go.

437
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,920
l might even find Dario.

438
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,550
Just try to find our brothers, Mathos.

439
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,400
All rise.

440
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,190
Warm greetings, Sirione.

441
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,130
l hoped you would lead our soldiers
from Phoenicia.

442
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,630
Sirione will take his orders from you.
He is the bravest of our Phoenician officers.

443
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,670
An actor as well
the way he winced under m' y whip...

444
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,909
...as if the pain were unbearable.

445
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,090
The pain was certainly real enough,
Mahor.

446
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,940
You must admit you were whipping me
with all the strength you had.

447
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,550
Noble sire, l would deem it
the greatest of honors...

448
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,150
...if you would order me
to kill King Serse myself.

449
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,989
Your enthusiasm is commendable, Sirione.

450
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,730
However, we must all be patient.

451
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:27,300
With your help, the throne of Rhodes
will soon be mine.

452
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,369
Let Serse take comfort while he can
in the impregnability of his island.

453
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:35,690
Well, the conquerors of his Colossus
have arrived masquerading as slaves.

454
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:39,440
Only when the deed is done
will it be the time to rejoice.

455
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:41,380
Here are your initial orders.

456
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:45,780
You will repair to your quarters
beneath this temple until it is time to strike.

457
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,610
l shall instruct Sirione
as to all military details...

458
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:54,170
...and after Serse's downfall...

459
00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:57,750
...you shall know
the extent of my gratitude.

460
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:13,739
Follow me.

461
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:49,869
Thiel.

462
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,269
-Something new?
-Your brothers and all captured rebels...

463
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,559
...are going to be sacrificed to Baal
this very day.

464
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:25,239
Follow me.

465
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,079
Dario.

466
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,670
Guards, you wait here.

467
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,099
l managed to talk with the king.

468
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,059
lt's up to you now to save your life.

469
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,969
What would l have to do?

470
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:20,099
Tell them
where the rest of the rebels are.

471
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,099
Tell them everything you know.

472
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:24,039
l know nothing.

473
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,090
l told Thar that.

474
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:28,650
And l have something else to say.

475
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:31,469
Even if l did know, l wouldn't speak.

476
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:33,190
But why?

477
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,219
By now you must have realized
they're common bandits.

478
01:03:37,769 --> 01:03:39,670
Why die for them?

479
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:42,619
l think it's pretty obvious
who the bandits are.

480
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:44,250
But you--

481
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,739
You could go free.

482
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,530
Oh, Dario.

483
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:51,840
l don't want you to die.

484
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,329
Goodbye, Diala.

485
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,190
Guard.

486
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:36,420
Forward.

487
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:33,010
Here.

488
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,179
We must get away
before they send reinforcements.

489
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,170
Back to the caves in the Stone Desert.
Come.

490
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,630
-Uncle.
-Yes, l'm in this as deep as you.

491
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,809
Hurry up, Dario. Come.

492
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,529
You're sure you're not mistaken?

493
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,930
Positive. l tell you,
l saw hundreds of Phoenicians.

494
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,810
The underground temple was full of them.

495
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:20,369
Thar obviously is behind this.

496
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:25,590
He is no longer content with the power
Serse stupidly bestowed upon him.

497
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:28,500
He wants this beautiful island
to sell to Phoenicia...

498
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:30,590
...then he'll be the reigning monarch.

499
01:09:30,989 --> 01:09:33,649
We can't let that happen.
Surely there's something we can do.

500
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:36,680
We don't have enough men
to attack them openly.

501
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:38,680
Do you have a plan?

502
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,170
Yes, l have.

503
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,300
To look for a way to enter the Colossus.

504
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,720
But the Colossus is impregnable.

505
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:01,890
How could we hope to get in?

506
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,699
This is now a fight for survival, men.

507
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:10,409
Rhodes' best soldiers
are imprisoned underground.

508
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:14,100
A heavy gate seals the only exit.

509
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:18,600
This gate can only be opened by a control
in the Colossus. You told me about it.

510
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,739
That's right.

511
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,350
l was working in a group that built it.

512
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,579
To make sure
that the installation was kept secret...

513
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,460
...those who worked on it
were thrown into the fire...

514
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:34,079
...so they would not be able
to talk about it. But l got away.

515
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:37,460
So the control is there.

516
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:42,020
lf we're lucky, we'll locate it and,
what's more important, open the gate.

517
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,390
Once we release the prisoners,
they can help us to attack Thar.

518
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,300
Do you approve?

519
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,859
Six of us should be able to do it.

520
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:59,050
Let's say tomorrow.

521
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,880
l want each man to pick one.

522
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:03,550
That's suicide.

523
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,430
Colossus is a huge trap.

524
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:11,840
Every detail has been studied for years
to make it impregnable.

525
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,550
How can you hope to break into it
with a handful of men?

526
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,930
Do you have a better suggestion?

527
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:20,729
We must try this or it will be all over.

528
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:22,569
All of us here feel the same.

529
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,510
And we all understand
the greatness of the risk.

530
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:29,319
Without any hope of coming out alive?

531
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:31,199
We'll see.

532
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,819
To bring peace to our people...

533
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:37,890
...is worth more than the lives of six men.

534
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,979
l was sure you'd left Rhodes.

535
01:16:57,569 --> 01:16:59,270
You shouldn't be here.

536
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:04,130
Don't you have the sense
to realize you're in danger?

537
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,989
Who would look for me here
at this time of night?

538
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:29,039
You certainly don't seem to lack courage.

539
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:36,439
You'll have to explain.

540
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,640
What is it?

541
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:49,329
You act so foolishly
just out of a desire to see me?

542
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,069
Diala...

543
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,319
...l must see your father.

544
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,279
lt's very important.

545
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:45,529
lmportant?

546
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:48,020
What is it, Dario?

547
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,060
To save Rhodes.

548
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:53,619
Thar is a traitor.

549
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:58,220
He's hidden a small army
of Phoenician soldiers in the temple of Baal.

550
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,439
lmpossible. You must be wrong.

551
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,130
How could the Phoenicians
enter the harbor?

552
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,739
Thar is a very shrewd man.

553
01:19:06,189 --> 01:19:10,380
Those Macedonian slaves that arrived here
recently were soldiers in disguise.

554
01:19:15,369 --> 01:19:16,710
But he couldn't.

555
01:19:17,069 --> 01:19:19,180
Unfortunately, it's true.

556
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:22,500
We can still be in time to stop him.

557
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,100
What do you want with Father?
The poor man couldn't be of any help.

558
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,020
Your father is the only one
who knows the secrets of the Colossus.

559
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:36,470
With his help,
we can turn the tide against Thar.

560
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,439
Father's been spending nights at the
Colossus, working on some new invention.

561
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,350
Well...

562
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,409
...can you get word to him?

563
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,109
l must speak to him.

564
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,670
Don't worry, l'll bring you to see Father.

565
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,600
Without me, you'd probably get caught.

566
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:05,000
So we'll go together.

567
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,880
That might be dangerous for you.

568
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,189
l thought you said
this was to save Rhodes.

569
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:15,869
Dario, everything will be all right.

570
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:24,159
You will leave me
if anything goes wrong?

571
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,319
The only thing l ask of you is...

572
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,140
...in case of danger...

573
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,239
...warn Peliocles.

574
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,430
You'll find him
in the caves of the Stone Desert.

575
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,239
l will. Now, you go.

576
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,149
l'll come back.

577
01:20:45,329 --> 01:20:46,619
Dario.

578
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:53,109
Dario, l....

579
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:08,060
Here is the first control room.

580
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,079
Amazing.

581
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,720
What is all this complicated machinery
used for?

582
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:23,239
ln a word, for the protection of Rhodes.

583
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,630
Stop.

584
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,539
You mustn't touch this.
It controls the door to the prisons.

585
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,630
Your little visit is quite a surprise,
Athenian...

586
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:06,989
...but l'm delighted you came. Watch out.

587
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:22,329
He eluded us. He jumped into the water.

588
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,590
You fools.

589
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:28,439
Why does this Athenian
outwit all our men?

590
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,300
You are right to be angry, Diala.

591
01:27:31,699 --> 01:27:32,899
But...

592
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,649
...the day has not been unprofitable
after all.

593
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:39,130
The Athenian will not live long
nor will his newfound friends.

594
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,199
Your bringing him here
was a magnificent idea, Diala.

595
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,229
l'm sure he suspected nothing.

596
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:48,989
l was afraid
he would get to speak to Father.

597
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:52,760
Sentimental Father, l know
he would have helped the Athenian.

598
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:55,949
ln a short time
Rhodes will be in our han'ds, Diala.

599
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:59,210
There will be no more obstacles
in our way.

600
01:28:00,189 --> 01:28:02,909
No, there is still one obstacle left.

601
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:09,220
Yes, this deluded old man labored...

602
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:12,810
...so that it might benefit all humanity.

603
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:15,800
l thought l was working...

604
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,250
...for the freedom of the people
not their enslavement.

605
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:23,829
But you're planning to betray Rhodes.

606
01:28:24,689 --> 01:28:27,529
And l thank the gods
l have found out in time to stop you.

607
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:48,609
Diala.

608
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:50,939
Diala.

609
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:10,470
'
It was inevitable. Now, with his death
Rhodes is ours to conquer.

610
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,130
Mirte.

611
01:31:39,579 --> 01:31:42,210
You must be so proud
of what you've done to us.

612
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,890
They were very efficient.

613
01:31:45,289 --> 01:31:46,659
What do you mean?

614
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:49,460
Thanks to your information...

615
01:31:49,859 --> 01:31:53,229
...Thar's soldiers were able to take us
by surprise and completely wipe us out.

616
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,989
They took Peliocles
and your uncle Lissipo.

617
01:31:57,529 --> 01:31:59,609
They took all our best soldiers.

618
01:32:00,069 --> 01:32:03,289
They'll hold the execution tonight
so you can watch my brothers killed.

619
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:09,189
-But you don't think l--
-We don't think. We know.

620
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,430
You were the traitor.

621
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:14,770
You told Thar precisely
where our camp was.

622
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:18,470
Mirte saw you in Rhodes last night
at Diala's.

623
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:22,859
But now we'll play your way.

624
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,989
Mathos.

625
01:35:13,729 --> 01:35:15,810
Everything is ready, sire.

626
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:47,409
Come, Mirte.

627
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,819
People of Rhodes.

628
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:40,720
People of Rhodes.

629
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,600
A terrible danger hangs over your homes
and all your children.

630
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,939
A group of traitors has delivered the island
to a foreign power.

631
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:01,520
Hundreds and hundreds of Phoenician
soldiers are in the city...

632
01:40:02,149 --> 01:40:03,899
...awaiting the order to attack.

633
01:40:06,819 --> 01:40:09,449
l forbid you to go on, Athenian.
l forbid you.

634
01:40:09,989 --> 01:40:11,890
Be careful, Serse.

635
01:40:12,729 --> 01:40:15,829
The treason was prepared
in your own palace.

636
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:19,770
The Colossus you built
is now a nest for the traitors...

637
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:23,050
...and they're waiting
to overthrow the throne...

638
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:26,229
...to enrich themselves
with the treasures of Rhodes...

639
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,050
...and impose a reign of terror.

640
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:33,050
May the gods mete out to you
a horrible death for--

641
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:00,739
Over there.

642
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:13,460
Stop. Stop.

643
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,569
What are you going to do without arms?
You'll all be killed.

644
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:20,399
-But the people are with us.
-We need trained men.

645
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:23,760
There's a thousand of our men
under the Colossus in the prison cave.

646
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:26,170
lf we free them, we still have a chance.

647
01:41:45,489 --> 01:41:47,449
-Peliocles.
-Mirte.

648
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:49,960
You're all all right?

649
01:41:50,789 --> 01:41:52,050
But how do we open this gate?

650
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:53,560
This way.

651
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:06,250
-Mathos.
-Peliocles.

652
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:09,510
There's no time to lose.
To the Colossus, everyone.

653
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,149
You've done more than your share, Dario.
Now you'd better think of safety.

654
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:17,130
Safety? There is no safety.

655
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:20,510
l'm sure you don't know where
the secret entrance is in the Colossus.

656
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,750
And you don't know
where to open the gates to the prison.

657
01:42:27,029 --> 01:42:29,659
Wait. We will approach
the prison caves by sea.

658
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:33,800
Dario will get to the control in the Colossus
that opens the prison gates.

659
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:36,140
May l go with you?

660
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:49,899
The signal.

661
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,149
The signal.

662
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:06,010
Send them the reply immediately.

663
01:43:09,869 --> 01:43:11,210
Thar's plan has worked.

664
01:43:11,569 --> 01:43:13,270
King Serse is dead.

665
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:15,069
Splendid.

666
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,890
The Colossus is in our hands.

667
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:20,689
Thar is about to assume
the throne of Rhodes.

668
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,520
And right now on the seas,
our proud Phoenician fleet...

669
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,359
...rapidly approaches to support his reign.

670
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:28,659
According to my information...

671
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:31,920
...the sails of the first ships
will appear on the horizon at dawn.

672
01:43:32,489 --> 01:43:35,890
Thar, a masterful strategist,
has prepared it all.

673
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,029
My mission is almost over.

674
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:43,130
May l congratulate you,
future queen of Rhodes?

675
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:06,100
Up.

676
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,449
Guards, come with me.

677
01:46:48,189 --> 01:46:49,920
Two of you, follow me.

678
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,550
The rest of you guard the entrance.

679
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,770
Guards, form ranks.

680
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:57,300
This opens the door of the prison.

681
01:47:04,039 --> 01:47:05,409
Let's go.

682
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,510
Dario, look out.

683
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:45,689
Get out, men. Get out.

684
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:08,250
Hurry. Get out of there, men.

685
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:03,399
Don't move, Athenian.

686
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:07,300
Kill him.

687
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,069
No.

688
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:12,239
Why wait, Diala?

689
01:49:15,369 --> 01:49:17,210
lt'd be too easy for him.

690
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:21,210
And later, we'll have more time.

691
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:28,130
Good.

692
01:49:28,449 --> 01:49:31,640
With this, we'll get into the Colossus
and turn it against our enemies.

693
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,500
What happened to Mathos and Dario?

694
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:42,000
Forward.

695
01:50:53,569 --> 01:50:54,800
Hurry.

696
01:51:00,569 --> 01:51:01,939
Tie him up.

697
01:51:21,029 --> 01:51:23,609
lt seems your rebel friends
wish to visit us.

698
01:51:24,130 --> 01:51:26,710
l shall greet them very warmly.

699
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,359
Load the catapults.

700
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:05,100
Faster.

701
01:52:05,869 --> 01:52:07,949
A few more times should do it.

702
01:52:18,949 --> 01:52:21,060
'
Athenian, that is molten lead
for your information.

703
01:52:24,289 --> 01:52:25,869
Let go.

704
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:38,170
Over there. Everyone take cover.

705
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,560
Again.

706
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:50,180
Peliocles, Mathos and Dario
are up there alone.

707
01:52:50,649 --> 01:52:53,369
-We must get them out.
-No, no, no. That would be suicide.

708
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,649
Half of our men
have been wounded already.

709
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,989
We'll think of something else. Come.

710
01:53:00,729 --> 01:53:02,689
Your companions are inordinate cowards.

711
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:05,060
They're all running away in terror.

712
01:53:11,739 --> 01:53:13,439
Take the injured and carry them inside.

713
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,970
Peliocles, we've got to go back
and try and stop those cursed catapults.

714
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:20,449
No. We're staying right here.

715
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:23,659
All we can do is wait for them
to come out.

716
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:26,819
And put our hope...

717
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:28,920
...in Mathos and Dario.
