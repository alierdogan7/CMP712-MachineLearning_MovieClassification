- Radar, keep your alphabet to yourself.

6
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:17,827
- Somebody put "X" before "W."
- I did.

7
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:21,566
- Why?
- I lost my head in the heat of battle.

8
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,608
- [Phone Rings]
- I got it!

9
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,643
Beatcha!

10
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:29,044
MASH 4077.
Colonel Potter.

11
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:31,082
Yes.

12
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:34,175
I'm the C.O.

13
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:37,085
What?

14
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,989
Well, that's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

15
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,687
I've seen the man work.
I can assure you, Colonel...

16
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,993
there is no need
for an investigation.

17
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,765
Very well. If you insist.

18
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,131
It's none of my business, sir,
but your lips are turning white.

19
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:59,143
Provost marshal's office. They're sending
a colonel up here to investigate B.J.

20
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,907
- Wow!
- Claim he's an impostor, not a doctor.

21
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,346
Ooh! He took some blood
out of my arm the other day.

22
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,350
Radar, the man's a doctor.

23
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:07,453
<i>Whoa, Habibi! Easy! Easy, Habibi!</i>
<i>[Trills]</i>

24
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:08,613
<i>Whoa, Habibi! Easy! Easy, Habibi!</i>
<i>[Trills]</i>

25
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:11,189
- Don't bump your humps.
- What do you want?

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,190
Bad timing, my faithful camel.

27
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:17,319
- Camel, my butt.
- [Shushing, Trilling]

28
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,365
Isn't she a magnificent beast?
A two-humper.

29
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,594
Easy. Easy. Whoa, Habibi.
Whoa. Stop that!

30
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:27,332
Sorry, sir.
High-spirited camels spit.

31
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:33,669
- Why is it Tuesdays are always the worst?
- <i>Isn't she a beauty, sir?</i>

32
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,807
Those gleaming yellow teeth, set against
her brown camel-hair coat.

33
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,910
Klinger, I'm gonna write home
to my mom about this one.

34
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:45,718
With Habibi's permission,
oh "bespeckled" one of the pale flesh.

35
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,022
Look at her, Colonel.
Gracious transportation with economy.

36
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,187
A thousand miles per hump.

37
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:55,495
- Klinger, I got a big problem. Now blow.
- As you command, sahib.

38
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,501
Come, oh faithful
ship of the desert.

39
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,503
Ah! Ah! Ah!
[Trills] Ah!

40
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:04,065
I can hear the call of the oasis now.
[Trills, Grunts]

41
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:08,511
Sir, I know there was
no camel in here, but there's a smell.

42
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,514
Lebanese aftershave.

43
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,278
[Chattering]

44
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:16,981
<i>[Jet Passes Overhead]</i>

45
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,923
- Two trays, Klinger?
- One for me and one for my camel, Habibi.

46
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,655
Oh. Is your camel with you?

47
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,663
Right at my side.

48
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,756
I surmised that was the case.

49
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,701
Klinger, can I make
a personal observation?

50
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:34,864
Sure. Oh! Cease!
Stop curling your lips.

51
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,874
You'll get your potatoes.

52
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:40,070
If you'd take all the energy you devote
to these discharge schemes...

53
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,272
and put it into prayer...

54
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,406
the war would be over
and you'd be home.

55
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,542
My Toledo priest
is working on that.

56
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,348
Hold the meat loaf.
A camel is not a carnivore.

57
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,753
[Trills]
No spitting. Watch the spitting.

58
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,384
[Chuckles]
Ah, tapioca!

59
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:59,726
But if you want the finest tapioca
in the world, get thee to a nunnery.

60
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:02,766
So why don't I drop over to your tent
around 9:30 tonight?

61
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,531
I'll bring a canteen of gin and some
Fig Newtons and, uh, we'll, uh...

62
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,539
- Cheese it, the cops.
- Hawkeye.

63
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,541
- Father.
- Jennifer.
- Father.

64
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,543
- Don't let me interrupt.
- Oh, no. Nothing important.

65
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:15,409
We were discussing the ups and
downs of doctor/nurse relationships.

66
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,414
- Always the professional.
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:21,680
- Sir, can I eat? It's meat loaf.
- Enjoy the mystery.

68
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,312
- Hawkeye, where's B.J.?
- Am I my doctor's keeper?

69
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:26,391
I've got to see him.
Something very important.

70
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,483
- What's up?
- There's a provost marshal coming here.

71
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:32,086
He's going to investigate B.J.
Claims he's an impostor, not a doctor.

72
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:35,099
I could have told you that.
He's a piano player in a bawdy house.

73
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,329
- Wild talk today.
- Your tapioca's blushing.

74
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:41,304
I told this colonel it's crazy,
but they're still investigating.

75
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,170
- Who's investigating?
- The provost marshal.

76
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,674
- Who? Me?
- You.

77
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,507
- Say you're not a doctor.
- Shucks, I knew they'd find out.

78
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,808
- Excuse me.
- Don't go. After B.J. Exposes himself...

79
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,815
- there's gonna be dancing.
- Oh, sure.

80
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,317
- It goes on and on.
- I think he's a spy.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,753
- Are you a spy?
- I'm not allowed to say.

82
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,348
Pierce, I've had a bad day.

83
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,290
What league
are the Brooklyn Dodgers in?

84
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:05,090
- League of Women Voters.
- So far he's right.

85
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,131
Who got down on one knee
and sang "Mammy"?

86
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,133
- Father Mulcahy.
- Right again.

87
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,226
I prefer to observe
rather than participate in this.

88
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:13,237
Colonel Potter, I must
talk to you right away.

89
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,829
- Is it medical?
- No, it's personal.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,840
- Not now, Major.
- It's important!

91
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,967
It's always important!

92
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,512
When's the last time I came to you?
I ask so little.

93
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,344
- And she gives so much.
- You stay out of this!

94
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,385
- I'm out! I'm out!
- Please, Colonel, I must see you right away.

95
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,852
All right.
In my office in half an hour.

96
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,082
The army has no gratitude.

97
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:34,751
- Talk to the owners.
- Listen, you guys, serious up.

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,760
That colonel will be here
this afternoon.

99
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,353
Come on. This is ridiculous.
The army has all my credentials...

100
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:42,593
Acme Medical School. Residency
at Joe's Hospital and Auto Supply.

101
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,101
And then there's my practice
at Schultz's Mortuary.

102
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:49,573
I know all that,
but this Colonel What's-his-name...

103
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,405
Bardonaro...
sounded pretty sure of himself.

104
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,708
[Chuckles] W-Wait a minute.
Is that Leo Bardonaro?

105
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,908
- That's the bird.
- [Laughs]

106
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:02,454
The spy laughed, refusing
both cigarette and blindfold.

107
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,716
Leo Bardonaro is an old friend
of mine from Stanford.

108
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,690
Stationed not far from here.
He lives for practical jokes.

109
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,920
I knew there had to be
a herring in the pickle barrel.

110
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,089
This whole bit must be his way of saying
he's gonna come see me this afternoon.

111
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,099
- You're not a spy?
- Sorry.

112
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,637
You've ruined my whole evening.
I was gonna take a date to your execution.

113
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,876
- [Brakes Squeak]
- Yeah. You gotta watch out for this guy.

114
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,445
You never know what he's gonna do.
He was best man at my wedding.

115
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:30,242
Formal occasion,
so he wore a white towel and black tie.

116
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,682
- No carnation?
- My honeymoon, he put a lizard in my alligator bag.

117
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:35,720
- So your bag wouldn't be lonely.
- Naturally.

118
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,153
<i>Yo, B.J.!</i>

119
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:40,521
- Leo! Hey, how you doing?
- Great. Great.

120
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,561
Good to see you.
Leo Bardonaro, Hawkeye Pierce.

121
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,426
Uh... Just checking
for a hand buzzer.

122
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,592
Oh, come on.
Kid stuff. No imagination.

123
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,262
Hey, listen. You really
had our C.O. Going crazy earlier.

124
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,464
Really? That's great.

125
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,564
- How 'bout a belt?
- Uh, did he make it?

126
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,166
No, no, no. I manufacture.
He's just a shipping clerk.

127
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,610
- Oh, good. Cigar?
- No, thanks.

128
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,614
- Oh. B.J.?
- Sure.

129
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:06,480
What, are you crazy?
It's probably loaded.

130
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,485
Kid stuff.
We gave that up 10 years ago.

131
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,987
Our practical jokes are creative.
We don't put bombs in cigars.

132
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,149
It spoils the taste.
I'll take that one.

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,758
- Eh...
- Here. Gimme that. Here.

134
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,093
Hey, remember that time
in the dean's office?

135
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,190
Mmm!
[Laughs]

136
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:25,099
One time... One time
we stole a taxicab.

137
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:28,935
Took it apart completely and put it
back together in the dean's office.

138
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,641
- With the meter running, I hope.
- Ran it up to 800 bucks.

139
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,507
Mm.
[Coughs]

140
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,517
What do you call this stuff?

141
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,452
- Old underwear.
- Strained through G.I. skivvies.

142
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,750
- Terrific.
- Leo, what brings you up to the boonies?

143
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,758
- I'm goin' home.
- [Groans]

144
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,762
Hey, I had to say good-bye. Got my orders
in my jacket. I'm heading stateside.

145
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,857
- You dog. I would give anything to go home.
- What, are you homesick?

146
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,835
He cries himself to sleep so often,
he's gotta wear water wings to bed.

147
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,599
It's lucky you bunk with a guy
that's got a sense of humor.

148
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,607
He's serious.

149
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,378
Hey, I got a plane to catch.
What time is it?

150
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,948
- It's 1:30.
- 1:30. Bye.

151
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,518
Wait a sec.
You just got here.

152
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,519
Well, listen.
I gotta cut it short.

153
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,283
If you're ever in America, be sure
and look me up. I'm in the book.

154
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,484
- Where do you live?
- What... Where do I live? Philly.

155
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:24,255
My father's in Crabapple Cove, Maine.
Would you call him, Leo?

156
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,194
Why? Is his name Leo too?

157
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,563
No jokes. Just tell him I'm fine,
and I'm happy he's not here.

158
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,568
Glad to do it.
Sure. Hey, B.J.

159
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,570
- Hey, Leo. All right, buddy.
- Take care of yourself.

- I couldn't resist...

the provost marshal bit.

163
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,739
- No problem. No problem.
- Sorry, fella.

164
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,748
- Hawkeye, it's been a pleasure.
- Me too.

But I must get to Tokyo.
I must see Donald!

- No, I can't spare you.
- Three days!

173
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,843
Nope.

174
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,846
- Colonel, may I be clinical?
- Shoot.

175
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:19,406
It's important for Donald's morale
and personal well-being.

176
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,817
You see, Donald is a man,
and you know how men are.

177

You've been away
from Mrs. Potter a long time.

Surely, you must feel...
yearnings.

179
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,751
Yeah, she does make
a hell of a raisin cupcake.

180
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,331
You've forgotten
what it's like to be young!

181

Listen, missy, I don't take those
cold showers just 'cause I'm dirty.

182
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,694
Well, then you do understand.

183
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,773
I mean, Donald is very virile.

184
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,308
- Here's the supply record.
- Will you butt out! This is man talk!

185
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,310
I'm sorry, sir!

186
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,937
Colonel, please,
let me put it another way.

187
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:59,555
- How's he doing?
- His vital signs still aren't stable.

188
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:03,094
Give him another unit of plasma
and continue I.V.s as ordered.

Uh, Captain Hunnicutt?

190

The tall chap
in the bowling shoes.

191
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:11,928
I know who he is.
These M.P.s wanna see him.

192
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,805
B.J., didn't you see
the No Parking sign by the latrine?

193
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,810
I only stopped to mail a letter.

194
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,708
I only stopped to mail a letter.

195
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,905
- Captain Hunnicutt?
- <i>The same.</i>

196
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:25,541
We're from the provost marshal,
and I'm sorry to say you're under arrest, sir.

197
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,779
[Chuckles]
Bardonaro again.

198
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,980
- His way of saying good-bye?
- Probably.

199
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,717
Look, uh, Sergeant.
This is all a big joke. I'm very busy.

200
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:37,353
- We've got a lot of people to tend to here.
- Captain, this is no joke.

201
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:39,727
Here's the arrest order.

Who's Fox?

204
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,130
Short, red-haired guy
with the long nose, steals chickens.

205
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,141
I'm afraid you'll
have to come along, Captain.

206
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:54,212
- Oh, bull!
- Now, sir.

207
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:56,679
- Blow, will you? I'm busy.
- I-I'll get the colonel.

208
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,148
Look, guy. This is all a joke.

209

Forget it and I'll get you
some silk stockings.

- Sorry.
- Then how about some for your girl?

<i>I went to school with this guy.</i>
<i>He's a captain.</i>

Biggest practical joker in the world.
Do you read me?

Bottle of scotch? How about a free operation?
Appendix? Gallstones?

214
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,831
What's this about one of my surgeons
being arrested?

215
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,837
- It's got to be Bardonaro again.
- Let me see the order.

216
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,545
"Willful misconduct"? This is no
practical joke. This is a bona fide charge.

217
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,639
Enough of this fooling around.
Let's get down to some serious bribery.

218
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,082
How about $14 in unmarked bills?

219

- You're in serious trouble.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:47,390
I'll get on the switchboard
so you can call Major General Fox.

and hit the road.

- Just cleaning up the mess my Habibi made, sir.
- Bull.

224
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,008
- Oh, no, sir, camel.
- Out.

225
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,443
- As you command.
- <i>[Radar] General Fox is on the line, sir.</i>

226
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,883
General Fox? Sherm Potter.

227
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:10,148
Right. The M.P.s are here now.
What's this all about, Fred?

228
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,649
He what?

229
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,728
Girls? Steaks?

230
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,728
Naked in the tub?

231
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,958
Oh, in the hall.

232
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,365
Can't be. He was here.

233
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:30,505
What proof? We'll be there.
Good-bye, General.

234
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:34,238
- What?
- Supposedly, 10 days ago in Seoul...

235
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,907
- the general was staying at the Grand Hotel.
- The Grand Central Hotel.

236
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:39,950
In the next room, you were
throwing a wild party...

237
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,020
Ioud music
with a bunch of bimbos.

238
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,920
- I thought we were friends. Why wasn't I invited?
- You? I wasn't even invited.

239
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,788
Then you went out on the balcony
and barbecued steaks.

240
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,260
Teriyaki steaks on a hibachi.

241

<i>Radar, were you listening</i>
<i>on the other phone?</i>

242
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,967
A little.

243
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,004
<i>Well, the general's room filled with smoke,</i>
<i>somebody yelled "Fire,"</i>

244
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:03,632
and forced the general and his secretary
to run into the hallway, naked.

245
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,869
- Naked?
- He, uh...

246
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,946
- was dictating to her.
- Mm.

247
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,310
Uh, in the bathtub.

00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,610
Oh, sure.
And chickens have pyorrhea.

- Colonel, I was here 10 days ago.
- With me.

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,354
- We were having a company sock wash.
- Who was there?

251
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,583
- The dirty sock crowd.
- Colonel, I have orders...

252
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,921
to get the prisoner
back by 2100 hours.

253
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:24,120
- Okay, okay.
- What do you mean okay?

254
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:27,130
You're gonna give in to a naked general
when I got wounded in post-op?

255
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,690
A naked general
still outranks a dressed wound.

256
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,702
- We'll cover for you, Beej.
- Let's go, Captain.

257
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:35,739
Uh, can I say something?
Uh, Captain Hunnicutt...

258
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,832
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll write you every day, sir.

00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,843

for three years.

261
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,847
Thank you, Radar.

262
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:49,212
Don't worry, son. We'll have this
cleared up before you know it.

263
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,414
This whole thing is so stupid!

264
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:54,117
- That's exactly what Dreyfus said.
- Buzz off.

265
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,251
Now, look, son.
We'll gather up all the work logs.

266
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,420
We've got plenty of proof
you were here.

267

Hawkeye and I'll be along
as quick as we can.

268

B.J., I just heard.
Here. Take these rosary beads.

- Thank you, Father. I'm not Catholic.
- It can't hurt.

If it doesn't work, you can use them
to strangle the guard.

I'll come on a conjugal visit.

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,585
Knock off the didoes, Pierce. We've got
work to do. I'll need you as a witness.

275
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,745
- Anything I can do?
- Pray.

276
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:25,516
Oh. That's all I ever get to do.

277
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,718
- Colonel Potter, I must talk to you.
- Not now.

278
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,227
But you've got to let me go to Tokyo.
I must see Donald.

279
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,229
If I don't,
Donald'll go crazy.

- Major, we've got a crisis!
- So has Donald!

281
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,867
Pierce, there might be
some duty logs in post-op.

282
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,461
Aye, aye. Margaret,
I have a prescription for your problem.

283

- Oh.
- A tall, dark surgeon with the hands of Paganini...

- I'm a married person.

285

- Get going, Pierce.
- Uh-huh.

286
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,641
Shave and put on
your class "A" uniform.

287

Got it.
Bow tie and saddle shoes.

288
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,286
Colonel, I'm begging you.

289
00:14:56,388 --> 00:15:00,722
I sympathize with you, Major. Your Colonel
Penobscott is away from the one he loves.

290
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,386
So tell him to take
two laps around Tokyo...

right to Miju...

00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:34,012
- [Screams]
- [Screams]

322
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,917
Oh, look what you've done!
My in-going and my outgoing.

323
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,354
- Now it's all in my out.
- Stuff it, you little shrimp!

324
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,516
- What l...
- No! No, no, no.

325
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,890
- Ma'am, ma'am, this is all official stuff.
- I'm sick of it!

326
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:45,895
- I'm sick of all of you!
- Oh, no!

327
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,864
- I'm sick of the army!
- That's all in alphabetical order!

328
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,094
For Pete's sake!

329
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,228
"Oh, we need you, Houlihan.
We need you."

330
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,829
Always me! Always me!
Why? Why? Why?

331
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:59,433
Well, you've been in the army a long time.
You're older.

332
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:01,444
Thanks for nothing!

333
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:05,243
You're very dependable
and kind to the enlisted.

334
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,217
This man occupied
a hotel room adjacent to mine.

335
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,949
He created an inordinate
amount of smoke, interrupting my...

336
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,957
official dictation...

337
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,027
motivating me
into a drafty hallway.

338
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,220
But, General, the duty logs,
the daily reports.

339
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,061
Everything shows
that Captain Hunnicutt was at the 4077.

340
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,567
Well, anybody
could have signed those.

341
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,570
That's the oldest dodge
in the army.

342
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,334
- I have Captain Pierce as a witness.
- He was with me in surgery.

343
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,706
I took some shell fragments
out of a South Korean soldier.

344
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,575
Right. That corporal who gave you
the water buffalo horn for an ashtray.

345
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,081
What time were you two
supposed to be in surgery?

346
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:44,147
Uh, right here.
Um, 0600 to 1117.

347
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,747
Plenty of time
to get to Seoul by chopper.

348
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,316
He never left camp.
We had a company sock wash that night.

349
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:55,058
Colonel, did you witness
this... company sock wash?

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,963
Uh, it was for the younger crowd.

351
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,735
General, we have
overwhelming evidence.

352
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,501
So do I.

353
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,735
Photostat of the hotel register.

354
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:09,143
"B.J. Hunnicutt
and a party of favorites"?

355
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,545
Sir, that's not my signature.

356
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,710
That signature could be forged.
The oldest dodge in the army.

357
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,980
All boils down
to your word against ours.

358
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,921
What do these say to you?

359
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,858
Always trust your car
to the man who wears a star.

360
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,328
- Clam up, Captain!
- [Hawkeye Mumbles]

361
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,365
I have additional evidence.

362
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:31,526
Hunnicutt, you left in such a hurry,
you left your hat.

363
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:34,469
- Sir, that's not my hat.
- Put it on.

364
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,666
General, I have never seen this hat
as long as my head has lived.

365
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,108
There's one way to prove it.
Put it on.

366
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,111
It's his hat, all right.

367
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:50,313
[Potter] Let's celebrate
our victory over the brass.

368
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,322
Pull over
under that tree, Hawkeye.

369
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,120
- Rest stop!
- B.J., break out one of those bottles.

370
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,126
You got it!

371
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,460
Practical jokes.
You can have them.

372
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,466
- That miserable Bardonaro.
- Ahh!

373
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,559
That'll clean your rifle barrel.

374
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,570
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

375
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,640
Easy, Hawkeye, easy.

376
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,869
Don't talk to the driver
while he's drinking.

377
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:15,674
- Practical jokes are really cruel.
- Right.

378
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,509
- Right. Vicious.
- Right.

379
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,276
- Sadistic.
- I couldn't agree more.

380
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,649
If I ever see that Bardonaro again,
I'll break every sadistic bone in his body.

381
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,154
Ah, you'll see him again.
Remember when I took his coat?

382
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,383
- Huh?
- In the Swamp, with the cigar bit?

383
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,824
- I took his coat?
- Yeah?

384
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,692
I swiped his travel orders.

385
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,998
Colonel Potter? Colonel Potter,
I gotta speak to you.

386
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,010
Get rid of this
dead soldier, soldier.

387
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:49,239
- Sir, but I still gotta speak to you.
- You walk funny.

388
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,406
- Poor toilet training.
- Colonel, this is important.

389
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,815
- Radar, baby. Kiss me, you fool.
- Whew! Holy mackerel.

390
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,012
Colonel, you gotta do something
about Major Houlihan.

391
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,182
- An officer and a gentleman.
- You gotta let her see her husband or something.

392
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,191
You know what she did?
She kicked me...

393
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,091
and then she messed up my files
from "M" to "Z" and everything.

394
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,426
- And then she got mad.
- <i>Colonel Potter!</i>

395
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:10,524
- Oh!
- Say no more. You've convinced me.

396
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,331
Get packed. You're going to Tokyo.
Give my love to Donald.

397
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,338
[Shrieks]

398
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,806
You know, I like
a major with hot lips.

399
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,812
- And I'll tell you why.
- Why?

400
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,814
Exactly.

401
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,153
- Did I fall down?
- No.

402
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,189
I didn't think so.

403
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,420
<i>Klinger. Klinger. Klinger.</i>

404
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,090
Ah, Colonel, sahib.
You have returneth.

405
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,760
Good news, bugle beak.
I brought a discharge from Seoul.

406
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,804
Oh, be still my throbbing heart.

407
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:52,138
It's for the camel.
He can pack his humps and leave anytime.

408
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:55,144
It's always the other guy.
[Trills]

409
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:59,613
[Chattering, Chuckling]

410
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,151
[Laughing]
Oh, Leo! Oh, you!

411
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:04,312
- You creep!
- Hey, look, fellas.

412
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,413
I'm really sorry about
the General Fox thing. Okay?

413
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:08,424
Sorry don't feed the bulldog.

414
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,960
- No, seriously. I'm very sorry.
- Uh-huh.

415
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,031
I didn't know General Fox
was right next door.

416
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:16,430
[Mock Laughing]

417
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,434
- B.J.?
- Yeah.

418
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,198
- Can I have my travel orders back?
- Tr-Travel orders?

419
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:23,365
What travel orders?
I haven't seen any travel or...

420
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:26,501
- Have you seen any travel orders?
- I saw my first robin.

421
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,671
Come on, Beej.
I haven't seen my folks for two years.

422
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,681
- Oh, poor guy.
- Oh, really?

423
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,876
- Come on. Come on.
- All right. All right.

424
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,215
- No, no, no, no. Don't do it.
- It's okay.

425
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,221
- On one condition.
- <i>Yo.</i>

426
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:41,815
We shake hands
and promise no more practical jokes.

427
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,224
Okay, okay, deal.
Gimme the papers.

428
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:47,025
- Don't forget the handshake.
- Right. Right.

429
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,629
- Ah!
- Ah!

430
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:53,704
[Both Stammering]

431
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,705
- Oh, you... [Mutters]
- All right. All right.

432
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,798
- Here.
- Like I said, I'll call Peg.

433
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,809
Okay. Good.

434
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:02,004
Leo, you...
[Laughs]

435
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,013
- How do we get to Kimpo Air Base?
- It's, um...

436
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,015
No, I don't have any wheels.

437
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,585
Wheels! Take our jeep.
It's parked in front of the hospital.

438
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,586
- It's all gassed up.
- It's all gassed up.

439
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,156
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I do. Blow.

440
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,249
Yo.

441
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,797
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, Hawkeye,
the tent is spinning around.

442
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,799
- Which way?
- Clockwise.

443
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,734
Mine's going counterclockwise.
Maybe together we're sober.

444
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:27,737
[Chuckles]

445
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,932
- Hi. Hey, B.J.
- Huh?

446
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,204
- While you was away, this mail come for you.
- Okay. Thank you, Radar.

447
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,445
- Bardonaro!
- Bardonaro, you creep!

448
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,543
Bardonaro! You see...
Look what he did.

449
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,020
[Laughs]
Look what I got.

450
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:48,092
A bill from that hotel
in Seoul, in my name...

451
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:52,095
for damages... 580 bucks.

452
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,401
[Laughing]
We...

453
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,732
What the hell are we laughing at?

454
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,772
Well, he'll be walking
back here in about an hour.

455
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,774
He'll be walking back?

456
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,969
The only thing gassed up
in that jeep was us.

457
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,580
- To my dear wife.
- To my darling wife.

458
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,523
To Goldie, the waitress
at Barney's Bar and Grill.

459
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,686
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

460
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,325
- Hi.
- Well, look who's back.

461
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,902
- <i>[Potter] How was Tokyo?</i>
- Oh...

462
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:36,098
- Never mind Tokyo. How's Donald?
- He's in wonderful shape.

463
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,109
- He's so relaxed now.
- Good. Is that a jug?

464
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,236
Thank you for giving me leave.

465
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:44,338
Thank you.

466
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:48,044
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some things to rinse out.

467
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,552
- <i>[Hawkeye] Would you do my underwear?</i>
- <i>[B.J.] And my socks?</i>

468
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:54,682
[Laughs]
Another time, Captains.

469
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,693
- Huh.
- Didn't even get a rise out of her.

470
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,559
She's no fun
when Donald's relaxed.
