we will be there for you,

711
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,806
should you choose to accept
an association.

712
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,042
Well, we'll put
some pot pies in the oven

713
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,777
and some fish and chips
in the fryer.

714
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,280
Come on in.

715
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,350
We can't go anywhere
till the lab's fixed.

716
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,520
Let's prepare
to greet our new friends.

717
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,054
XO has the lead.

718
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:14,790
Ow.

719
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,224
Oh, that stings.

720
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,694
Rachel: It's supposed to sting.
I'm cleaning it.

721
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,762
I don't need it cleaned.

722
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,996
Yes, you do.

723
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,498
This is gonna sting a little.

724
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,968
Ow.

725
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,269
Chandler:
How you doing, Eng?

726
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,570
All right, sir.

727
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,104
Doc says I'll be on my feet
soon enough.

728
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:34,176
No rush.
We got it all under control.

729
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:39,614
She saved him.

730
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,319
She's gonna save us all.

731
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:46,754
Right,
Dr. Scott?

732
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:50,124
Well, hopefully,
we'll save each other.

733
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,259
Real soulful, this one.

734
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:55,362
You never mind them good looks,
that brassy exterior.

735
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:57,264
Word?

736
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:07,408
I know--
Don't do it again.

737
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,043
You don't have anything
to prove...

738
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:14,582
if that's what it was about.

739
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:18,488
And don't do it again.

740
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,858
Tex:
Hey! Nursey!

741
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,328
I need a cold compress here.

742
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:46,512
Spoils of war.

743
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:24,115
You know, I should be getting
this stuff ready for his family.

744
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:28,253
But, uh...

745
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,657
there's nobody even
to give it to.

746
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:40,230
[ Crying ]

747
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,702
Man:
Captain's on the bridge.

748
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,536
They in sight?

749
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:48,838
Yeah.

750
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,574
I hear they serve Guinness
on board.

751
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:57,046
Sir, E-Dub can't confirm
the signature on that vessel,

752
00:40:57,048 --> 00:41:00,049
but they don't think
it's British.

753
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,687
Chandler:
It's the Russians.

754
00:41:04,689 --> 00:41:06,355
Set general quarters now!

755
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:08,023
General quarters!
General quarters!

756
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:09,891
<i>All hands,</i>
<i>man your battle stations!</i>

757
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:12,828
[ Klaxon blaring ]
<i>Bridge, TAO--</i>

758
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,631
<i>SCUNK Alpha just energized</i>
<i>fire control radar.</i>

759
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:17,098
We're in their cross hairs.

760
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,601
Man: [ Russian accent ]
Captain Tom Chandler?

761
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,436
This is Commander Chandler.

762
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,338
Identify yourself immediately.

763
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,175
I am sorry to have made
such a rude introduction,

764
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:31,980
but I believe you have something
that I want.
