1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:02,578
<i>Previously on "Turn"...</i>

2
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:05,321
<i>Law, order, authority...</i>

3
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:08,064
<i>We are the beacon of authority
in these colonies,</i>

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,701
and we bear the burden
of that authority.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:13,420
Someone has been whispering
into the enemy's ear,

6
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,025
and the only ones that knew about
the location of that safe house

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,750
<i>were ranked well above me.</i>

8
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:20,246
<i>What'd you find out?</i>

9
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,309
A brigade of Hessian mercenaries
1,500 strong

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,068
readies to march to Trenton.

11
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:27,014
I gotta get this back to Ben
right away.

12
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,757
Tell me where your
next secret mission will take you.

13
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,349
<i>I've just completed my mission...</i>

14
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,993
the recruitment
of a young, talented agent

15
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:37,871
willing to apply said talents
in service to the crown.

16
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,334
Anna Strong is not your family.

17
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,904
Mary and Thomas are.
Now honor your responsibilities

18
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,088
- as your brother would've done.
- Thomas is dead.

19
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,373
- (Whip cracks)
- (Man groans)

20
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:59,588
I thought I would read a verse
from Proverbs, his favorite.

21
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:01,921
He preferred the one from Galatians.

22
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:05,188
You knew him better.

23
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,074
Before I met Thomas,

24
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:16,641
I was uncertain about being
engaged to a stranger.

25
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,947
But the first thing he told
me about was his family

26
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,289
and how you would welcome me.

27
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,639
He seemed a very good son.

28
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:29,547
And a better brother.

29
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:32,591
- (Babbles)
- ABE: I remember at Mother's funeral...

30
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,264
her casket.

31
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,738
To me, it was like a wooden seed.

32
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,610
I remember asking Thomas,

33
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,913
"Am I to grow a new mother?"

34
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,748
"No," he said.

35
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:52,051
But he told me...

36
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:55,259
"Whatever sprouts from the dirt is
a sign she'll always be with you."

37
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:59,197
As will he.

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,483
In truth, I too prefer Galatians.

39
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:13,892
(Whip cracking)

40
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:17,370
(Grunts)

41
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,645
All of this because of one rebel.

42
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,715
Hewlett suspects a plot.

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,421
- (Whip cracks)
- HEWLETT: Face forward, Baker.

44
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:29,625
Looking in the wrong direction
is what landed you here.

45
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,264
I have a mind to have you
flogged, too, Appleton.

46
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,169
These men let the spy escape.
You let him in.

47
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,371
Your defenses are lacking.

48
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:40,980
How are we to thwart an attack
if we can't stop one man?

49
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,635
(Men chatting)

50
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:59,853
Ready to be happy?

51
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,757
- Woody came through.
- (Laughs)

52
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:08,435
Fresh from New York.

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,007
The scout was a harbinger.

54
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:15,144
A strike is imminent.

55
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:18,246
And now they know we lack
the manpower to resist.

56
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,118
This barricade is pathetic.

57
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,930
Perhaps if the cannons were
placed somewhere less ceremonial,

58
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,133
atop the earthworks,
they would be lethal, no?

59
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,969
Yes, but, sir, the gunners
would be completely exposed.

60
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:37,342
Unless, of course, we devise
some way of shielding them.

61
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:46,054
Indeed.

62
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,698
RICHARD:
Our stones?

63
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,870
You mean to use our
graveyard as a quarry?

64
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,708
Yes, I fear there's not enough
time for a better solution.

65
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,444
This is...

66
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:05,011
there are many who will
see this as a desecration.

67
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,880
Mm, we're not going to
exhume the bodies, Richard.

68
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,614
I should hope not.

69
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,608
And I shall replace the
stones as soon as I'm sure

70
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,583
that this garrison
has been made safe.

71
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:16,986
You do understand
the need for fortifications?

72
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,887
I've not received reinforcements

73
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,289
to replace the men that
I lost at Connecticut.

74
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,123
Major, with all due respect,

75
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,194
Setauket is a small town.

76
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,602
These gravestones
represent our forebearers,

77
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,369
our history, our legacy.

78
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:36,504
My wife and son are buried here.

79
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,905
I understand.

80
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:43,778
You know this town and these people

81
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:46,880
far better than I ever could.

82
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,714
I now see why you,

83
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,151
not I, nor my engineer,

84
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:55,757
should be the one to select the
stones which are to be used.

85
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,290
Naturally, your family will be exempt.

86
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:18,286
No, I...

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,121
I'm sorry, I can't.

88
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,620
(Door closes)

89
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,726
Very well. Appleton.

90
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,793
I've completed my survey, sir.

91
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,529
147 stones in total.

92
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,299
What is the minimum amount of
stones that you could use?

93
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,170
Mm, two-cannon complement,

94
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,572
six men each, five if the
sergeant fires the piece...

95
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,908
10.

96
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,013
You shall use no more than 10.

97
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:44,950
Which are the strongest?

98
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,952
Granite is hardest, though
there's but a few of those.

99
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,057
HEWLETT:
What about slate?

100
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,862
APPLETON: Slate will stop one ball
but it won't stop two.

101
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:54,797
I'll examine the limestone. The ones least
weathered, we'll unearth right away.

102
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:58,068
HEWLETT: Unfortunately, that
means those not long deceased.

103
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,835
I'll do it.

104
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,272
I'll do it.

105
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,839
I can help you choose the names

106
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:10,844
that will cause the least...

107
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,014
protest.

108
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,480
If you insist.

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,116
How long to secure the cannons?

110
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:23,320
Two days to raise them,
another to make them fast.

111
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:26,024
You have three days.

112
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,462
Godspeed, Richard.

Court-martialed, huh? Busy boy.

122
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,673
General Scott's relegated me
to secretary in the meantime.

123
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,244
I just hope he'll heed this.

124
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:14,015
It's too long. If the scout
has anything to say,

125
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,683
he keeps it brief.
Otherwise he rambles

126
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:19,555
or, at worst, gives an opinion.

127
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,491
Sir, I grant you I care
little for sauerkraut

128
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,925
or Hessians, for that matter.

129
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,763
But if German mercenaries
are in Trenton,

130
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:27,866
then the British are surely not.

131
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:30,535
Now, don't you think General Washington
should want to know that?

132
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,944
This is unsigned.

133
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,180
Who spoke to these Hessians?

134
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,151
You?

135
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,619
We swore he would
remain nameless, sir.

136
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,489
Captain Tallmadge?

137
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:56,929
The source is true,
sir, and trustworthy,

138
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,163
but we swore his name
would be kept secret.

139
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:03,100
If you cannot trust me, your superior
officer, then I cannot trust you.

140
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,871
And I certainly will not trust this.

141
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,206
Burn it.

142
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,225
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, shh.

143
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,842
This'll end in violence.

144
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:39,210
Violence is what began it.

145
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:42,280
It was one scout. Not even a scout.

146
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,551
It was more likely a boat thief...

147
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,919
- hungry and desperate.
- You don't know that.

148
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:52,258
I don't see why the rebels
would attack Setauket.

149
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,058
By all reports, they're on retreat

150
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,258
and we're well behind
British lines here.

151
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,429
This town has always been loyal to
the Crown and they hate us for that.

152
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:00,823
- They don't hate us. They hate...
- Why do you defend them?

153
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,865
I'm not defending them.
I'm defending you.

154
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,198
Look, I'm telling you,
if you write that list,

155
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,897
the town will turn against you.

156
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,666
Not Hewlett, you.

157
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,981
Hewlett will take the stones
whether I counsel him or not.

158
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:14,505
Well, then, let him.

159
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,975
To tear a gravestone,
any gravestone,

160
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,041
from where it sits
is an act of evil.

161
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,342
No amount of wisdom
can make that just.

162
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,277
To shoulder a burden is my
way, to run from it yours.

163
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,444
Look, I'm not running anywhere, all right?
I'm trying to help you.

164
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:35,584
Then why don't you help me in the
way you seem to find hardest...

165
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,318
being a loyal son?

166
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,402
When the town hears about this,
my opinion won't matter.

167
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,194
The town won't hear of anything

168
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:48,997
until I am prepared
to present the names.

169
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,134
ANDRE:
Do it again.

170
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:00,804
Tell me your name.

171
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,137
(Music playing)

172
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,844
I am Miss Iris Endicott,

173
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,245
native to Basking Ridge,
New Jersey.

174
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,250
Tavern wench of the Traveler's Rest.

175
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,784
Ooh.

176
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,853
Mm, well done.

177
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,955
You've taken your character to heart.

178
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,658
Well, it's easy to play
the trollop with you, Major.

179
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:32,430
As for my next partner,
I fear I'll be less convincing.

180
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,762
I promise you, if you play the wench,

181
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,798
he will play the fool.

182
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:41,866
Such intrigue for a man who's
already one of your spies.

183
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,607
One who I've never met before
and have reason to doubt,

184
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:51,310
and yet the advantage is ours.

185
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,847
He's never seen me.

186
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,783
And he will never suspect you.

187
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,959
(Philomena laughing, squealing)

188
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:10,732
Where's my Iris?

189
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:14,139
Mm, I can smell my flower.

190
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,341
Reporting for duty, General.

191
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,912
(Chuckles)

192
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,013
I catch the scent.

193
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,246
Give me a taste.

194
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:27,247
If you can find me.

195
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,086
(Grunts)

196
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,654
(Squeals)

197
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:34,089
(Chuckles)

198
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,894
Marco.

199
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:38,494
Polo.

200
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,260
Marco.

201
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,927
Polo.

202
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,200
Marco.

203
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,370
(Whispers)
Polo.

204
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:01,173
(Laughing)

205
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,273
Marco.

206
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,710
Polo.

207
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,081
Evening, General.

208
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,584
I just got him off to sleep.

209
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,014
(Whispering)
We'll be silent as Quakers.

210
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,668
Hearing you talk about your brother,

211
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:42,300
how much you loved him,
how much you miss him...

212
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:46,133
I don't want Thomas to be alone.
I want to give him a brother.

213
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,838
Tell me what you want.

214
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,907
I can be what you want.

215
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:14,727
If you have something
to tell, tell it.

216
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:19,402
There should be
no secrets between us.

217
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,569
If there's another
in your thoughts, then...

218
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,656
(Whispering)
Mary...

219
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,558
if I tell you what troubles me...

220
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:40,725
you'll have to promise me
you'll keep it quiet.

221
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,460
Promise me.

222
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,896
(Clicking)

223
00:13:57,543 --> 00:14:01,281
You can only imagine what
a blacksmith's house looks like

224
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,952
without a woman around.

225
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:06,355
So Mrs. Hallock has loaned him
her slave Zipporah

226
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,589
to cook and clean
until he finds a wife.

227
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:12,591
Mr. Shelton's not the only man
who could use a wife, I'd say.

228
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:15,062
Your father-in-law, for instance.

229
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:19,433
Judge Woodhull always says
he's married to the town.

230
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,239
(Quietly) I'm not sure the town
will stay married to him.

231
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,904
What do you mean, dear?

232
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:31,341
(Clicking stops)

233
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,111
Nothing.

234
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:43,382
It's not nothing.
It's a real shame what he's doing.

235
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,752
Very serious, indeed.

236
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,586
I feel the same way you do.

237
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,855
You've... you've heard about it?

238
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,957
We hear all the rumors.

239
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:57,126
It's a terrible position
that he's put himself in.

240
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,063
Yes.

241
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,601
Why don't you tell us
how you came upon it,

242
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,436
in your own words?

243
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,211
I am an officer
of the Continental Army.

244
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:17,018
No, you are a deserter
from His Majesty's Royal Militia.

245
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:19,189
(Sobbing)

246
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,507
I demand an audience
with General Howe.

247
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:35,313
Oh, we can't take you to New York.
All the trees have been cut down.

248
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,650
I'll have to hang you right here.

249
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:42,957
And the girl?

250
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:45,462
The King's Army will make
use of her, I assure you.

251
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,467
- Take her away.
- No, no please.

252
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,836
- Let her be. Let her be!
- No! No, no, please!

253
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:54,176
No, no, let me go! General, help me!

254
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,610
No! Ow, you're hurting me!

255
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:59,712
No!

256
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:02,418
General, help!

257
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:06,589
A man in your position is privy
to a great deal of intelligence.

258
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,325
Were you to provide it,

259
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,627
I might reconsider
what I intend to do.

260
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,564
PHILOMENA:
No!

261
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:19,133
I've already provided
your side with information.

262
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,035
(Laughs)
Oh, you did, did you?

263
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,404
As a gesture of good faith.

264
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:30,675
The destination
of a Connecticut dragoon patrol.

265
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,143
(Philomena screaming)

266
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,080
I also provided

267
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,785
the location of a safe house

268
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,389
for small arms and powder.

269
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,893
A safe house?

270
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:53,766
The men who raided that safe
house were led into an ambush.

271
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,003
You sold them out.

272
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,040
(Philomena screams)

273
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:00,711
I assure you, I had no idea.

274
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,914
And now you're playing me falsely.

275
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:06,784
I give you my word
as an officer and a gentleman.

276
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:12,691
No, you are a traitor and a spy.

277
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,961
If not for my sake, then hers.

278
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:19,433
(Philomena crying)

279
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,536
(Screaming)

280
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,973
No, stop!

281
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,974
- No!
- (Platters clatter)

282
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,169
What was the name of the
officer you corresponded with?

283
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:37,315
- His name was Major John...
- Andre?

284
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:41,983
It's a pleasure to meet you
in person, General.

285
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:45,585
I do apologize for all this,

286
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,253
but I had to be sure
you were telling the truth.

287
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,820
(Philomena screaming)

288
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,387
"Let us love good boys
and play with none"

289
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:53,455
that lie or swear or steal

290
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,424
for fear we will learn their
ways and be as bad as them.

291
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,225
"Amen."

292
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,628
Amen.

293
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:07,464
(Distant chatter)

294
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,567
MAN:
It's not right!

295
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,468
These are hallow grounds.

296
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,303
MARY:
What is it?

297
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:18,676
ABE:
It's half the town, by the looks of it.

298
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,713
What are they doing headed
up the road at this hour?

299
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,423
I think I know.

300
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:34,664
They're going to your father's.

301
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,099
What?

302
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:39,538
- How did they find out?
- I let it slip.

303
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:42,839
Abraham, I'm sorry.

304
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:59,227
You there, halt! Stand fast!

305
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,131
Wait, wait, wait.

306
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:07,802
They've come to see me,
not the major.

307
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:11,073
This is too many people.
Disperse at once!

308
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:14,645
- We demand an audience.
- They just want to talk.

309
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,083
I invited them.

310
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,089
Gentlemen, glad you could come.

311
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:26,888
Is it true you mean to rip
out all our gravestones?

312
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,442
- SOLDIER: Sir, should I...
- Shh, shh.

313
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,159
RICHARD:
No, no. Where did you hear that?

314
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:31,759
Everyone knows, Judge.

315
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,159
Slip out the back.

316
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:35,861
Take Bucephalus
from the barn, quietly.

317
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,332
Ride to the church and inform
Lieutenant Wakefield to muster the troop.

318
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,600
RICHARD:
10 stones.

319
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,433
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,199
RICHARD: They are necessary
for the defense of the town.

321
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,500
MAARTEN:
You mean defense of the garrison.

322
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,834
RICHARD:
The garrison shields us from attack.

323
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:53,039
Listen, this is being done
for you, for us.

324
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:57,344
Just as our town fathers shielded us
from the Nesaquake and from the Dutch.

325
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,313
But they never used
our dead to do it.

326
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,413
We...

327
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,948
The stones of the founders
will not be touched,

328
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,616
I can promise you that.

329
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,022
Nor of men who gave their
lives for the Crown.

330
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:10,956
Nor the stones of women.

331
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,923
Well done, Woodhull.
You've kept the souls

332
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:15,191
of your wife and child
off the chopping block.

333
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,362
ABE:
He's protecting your families as well.

334
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,900
Do you think he wants to do this?

335
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,735
Do you think you could
choose any better?

336
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,772
Who has he chosen so far?

337
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,574
RICHARD:
The list is not complete.

338
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,508
- What gives you the right?
- I am the magistrate!

339
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,610
How is this law?

340
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:35,783
- This is a sacrilege.
- You ain't taking my stone, Judge!

341
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,653
No stones will be taken
without consent.

342
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:46,928
The heads of the families
must agree to give,

343
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:50,262
and since the giving
will mean they are protecting

344
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,099
their loved ones and their homes,

345
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:56,467
I expect they will rise to it.

346
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,873
Now, it is very late and I am tired.

347
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,207
Good night, gentlemen.

348
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,556
You've done the right thing.

349
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,061
No, all I've done
is take a difficult task

350
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,032
and made it impossible.

351
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:06,964
You know, Ben. Just don't let me wait
to get Abe's letter to Washington.

352
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,000
- But you've gotta be all for it.
- The letter?

353
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,299
- Scott burned the letter.
- So you rewrite it.

354
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,567
And then we smuggle it in.

355
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,401
- Smuggle it?
- Yeah.

356
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:17,569
- Oh, right.
- I mean, come on, you saw yourself.

357
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,938
Scott only reads the first
page of a scout's report

358
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,305
- before passing it on, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,441
So we get Abe's letter and we
fold it into a report, yeah?

360
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:29,774
And then watch it sail
right into Georgie's hands.

361
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,444
I've just finished my interrogation
of the returning scouts.

362
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:34,479
There's no single report
worthy of passing on.

363
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:38,047
Right, so we beef it up, huh?

364
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:40,002
- Add a little excitement.
- You mean falsify it.

365
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:42,283
Yeah, well, insubordination
is your best quality.

366
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,284
(Laughs)

367
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,251
It's been far too long, Richard.

368
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:49,122
I agree, and I apologize,

369
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:52,491
but since the arrival of our
guests from the Royal Army,

370
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:54,827
I've had little time
to pay social calls.

371
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,530
Is that what this is?

372
00:22:56,563 --> 00:23:00,163
Lucinda, your family's
strong allegiance to the Crown

373
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:04,737
has always been the very
anchor of Setauket.

374
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:06,905
This town looks to the Scudders

375
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
for moral guidance,

376
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:12,277
for leadership,
for inspiration, even.

377
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:16,282
Were you to donate a gravestone
for the common defense,

378
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:20,419
I believe it would inspire the
other families to see the light.

379
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:24,058
Have you gone mad?

380
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:26,795
The people here aren't against this
because their hearts are hard.

381
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,728
It's a bad idea and they know it,

382
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,729
and I think you know it, too.

383
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:33,300
I have tried to reason with
Major Hewlett, believe me.

384
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,799
I'm sure you have, Richard.

385
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,267
But you cannot reason with
someone who is being irrational,

386
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:40,572
whether it be
the rebels or the major.

387
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:44,239
But once the decision has
been made, surely it is our...

388
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:47,306
I am not going to bail
you out, Your Honor.

389
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,480
But I will give you some advice,
which I hope inspires some reason.

390
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,779
If you forge ahead with this,

391
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:56,944
you may as well dig your own grave.

392
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,001
(Sighs)

393
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,813
MAARTEN:
Mr. Woodhull.

394
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:33,020
I have a little apple
to peel with your father.

395
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,659
Well, he doesn't live here,
Mr. DeJong.

396
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:39,196
Yeah, he likes to hide
behind the major.

397
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:43,800
But that won't save him
when judgment comes.

398
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:45,635
Come again?

399
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,372
Our message is thus...

400
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:51,472
If he tries to take our stones,

401
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:53,973
we will defend them.

402
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:57,143
You made that very clear last night.

403
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:00,009
When my father gives
his word, he means it.

404
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:03,879
The devil may sound reasonable at first,
but it's always a trick.

405
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,351
Go home, Maarten.

406
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,119
I have family in New York.

407
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:14,990
They could make it difficult for
the judge's business there.

408
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:18,895
My father's business is with the
King's Army, so I doubt that.

409
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,632
It's a long way between
Setauket and York City

410
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:26,465
and there's a lot
of trouble on that road.

411
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:31,667
A man could get robbed.

412
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,534
Or even killed.

413
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:43,516
You threaten my father again,
I'll kill you myself...

414
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,151
on this road.

415
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,087
You hear me?

416
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,925
My quarrel was with your father.

417
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:59,762
Now it is with you as well.

418
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:04,004
You're both damned.

419
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,813
What do you want me to write?

420
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:18,015
So, we were burning boats
at night... you were...

421
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,024
uh, so we say that the flames
were spotted by an enemy patrol.

422
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,824
Your move.

423
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,128
How could I see them in the dark?

424
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:30,465
(Scoffs) Don't make me give you
a dowse in the chops, boy.

425
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,931
Write what I say.
I need it to get to Washington.

426
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,666
I need to stay out of the brig.

427
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:36,402
No, here's what
you're going to write.

428
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:39,106
"I came across a Loyalist militia
on the bank of the river."

429
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,041
I exchanged fire with them,
but was outnumbered

430
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:44,045
so I dove into the icy water
to avoid their shots,

431
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,216
swam downriver,
hid in the bushes all night,

432
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,118
which is how I caught frostbite.

433
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:50,988
Finally, they boarded their boats
and withdrew across the Delaware.

434
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:55,527
"From my vantage point, I could
make out five men and one officer."

435
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,298
King me.

436
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,667
Is that legal?

437
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,957
So, we fold Abe's letter
inside Ezra's report

438
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,658
and we watch it sail away to
Washington like a stowaway.

439
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,195
BEN: Stowaways get
tossed overboard, Caleb.

440
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,714
"Swam downstream and hid
in the bushes all night."

441
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:41,551
That's how I caught frostbite.

442
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:47,426
Finally, they boarded their boat
and withdrew across the Delaware.

443
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:49,062
From my vantage point,
I could make out

444
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:52,233
"five men and one officer."

445
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:54,771
Too small for a foraging party.
Most likely scouts.

446
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,411
Washington fears that General Howe
will ford the river to strike at us.

447
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,147
He'll want to ponder this.

448
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:09,324
This is the kind of intelligence
you should've been bringing me.

449
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:20,998
Richard, you've hardly left
your study once this day.

450
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,802
Come and join me for dinner.

451
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,236
Major, this task...

452
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,271
has proved more difficult
than I had expected,

453
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:31,074
owing to the sentiments
of the people.

454
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,609
You've appeased them, Richard.

455
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:35,476
You have coddled them.

456
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:38,915
And yet somehow you're surprised
when they act like children.

457
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,349
The stones are for their defense.

458
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,451
If the rebels take the town,
then they will be victims, too,

459
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:48,188
of murder, of rape, and of pillage.

460
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:52,327
They fear damnation as much
as they fear the rebels.

461
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:56,329
They see this as a
reproach against God.

462
00:28:56,363 --> 00:29:00,033
Romans 13: "The powers
that be are ordained by God."

463
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,470
Our king was ordained by God

464
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:05,642
and I was appointed
to my duty by our king.

465
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:08,045
You may well speak for God,
but I do not.

466
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,647
At least, that's not
the way the people see it.

467
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,286
I need more time.

468
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:16,524
I'm not going to indulge you, Richard.

469
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,927
If I don't have a list of
names by tomorrow morning,

470
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:23,067
then Appleton will
choose the best ones.

471
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:51,907
(Rain pattering)

472
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,077
Where are you going?

473
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:07,842
My father's.

474
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:12,010
But it's starting to rain.

475
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:15,647
There's something I got to tell him.

476
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,616
Something that'll
put a stop to all this.

477
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,186
What could you possibly
say that would...

478
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,590
Something I should have
said three days ago.

479
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,765
(Door closes)

480
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,034
(Chuckles)

481
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,943
- Ready?
- Yes.

482
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:46,982
(Sobbing)

483
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:48,285
Iris.

484
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,154
General. Thank God you're alive.

485
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,555
(Screams)

486
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,723
- Iris! Iris!
- No!

487
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:55,657
Bastard.

488
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,432
(Philomena wailing)

489
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,565
We may not be allies,

490
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,299
but we share a common enemy.

491
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,671
"To Mr. John Hancock,"

492
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,738
President of the Continental Congress.

493
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:13,674
Sir, entre nous,

494
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,146
a certain great man
is most damnably deficient.

495
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,914
"General Washington is not fit
to command a sergeant's guard."

496
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:21,616
How did you get that?

497
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:23,611
You think you're the sole rebel
I correspond with?

498
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:28,524
You wrote this letter for the
same reason you wrote to me.

499
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,059
You believe you should be
commander instead of Washington.

500
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,197
And I agree.

501
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:36,769
This capture is my gift to you.

502
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:39,037
Your gift?

503
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:42,544
You won't be blamed when half the
army walks out come the new year.

504
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:46,512
Which is when General Charles Lee
heroically escapes captivity

505
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,980
and fights his way back
to the Continental lines.

506
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:54,118
The Congress will clamor for the hero
who would pull off such a daring feat.

507
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:56,854
(Scoffs)

508
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:59,456
Come the spring...

509
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:03,424
you will advise Congress...

510
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,794
to sue for peace.

511
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:13,234
So I'll be in charge of our surrender?

512
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:22,118
Then Crown and Colonies are reunited
and this terrible conflict is over.

513
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,963
To the next commander-in-chief
of the Continental Army.

514
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,810
- (Rain pattering)
- (Shivers)

515
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:44,913
Thanks.

516
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,820
- There you are.
- Thanks.

517
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:06,169
RICHARD: Do you think hell
exists in more than one place?

518
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:10,176
What does the Bible say?

519
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:13,478
It is silent...

520
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:17,645
as are these books of law,
books of wisdom.

521
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:23,045
There are no answers to my question.

522
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,144
No, there's always an answer.

523
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:26,713
Hmm.

524
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,983
Father,

525
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:34,850
if Major Hewlett were convinced

526
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,820
that there was no immediate
threat to the town,

527
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:41,088
then there would be no need
to bolster the earthworks.

528
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,958
But he is convinced.

529
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,728
But...

530
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:49,934
if the rebels were preparing
to attack Setauket,

531
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:53,872
surely their scout would do everything
he could to avoid detection.

532
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:56,974
I mean, what sort of spy
reveals himself?

533
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:59,509
You think I haven't considered that?

534
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,479
You try telling that to Hewlett!

535
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:03,550
Shh, shh, lower your voice.

536
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,904
I don't know which is worse, his
lack of military experience

537
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,318
or his delusions of grandeur.

538
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:11,925
To fortify the church is rash,
to use the headstones folly.

539
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,425
He's been obstinate, capricious.

540
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:16,259
You mean he's acted like a king.

541
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:25,238
You have been compelled
to do something that is unjust,

542
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:27,544
and when a man is compelled
to do something,

543
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:29,879
- he either submits or...
- He rebels.

544
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:33,352
Right, and so you saw for yourself,

545
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,788
the people are against this.

546
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:38,823
They will be there tomorrow and
they will outnumber the soldiers.

547
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:41,591
- So?
- So, then lead them.

548
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:45,261
Tell Hewlett that it can't
be done or they'll revolt.

549
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:47,494
Call his bluff and he will back down.

550
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:50,764
- I'm not gonna lead a revolt.
- It's not a revolt.

551
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:55,205
It's just you standing your ground.

552
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,738
You won't be made
to sacrifice your honor.

553
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:00,742
And what about the major's honor?

554
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:02,747
Why would he yield?

555
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:07,583
Let me ask you...

556
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:10,087
why is he doing this?

557
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:13,791
- Above all else?
- He doesn't want to lose the town.

558
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,432
Right.

559
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:25,738
(Thunder crashes)

560
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:30,310
Uh-huh.

561
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,821
He used to sit there.

562
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,556
Thomas.

563
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,192
I know.

564
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,529
(Chuckles)

565
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:55,170
I think that's enough for one night, huh?
Don't you?

566
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:56,706
Come on. Come on, then.

567
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,572
(Groans)

568
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:04,543
- He used to sit there, you know?
- I know.

569
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,811
I used to spy on you both
from that window.

570
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,110
He had such a perceptive mind,

571
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:12,980
like a... like a clear lake.

572
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,283
His questions were like answers, too.

573
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,189
Come on. Come on.

574
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:32,393
There you go.

575
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:34,559
Thomas.

576
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:50,779
BEN: Well, we'll be heroes
or we'll be hanged.

577
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,350
It ain't treason
if there's good reason.

578
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,821
(Laughs)

579
00:36:57,655 --> 00:37:00,021
BEN:
I just hope Washington reads it.

580
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:02,360
To the general's attention, sir.

581
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,663
CALEB:
What else has he got to do?

582
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:27,214
SOLDIER: Just the stones, men.
Leave the bodies be.

583
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,964
Thank you. Thank you, son.

584
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:40,436
Bless you.

585
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,437
Thank you.

586
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:04,227
(Loud muttering)

587
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,209
Proceed no further.

588
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:21,983
This is an illegal assembly.

589
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:34,766
SOLDIER: You may not gather here.
Return to the village.

590
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,023
SOLDIER:
Stand back.

591
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:15,143
When Major Hewlett
first proposed this plan,

592
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:17,211
I was against it.

593
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,481
Now I must disappoint
the major yet again.

594
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,717
I have no stones to give him.

595
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:30,387
(Murmuring)

596
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,830
My fault...

597
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:42,666
was not in asking too much
of you, but too little.

598
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,670
We have failed to consider
what's most important here.

599
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:52,410
Not what we want
or what the major wants.

600
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:54,913
But what God wants.

601
00:39:57,779 --> 00:40:01,183
And what He demands is
sacrifice as a test of faith.

602
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:03,815
For faith without works is dead.

603
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,414
Abraham understood this

604
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:09,350
when he brought Isaac
to the mountain.

605
00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:14,484
And we must follow his example...

606
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,829
and offer up that which
we hold most dear,

607
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:24,330
that which we would never sacrifice.

608
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:27,832
Just as God sacrificed His only son

609
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,066
to save us all.

610
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:52,957
Please ask your father to forgive me.

611
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,961
Ask him yourself.

612
00:42:22,193 --> 00:42:25,062
Pay attention, Appleton.

613
00:42:25,096 --> 00:42:27,666
This is why I picked gravestones.

614
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,938
If it was this hard for the
Loyalists to give them up,

615
00:42:31,973 --> 00:42:33,741
imagine how hard it will be

616
00:42:33,775 --> 00:42:37,309
for rebels from the same
region to fire upon them.

617
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,256
This is how you tame a colony.

618
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,491
Not through battle...

619
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,826
but through winning
their hearts and minds.

620
