00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,519
Previously on "Vikings":

2
00:00:01,728 --> 00:00:03,262
Why do you not go home?

3
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:07,233
By staying you've given me time
to raise a large army.

4
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:09,602
Thorvard: Your lands are
lost, invaded by Jarl Borg.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,071
Your family has fled
only the gods know where.

6
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,239
I must find my family.

7
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,373
If I can be of help
to king Horik

8
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:15,715
Then I'm happy to stay.

9
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:16,809
Then so be it.

10
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,744
Your friends will be leaving
at first light.

11
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:20,413
Ealdorman Werferth:
Their forces have divided,

12
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:22,415
Four of their ships
have sailed away.

13
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:25,151
- (arrow strikes)
- Aghhh! Ugh!

14
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:28,187
Bishop Edmund:
Here is your destiny, apostate!

15
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:31,591
King Ecbert:
Wait! Cut him down.

16
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:34,160
Jarl Borg: I'm happy that
Ragnar Lothbrok has returned.

17
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:37,296
I will kill him!
(cheers erupt)

18
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:39,065
Rollo: We have no chance
at defeating Jarl Borg.

19
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:40,292
Ragnar:
Then we find more men.

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,235
Rollo: There are no more to find.
I have tried.

21
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:43,703
It has been a long time.

22
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,171

Lagertha, you're the last person
I expected to see here.

39
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:59,445
You and your warriors
are as welcome to us

40
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:03,449
As spring after the hardest
and most bitter winter.

41
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,718
Rollo, my son and I
are only too glad

42
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,787
To come to Ragnar's aid.

43
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,328
(laughs)

44
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:18,497
Freya and all the gods, Bjorn,

45
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,302
You're a big bastard now.

46
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,438
Thank you, Uncle.

47
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:28,507
Still can't grow a beard,
though.

48
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,612
(emotional exhale)

49
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,783
Everything is new now.

50
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:43,522
Torstein:
Good to see you, Bjorn.

51
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:50,329
Yes...
Yes. (giggles)

52
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,830
You stayed true to your path.

53
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:55,401
Siggy!

54
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:58,738
Floki: You see him, Helga?
He's all grown up!

55
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,072
Bjorn:
I missed you so much.

56
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,009
Floki: You look stronger
than your father.

57
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,477
Come, what have they been
feeding you?!

58
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,746
You look like
you've been eating a cow a day.

59
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,814
Bjorn:
You are the one to talk.

60
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:13,119
Aslaug:
I am grateful to see you.

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,260
Lagertha:
Thank you, princess Aslaug.

62
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,793
(sigurd coos softly)

63
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,330
Bjorn:
Princess.

64
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,801
My sons: Ubbe and Hvitserk.

65
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,073
I am pleased to see you.

66
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,776
I always knew that, some day,

67
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:40,112
I would meet some more
of Ragnar's sons.

68
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,348
Ubbe:
How did you know?

69
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,792
And you have a baby?
May I?

70
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,133
Aslaug: His name is
Sigurd snake-in-the-eye.

71
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,603
After your father?

72
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,707
And after his own father.

73
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:16,048
(low hum of chatter,
goats bleat)

74
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:20,119
Ragnar: Enough with the
pleasantries, let's make a plan.

75
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,437
Lagertha:
So?

76
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,229
Torstein: Even with your
additional forces, Lagertha,

77
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:32,765
We cannot attack Kattegat
and hope to succeed.

78
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,234
Jarl Borg is well dug in.

79
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:37,703
Lagertha:
What do you propose?

80
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:41,040
Rollo: We want to drive
Jarl Borg out of Kattegat.

81
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,342
He has no idea
we have been reinforced.

82
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,710
Torstein: And what would
make him leave Kattegat

83
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:47,646
Where he can winter in safety?

84
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:49,014
Rollo: The one thing
that would threaten

85
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,649
His whole existence there.

86
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,652
Floki:
And what would that be?

87
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,655
Food.

88
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,024
A few of us will go
into the town

89
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,294
And destroy the winter
grain stores.

90
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:05,064
Floki: I will do it! I will go.

91
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:09,568
Ragnar:
No. My son and I shall go.

92
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:12,138
We'll only need a few men.

93
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,544
(loud buzz of chatter,
carts rattle)

94
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:22,290
Woman: Don't think
we will be long now.

95
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:25,036
Man: Seems to me the
case is quite clear.

96
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:30,031
Encompass everything else
we've discussed... Yes, yes.

97
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,657
(door groans and shuts heavily)

98
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,759
King Ecbert:
Thank you.

99
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:47,406
I cannot see your face.

100
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:52,011
Young woman: I am ex-wife
of Christ: A nun.

101
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:55,514
I cannot show my face
to any man.

102
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:59,685
Well,
I am not "any man."

103
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,288
I am King Ecbert

104
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,656
And you will show me your face

105
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,191
Or I will be unable to judge

106
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:08,294
Whether or not
you're telling me the truth.

107
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:17,236
(crowd murmurs)

108
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,538
Who did this to you?

109
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:23,375
My husband.

110
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:27,446
He claimed
I had been unfaithful.

111
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:41,260
And were you...
Unfaithful?

112
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:44,230
(whispering) no.

113
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:50,803
Hmm... What do pagans say
of such cases?

114
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:56,175
(crutch taps lightly)

115
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,583
Athelstan:
If she was a free woman,

116
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,585
They would believe her word,

117
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,188
And make judgment
on her behalf.

118
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:12,958
King Ecbert: But surely her
husband has every right over her?

119
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:18,464
Surely she belongs to him,
to do with as he sees fit.

120
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:21,367
Not according to the pagans.

121
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:27,106
Then pagan laws are superior
to ours?

122
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:34,380
Not in every case, sire.

123
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:43,756
Woman, I find it unlawful
and disagreeable

124
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:47,092
That your husband should make
false claims against you.

125
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:51,330
He has provided no evidence
of your cupidity.

126
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,534
Therefore, I dismiss his demand
to have you branded in public.

127
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,704
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, lord.

128
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:01,507
Oh, well, don't thank me.

129
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:04,109
Thank this pagan.

130
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,545

00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,458
My father served at the court
of the emperor charlemagne,

356
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,027
The most devout of men.

357
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,495
If I were you,

358
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,732
I would not forget to attend
high mass...

359
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,302
That is,
if you value your soul.

360
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,540
(bell tolls)

361
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,743
Baker: Bread! No stone in this bread!
Best bread you can buy! Bread!

362
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:22,113
(townsfolk chatter)

363
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:24,348
- Man: Fine, we'll take one.
- Woman: Introduce them!

364
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,786
(bell ringing grows louder)

365
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:36,627
(bell tolls loudly)

366
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,804
(quietly)
Mary, mother of Jesus.

367
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,514
I just wanted to thank you.

368
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:58,783
(bell tolls)

369
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,351
That's...

370
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,355
I'm glad.

371
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,793
No woman should be treated
like that,

372
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,529
Especially not a christian.

373
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,102
(square buzzes with chatter)

374
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,638
Woman: Another one on the
way for her and her boys.

375
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:23,708
(square buzzes with chatter)

376
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:30,915
(exhales held breath and sighs)

377
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:41,258
Rollo: On this day, we
offer a sacrifice to Odin,

378
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,697
The mighty one,

379
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,834
Townsfolk:
(cheer)

380
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,607
(jeering)

381
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,748
Rollo:
Release him from his bonds.

382
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:07,184
I know he will want
to die well.

383
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:10,721
Man 1: (murmurs loudly)
man 2: (laughs)

384
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:12,723
(blade rings)

385
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:14,825
Kneel.

386
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:25,669
In the presence of the gods,
and in their honor,

387
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,538
I offer this sacrifice.

388
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,640
Ragnar:
Stop!

389
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,111
(confused murmurs)

390
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:49,059
Father?

391
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:51,128
(fire crackles)

392
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,835
(footsteps crunch)

393
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:21,425
In the presence of the gods,
and in their honor,

394
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,328
I offer this sacrifice.

395
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:27,398
(axe slices, cheers erupt)

396
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,341
(invigorating grunt)

397
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:42,413
(music, laughter, and chatter
fill the air)

398
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,650
♪♪

399
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:00,732
♪♪

400
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,441
Ragnar:
I love two women.

401
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:15,212
Both of them
have given me children.

402
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:18,658
Seer: And you suppose you
must choose between them?

403
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:24,421
Ragnar:
No. I don't want to choose.

404
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,123
I would like
to have both of them.

405
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:29,393
Seer:
(chuckles) I see.

406
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,695
You know, of course,
the story of the marriage

407
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:34,231
Between Njord and Skadi?

408
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:37,101
Skadi was a giantess.
Her father was killed.

409
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:40,137
She strode to Askard
to get justice

410
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:43,040
And the gods asked her
if she wanted gold

411
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,808
For the death of her father.

412
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,611
"I'll settle for a husband,"
she said,

413
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:49,079
"and a bellyful of laughter."

414
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,448
Ragnar: This is going
to be a long story.

415
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,117
Seer: If you are
hundreds of years old,

416
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:56,387
Then it's a very quick story.

417
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:57,554
Ragnar:
Hmm.

418
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,056
Seer:
The gods conferred and agreed

419
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,292
That skadi could choose
a husband from among them,

420
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,227
But they made one condition:

421
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:06,330
That she chose him by his feet.

422
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,367
His feet?

423
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:14,338
Seer: Yes. And skadi
lost no time in choosing

424
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,739
The most shapely pair of feet,

425
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:18,742
Believing they would naturally
belong to Balder,

426
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,513
The most handsome of the gods.

427
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:25,249
Ragnar:
But they didn't?

428
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,720
Seer: No. They belonged
to the God Njord,

429
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:33,657
The lord of seafarers
and sea harvests.

430
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,659
His skin was old and weathered.

431
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:40,431
Ragnar:
What are you talking about?

432
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:43,734
I don't want to make a choice
between them,

433
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:48,305
But if I did,

434
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,774
Are you saying
that I should decide

435
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:53,043
Based on the appearance
of their feet?

436
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:56,180
Seer: Neither their
feet nor their faces.

437
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,350
You should examine their hearts,
their livers,

438
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,353
And every other organ.

439
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:05,055
In any case,
it makes no difference.

440
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:08,258
You are only fooling yourself,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

441
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,762
If you think the choice
is yours to make.

442
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:17,234
(wind howls)

443
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:21,238
Bishop Edmund:
Accipite et bibite ex eo omes

444
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:27,111
Hic est enim calix
sanguinis mei...

445
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:31,482
Qui pro vobis et effundetur.

446
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,585
(footsteps scuff)

447
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:39,590
Corpus christi.

448
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:46,563
Corpus christi.

449
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,237
Sanguinis christi.

450
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:56,774
(monks chant in Latin)

451
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:00,844
Sanguinis christi.

452
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:05,482
Sanguinis christi.

454
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,221
Sanguinis christi.

455
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:16,693
Et pro multis in remissionem

456
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,129
Me sterium fide.

457
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,566
Corpus christi.

458
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,403
Corpus christi.

459
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:29,506
Corpus christi.

460
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,369

and chanting merge)

461
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,513
Corpus christi.

462
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:43,687

463
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:55,165
Bishop Edmund:
Corpus christi.

464
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,902
Corpus christi.

465
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:02,806
Corpus christi.

466
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:08,178
Sanguinis christi.

467
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:12,883
Corpus christi.

468
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,686
Sanguinis christi.

469
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:25,391
(rain begins pouring heavily,
townsfolk cry out)

470
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,226
Woman: Quickly! Quickly!
Man: Come along!

471
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:28,961
- Bjorn: Oh!
- Hvitserk: I got you!

472
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:30,963
Bjorn:
Agh!

473
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:32,498
You have to be stronger
than that!

474
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,467
(laughing)

475
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,372
Hvitserk, when you grow bigger,
I'll teach you to hunt.

476
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,544
Ubbe! Whoa!

477
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:46,412
Ragnar: It is good to see
them playing together.

478
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:49,048
Bjorn:
Agh! You have to pull!

479
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,350
- Aslaug: For you.
- Ragnar: Mmm...

480
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,119
They are all my children.

481
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,287
Bjorn:
What are you boys doing?

482
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:57,657
(loud thunderclap,
Ragnar sighs, amused)

483
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:01,703
Bjorn:
There! You have it!

484
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:04,363
I am going to bear you
another son.

485
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,526
I know.

486
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,603
Bjorn:
What are you doing, huh?

487
00:32:10,704 --> 00:32:12,572
But I am fearful
of the prophecy.

488
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,640
Hvitserk:
Caught you there!

489
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:19,712
(thunder rumbles)

490
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:27,653
What are you going to do
about Lagertha?

491
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,025
What do you mean
what am I going to do?

492
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:36,562
Bjorn: Stronger than this!
(boys laugh)

493
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,930
It is her decision.

494
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:42,001
I've never had a choice
whether she comes or goes.

495
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:46,439
I will not tell her to go away,

496
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,442
If she does not want to.

497
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:51,177
Then, if you like,
I shall go away!

498
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:52,438
Oh, stop!

499
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:56,449
No doubt you prefer her
because she is a Shield-Maiden.

500
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,451
A warrior.

501
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:00,419
In that way,
she is more like you.

502
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:01,854
Bjorn:
What are you going to do?

503
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:04,557
Bjorn and hvitserk:
(laughing)

504
00:33:04,658 --> 00:33:07,360
I don't want either of you
to leave.

505
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,463
I want you both to stay.

506
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,434
I want to believe you love me.

507
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,404
Then believe me!
Hmm?

508
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,675
(thunder rumbles loudly)

509
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:33,212
(rain patters loudly,
thunder rolls)

510
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:40,126
(knocking)

511
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:53,143
(fire crackles,
door creaks open)

512
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,245
Thank you.

513
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:01,184
I came to talk to...

514
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,353
Rollo:
We all know why you're here.

515
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,692
(rain patters loudly)

516
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:15,065
(thunder rolls)

517
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,536
(door creaks shut)

518
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:26,142
(sighs heavily)

519
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,524
I was wondering-you were
wondering what I was going to do.

520
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:36,352
Yes.
Regarding my son.

521
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:45,161
I don't know what to do.

522
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:47,263
Then he should stay.

523
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:55,338
You both should stay.

524
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:04,581
Your wife would not be happy.

525
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:06,649
I imagine not.

526
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:12,722
(rain patters loudly)

527
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:18,194
Siggy: I think Ragnar is
still in love with Lagertha.

528
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:24,567
Are you?

529
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,438
In a way, yes.

530
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,917
And yet, it seems to be
another rollo

531
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:34,277
Who still loves her.

532
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:44,220
I am like a snake
which has shed its skin.

533
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:49,559
The pattern is just the same,
but the snake is new.

534
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:55,198
And this new rollo
does not love Lagertha,

535
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:58,468
Or suffer from desires for her.

536
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:01,571
(loud thunderclap,
thunder rumbles)

537
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:12,382
Does that answer your question?

538
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,064
Athelstan:
(shallow breaths)

539
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,294
Please, lord, hear my prayer.

540
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:36,506
I am weak.
Make me strong.

541
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:40,210
Come into me again, lord.
Ravish me.

542
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,478
Open my eyes, lord,
to the truth.

543
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,548
To your presence.

544
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:48,918
Why don't you show yourself
to me?

545
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:51,921
Let me be filled again, lord,
by the holy spirit.

546
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:55,391
(ominous whispers)

547
00:36:55,492 --> 00:36:58,061
(object clatters)

548
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:10,707
(loud whoosh, frightened gasp)

549
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,022
(vicious growl,
athelstan gasps in fear)

550
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:20,116
(panicked breaths)

551
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,418
(barrel clatters)

552
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,201
(vicious growl)

553
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:41,304
(gasps in horror) you devil!

554
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:51,614
(shaky breaths)

555
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:04,894
(calming breaths)

556
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:10,600
(ominous whispers)

557
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:12,702
You devil!

558
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:18,821
I think he's ***.

559
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:22,291
Just assume that
we shall find him guilty

560
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,793
And confiscate his land.

561
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,628
Men:
Yes! Yes!

562
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:30,033
But, on this occasion,

563
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:32,335
I believe he should
keep his land...

564
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,703
(murmurs of concern)

565
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:37,807
And the accusers
should give him...

566
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,913
Three sheep?
(crowd laughs)

567
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:46,182
All in favor, say baaaaah.

568
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,354
Crowd: Baaaaaaah. (banging)

569
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,456
Man:
Ragnar!

570
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:59,729
Ragnar:
Quiet! Thorvard.

571
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,866
Thorvard:
My lord Ragnar.

572
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,469
I hope you bring better news
than the last.

573
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,371
My lord, after you left,

574
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,719
The Saxons treacherously
attacked

575
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,774
King Horik's camp at Wessex.

576
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:16,012
There was a terrible slaughter.
A great many warriors perished.

577
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:19,382
The king and his son only just
escaped with their lives.

578
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,618
What about athelstan?
What happened to athelstan?

579
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:25,888
My lord, I don't know
of whom you speak.

580
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,558
Why has it taken so long
for me to hear this news?

581
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:31,394
My lord, bad news travels
a great deal slower

582
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:33,396
Than good news.

583
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:36,566
(worried murmurs)

584
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,702
Man 1:
Make way, make way.

585
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:40,937
Man 2:
It's Lagertha.

586
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,725
Man 1: Make way, make way.
It's Lagertha.

587
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:46,985
Ragnar: (whispers) we
shall speak later.

588
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,011
Thank you.

589
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,021
What is wrong?

590
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:02,692
I have something important
to say.

591
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,427
Should it be said in private?

592
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:08,698
No. I want to say it
before everyone.

593
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:11,767
(townsfolk whisper)

594
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,855
Lagertha:
I have come to a decision.

595
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,837
More than anything
in the world,

596
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:40,830
To stay here with his father.

597
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,934
And who can blame him?

598
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:49,805
If you had a father
like Ragnar Lothbrok,

599
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:51,807
Would you not want to stay?

600
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,876
(murmurs of agreement)

601
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:01,050
I happily give my permission
to my beloved and only son

602
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:04,787
To remain here with his father
and his half brothers.

603
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:18,935
As for me...
I must go back to my husband.

604
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:22,438
I have a duty;
I am a responsible person.

605
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,610
(upset murmurs)

606
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:35,885
But I leave my son
in your good hands.

607
00:41:35,986 --> 00:41:38,988
(fire crackles, quiet murmurs)

608
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:49,899
Look after him, Ragnar.
He's all I have left.

609
00:41:58,075 --> 00:42:00,443
(townsfolk murmur quietly)

610
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:08,417
(loud chatter resumes)

611
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,760
(horse snorts)

612
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:20,563
Aslaug:
Lagertha.

613
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,398
(sighs heavily)

614
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:25,735
Thank you.

615
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:27,336
There are no possible words
to describe

616
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:29,739
What you have done for us.

617
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:32,675
I will always be in your debt.

618
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:34,910
The debt is already paid.

619
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:41,917
The future is open.
Trust in the gods.

620
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,025
Live for each moment.

621
00:42:53,563 --> 00:42:55,931
(horse whinnies)

622
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:13,182
Don't take any more shit!

623
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,094
Lagertha:
Who do you think I am?!

624
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,120
(hooves thud)

625
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:23,759
(hooves thud)

626
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:27,745

627
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:28,264
(sighs)
