00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,164
- Who is Peter?
<i>- [Anna] Our leader</i>

656
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,240
- Oh, so you have a leader.
<i>- Yes A wonderful leader</i>

657
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,241
<i>You'll meet him</i>

658
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,744
Aren't you coming to the settlement?
There isn't another for eight miles.

659
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,815
I told her we were looking for work.

660
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,583
We should be glad to,
but, uh, there are four of us.

661
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:08,624
Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper,
four more won't make any difference.

662
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,625
<i>[Lohrmann]</i>
<i>Did you say 111?</i>

663
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:14,060
Thirty-nine brothers,
47 sisters and 25 children.

664
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,826
Hmm. What are you? Mormons?

665
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,834
Mormons?
No. Hutterites.

666
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,337
[Laughs]
I didn't mean we were all one family.

667
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,840
We're only brothers and sisters in God.

668
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,608
Hurry up, boy.
You are a slow boy.

669
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:43,559
Anna, more bread for our guests.

670
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,518
We're sorry about the bread.

671
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,520
Mmm.
I know a bit about baking.

672
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,523
If you don't mind my saying so,
you ought to get a new baker.

673
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,526
- We had a good one,
but he went to Small Springs.
- Mmm. Better pay?

674
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,188
Pay?
Oh, no one gets paid here.

675
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,858
- Doesn't anyone get paid anything?
- No.

676
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,868
Well, what do you work for, then?
Just your keep?

677
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,870
No. For us all.

678
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,566
What, all these people
work for nothing?

679
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,575
- Yeah.
- What sort of work?

680
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,668
Whatever suits them best.

681
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,010
Well, what do you mean?
They don't choose themselves, do they?

682
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,573
- Haven't you got a leader of the community?
- Yes. There he is over there.

683
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,348
Where?
Which is your leader?

684
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,686
There.
Third from the right.

685
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,292
Well, doesn't he tell the people
what sort of job they've got to do?

686
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,869
Oh, no.
We tell him what <i>we</i> want to do.

687
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,098
Then how can he be your leader?

688
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,174
How do you mean?

689
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,505
Well, anyone works
at whatever job they like, then.

690
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:14,516
Yeah, that's right.
If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes.

691
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:17,519
If he wants to be a blacksmith,
he works in the forge.

692
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,522
If somebody feels he can preach,
well, he preaches.

693
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,751
Well, what's your specialty?

694
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,157
I'm... the baker.

695
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,427
When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg,
what happens to the money?

696
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,936
We buy new tractors, build houses,
found new settlements.

697
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,633
We just founded a new one
over at Small Springs.

698
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,143
And if someone leaves you and then
wants to come back, don't you punish them?

699
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,145
- Punish?
- Yes.

700
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,148
Don't you send them
to a camp or something?

701
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,650
Camp? Why a camp?

702
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,654
No, we just take them back
because our religion tells us to.

703
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,316
- The Hutterite religion?
- The Christian religion.

704
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,857
- ## [All Singing]
- Is it one of your rules to sing like this?

705
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,868
We haven't any rules. We sing because
we like to. It's good for the digestion.

706
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,938
## [Continues]

707
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,574
Well, good night.
The leader will look after you.

708
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,906
- Thank you.
- What's the salute?

709
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,638
The what?

710
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,237
Don't you give the leader
a salute?

711
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,251
[Chuckles]

712
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,054
- Good evening, friends.
- Good evening.

713
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,057
On behalf of my friends and myself,
I have to thank you for your kindness...

714
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,059
in giving us food and shelter.

715
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,061
You're welcome.

716
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,964
I hear you come from up north in the woods,
or down north, as we call it here.

717
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,968
Yes.

718
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,698
- Just come out?
- Last week.

719
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,475
Are you Germans?

720
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,942
I ask, are you Germans?

721
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,945
Yes.

722
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,947
Are you ashamed of it?

723
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,017
Of course not.

724
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,482
I'll show you where to sleep.

725
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,558
<i>[Hirth]</i>
<i>Thank you</i>

726
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,426
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Most of us are Germans</i>

727
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:12,592
<i>You may find some from the same part</i>
<i>of the old country as yourselves</i>

728
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,603
Anna, I thought you would have
told them all about us.

729
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,605
[Vogel]
We mostly discussed birthdays.

730
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,268
[Chuckles] Well, it's quite an event with us,
the 16th birthday.

731
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,347
It means that one has grown up at last.
Come in, please.

732
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,646
This house
belonged to Hugo Waldner...

733
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,311
one of our brothers
who has gone to the new settlement.

734
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,320
- At Small Springs?
- Yes.

735
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,583
You see, we are like bees.

736
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,387
If we get too many,
we send out a swarm.

737
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,588
So the house is empty
and at your service.

738
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,597
Good night.

739
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,667
- Sleep well.
<i>- [Hirth] Good night</i>

740
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,977
Hmm.
That's what I call a busy girl.

741
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,980
It's nothing.
I make 14 beds every night.

742
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,982
That's a lot of work.

743
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,485
We have a lot of men who have no mothers
and who aren't married yet.

744
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,750
- So somebody has to make their beds.
- Quite right.

745
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:15,564
<i>Two of you can sleep in here,</i>
<i>and there are two more beds in the other room</i>

746
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,758
- Where do you sleep?
- In Peter's house.

747
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,768
- In Peter's house?
<i>- But I don't make the bed for him</i>

748
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,772
- Poor Peter. Why not?
- Because he has a mother to look after him.

749
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,468
<i>[Vogel]</i>
<i>Haven't you a mother?</i>

750
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,444
No. She was drowned.

751
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,481
Drowned?

752
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,550
In the sea.

753
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,290
When we left Germany...

754
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,519
we went to England...

755
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,757
because we had to wait
until we got a permit to come to Canada.

756
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,225
We got our permit
after war was declared.

757
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,236
Was your father with you?

758
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,330
Wait a minute.
I want to hear about her mother.

759
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,999
Her ship was sunk.

760
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,872
<i>[Kranz]</i>
<i>Torpedoed?</i>

761
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,741
I think so.

762
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,815
Don't you know?

763
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,315
- Was there a big explosion?
<i>- [Anna Whimpers]</i>

764
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,387
Shut up, you two.
You and your questions.

765
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,324
<i>Don't answer them, Anna</i>

766
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,527
Oh, leave that.

767
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,598
- Run along now.
- I'll take her home.

768
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,458
All right, you take her.

769
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,935
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.

770
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,943
Chins up.

771
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,104
<i>[Hirth]</i>
<i>Remember then, do nothing without orders</i>

772
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,114
<i>Discipline is more important</i>
<i>now than ever</i>

773
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,275
<i>So far, luck has been with us</i>

774
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,286
<i>It's a great stroke of fortune</i>
<i>being here at all</i>

775
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,619
- Do you think they are friendly, <i>Herr Leutnant?</i>
- Friendly? Yes.

776
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,626
But you saw how their leader
tried to draw us out.

777
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,629
"Are you Germans?
Are you ashamed of being Germans?"

778
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,132
- That in a country with which we are at war.
- There can only be one answer to that.

779
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,429
Our agents have done their work well.

780
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,937
Yes. This religion may be
nothing but a cover.

781
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,940
I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song
better than hymns.

782
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,237
We shall see that tomorrow.
<i>Heil Hitler</i>

783
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,244
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

784
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,314
Shut the door.

785
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,947
<i>Well, Vogel, who knows?</i>

786
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,356
<i>Rerhaps one day the story of our adventures</i>
<i>will all be written in a book</i>

787
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,760
In a few years time, it may be the basis
of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.

788
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,858
The ships we sank,
with women and children aboard...

789
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,529
the lifeboats we shelled —

790
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,539
mmm, we were good at that.

791
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,542
What we did to the Eskimos
at the post...

792
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,078
the unarmed men
we shot in the back.

793
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,081
You forget, Vogel, we're at war.

794
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,084
We can't expect to win
without the methods of total warfare.

795
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,952
Men, women and children — they're all
our enemies and must be treated as such.

796
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:57,857
Did you never read what Bismarck said?
"Leave them only their eyes to weep with."

797
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:03,390
"Leave them only their eyes
to weep with."

798
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,399
Did he say that?

799
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,664
<i>Those were his actual words</i>
<i>in the war of 1870</i>

800
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,899
<i>You should study Bismarck</i>
<i>He was a great German</i>

801
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,976
A great German.

802
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,235
You know, Vogel,
I'm worried about you.

803
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,713
You're a good fellow,
but you don't discipline yourself.

804
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,309
<i>You give way to emotions</i>
<i>That'll land you in trouble one of these days</i>

805
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,791
<i>Why don't you take an example from Kranz,</i>
<i>a fine, soldierly fellow</i>

806
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,860
You could be just as good a Nazi as he is
if you tried.

807
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,697
- Are you listening, Vogel?
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

808
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,700
- Then think it over.
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

809
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,260
- And get out of bed and turn out the light.
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

810
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,044
[Sighs]

811
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,692
Vogel, I —

812
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,266
[Snoring]

813
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,999
<i>- Herr Leutnant?</i>
- Either of you seen Vogel?

814
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,007
- No, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>
- Well, get dressed at once.

815
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,362
- [Woman] Good morning, friend.
- Good morning.

816
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,111
He's asking for you.

817
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,340
Oh? All right.

818
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,852
Well? Aren't you going?

819
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,855
Well, I can't go
till I've got this lot ready.

820
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,857
What shall I tell him?

821
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,086
I'll be along in a minute.

822
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,966
[Chattering]

823
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:23,772
<i>[Man] Now, where's this new baker</i>
<i>I hear about, eh?</i>

824
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,773
Ah.

825
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,036
Now, that's what I call bread.

826
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:31,170
<i>- [All Murmuring Agreement]</i>
<i>- [Man] You'll have to teach David the trick</i>

827
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,182
<i>[David] Trick or no trick,</i>
<i>I could never make bread as good as that</i>

828
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,185
Cheer up, David.
It took me seven years.

829
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:42,018
<i>- Why ever did you want to give it up?</i>
- I didn't want to give it up. I had to.

830
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,286
- You see, we all had —
<i>- [Door Slams]</i>

831
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:48,124
<i>[Man] Reterl</i>
<i>Just come and look at this breadl</i>

832
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,065
Good morning, friend.

833
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:55,001
Mr. Vogel is the best baker
we've had here in 15 years.

834
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,902
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>why his last boss let him go</i>

835
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,204
<i>Must have been crazy</i>
<i>lfhe wasn't then, he is now</i>

836
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:06,306
Congratulations, Vogel.
It was a good idea.

837
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,647
Round the barn!

838
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,906
What's the news in Winnipeg?

839
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,808
The market was good for geese.
People are asking for Hutterite geese.

840
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,005
I don't like that, Andreas.

841
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,275
No?

842
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,513
For 300 years our brethren
have wandered from place to place...

843
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,089
from country to country...

844
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,488
because of the jealousy of others.

845
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,352
This is a good country, Andreas.

846
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,093
- I met Frau Habermann.
- Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?

847
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:36,501
Her husband and her eldest son, Eric,
are to be interned. She is free.

848
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,940
Bad luck...

849
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,942
just at harvest time.

850
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,444
It wasn't a good day for the trial.

851
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:49,280
Papers are full of stories about those Germans
who landed from a U-boat down north.

852
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,616
They seem to have acted like wild beasts,
killing and stealing.

853
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,623
- What's Frau Habermann going to do?
- I had a talk with her.

854
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,956
- She needs help on the farm.
- It'll be difficult.

855
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,225
We'll talk it over. Tell the others
we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?

856
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,233
[Exhales]
Air's heavy.

857
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,304
I'm afraid we're going to
have a storm tonight.

858
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,406
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late, Peter.

859
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,636
Barbarina, there's an electric storm
playing all around us...

860
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,838
frightening the animals
and your chickens.

861
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:21,110
- Move over, Philip.
<i>- What about you, Anna?</i>

862
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,117
- Andreas.
- Huh?

863
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,120
- One of our guests is speaking.
- Eh? What? Oh! Good!

864
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,190
We're discussing the Habermanns.

865
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,555
I was about to say...

866
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,458
you have one clear choice.

867
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,723
Where there is a question of blood...

868
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,392
where one is governed
by the deepest of racial instincts...

869
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,630
then every other consideration
is swept aside.

870
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,208
Men like yourself—
German, or of German ancestry—

871
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:53,248
<i>rise up with all the might and power</i>
<i>of the great German people behind you</i>

872
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:56,147
conscious of the sacred duty
that binds us all together...

873
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,153
and in the knowledge that he
who doesn't forget his people...

874
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,723
will not by his people be forgotten.

875
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,684
There is a new wind
blowing from the east...

876
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,922
a great storm
coming across the sea...

877
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:13,330
<i>a hurricane which will sweep aside</i>
<i>all the old, outmoded ways oflife</i>

878
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,462
<i>and mark the beginning of a new order,</i>
<i>not only for Europe</i>

879
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,597
<i>but for the whole world</i>

880
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,201
Let those beware who would have
the temerity to stand in its way.

881
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,746
They will go down
before its irresistible impulse...

882
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,306
and be crushed out of existence!

883
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:33,616
<i>But for those who accept the new order</i>
<i>or those who perhaps belong to it already</i>

884
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,625
why need I use
these parables of speech any longer?

885
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,888
I mean, all of you here tonight —

886
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,692
yes, you, brothers —

887
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,824
I call you brothers
and proudly acknowledge you as such.

888
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,098
You who formed a little stronghold
of our people here in Canada...

889
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:52,106
you will have your share
of the happiness and prosperity...

890
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:56,440
that is waiting for us all
when the storm is over and the sun rises —

891
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,513
that mighty sun —

892
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,917
<i>which will give us</i>
<i>everything we need in life</i>

893
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,385
What sun are you
talking about, friend?

894
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,980
I am talking of
the greatest idea in history—

895
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,891
supremacy of the Nordic race,
the German people.

896
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:17,193
I am talking of the being whose name
I am certain lives in every heart...

897
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,995
whose name hangs on all our lips...

898
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:25,062
whether we can shout it to the world
or only whisper it in one another's ears.

899
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,574
Germans!

900
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,202
Brothers!

901
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:35,682
I ask you to join with me
in paying homage to our glorious führer.

902
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,653
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

903
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,654
[Kranz, Lohrmann]
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

904
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,725
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

905
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:07,212
I don't ask where you come from
or what brought you here...

906
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,781
although you've left us
in no doubt as to your beliefs.

907
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:17,455
Someone has given you,
no doubt deliberately...

908
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,926
a completely false impression of us.

909
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:25,263
We are only one amongst
many foreign settlements in Canada.

910
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,825
There are thousands of them
in this part of the world.

911
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:34,171
And they have been founded,
some recently, some 80 years ago...

912
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:38,906
by people who left their homes
in Europe because of famine...

913
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,107
because of starvation...

914
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,685
because of racial
and political persecution...

915
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,085
and some, like ourselves,
because of their faith.

916
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,647
<i>Some came only to find new land</i>

917
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,421
<i>new boundaries, a new world</i>

918
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,989
But all have found here in Canada...

919
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,159
the security...

920
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:04,933
the peace and tolerance
and understanding...

921
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,668
which, in Europe...

922
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:12,072
it is your führer's pride
to have stamped out.

923
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,610
<i>You call us Germans</i>

924
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:19,176
You call us brothers.

925
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,191
Yes. Most of us are Germans.

926
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,692
Our names are German.
Our tongue is German.

927
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,594
Our old handwritten books
are in German script.

928
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:34,158
But we are not your brothers.

929
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,172
Our Germany is dead.

930
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:43,372
However hard this may be
for some of us older people...

931
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,380
it's a blessing for our children.

932
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,782
Our children grew up against
new backgrounds, new horizons.

933
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,287
And they are free...

934
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,826
free to grow up as children...

935
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:02,364
free to run and to laugh
without being forced into uniforms...

936
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,524
without being forced to march
up and down the streets...

937
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,125
singing battle songs.

938
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,372
You talk about a new order in Europe.

939
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,870
The new order...

940
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,075
where there will not be one corner...

941
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:26,052
not a hole big enough for a mouse...

942
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,613
where a decent man can breathe freely.

943
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,118
<i>You think we hate you, but we don't</i>

944
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,394
It is against our faith to hate.

945
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,402
We only hate the power of evil
which is spreading over the world.

946
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:46,838
You and your Hitlerism...

947
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:52,842
are like the microbes
of some filthy disease...

948
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:57,408
filled with a longing
to multiply yourselves...

949
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:03,014
until you destroy everything
healthy in the world.

950
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,818
No.

951
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,764
We are not your brothers.

952
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,881
What do you want?

953
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:31,180
I am come to tell you that
you can make your own beds.

954
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,187
I don't want to work for you.

955
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,553
<i>[Vogel]</i>
<i>That's all right, Anna Run along now</i>

956
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,650
You're Nazis, aren't you?

957
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,252
Aren't you?

958
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,059
We're not allowed to hate anybody.

959
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,294
But I hate you.

960
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,600
I believed you'd escaped
from an internment camp.

961
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,606
I should tell the police about you.

962
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,271
You killed my father...

963
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:02,339
because he said your führer
was the Antichrist.

964
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,249
You drowned my mother.

965
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,481
I hate you.

966
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,489
I hate you!

967
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:12,617
So you're going to tell
the police about us, are you?

968
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,358
Little girls should be seen
and not heard.

969
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,433
- That will do.
- What's the matter with you?

970
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,697
<i>- That will dol</i>
- Vogel.

971
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,103
Come along, Anna.
I'll take you home.

972
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,540
<i>- Herr Leutnant,</i> we can't let them go.
- I'd like to see what you're
going to do about it.

973
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,441
- Vogel!
- Yes, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>

974
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,605
Have you forgotten who you are?

975
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,616
<i>- No,</i> Herr Leutnant.
- Let the girl go and shut the door.

976
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,653
I'll take her home, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>

977
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,415
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

978
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,602
Is that you, Anna?

979
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,231
Yes, Peter.

980
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,446
I brought Anna home.

981
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,687
She's all right.

982
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,700
We're going now,
perhaps in a few minutes.

983
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,266
I only wanted to say that
you've been kind and I like it here.

984
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,677
You like my bread,
and I like the way you live.

985
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,912
Being with you has made me feel
like it used to be at home.

986
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,647
I'd almost forgotten
what it was like...

987
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,191
baking bread,
doing my real work.

988
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:54,786
That's how it used to be seven years ago
before everything changed.

989
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:59,197
The life I've been living
seems to have no sense in it now.

990
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,394
Well, I'd better go now.

991
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,494
Please don't go.

992
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:13,579
- Are they still talking?
- Hush, child. Go to sleep.

993
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:18,642
How can a man like you, Vogel —

994
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,417
I mean, you're a simple,
good human being.

995
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:28,156
How can you get mixed up
with such a lot of gangsters?

996
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,629
What can you do?

997
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,031
When you're a boy,
you like playing soldiers.

998
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:38,072
When you're a young man, you can't
get work unless you belong to them.

999
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,108
When you're an old man,
you're anxious not to lose what you've got.

1000
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,179
But there are thousands
of men like you, Vogel...

1001
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,406
men who don't like
the way things are going.

1002
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,415
I suppose so.

1003
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:51,486
I suppose they don't know
themselves. I didn't know.

1004
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:55,921
It's as if a blind man said
he doesn't know the sun shines.

1005
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:59,790
- I suppose so.
- Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?

1006
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,696
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I mean it.

1007

Even if you know who I am,
where I come from—

1008

I don't care who you are

1009
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:15,573

- Thank you, Peter.

1010
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:20,070

1011
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,412

You saw what the bulletin said.
They're watching the border.

But they don't know there are only three of us.
They still think there are five.

- About 2,000 kilometers.

1045
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:33,528
- We can never get as far as that.
- The führer has never admitted the word "can't."

1046
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,126
Neither should we.

1047
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,706

must be how to get to —

<i>- [Man] Ham sandwich, sir</i>
- How to get home.

that destiny, but she will achieve it.

01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,385
For Indian Day? No, no, no.

1148
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,217
That's just for tourists.
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1149
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,587

1150
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:23,305
Well, gentlemen.
Welcome to my humble tepee.

<i>Got two this time, George</i>
<i>I'm improving</i>

1152
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:42,685
And tell Bob
two more for dinner. Well.

1153
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,163
It must be very pleasant
roughing it up here in the mountains.

1154
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:47,894
Yes, I rather like
pigging it occasionally.

1155
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,129
I hope you won't mind
taking potluck with me.

1156
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,866
Here, have a cigarette.

1157
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:55,943
Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso.

1158
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,170
It's nice, isn't it?

1159
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,179
Here.

1160
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,408
How do you feel about Matisse?

1161
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,918
I picked these up about a year ago,
and I can't bear to be parted from them.

1162
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,920
How do you like it, hmm?

1163
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:12,252
- Excellent.

1164
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,295
I don't think you two are
really interested in pictures.

1165
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:18,024
Well, my motto is,
wars may come and wars may go...

1166
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,157
but art goes on forever.

1167
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,566
Ah, you like reading, don't you?

1168
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,570
Have you seen Hemingway's latest?

1169
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:27,436
Here. I'm going to
show you one of my pets.

1170
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,636
There. Thomas Mann,

By the way, do you speak German?
Have you read this book?

1175
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:43,456
Thomas Mann is very good, I believe.

1176
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:47,358
I'm so sorry. Of course,
you'll want a bath after your long climb.

1177
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:50,658
I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower.
Come on. I'll show you the way.

1178
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,393
- Thank you very much, Mr. —

Ah, hot water.

1182
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,649
I feel completely confident tonight.

1183
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,377
If we'd twice as far to go,
I wouldn't worry now.

1184
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:15,385
What could these
weaklings ever do to us?

1185
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:17,787
The man's country's at war

01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,019
I tell you, Lohrmann,
they're rotten to the core.

1187
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:24,587
There's no fight in them.
They're soft and degenerate all through.

1188
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,327

Yes, I've discovered some rather
amusing things during my researches.

1194
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:53,383
Blackfoot tribal customs,
for instance, closely resemble those...

1195
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:56,019
of a certain modern
European tribe.

1196
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,428
I'm gonna read you
something about that.

1205
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:30,389
Well, doesn't that sound
familiar to you?

1206
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,466
Familiar?

1209
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:42,237

This ought to be enlightening.

you'd have struck me across the face

Come on, have a cigarette.

1264
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:20,657
I don't think you're even a coward.
I don't think you're a man at all.

Such a thing couldn't happen
to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott.

1275
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:55,455

01:38:58,799 --> 01:39:02,428
Suppose I was to tell you that
the war is right here in this tent?

1278
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:08,500
I don't suppose you've heard of
the U-boat that was sunk in Hudson Bay
and the six Germans who escaped.

1279
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:14,177
So that's who you are — Nazis.

Get over there by your books!

01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,597
Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up?

1284
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:35,601
Excuse us, Mr. Scott.
We still employ savage, tribal methods.

1285
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:37,933
They get results.

1286
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:44,702
The best thing that's
happened to us is meeting you.
You've put the heart back into us.

1287
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,940
There are only two of us now.
Two out of six brave men.

1288
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:49,948
There are millions like us in Germany.

1289

Any more of your sort here,

Think yourself lucky
we don't burn you too.

1310
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:31,209
Well, I never would've believed
that grown-up men...

1311
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:34,287
could behave like
spiteful little schoolboys.

1312
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:38,115
Have I said something to annoy you?

1313
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:40,716
Then, I forget,
anything reasonable annoys you.

1314
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:44,286
- Open your mouth.
- One question, please.

1315
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:48,835
When Hitler's making a speech,
just exactly what are your rea —

1316
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,211
Damn them horses.
Stampeded again.

1317
01:42:01,315 --> 01:42:03,545
<i>- Maybe they got wind of something</i>
<i>- [Man #2] Maybe a bear</i>

1318
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:06,881
<i>- [Whinnying]</i>
- There. There they go.

1319
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:23,699
[Whinnying]

1320
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:29,307
[Whispers]
This way.

1321
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:39,944
Who's been leaving a saddle out here?

1322
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:42,146
Confound it!
Here's another one.

1323
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:44,952
Boss must've gone crazy.

1324
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:46,958
You've made a fine mess of things.
You've roused the whole camp.

1325
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,960
The horses were your idea.
I knew they'd give trouble.

1326
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,860
- You forget yourself, Lohrmann.
- Save your breath, Hirth.

1327
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:58,295
<i>Hey, Bobl</i>
<i>They're gone down by the lakel</i>

1328
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:00,498
Hirth! Not that way!

1329
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:02,768
- Who are you talking to?
- You're not my superior officer now.

1330
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,777
- Obey orders and follow me!
- Orders be —

1331
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:11,376
All right.

1332
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:15,785
Come on, George. Art! Art!

1333
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,789
<i>Where are you?</i>

1334
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:21,088
<i>- Here, Mr Scottl</i>
<i>- [Scott] On the trail</i>

1335

1338
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:37,737
<i>Bob, Bob, Mr Scott wants youl</i>

1339
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:40,005
<i>[Bob]</i>
<i>Okayl</i>

1340
01:43:42,482 --> 01:43:44,916
- What's happened, Boss?
- A holdup. Those two fellas —

1341
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:47,213
- No!
- Yes.
- [George Grunts]

1342
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:49,482
- Oh, there's one of them.
- Good old George.

1343
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:53,982
<i>- [Man Shouts]</i>
<i>- Right herel</i>

1344
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:56,255
<i>Coming your wayl</i>

1345
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:59,958
<i>- [Shouting, Indistinct]</i>
<i>- [Shouts]</i>

1346
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,297
<i>Where are you?</i>

1347
01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:08,604
- Looks like he's lost it.
- Confound it.

1348
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:13,939
He's got it, the old bloodhound.
Come on.

1349
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:24,085
<i>- [Scott] Where is he, George? In the cave?</i>
<i>- [George Grunts]</i>

1350
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:26,091
<i>What are we waiting for?</i>
<i>Let's get him</i>

1351
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:29,856
- Which one of them two is it, Boss?
- I don't know. Did you see, George?

1352
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:32,426
All right, George?

1353
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:38,099
I forgot to tell you, Art.
He's got my Colt, too.

1354
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,598
See that hole?

1355
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:46,110
That's gonna cost him seven bucks
before I let the Mounties get him.

1356
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:48,113
That means he's got four shots left.

1357
01:44:48,215 --> 01:44:50,775
<i>All right, Bob I'll take over now</i>

1358
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:53,944
- Okay, Boss, but I don't think
you ought to take any—
- Let me stay with you, Mr. Scott.

1359
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:57,683
- The papers say these men are killers.
- Yes, the Canadian papers.

1360
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:00,521
The Nazi papers call them heroes.

1361
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:05,360
Two brave Nazis
against 11 million Canadians.

1362
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,967
Say, Mr. Scott.

1363
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:12,504
Mr. Scott.

1364
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:16,008
<i>- Stop him</i>
<i>- [Gunshot]</i>

1365
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:17,576
One.

1366
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,242
<i>- [Gunshot]</i>
- Two.

1367
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:31,951
<i>- [Gunshot]</i>

1368
01:45:35,595 --> 01:45:39,588
<i>- [Gunshot]</i>
- Four.

1369
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,938
That's the lot.

1370
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:05,456
<i>Oh, it's you</i>
<i>I hoped it was the other fellow</i>

1371
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:12,762
<i>- [Scuffling]</i>
<i>- [Scott] That's for Thomas Mann</i>

1372
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:16,063
<i>- [Blows Landing]</i>
<i>- That's for Matisse</i>

1373
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:21,136
<i>- [Scuffling Continues]</i>
<i>- That's for Ricasso</i>

1374
01:46:21,241 --> 01:46:24,369
<i>- [Blows Landing]</i>
<i>- And that's for me</i>

1375
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:40,349
All right, you can fetch him out now.

1376
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:49,334
You all right, Boss?

1377
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:53,372
Well, you can't expect me to capture
an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little.

1378
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:56,738
- Yet —
- Here. Let me have a look at that.

1379
01:46:56,843 --> 01:46:59,437
The boss has knocked him cold.

1380
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:04,607
Well, he had a fair chance.

1381
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:07,886
One armed superman...

1382
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:13,150
against one unarmed decadent democrat.

1383
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:18,323
I wonder how Dr. Goebbels
will explain that.

1384
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,730

You needn't be afraid of me.
I won't split on you.

1411

I'm not afraid.

1412
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:22,205
Looks like you got a nice private car.
Have a cigarette.

1413
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:37,253
Sit down.

1414
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:39,264
Thank you.

1415
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:43,734
- Comin' from Toronto?
- Yes.

1416
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:46,135
- Livin' there, maybe?
- No.

1417
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,265
- Quite a place, Toronto.
- I didn't see much of it.

1418
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:52,072
- Are you from the west?
- Well, I've been there.

1419
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:54,646
- Vancouver?
- Yes.

1420
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:57,342
That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver.

1421
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,350
I didn't stay there long either.

1422
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:02,580
- You don't stay long anywhere, do you?
- Well, I travel about a good deal.

1423
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:05,988
Travel about.
That's a lot of fun.

1424
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:09,755
When I was a kid, I had the big idea
to see the whole of Canada.

1425
01:51:09,863 --> 01:51:12,058
But things don't work out
the way you think.

1426
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:14,725
I save a bit of money,
and what do I do?

1427
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:17,132
Put it in my pocket and
start off down the road...

1428
01:51:17,237 --> 01:51:20,365
my own boss, with the whole
of Canada in front of me?

1429
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:22,441
Not on your life.

1430
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:24,533
I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way.

1431
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:28,102
And that keeps me so busy,
that's about all of Canada I see.

1432
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:30,944
Have a shot of Ontario wine.

1433
01:51:31,985 --> 01:51:33,885
Catawba.

1434
01:51:33,987 --> 01:51:37,514
I send the grapes to the winery
from my own farm.

1435
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:40,286
- Sherry-type.
- Thank you.

1436
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:42,327
Got a kick like a mule.

1437
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:49,433
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday.

1438
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:52,096
But do I take a holiday?
Not a bit of it.

1439
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:54,298
- I take a wife.
<i>- [Brakes Squeal]</i>

1440
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,148
Say, were there any M.P.'s around
while you've been here?

1441
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:06,184
- M.P.'s?
- Military police.

1442
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:09,255
- Are you in trouble with the police?
- Not exactly what you'd call trouble.

1443
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:11,346
I just don't wanna
meet 'em, that's all.

1444
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:14,791
- Are you a soldier?
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.

1445
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:16,885
That's what I joined up to be.

1446
01:52:16,996 --> 01:52:21,262
The government said,
"We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today."

1447
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:24,700
So I joined.
I figured they were in a hurry.

1448
01:52:24,804 --> 01:52:27,534
That was 387 days ago.

1449
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,938
Four divisions and a lot of drafts
have gone overseas...

1450
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:34,002
and what's Number B-987642 doing?

1451
01:52:34,114 --> 01:52:38,483
Guardin' the Chippewa Canal.
Who'd wanna steal it anyway?

1452
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:41,383
<i>- [Bell Ringing]</i>
<i>- [Train Rattling]</i>

1453
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:44,651
Well, I guess I better climb
back into my battle rompers.

1454
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:46,692
Do you think your government
have treated you badly?

1455
01:52:46,793 --> 01:52:51,253
<i>Well, what do you think?</i>
<i>I didn't enlist to play nursemaid</i>

1456
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:54,128
I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis.

1457
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:58,500
I'm about as close to getting my hands
on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning.

1458
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,505
<i>We don't eat so good</i>

1459
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:04,873
Holy mackinaw,
beef, three times a day.

1460
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:07,412
Haven't tasted parsnips
since I joined the army.

1461
01:53:07,514 --> 01:53:11,507
- I'm fond of parsnips, too.
- Why are you afraid of the police?

1462
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:14,519
Who's afraid of the police?

1463
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:16,521
I just overstayed my leave eight days.

1464
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,921
That is a serious offense in wartime.

1465
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:21,960
<i>- Says who? My CO?</i>
- You're a deserter.

1466
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:26,589
Deserter, my royal Canadian foot.

Okay.

- Same way. Two unlisted items.
