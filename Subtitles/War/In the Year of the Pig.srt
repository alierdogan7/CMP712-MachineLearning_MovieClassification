I think the most significant aspect...

35
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,997
<i>has been the suppression</i>
<i>of political activity...</i>

00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,033
<i>to force the people</i>
<i>to go underground...</i>

<i>[Man] One of the most important</i>
<i>things concerning Ho Chi Minh...</i>

43
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,960
<i>is the fact that he spent so long</i>—
<i>years</i>— <i>out ofhis country...</i>

44
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,864
<i>and that, nevertheless,</i>
<i>he has the touch and feel...</i>

<i>of the peasantry ofhis country,</i>
<i>of the village...</i>

<i>for village life in Vietnam...</i>

47
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,662
<i>is the essential</i>
<i>of the life of the nation.</i>

48
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,700
<i>I wouldjust give you one anecdote</i>
<i>to show you that connection.</i>

49
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,071
<i>When he, for the first time,</i>
<i>met a press</i>—

50
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,051
<i>gave a press conference in Hanoi...</i>

51
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,555
<i>in 1945...</i>

52
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,548
<i>where he came for the first time</i>
<i>as a leader ofhis nation...</i>

53
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,730
<i>in front of the public...</i>

54
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,466
<i>he said to the people there...</i>

55
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,602
<i>"I can't tell you</i>
<i>what you have to do...</i>

56
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,739
but I can show it to you."

57
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,841
Put his thumb on the table...

58
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,609
and said...

59
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,580
"If everywhere
where you put your thumb...

60
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,982
"on the sacred earth of Vietnam...

61
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,986
"there is a plant growing,
then we will succeed.

If not, not."

63
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,881
Now, this is, again,
one of the points where Ho...

64
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,129
on one hand, is a Marxist economist...

65
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,033
who knows the importance
of the basic production...

66
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,903
and, on the other hand,
a Confucian scholar...

67
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,896
because what you have to have in mind
to understand that idea...

68
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,076
of the thumb on the earth...

69
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,913
is a simple Chinese proverb.

70
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,082
"A thumb square...

71
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,052

00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,087
"is more precious...

place about Ho Chi Minh...

00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,728

82
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,252
the life of Ho Chi Minh changed,
in my opinion.

83
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,245
Where Ho Chi Minh,
who came in 1917 in Paris...

84
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,294
as a peasant, an Asian peasant...

85
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,297
became really revolutionary...

86

104
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,219
<i>after that, a communist.</i>

105
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,122

we failed to recognize...

114
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,049
is that Ho Chi Minh...

116
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,254

118

143

<i>and so he</i>—<i>as I understand it</i>
<i>and as I recall it</i>—

144
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>he took the weapons...</i>

145

<i>that he derived from theJapanese...</i>

146
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,157
<i>and turned them over to French...</i>

<i>the French could not have recaptured</i>
<i>their control at Saigon.</i>

151
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,906
I met Ho Chi Minh for the first time...

152
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,744
in Hanoi at the end of'45.

153
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,737
<i>Sent there by d'Argenlieu,</i>
<i>a high commissioner...</i>

154
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>sent by de Gaulle in Saigon.</i>

155
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,245
<i>Wanted me to contact</i>
<i>the Viet Minh leader for the first time.</i>

156
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:42,317
<i>I said to him, "I am sent to you</i>
<i>by the high commissioner...</i>

157
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,797
<i>"in the name of General de Gaulle...</i>

<i>"to tell you...</i>

<i>that we want Vietnam</i>
<i>tojoin us in the French union. "</i>

160
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,241
<i>Looked at me and he said,</i>
<i>"The French union?</i>

161
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,409
<i>"What's that?</i>

162
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,112
<i>Is it a circle, or is it a square?"</i>

163
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,414
<i>That was a test...</i>

164
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,550
<i>because there is a Chinese proverb</i>—

165
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,786
<i>a lot of Chinese proverbs</i>—

166
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,779
<i>which identify heaven</i>
<i>and intelligence...</i>

167
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>with the circle...</i>

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>and earth and solidity</i>
<i>with the square.</i>

169
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,789
<i>Is it an idea, or is it a fact?</i>
<i>Is it somewhere?</i>

170
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,859
<i>So I answered, and I think</i>
<i>it's one of the occasions...</i>

171
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,573
where Ho Chi Minh has been
just a little surprised.

172
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,243
I answered, "I don't know."
He said, "But what are you doing here?"

173
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,236
I said, "I came to ask you
because we have to build it together."

174
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,808
Towards the end
of November
of 1946...

175
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,555
when the admiral
commanding
the French fleet...

176
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,124
in the Bay ofTonkin...

177
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,117
in his words, decided to teach
the Vietnamese government a hard lesson...

178
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,032
the fleet stood off of Haiphong
and shelled the city...

179
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,025
until between 6,000 and 10,000
were killed.

180
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,429
He said, "I have no army."
That's not true now.

181
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,011
"I have no army." 1945.

182
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,447
"I have no finance.

183
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,916
"I have no diplomacy.

184
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,920
"I have no public instruction.

185
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,656
"I have just hatred...

186
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,359
"and I will not disarm it...

187
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,352
until you give me confidence in you."

188
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,167
Now, this is the thing
on which I would insist...

189
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,437
because it's still alive in his memory,
as in mine.

190
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,341
For every time Ho Chi Minh
has trusted us...

191
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,409
we betrayed him.

192
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,912
Here you had a country...

193
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,513
which was not just divided...

194
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,415
at the 17 th parallel.

195
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,085
You had fought the Indochina war...

196
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,989
<i>and all the best and most talented</i>
<i>Vietnamese of a generation...</i>

197
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,492
<i>had faced, in 1946 and 1947...</i>

198
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,495
<i>the alternative of the French...</i>

199
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,898
<i>or the Viet Minh.</i>

200
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>The best of a generation</i>—

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>the kind of young men who wouldjoin up</i>
<i>the day after Pearl Harbor in this country.</i>

202
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,563
<i>Are you going to fight to kick out the French,</i>
<i>or are you going to be a French puppet?</i>

203
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,578
<i>So the most talented people</i>
<i>of a generation all signed up...</i>

204
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,114
<i>and the Viet Minh won this war...</i>

205
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,116
<i>and it was an enormously popular</i>
<i>national war.</i>

206
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,719
<i>At the end of it, they came up with</i>
<i>a dynamic society which had won a war...</i>

207
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,322
<i>which was tested, which was tough...</i>

208
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,315
<i>which had brought up to the top</i>
<i>the very best of a generation.</i>

209
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,063
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>There are some similarities...</i>

210
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,632
<i>between the French...</i>

211
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,336
<i>effort in the Indochina war</i>
<i>in Vietnam...</i>

212
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,138
<i>and the Americans.</i>

213
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,474
<i>The Americans arejust so much</i>
<i>more powerful than the French were.</i>

214
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,643
<i>They have so much more artillery.</i>

215
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,180
<i>They have so much more air power.</i>
<i>They have so many more men.</i>

216
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,649
<i>They have so much more wealth</i>
<i>than the French ever had.</i>

217
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,642
<i>So that they're not going to be</i>
<i>any Dien Bien Phus...</i>

218
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,258
<i>in the American presence there.</i>

219
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,126
<i>[Announcer] In Washington,</i>
<i>the U.S. Secretary of Defense</i>—

220
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,129
<i>[Wilson] The equipment</i>
<i>which we have sent to Indochina...</i>

221
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,265
<i>is highly technical...</i>

222
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>so we are sending technicians...</i>

223
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,203
<i>as a temporary training force.</i>

224
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>We are sending planes, but no pilots.</i>

225
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,966
<i>We are not sending combat troops.</i>

226
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,716
We have seen no reason
for the abandonment...

227
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,785
of the so-called Navarre Plan.

228
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,356
<i>That plan, as you may recall,</i>
<i>broadly speaking...</i>

229
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,157
<i>was a two-year plan...</i>

230
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,150
<i>and contemplated a very substantial</i>
<i>buildup oflocal forces...</i>

231
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,664
<i>and their training and equipment.</i>

232
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,301
<i>[Halberstam] The French moved in</i>
<i>to Dien Bien Phu in 1953</i>—

233
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,670
<i>in January of 1953.</i>

234
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,439
<i>Parachute battalion</i>
<i>came into the area.</i>

235
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,775
<i>The idea was</i>—
<i>There were two aspects of it.</i>

236
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,579
<i>One, to control the piece of ground</i>
<i>and then to prevent the Viet Minh...</i>

237
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,815
<i>from sweeping on into Laos.</i>

238
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,386
<i>I do not expect that there is</i>
<i>going to be a communist victory...</i>

239
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,323
<i>in Indochina.</i>

240
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,316
<i>By that, I don't mean that</i>
<i>there may not be local affairs...</i>

241
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,398
<i>where one side or the other</i>
<i>will win victories.</i>

242
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,300
<i>But in terms of a communist</i>
<i>domination of Indochina...</i>

243
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,337
<i>that I do not accept</i>
<i>as a probability.</i>

244
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>[Halberstam]</i>
<i>The French generals did not believe...</i>

245
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,576
<i>that artillery could be brought to bear</i>
<i>in sufficient quantity...</i>

246
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,779
<i>so, correspondingly,</i>
<i>they were not active...</i>

247
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,848
<i>in their patrolling outside</i>
<i>of their particular perimeter.</i>

248
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,484
<i>The feature was</i>
<i>to keep the focus on the area...</i>

249
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,455
<i>not to cause the quick rush</i>
<i>of the battle position...</i>

250
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,792
<i>but to build</i>
<i>the particular battle position.</i>

251
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,827
The French miscalculated —

252
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,662
as, I think, did we —

253
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,655
<i>in the degree of sophistication</i>
<i>of the weaponry...</i>

254
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,503
<i>that was deployed on the high ground.</i>

255
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,139
<i>We didn't think they could get</i>
<i>these pieces up there...</i>

256
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,508
<i>but they did somehow.</i>

257
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,877
The Battle of Dien Bien Phu...

258
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,870
is a significant phenomenon
in military history...

259
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:07,442
<i>and from all of the standpoints</i>
<i>that one views a war.</i>

260
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,524
<i>It achieved a particular</i>
<i>political objective...</i>

261
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,395
<i>in the full Clausewitzian sense</i>
<i>of the term.</i>

262
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,299
<i>It represented</i>
<i>a tremendous logistical effort...</i>

263
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,168
<i>on the part of the North Vietnamese...</i>

264
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,170
<i>or of General Giap...</i>

265
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,873
<i>to move the artillery pieces...</i>

266
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,810
<i>which changed the balance</i>
<i>of this particular battle significantly.</i>

267
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,714
Forces of aggression seem to be
concentrating just at one point...

268
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,850
at Dien Bien Phu...

269
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,619
<i>where the resistance</i>
<i>is extremely gallant...</i>

270
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,522
<i>against overwhelming odds.</i>

271
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,225
<i>[Lacouture] The French</i>
<i>had begun the war as a colonial war.</i>

272
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,218
<i>They try many times to change</i>
<i>this very nature of the war</i>—

273
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,355
<i>trying to change it in a civil war...</i>

274
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,337
<i>a war between the right and the left</i>
<i>in Vietnam...</i>

275
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,507
<i>and, after that,</i>
<i>an international war...</i>

276
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,500
<i>a crusade against communism.</i>

277
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,670
<i>[Morton] It was clear that the French</i>
<i>were in deep trouble in Dien Bien Phu.</i>

278
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,719
<i>And then Admiral Radford thought</i>
<i>that if we went in with air...</i>

279
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,721
<i>we could knock 'em out.</i>

280
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,358
<i>[Man] Senator Morton,</i>
<i>as you know from my letter to you...</i>

281
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,760
<i>we are very interested</i>
<i>in a meeting</i>—

282
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,753
<i>It was called by Mr. Secretary Dulles</i>
<i>and Admiral Radford...</i>

283
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,267
<i>in which you played a part...</i>

284
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,336
<i>and in which eight members of the congress</i>
<i>of the United States were present</i>—

285
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,539
<i>five senators and two representatives.</i>

286
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,276
<i>I wonder if you could give us your best</i>
<i>recollection of who was at that meeting</i>—

287
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,269
Senator Morton, sound one, take one.

288
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,551
There was a meeting —
I've forgotten the exact date.

289
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,353
This can be easily ascertained.

290
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,346
I assume that the records
have been kept.

291
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,227
The burden of it was...

292
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,529
Admiral Radford's feeling...

293
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,522
that we should really move in...

294
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,560
and bring active support
to the French.

295
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,730
Specifically, air support
from carrier base —

296
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,844
from carriers.

297
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,448
Carriers were available
in the nearby area.

298
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,718
How many missions could have been mounted?
I don't know.

299
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,721
I didn't get into the military details.

300
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,024
And it was felt that the artillery...

301
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,927
that they had on the high ground...

302
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,798
could be destroyed by air attack.

303
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,791
They fail always because they were
always seen by the Vietnamese...

304
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,438
as a foreign power...

305
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,841
trying to get back
its colonial power.

306
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,834
That is why they lost the war
at Dien Bien Phu.

307
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,315
Dien Bien Phu has fallen.

308
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,818
I join with you in paying tribute...

309
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>to the gallant defenders.</i>

310
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,757
<i>May it be given us</i>
<i>to play a worthy part...</i>

311
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,750
<i>to defend the values</i>
<i>for which they gave their lives.</i>

312
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,756
<i>The defense of Dien Bien Phu</i>
<i>of 57 days and nights...</i>

313
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,261
<i>will go down in history</i>
<i>as one of the most heroic of all time.</i>

314
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,733
<i>The defenders, composed</i>
<i>of French and native forces...</i>

315
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,404
<i>inflicted staggering losses</i>
<i>on the enemy.</i>

316

<i>Giap's writing about this...</i>

317
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,811

318
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,793
<i>in Dien Bien Phu,</i>
<i>he was ready</i>—

<i>some eight weeks before</i>
<i>the final movement took place.</i>

321
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,769
<i>I would submit that</i>
<i>the reason for this...</i>

322
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,762
<i>is that Giap and Ho Chi Minh</i>
<i>understood the political nature...</i>

<i>of this particular battle...</i>

324
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,978
<i>and they wanted the politics...</i>

325
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,947
<i>the public opinion in France...</i>

326
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,584
<i>and in the rest of the world,</i>

327

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,590

Indochina, Mr. Jenkins...

341
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,826
we will lose the Pacific...

Situation in the area
as we found it...

344
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,736
was that it was subject
to the so-called domino theory.

345
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,729
That meant that if one nation went,
then another nation would go, and so on.

346
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,177
We're trying to change that
so it won't be the case.

400
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,901
Diem, I said before, was the man of the hour. Why?

401
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,894
<i>Once colonialism came to an end...</i>

<i>could be broken.</i>

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,313
<i>Since colonialism,</i>
<i>the creator of communism, so to speak...</i>

408
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,693
<i>was now dead...</i>

409
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,696
<i>there was a chance</i>
<i>that other forces...</i>

410
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,689
<i>might be able to compete</i>
<i>with Ho Chi Minh.</i>

411
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,102
<i>However, under certain conditions.</i>

412
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,372
<i>They had to be as nationalistic</i>
<i>as Ho Chi Minh.</i>

413
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:58,365
<i>They had to be free of the taint</i>
<i>of collaboration with the French.</i>

414
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,081
<i>They had to be the opposite</i>
<i>of puppets...</i>

415
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,883
of colonialism.

416
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,286

<i>There's no doubt about that.</i>

419
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,494
<i>There was sort of a cult</i>
<i>of the little fellow in the sharkskin suit...</i>

420
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,264
<i>and the little mandarin</i>
<i>who's going to stop the Reds.</i>

that the interest of the Vietnam...

453

455
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,444

00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,536

There is no two Vietnams.

464
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,340
There is only one Vietnam...

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,909
temporarily divided

466
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,545
between a free zone,
which is North Vietnam...

467
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,648
and an occupied zone,
occupied by the French —

468
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,641
but the French had still, after Geneva,
the jurisdiction over South Vietnam...

469
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,957
because they could not hand it over
to a regime which did not exist.

470
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,860
It is not even mentioned
in the Geneva agreement.

471

473
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,002

474
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,138
if only because the kind of election...

475
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,131
envisaged by the Geneva agreement
of 1954 —

476
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,345
a free election —

477
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,513
could not have been held.

478
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,884
Anyone who thinks
that a free election...

479
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,487
was possible
in communist North Vietnam...

480
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,957
knows little
of how communists operate...

481
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,950
and could have fallen into
a Moscow-Peiping trap.

482
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,131
The United States could not agree today...

483
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,067
any more than in 1956...

484
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,504
to legitimizing communist control...

485
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:50,497
of all Vietnam by a device
of a communist-style election.

486
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,478
You all have sat with me...

487
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,482
on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1956...

488
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,475
when our intelligence forces
brought in their reports warning...

489
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,489
that if the election called for
by the Geneva accords...

490
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,992
forJuly 1956 were held...

491
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,095
Ho Chi Minh would be elected
president in South Vietnam...

492
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,698
by at least 80% of the vote.

493
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,691
And our country that boasts about
believing in self-determination...

494
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,429
used its power and its prestige
and its influence...

495
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:26,466
really to get our first
puppet government under Diem...

496
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,213
not to cooperate
in holding those elections.

497
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,549
That's just a matter
of historic record.

498
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,619
As you know,
when Ngo Dinh Diem and Nhu...

499
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,523
were finally killed in 1963...

500
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,159
some 50,000 to 60,000 —

501
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,962
the precise number
is not readily available —

502
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,955
but some 50,000 to 60,000
political prisoners...

503
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:52,192
were released from prisons
in South Vietnam subsequent to this.

504
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,674
Uh, elements
of the rotating governments...

505
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,411
<i>that followed the death</i>
<i>of Diem and Nhu...</i>

506
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,548
<i>have indicated</i>
<i>that most of those people...</i>

507
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,185
<i>were not Vietcong sympathizers</i>
<i>in any way, shape or form...</i>

508
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,089
<i>which would indicate</i>
<i>that all political...</i>

509
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,559
<i>activity that was antithetical</i>
<i>to Diem and Nhu...</i>

510
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,552
<i>was met either with murder</i>
<i>in the south or imprisonment.</i>

511
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,666
And from 1958...

512
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,169
we see the existence,
confirmed by some American experts...

513
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,438
and some broadcasts from —

514
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:31,042
of a National Front for Liberation
of South Vietnam.

515
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,145
<i>It was, in fact, a consolidation</i>
<i>of all the forces...</i>

516
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,138
<i>who, for years, were struggling</i>
<i>against the Diem regime...</i>

517
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,309
<i>and it was not, as it has been said</i>
<i>too much and too often...</i>

518
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,523
<i>the political arm of Hanoi.</i>

519
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,516
<i>The National Front for Liberation</i>
<i>included the former remnants...</i>

520
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,263
<i>of this political religious sects,</i>
<i>Cao Dai and Hao...</i>

521
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,600
<i>Binh Xuyen too, the former Viet Minh...</i>

522
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,703
<i>and the democratic party,</i>
<i>the radical socialist party...</i>

523
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,696
<i>and various other elements</i>
<i>who are united in the common aim...</i>

524
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,843
<i>to overthrow the regime,</i>
<i>to create the coalition government...</i>

525
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,845
<i>democratic regime in the south...</i>

526
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,838
<i>in order to be able to discuss</i>
<i>with the north the provision of Geneva.</i>

527
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,421
<i>That means the end of</i>
<i>the occupation regime in the south...</i>

528
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,414
<i>and peaceful reunification</i>
<i>between the two parts of Vietnam.</i>

529
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:25,585
Uh, the Front is not what you
would call a puppet of Hanoi.

530
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,733
The two
organizations —

531
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,736
and I do stress
they are two
organizations —

532
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,671
work very closely together.

533
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,274
Many of their aims are parallel aims...

534
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,343
but their ideas do not always coincide...

535
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,336
and, indeed, sometimes their policies
are in conflict.

536
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,651
<i>[Corson]</i>
<i>A land reform was a total failure.</i>

537
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,621
<i>They were sporadic attempts</i>
<i>to try and deal with land...</i>

538
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,890
<i>but they never had</i>
<i>any real support from Diem.</i>

539
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>[Buttinger]</i>
<i>What he did was that he gave...</i>

540
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,753
<i>to the 1,200,000 tenants...</i>

541
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,733
<i>some land.</i>

542
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,336
<i>Actually, didn't give it to them.</i>

543
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,329
<i>He sanctioned the fact</i>
<i>that the Viet Minh had given it to them.</i>

544
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,544
<i>But he made them pay for it now.</i>

545
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,537
<i>The downhill trend of the Diem regime...</i>

546
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,220
is best described...

547
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,890
by the increase of corruption...

548
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,793
by the increase of the influence...

549
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,786
of a near psychopath
like his brother Nhu...

550
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,633
and his wife, Madame Nhu...

551
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,803
both of whom had a drive for power...

552
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,640
which I can only describe
as pathological.

553
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,942
I had, once, dinner with them...

554
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,879
and Nhu told me, "You see...

555
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,282
"we could have an opposition in Vietnam...

556
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,351
"if I led it...

557
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,344
"but since I'm the only
intelligent man in South Vietnam...

558
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,291
"all my mental capacity...

559
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,394
<i>"goes into leading my brother...</i>

560
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,230
<i>"to rule South Vietnam.</i>

561
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,799
<i>I have nothing left</i>
<i>to organize an opposition. "</i>

562
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,402
<i>Now, this kind of conceit is,</i>
<i>of course, pathological.</i>

563
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:15,395
<i>However, this man gained</i>
<i>more and more influence over Diem...</i>

564
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,278
<i>together with his wife.</i>

565
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,271
<i>[Corson] This is the kind of psychology</i>
<i>you had in a turbulent, changing Asia.</i>

566
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,218
<i>This old, sort of mandarin idea</i>
<i>that I am</i>—

567
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,987
<i>I have this almost divine right to rule.</i>

568
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,957
<i>How can you challenge what I say,</i>
<i>because I'm incorruptible?</i>

569
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,826
Staley bought this strategic hamlet
from Nhu.

570
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,764
Nhu brought it out as a new little goodie —
no pun intended —

571
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,667
but came up
with the strategic hamlet...

572
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,660
and this amounted to the same old approach
of forced relocation...

573
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,639
the living behind bars...

574
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,643
the total regimentation of the social
and the fabric of the society.

575
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,780
One of the more significant things
about the strategic hamlet...

576
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,773
is that they were physically
and literally demolished by the Vietcong...

577
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,820
after Diem and Nhu were killed.

578
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,657
Every stick was taken down
and every piece of wire.

579
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,293
The enemy took this off
to make use of it...

580
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,430
and told the people,
"Return to your ancestral homes."

581
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,423
And at that time they began to take
effective control over the countryside.

582
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,373
<i>[Halberstam]</i>
<i>Diem was corrupted on vanity and power...</i>

583
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,042
<i>Nhu on his own ego...</i>

584
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,311
<i>Madame Nhu, certainly, on power.</i>

585
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,781
<i>She was the one who really understood</i>
<i>what they were doing the most.</i>

586
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,385
<i>She was the most realistic one.</i>

587
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,378
<i>She had no illusions about them.</i>
<i>She was a smart, strong, dynamic woman.</i>

588
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,927
<i>No illusions about herself.</i>
<i>And she tended to set policy.</i>

589
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,929
<i>She knew what they wanted.</i>

590
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,765
<i>She didn't worry about</i>
<i>what the Americans were saying</i>—

591
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,800
<i>be nice, or do this nice, popular thing.</i>

592
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,036
<i>The important thing to her</i>
<i>was the survival of the family.</i>

593
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,029
<i>Anybody who got in the way</i>
<i>of the survival of the family was a threat.</i>

594
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,267
In this affair, I do not think
that we should worry too much...

595
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,814
because we have the same faith.

596
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,807
Whatever happens in my country,
we shall not feel it alone.

597
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,289
You, also —You will feel it.

598
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,425
The base of Diem was his army,
which was American-supported...

599
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,594
and American aid coming through...

600
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,596
and the police force...

601
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,589
and, generally, an increasingly
police-state technique.

602
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,960
But there was no dissent. They controlled
the legislature, which was a rubber stamp.

603
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,976
About the question
of a horrible stamp...

604
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,312
I have repeatedly said...

605
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,305
"But what's wrong to have a stamp
the laws we approve?"

606
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,753
A major policy paper issued
by the State Department...

607
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,489
in December of 1961...

608
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,626
stated flatly— and I quote...

609
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,496
"The years 1956 to 1960...

610
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,866
"produced something close
to an economic miracle...

611
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,002
"in South Vietnam.

612
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,939
"It is a report of progress
over a few brief years...

613
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,932
equaled by few young countries."

614
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,046
It has been said by Confucius,
wonderfully well —

615
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,416
He said, "Never have laws too precise...

616
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,409
"because the precision of the law
gives a possibility to get around it.

617
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,980
"Have laws
that are built by governments...

618
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,994
"which are reliable,
which know you...

619
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,030
which are close to you."

620
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,023
And this is how, in the organization
of the Vietnamese society...

621
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,570
the village was so essential.

622
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,563
And I think that this has been
the great mistake of Ngo Dinh Diem —

623
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,144
to replace the leader of the village...

624
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,813
who was the expression
of the country...

625
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,449
the expression, as they say...

626
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,119
of the wind and the water...

627
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,121
of the locality.

628
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,657
He replaced that
by appointed village chiefs.

629
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,650
Now, when the Vietcong
assassinated village chiefs...

630
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,831
they were not at all village chiefs...

631
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,934
but people who were not
belonging there...

632
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,104
and it was a scandal to a village
to have them there.

633
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:11,097
And so when the Vietcong assassinated
so many of those people —

634
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,112
and I am not a man
who likes to hear...

635
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:18,149
that people have been assassinated —

636
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,652
And some of them might have been
very good people.

637
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,422
The majority might have
been acceptable...

638
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,958
if they had been
the expression of the village.

639
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,662
But at the very point
where the Vietnamese nation...

640
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,098
the Vietnamese earth...

641
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,001
arises and speaks
to the government...

642
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,703
through the — not chiefs —

643
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,906
through the representatives
of the village...

644
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,208
the elders of the village...

645
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,201
at that very point
where the life of the country is...

646
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,572
Ngo Dinh Diem put, simply...

647
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,054
a wet blanket of functionaries.

648
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,690
Just at the point where was...

649
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,692
the life of the country...

650
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:05,685
he brought the extinguishing methods...

651
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,723
of a government which was not
a government for the Vietnamese.

652
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,206
<i>[Buttinger]</i>
<i>One of the very significant events...</i>

653
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,542
<i>toward the end of the Diem regime...</i>

654
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:22,513
<i>which indicated</i>
<i>the degree of decay...</i>

655
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,016
<i>particularly in the morale</i>
<i>of the army...</i>

656
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,752
<i>was the Battle of Ap Bac.</i>

657
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,856
<i>It indicated that, militarily...</i>

658
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,091
<i>the Diem regime...</i>

659
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,695
<i>was unable to handle the insurrection...</i>

660
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:41,565
<i>and it brought about</i>
<i>discussions in Washington...</i>

661
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,135
<i>which eventually led to the decision...</i>

662
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,304
<i>to put in our own troops...</i>

663
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:51,297
<i>and not only our equipment.</i>

664
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,869
<i>[John F. Kennedy] The vice-president's</i>
<i>journey represented a great public service.</i>

665
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,039
There are members from both parties
here today to greet him.

666
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,154
There were members of both parties
in his group...

667
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,190
going around the world.

668
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,183
This was an American effort
to indicate our great concern...

669
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:14,287
for the cause of freedom
in insignificant and important countries...

670
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,536
around the world.

671
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,273
We visited in several countries...

672
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,209
<i>where the population...</i>

673
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,202
<i>would add up to more than</i>
<i>three-quarters of a billion people.</i>

674
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,017
<i>We didn't see all of those people,</i>
<i>but we saw a good many of them...</i>

675
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,220
<i>as well as their leaders.</i>

676
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,213
<i>We never heard a hostile voice</i>
<i>and we never shook a hostile hand.</i>

677
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,730
When Vice-PresidentJohnson...

678
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,066
which was also part
of the '61 arrangement —

679
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,236
When he came to Vietnam,
he announced...

680
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,073
a series of things
that the United States was going to do.

681
00:42:56,073 --> 00:43:00,066
And this is when we made
a fundamental change in our policy.

682
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,213
I can remember Bernard Fall in 1962...

683
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,916
<i>interviewing Pham Van Dong,</i>
<i>the prime minister...</i>

684
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,352
<i>of North Vietnam...</i>

685
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,822
<i>and talking about the American aid.</i>

686
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,158
<i>And Pham Van Dong was saying...</i>

687
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:18,151
<i>"Poor Diem. Poor Diem.</i>
<i>He is unpopular.</i>

688
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,365
<i>"And because he is unpopular...</i>

689
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,901
<i>"the Americans must give him aid.</i>

690
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,403
<i>"And because the Americans</i>
<i>give him aid...</i>

691
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,739
<i>"he becomes less popular.</i>

692
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,643
<i>"And because he becomes less popular,</i>
<i>the Americans must give him more aid.</i>

693
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,413
<i>And because they give him more aid,</i>
<i>he becomes even less popular. "</i>

694
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,149
Bernard Fall interrupted and said,
"That sounds like a vicious circle."

695
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,142
Pham Van Dong paused and said,
"No, not a vicious circle.

696
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,823
A downward spiral."

697
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,859
I'm Roger Hillsman.

698
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,929
I was Director of Intelligence and Research
in the State Department...

699
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,931
underJohn F. Kennedy...

700
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,635
and then Assistant Secretary of State
for Far Eastern Affairs...

701
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,628
under Kennedy and, for a while,
under PresidentJohnson.

<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

705
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,369
<i>[Hillsman] The most dramatic</i>
<i>was one day in Saigon...</i>

706
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,472
<i>when a Buddhist parade</i>
<i>started off.'...</i>

707
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,808
<i>with a sort of a hypnotic chant...</i>

708
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,944
<i>the yellow-robed priests...</i>

709
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,780
<i>marching along.</i>

710
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,773
And then there stepped forward
a very frail old man in his 70s...

711
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,955
who turned out to be
this priest Quang Duc.

712
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,158
And he assumed the lotus posture.

713
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,151
<i>Another priest stepped forward</i>
<i>and poured gasoline over him.</i>

714
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:02,388
<i>But I don't think anything really gives</i>
<i>the flavor or the fever of that time...</i>

715
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,304
more than to point out that
when this monk burned himself...

716
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:11,297
Ngo Dinh Diem really believed that American
television networks had staged this.

717
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,746
They had paid the Buddhists
to stage this burning for their own benefit.

718
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,049
I mean, after all,
the Americans were Diem's allies.

719
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,486
And then suddenly, a towering flame.

720
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,889
<i>And the priests and the nuns</i>
<i>in the audience...</i>

721
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,860
<i>moaned and prostrated themselves</i>
<i>towards this burning figure.</i>

722
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,063
<i>And he sat there, unflinching...</i>

723
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>and the smell of gasoline</i>
<i>and ofburning flesh in the air...</i>

724
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,302
<i>for 10 minutes.</i>

725
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,205
<i>The political effects of this</i>
<i>were enormous.</i>

726
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,373
<i>It was so dramatic.</i>

727
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,009
<i>It hit the headlines</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

728
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,146
It had enormous
political consequences...

729
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,316
outside of Vietnam
and inside of Vietnam.

730
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:56,309
Uh, people thought they saw...

731
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,389
the face of Buddha
in the clouds that night.

732
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,826
People have spoken very much about...

733
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,296
the monks who burned themselves.

734
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,066
But those monks
who burned themselves...

735
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,836
burned themselves because
they were incited to do it.

736
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,829
<i>[Halberstam] The American idea, which</i>
<i>was "sink or swim with Ngo Dinh Diem"</i>—

737
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,144
<i>as my colleague Homer Bigart</i>
<i>had coined the phrase</i>—

738
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,480
I think the idea of that was, well,
that he had become an expendable man.

739
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,473
American policy had always been
that he was the only man we had.

740
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,855
Johnson had called him
the Winston Churchill of Southeast Asia...

741
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,159
which is a unique tribute
to Mr. Churchill.

742
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,152
So I think with this, they had changed
the American policy view —

743
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,266
that they were expendable.

744
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,068

<i>the coup did take place...</i>

745
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,172
<i>on that day in November,</i>
<i>and they were murdered.</i>

746
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,608
<i>It had taken place in an atmosphere...</i>

747
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,945
<i>where the Americans, who had,</i>
<i>in a sense created this regime...</i>

748
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,414
<i>who had given it</i>
<i>what little sustenance it had...</i>

749
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,484
<i>whose invention Ngo Dinh Diem</i>
<i>had really always been...</i>

750
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,252
<i>had withdrawn.</i>

751
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,355
<i>Because, after all, the V.C. Were about to</i>
<i>take his cities without even a fight.</i>

752
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,991
<i>The V.C. Were running rampant</i>
<i>over the countryside.</i>

753
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,428
<i>The strategic hamlet program</i>
<i>was really finished. It didn't exist.</i>

754
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,432
<i>And it was not so much</i>
<i>that the Americans had aided the coup...</i>

755
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,534
<i>or created it...</i>

756
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:21,527
<i>but as they had given</i>
<i>all their aid to Diem...</i>

757
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,308
<i>they had moved back</i>
<i>and they had said, "No.</i>

758
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,844
We just support
the anticommunist effort."

759
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,546
It wasn't that they were on the side
of the others, but they made it very clear...

760
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,849
that they would stand aside.

761
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,842
And with that, they spelled
the final end to that regime.

this is the myth —

770
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,100
that a friendly government
has asked us to come in...

771
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,769

<i>Would Kennedy have done</i>
<i>whatJohnson has done?</i>

792
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:31,710
There were two things that he
very, very much wished to avoid.

793
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,126
One was making this an American war.

794
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,830
As he used to say,
"It's their war— the South Vietnamese.

795
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,266
"We can give them aid.
We can even give them advisers.

796
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,469
But they must win it or lose it."

797
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,272
And I think he was fully prepared
to let them lose it...

798
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,475
rather than make it an American war.

799
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:55,479
He felt that if we put Americans
in there, with their white faces...

800
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:59,416
it would drive nationalism
into the arms of communism.

801
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,409
The second thing he wished to avoid was
internationalizing the war, as we called it.

802
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,823
By this we meant bombing the north
or attacking the north.

803
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,493
First and foremost
because it would not work.

804
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:13,486
And here 30-some odd months of bombing
has shown that his judgment was right.

805
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,591
I think that, uh, there's
great danger in this country, uh...

806
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,173
because of the fact that
so much of our economy...

807
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,476
is geared, uh, in the military area.

808
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,246
There is grave danger of, uh...

809
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,239
a military-industrial alliance
of a kind...

810
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,187
uh...

811
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,856
actually affecting policy.

812
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,849
Now, uh, Vietnam is a case in point.

813
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,331
Uh, not the only place, because
we're spending $50 billion a year...

having dropped more bombs on Vietnam...

818
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,835

in World War II, in tonnage...

and that we would step out
and close the port of Haiphong...

835
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,373
and hit every military,
renumerative target over there.

836
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,366
I think you're, uh, a better chance to bring
the communists to the conference table...

837
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,446
than if we do not hurt them.

838
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,750
However, American instinct makes us
want to jump in with both feet...

839
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,553
and get an unpleasant job over with
as soon as possible.

840
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,790
But traditional Oriental patience...

841
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,960
makes them willing
to carry on the struggle...

842
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,953
into generation after generation,
if necessary.

843
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,903
We're fighting a war over there...

844
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,905
with a commodity...

845
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,007
most precious to us...

846
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,377
and held far more cheaply
by the enemy—

847
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,379
the lives of men.

848
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:20,372
I don't think it's necessary to have
an invasion of North Vietnam.

849
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,520
It would be just exactly
what the enemy wants.

850
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,513
He'd like us to put down 100,000 men
in the field, and they'd put down 100,000.

851
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,461
They're willing to lose half of theirs,
and ours is a precious commodity.

852
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,065
I wouldn't trade one dead American
for 50 dead Chinamen.

853
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:39,058
We must fight the war from <i>our</i> strength,
not the enemy's.

854
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,006
We must fight it
at least cost to ourselves...

855
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,076
and at greatest cost to the enemy.

856
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,069
We must change the currency of this game
from men to material.

857
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,482
What's that?

858
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,485
What is the greatest single problem
we're facing in Vietnam?

859
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,487
Well, it's the despicable
communist enemy.

860
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,489
No question about it.

861
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,492
And the sooner we smash him,
as we should have done in Korea —

862
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,995
If we'd done it in Korea,
in our first test of arms with communism...

863
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:09,933
we wouldn't be confronted, I don't think,
with the situation we have in Vietnam.

864
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,370
Do you have respect for the Vietcong?
Do you think they're a good soldier?

865
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,363
Well, there's no question about it.
They're willing to die readily, as all Orientals are.

866
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:21,600
And their leaders will sacrifice them,
and we won't sacrifice ours.

867
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,981
The only solution I see...

868
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,084
is to use our strength —
our air and naval power—

869
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,088
in the most humane possible m —
manner— manner possible...

870
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:36,081
to destroy North Vietnamese
capability to wage war...

871
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,829
against the free people
of South Vietnam.

872
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,633
So I think the sooner that we hit
everything we can and hurt 'em over there...

873
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,069
we got a better chance
to win that war...

874
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,605
and that's exactly what we should do,
in my opinion.

875
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:52,598
So, the harbor at Haiphong...

876
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:56,746
and the entire capacity
to receive outside help — close it.

877
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,739
<i>[Applause]</i>

878
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,988
<i>[Applause Subsides]</i>

879
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,981
The power system that fuels
every war-making facility...

880
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,185
the transportation system —
rails, rolling stock, bridges, yards —

881
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,665
eliminate 'em.

882
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:19,102
<i>[Applause Resumes, Subsides]</i>

883
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,172
Every factory
and every industrial installation...

884
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,641
beginning with
the biggest and the best...

885
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:28,077
and never ending, so long as there are
two bricks still stuck together.

886
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:32,070
<i>- [Man] Yeah.!</i>
<i>- [Applause Resumes]</i>

887
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,219
<i>[Applause Subsides]</i>

888
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:40,212
And, if necessary, the irrigation system,
on which food production largely depends.

889
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,793
We must be willing
to continue our bombing...

890
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,796
until we've destroyed every work of man
in North Vietnam...

891
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,599
if this is what it takes
to win the war.

892
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,169
Then there was
a little crisis there.

893
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,172
The military thought that
there was a great infiltration.

894
00:57:56,172 --> 00:58:00,165
Secretary McNamara went out, came back
and said, "No, there wasn't a crisis at that time."

895
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,179
But I thought
it was very significant...

896
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,282
that PresidentJohnson
then appointed a committee...

897
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,953
to prepare a list of targets in the north...

898
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:13,289
in case he should decide
to bomb the north.

899
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,292
The more I thought about this,
the more I became convinced...

900
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:20,296
that if there were a crisis,
he would escalate the war.

901
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,999
This is part of
the steady escalation...

902
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,903
that's taken place
during the last five years.

903
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,639
First we sent in only advisers.

904
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,543
Then it developed these advisers
were also in combat.

905
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,545
Then we sent in the marines...

906
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,548
and the first thing was said was
they were only there to defend.

907
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,018
The next thing was that
they were to shoot back if attacked.

908
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:46,011
And now there is an admission
that we're all in.

909
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,816
Some others are eager
to enlarge the conflict.

910
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,866
They call upon us
to supply American boys...

911
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,603
to do the job
that Asian boys should do.

912
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,673
They ask us to take
reckless action...

913
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,009
which might risk
the lives of millions...

914
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,978
and engulf much of Asia...

915
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,971
and certainly threaten the peace
of the entire world.

916
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,552
A second deliberate attack...

917
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,321
was made
during darkness...

918
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,557
by an
undetermined number...

919
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,893
of North Vietnamese P.T. Boats...

920
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,886
on the U.S. S<i>. Maddox</i>
and the U.S. S<i>. C. TurnerJoy...</i>

921
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,169
while the two destroyers
were cruising in company...

922
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,039
on routine patrol duty...

923
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,041
in the Tonkin Gulf...

924
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,143
in international waters...

925
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,780
some 65 miles
from the nearest point of land.

926
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,183
They put out that propaganda,
but they got caught...

927
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,353
because we were able to disclose
within two days...

928
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:54,346
that if they would check upon the log
of the <i>Maddox,</i> for example...

929
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:59,952
they would find she
was only 11 to 13 miles...

930
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,332
from the bombing of those islands.

931
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,334
And, of course, that's coverage.

932
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,804
And the North Vietnamese
knew that it was coverage.

933
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,808
<i>[Reporter] Do our naval vessels</i>
<i>afford any cover for these</i>—

934
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,810
<i>those operations?</i>

935
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,012
Our naval vessels
afford no cover whatsoever.

936
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,015
Now, the sad fact is,
history will record...

937
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,008
that the United States
was an aggressor in Tonkin Bay.

938
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,688
We were violating the rights
of North Vietna —

939
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,992
They had no right to proceed
on the second day...

940
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,661
to, ourselves, bomb...

941
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,663
uh, North Vietnam —

942
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,656
the areas where
her torpedo boats were kept.

943
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,903
But we had a duty—
That wasn't self-defense.

944
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,674
Bombing North Vietnam was not
within the right of the president...

945
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,176
to act in self-defense
of the republic.

946
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,180
My duties on board
the seaplane tender were...

947
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,784
nuclear weapons officer.

948
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,786
On August 4...

949
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,223
there was an alleged attack
upon the U.S. S<i>. Maddox...</i>

950
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,225
<i>and</i> TurnerJoy...

951
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,227
<i>two of our destroyers...</i>

952
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,195
<i>in the Gulf of Tonkin.</i>

953
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:10,188
Destroyer personnel indicated at first
that they were under attack...

954
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,360
and later indicated uncertainty
as to whether or not they were under attack.

955
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,410
Large numbers of torpedoes...

956
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,746
were supposed to have been fired.

957
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,883
The ship was, uh...

958
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,876
reporting itself as continuously maneuvering
to avoid torpedo attack...

959
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,892
and yet there was also indicated
in these messages...

960
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,895
doubt as to whether or not
they were under attack at all.

961
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:42,131
And I have a feeling, therefore,
that this harassment attack...

962
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:46,124
and this attack with 20 or more torpedoes
upon two of our destroyers...

963
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,907
was designed to force us out,
in a way...

964
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,042
lest we precipitate
a greater struggle.

965
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,379
I have a feeling that they've
misread America once again.

966
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,382
In the course of our conversation...

967
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,386
this chief petty officer told me
that he was a sonar man...

968
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,488
on board the U.S. S<i>. Maddox...</i>

969
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,491
and that he had been in sonar—
the sonar room —

970
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,860
during the attack.

971
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,864
He told me that,
in his estimation...

972
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,857
there were no torpedoes
fired at the ship or otherwise...

973
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,237
during that alleged attack...

974
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:25,230
and furthermore,
he constantly repeated this —

975
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,534
uh, sent this information
to the commanding officer on the bridge.

976
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,215
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>The North Vietnamese...</i>

977
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,217
<i>have no submarines.</i>

978
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,219
<i>What is the purpose</i>
<i>of that movement?</i>

979
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,221
This is purely precautionary...

980
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,224
so that the fleet will be prepared
for all eventualities.

981
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,226
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>What sort of eventualities, General?</i>

982
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,495
- Well, possible submarine attack.
<i>- By whom?</i>

983
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,497
By anyone.

984
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:51,200
<i>[Reporter] Well, you always contended</i>
<i>that in the first incident they were having</i>—

985
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,193
I am contending that having
the <i>Maddox</i> and the <i>Joy</i> there...

986
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,907
constituted...

987
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:01,544
in view of the knowledge as to what
the South Vietnamese boats were up to...

988
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,147
an act of constructive aggression
on our part.

989
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,316
The Vietnamese situation...

990
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:11,309
as I noted on my visit back home
last week and this week...

991
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:17,415
has taken on some real spirit
and real interest.

992
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,920
I thought perhaps a statement by
the joint senate-house Republican leadership...

993
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,793
would be timely and quite in order
at this moment.

994
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,207
As a result of what we have done
in South Vietnam...

995
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:35,200
not only has
the psychology changed there...

996
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,314
but also it has had
a most beneficial effect...

997
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,316
in my opinion...

998
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,619
among other free Asian countries...

999
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,612
who looked at South Vietnam
as a test.

1000
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,993
Okay, today—

1001
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,995
<i>today's the day.</i>

1002
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,399
<i>It's the big one.</i>
<i>This is the one we've been waiting for.</i>

1003
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,168
<i>This is the one you've all been</i>
<i>saying to yourselves...</i>

1004
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,338
<i>"What this company needs</i>
<i>is a good fight. "</i>

1005
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,331
<i>By the grace of God, we're gonna get it.</i>

1006
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,602
<i>From there we're gonna "S"and "D"</i>—
<i>search and destroy, the thing you guys like.</i>

1007
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,451
<i>Okay.</i>

1008
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,421
<i>Some of you, I know this is</i>
<i>gonna be a shock to you...</i>

1009
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,423
<i>but it's a switch</i>
<i>for ol'Alpha Troop</i>—

1010
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,416
<i>we're ridin'in, and we're not ridin'in</i>
<i>on one of those dusty ol'A.P.C. 's.</i>

[Soldiers Laughing]

1013
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:35,538
Well, search and destroy
is an attempt to...

1014
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,974
<i>as the first word would indicate...</i>

1015
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,109
<i>to find the enemy...</i>

1016
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,912
<i>to search out where he would be...</i>

1017
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,648
<i>and then to destroy him</i>
<i>in his habitat.</i>

<i>[Officer]</i>
<i>Okay.!</i>

1020
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,879
West of the stream
and east of the road. Roger.

1021
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:36,332
<i>How much rice do you think</i>
<i>is actually in there?</i>

1022
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:40,169
Oh, geez, I don't know.
About...

1023
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,305
20 tons, 10 tons.

1024
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,307
How far back does it go?

1025
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:48,177
<i>It's about 30 by 15.</i>

1026
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,280
<i>Anyways, about 12 feet deep.</i>

1027
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,416
- Come on.
<i>- [Explosion In Distance]</i>

1028
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,152
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How do you destroy this much rice?</i>

1029
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,554
<i>[Soldier]</i>
<i>The demo man usually blows it up.</i>

1030
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,325
<i>- [Reporter] You gonna blow it up?</i>
<i>- If they can't get it out, they'll blow it up.</i>

1031
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:06,318
<i>It's, uh, unmilled rice.</i>

1032
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,461
Oh, look at that.

1033
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:26,571
<i>[Reporter] Here's all the detachment consists of</i>—
<i>two double-rotored Chinook helicopters.</i>

1034
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,518
<i>The Chinook usually are</i>
<i>cargo or troop carriers.</i>

1035
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:33,511
<i>But not these</i>—
<i>they're gunships.</i>

1036
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,320
The prisoners that we've captured are —
that have been captured...

1037
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:47,436
say that this is the most feared weapon
outside the B-52s.

1038
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:51,440
That is because of the amount
of ammunition we carry...

1039
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,433
the various types of weapons
in the amount of time we can stay on station.

1040
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,282
<i>At the present time</i>
<i>we have on this...</i>

1041
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,652
<i>a 140-millimeter grenade launcher,</i>
<i>two 20-millimeter cannons...</i>

1042
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,654
<i>five 50-caliber machine guns...</i>

1043
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,647
<i>and two rocket launcher pods</i>
<i>consisting of 192.75 rockets.</i>

1044
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:15,220
<i>Uh, we usually carry inside</i>
<i>two additional M60 machine guns...</i>

1045
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,401
and ammunition for them.

1046
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,394
Occasionally, the crew rat-holes a few things
they don't tell us about until they're airborne.

1047
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:26,409
<i>If we work at it,</i>
<i>we can unload in about 20-25 minutes.</i>

1048
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,246
<i>But we are in danger ofburning out</i>
<i>barrels, which we frequently do.</i>

1049
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,681
<i>I was amazed,</i>
<i>when I came to this outfit...</i>

1050
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,683
<i>how accurate the 50-calibers were.</i>

1051
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,387
<i>I figured they would be</i>
<i>no more than aerial spray weapons.</i>

1052
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,390
<i>But they can actually walk those weapons</i>
<i>right down a tree line.</i>

1053
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,627
<i>Now, the 20-millimeter is, of course,</i>
<i>very, very accurate and has quite a range.</i>

1054
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:48,620
<i>We can start firing this machine 4,000 meters</i>
<i>away, which is a considerable distance.</i>

1055
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,193
<i>The one I fly</i>
<i>is known as "Birth Control."</i>

1056
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,573
You look like
you enjoy your work. Why?

1057
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,566
Well, I been doin' it for 36 months
since I been in the service.

1058
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,380
<i>It's the type of work I enjoy</i>—
<i>outside, moving around.</i>

1059
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,251
<i>But this particular operation,</i>
<i>the cedar falls, why are you enjoying this?</i>

1060
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:45,254
<i>Well, I think were benefiting</i>
<i>by clearing all this area.</i>

1061
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:49,247
<i>This is the first time we've got a push on</i>
<i>like this and haven't walked off and left it.</i>

1062
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,294
<i>They're completely going right ahead</i>
<i>and pushing on forward...</i>

1063
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,287
<i>instead of walking off.</i>

1064
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:13,671
<i>- Where did you find these people?</i>
<i>- They live in the village of Dong Lien...</i>

1065
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,218
<i>between here</i>
<i>and the railroad to the west.</i>

1066
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,753
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>Why'd you bring 'em in here?</i>

1067
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,746
<i>[Soldier] We've had so much trouble</i>
<i>when we've moved through this area.</i>
<i>Been a lot of civilians killed as a result of this.</i>

1068
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,927
<i>As we made our pass through here</i>
<i>we picked these people up...</i>

1069
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:28,430
<i>and moved 'em with us into here</i>
<i>so that we could make a careful sweep...</i>

1070
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,423
<i>and probe each and every hut, looking for</i>
<i>tunnels and caves, possible V.C. Hiding places.</i>

1071
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,937
<i>We found a few caves...</i>

1072
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:38,574
and blew 'em, picked up some weapons,
killed a few V.C.

1073
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:42,578
We're now gonna sweep back through,
go to the railroad and move back to the west.

1074
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,681
- What's gonna happen to the people tonight?
<i>- Well, we're gonna keep 'em right here.</i>

1075
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,651
<i>We've got some chow for 'em, some water.</i>
<i>We'll feed 'em.</i>

1076
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:52,644
<i>You'd be surprised how they can take care</i>
<i>of themselves with a minimum of resources.</i>

1077
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,358
<i>They take care of these children here</i>
<i>during the night.</i>

1078
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,261
They'll huddle real close together.
They'll keep warm.

<i>[Soldier] Well, around noon tomorrow,</i>
<i>as we move back out to the west...</i>

<i>to go back to their own huts...</i>

<i>to cultivate their rice,</i>
<i>harvest their rice...</i>

1084

<i>to be further interrogated.</i>

<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How did you select them?</i>

1090
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,293
<i>These</i> chieu hoi <i>people</i>—
<i>Vietnamese interpreters we have with us</i>—

1091
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:34,730
<i>they've been in this area two or three years,</i>
<i>they know these people...</i>

1092
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,723
<i>and from talking to 'em they get ideas that maybe</i>
<i>these people know more than they're telling us.</i>

1093
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,972
<i>We take 'em back to get</i>
<i>a little higher echelon of interrogation...</i>

1094

<i>down at Hoi Yen or Dinh Banh.</i>

1095
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,277
<i>Some of these people</i>
<i>come back to us, even...</i>

1096
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,380
<i>and we'll put 'em with our companies</i>
<i>to sweep these riverbanks.</i>

1097
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,984
<i>It's hard to knowjust who a V.C. Is</i>
<i>unless he's carrying a weapon...</i>

1098
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,986
<i>or a cartridge belt</i>
<i>or some grenades or somethin'!</i>

<i>ifhe's a V.C. Or not. Might be in this crowd.</i>

1100

<i>But then, some of these people</i>
<i>that have operated with the V. C...</i>

1101
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,819
<i>and if they defect and come over,</i>
<i>we can use these people as scouts.</i>

1102
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,033
<i>They go along riverbanks with us,</i>
<i>and they look just like anybody else.</i>

1103
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:15,026
<i>But when they have a weapon,</i>
<i>then they're free game.</i>

1104
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,309
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How did this man get killed?</i>

1105
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,311
<i>[Soldier]</i>
<i>He threw grenades at the marines.</i>

1106
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,314
<i>Instead ofjust one, he threw three,</i>
<i>and a marine spotted him...</i>

1107
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,316
<i>and started shooting at him...</i>

1108
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,318
<i>and that's how he got it.</i>

1109
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:33,311
<i>Those two big holes by his eye and throat</i>
<i>were done by 30.06 sniper rifles.</i>

1110
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:37,382
<i>All the rest of the holes are done</i>
<i>by this new type of rifle we got, the M16.</i>

1111
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:41,497
<i>[Reporter] How about all these people</i>
<i>who are standing behind me over there?</i>

1112
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,500
<i>- Do you think any of them know this man?</i>
<i>- Yes, they do.</i>

1113
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,502
<i>But they wouldn't admit it...</i>

1114
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,372
<i>because they're afraid that we will</i>
<i>take them back to C.P. For questioning...</i>

1115
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,741
<i>and detain them...</i>

1116
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,743
under this R.V.N. Program...

1117
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,746
where they teach them propaganda for
three months — they hold 'em for three months.

1118
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,416
That's why they won't admit
they know this man here.

1119
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:04,409
We've put over three million of them
into what I would call a concentration camp.

1120
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,723
They call it a refugee center.

1121
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,326
It's got barbed wire around it.
They can't get out of it.

1122
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,329
We've taken these people
from the graves of their ancestors...

1123
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,331
from their rice paddies...

1124
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,734
and we say, "Oh, well,
we've pacified X-million people."

1125
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,438
Yeah, we've pacified some more people
by putting them in these camps.

1126
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,440
I'll wind this up in a hurry.

1127
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,743
I know many people have said
we've killed innocent people.

1128
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,747
Our bombs have killed civilians
and babies and mothers...

1129
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,583
and I suppose
there is truth to that.

1130
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:38,153
There have been people
that have been killed.

1131
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,657
But your government
has not bombed civilians.

1132
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,727
Your government
has not bombed open cities.

1133
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,720
Your government has sent its bombers in
after targets — military targets...

1134
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,924
that have been placed in an area
surrounded by civilians.

1135
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,540
Try a sweep-around?

1136
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,844
<i>[Corson] The unfortunate thing is,</i>
<i>the enemy is quite frequently located...</i>

1137
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,837
<i>in areas that have people who are</i>
<i>not part of the military structure...</i>

1138
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,684
<i>in an immediate sense.</i>

1139
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:12,677
<i>They may be sympathizers. They may be</i>
<i>supporting through their efforts, their work.</i>

1140
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>But what occurs when you engage</i>
<i>in a search and destroy...</i>

1141
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,695
<i>is the destruction</i>—
<i>the needless destruction</i>—

1142
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,631
<i>of innocent human</i>—
<i>innocent civilians.</i>

1143
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:26,624
<i>Now, you might say that they're all part</i>
<i>of the entire communist apparatus.</i>

1144
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:31,673
<i>But the feature is that if we are going to</i>
<i>prevent this war from degenerating...</i>

1145
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,675
<i>into a genocidal activity...</i>

1146
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,211
<i>then our attempt</i>
<i>would be to rehabilitate...</i>

1147

or to wean those folks away from
the communists, rather than to destroy them.

They are the subject
of our constant concern...

1151
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,743
because
they're such
a magnificent...

01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,745
group of

1153
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,747
Their morale is extremely high.

1154
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,749
They always have a smile.

1155
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,742
I was at a very
kind of sobering thing last night —

1156
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:21,757
a memorial service for four men
in the 2nd Squadron...

1157
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,750
who were killed the other day,
one of them being a medic.

1158
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,564
And the place was just packed.

1159
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,700
We sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.

1160
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,703
I turned around and looked at their faces...

1161
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,539
and they were —
I was just proud.

1162
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:41,532
My feeling for America just soared
because of their—

1163
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,546
the way they looked.

1164
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:48,539
They looked determined
and, and reverent at the same time.

1165
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,743
But still, they're a bloody good
bunch of killers.

1174
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,743
<i>The prisoners were, uh,</i>
<i>executed in our outfit...</i>

1175
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,258
as a standard policy.

1176
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,727
We were told by our C. O<i>...</i>

1177
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,729
after our first battle...

1178
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,798
that from then on we weren't
gonna take any prisoners.

1179
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,800
My name is John Toller.

1180
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,793
I'm a sergeant in the U.S. Army Special Forces,
known as the Green Berets.

1181
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,073
I'm en route to Vietnam.

1182
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,075
However, I'm deserting the army...

1183
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:51,068
because I'm protesting the U.S. Involvement
in the Vietnamese conflict.

1184
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,974
Today your soldiers, sailors,
airmen, marines and coast guardsmen...

1185
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,690
are better educated than before...

1186
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,726
are better informed...

1187
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:08,719
have traditional American
ingenuity and initiative...

1188
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,100
are better physical specimens...

1189
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,102
have high morale...

1190
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:17,105
and understand
what the war is all about.

1191
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,107
As I mentioned before...

1192
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:23,078
about changing the minds
of the apathetic populace...

1193
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,581
the key is the communication...

1194
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,574
and most of the American soldiers I know
can't communicate.

1195
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:33,388
They don't really understand
the Vietnamese way of life...

1196
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:36,358
and its goal.

1197
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,351
And the only way they can communicate
is through money or with a gun.

1198
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:45,000
So after a while
they develop this kind of fear.

1199
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,836
And so, a misunderstanding
and a noncommunication —

1200
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:50,706
They mistrust the Vietnamese...

1201
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,941
and they kind of despise them.

1202
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,944
Once we got to Vietnam,
it was an entirely different story.

1203
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,937
The officers started referring
to the Vietnamese as "gooks."

1204
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:04,075
<i>They even went so far as to say that</i>
<i>the only good gook is a dead gook.</i>

1205
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,880
<i>They said, "You can't trust 'em</i>—
<i>You can't trust any of these slant-eyed bastards...</i>

1206
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:14,819

No, sir, I don't think so.

01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,779
But you have said, have you not,
that the Vietnamese press...

1229
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,782
should not criticize
the candidates in the election?

1230
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,184
Why is that, sir?

<i>[Werfel]</i>
<i>And so, PresidentJohnson...</i>

1264

being true to the origin

1265
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,101
was very much concerned...

1266

about how the American people
would interpret these elections...

1267
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:54,398
and he saw that
it was necessary to appoint...

1268
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:58,936
an official observer team.

1269
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:03,140
<i>But, of course, most of the people</i>
<i>had never been in Asia before.</i>

1270
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:07,022
<i>Almost none of them</i>
<i>had ever been in Vietnam before.</i>

1271
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,659
<i>Very few of them even had</i>
<i>any contacts in Vietnam.</i>

1272
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,652
<i>So the theoretical opportunity</i>
<i>to talk to anybody they wanted to...</i>

1273
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,599
<i>simply could not be utilized.</i>

1274
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,592
<i>In fact, most of those who talked</i>
<i>to anyone except embassy people...</i>

1275
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,572
<i>talked to those Vietnamese...</i>

1276

<i>introduced to them...</i>

1277

<i>by embassy people.</i>

<i>Voting officials, voters,</i>
<i>everybody were on their good behavior...</i>

1279
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,955
<i>because the American observers</i>
<i>were there.</i>

1280
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,324
<i>So, for them to have expected...</i>

1281
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:45,193
<i>that they would see fraud</i>
<i>with their own eyes...</i>

1282
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,196
<i>was, uh, simply absurd.</i>

1283
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:51,733
<i>Furthermore, they left Vietnam...</i>

1284
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,170
<i>within 24 hours</i>
<i>after the polls closed...</i>

1285
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,306
<i>and in that period</i>
<i>after the polls closed...</i>

1286
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:02,299
<i>they did not speak</i>
<i>to a single Vietnamese.</i>

1287
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:06,737
<i>The possession of a clipped</i>
<i>and stamped voting card, of course...</i>

1288
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,709
<i>was a very important protection</i>
<i>for the Vietnamese peasant.</i>

1289
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:16,046
<i>It was almost as important as</i>
<i>having his registration card.</i>

<i>And anyone in Vietnam...</i>

1291

<i>who does not have an official</i>
<i>government registration or identity card...</i>

1292

<i>for questioning, or worse.</i>

1295
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:36,734

in working-class districts...

1296
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:41,416

already lined up...

that they had run out of ballots...

1301
01:23:56,231 --> 01:24:00,224
the poor washer women

1302
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:04,728
"We've got to vote! We've got to vote!
We've got to have our clipped voting card!"

1303
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:09,411
<i>So, uh, in balance...</i>

1304
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:13,248
<i>we had a government elected...</i>

1305

<i>with little more</i>
<i>than a third of the vote...</i>

1306

1308
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:26,750
as being a popular
and legitimate government...

1309
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,799
nearly two-thirds of the people
voting against it...

1310
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:34,792

being to a considerable extent...

01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:39,329
a result of fraud
and, uh, intimidation.

1318
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:34,129
<i>[Werfel] It was bad enough</i>
<i>for the generals to get away...</i>

1319
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,798
<i>with double-voting</i>
<i>and ballot box stuffing...</i>

1320
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,791
<i>but to have the American observers say</i>
<i>that they thought it was all fine and dandy...</i>

1321
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:46,207
<i>made the Vietnamese</i>
<i>very mad indeed.</i>

1322
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:49,544
<i>There were efforts</i>
<i>to protest election fraud.</i>

1323
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,546
<i>There were student demonstrations.</i>

1324
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:55,250
<i>And as a matter of fact, at one point</i>
<i>it almost looked as if the election...</i>

1325
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,243
<i>would be invalidated.</i>

1326
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:04,515
What I think we've come to,
and what I think the tragedy of Vietnam...

1327
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,661
clearly
demonstrates...

1328
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,430
is that we now
find ourselves...

1329
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,901
in a world in which
the arrangements of power...

1330
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,637
cannot yet be ignored...

1331
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,439
but in which
the instruments of power...

1332
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,608
no longer work.

1333
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:24,612
If this lesson has been taught us
in Vietnam...

1334
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:28,605
then the stubborn little guerrillas
out there...

1335
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:32,709
who sawed off the American giant
at the knees and brought him down...

1336
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,524
almost like David versus Goliath...

1337
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,294
will have done a great service
not only to their own cause...

1338
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,296
whatever one may think about it...

1339
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,731
but perhaps to the cause
of world peace...

1340
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:47,724
and perhaps most particularly
to the colossus himself.

1341
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:52,006
Maybe we needed
to be brought up short.

1342
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,877
Maybe what we've been doing
in Vietnam all along...

1343
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,647
is an exercise in what
Senator Fulbright has called...

1344
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:03,351
the arrogance of power.

1345
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,821
We cannot retreat...

1346
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,357
from anyplace...

1347
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,694
and I can tell you
that we don't intend to retreat.

1348
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,829
We were asked
by the State Department...

1349
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:18,499
to prepare a letter
and send it to Ho Chi Minh...

1350
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,836
through a channel which had been opened
and was available to us.

1351
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:25,006
We were certain would deliver
the letter directly to him.

1352
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:28,999
It was a very conciliatory letter
written in the State Department...

1353
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,981
in consultation, word by word,
with Secretary Bundy...

1354
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,850
Secretary Katzenbach and others...

1355
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,286
in which we spoke on behalf—

1356
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,655
this was the actual phraseology—

1357
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:43,524
"on behalf of" high officials
of the State Department.

1358
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,593
All of Asia — free Asia —

1359
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,595
as well as communist Asia...

1360
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,597
is watching Vietnam.

1361
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:53,001
And if, for example,
out of this present struggle...

1362
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,703
after making this great commitment...

1363
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,706
after turning around
the psychology in Asia...

1364
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:01,809
we then agree to a coalition government
with the communists...

1365
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:05,680
or we force the South Vietnamese
into a neutralized position...

1366
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,749
and neutralize as we did Laos...

1367
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,884
or if we make...

1368
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,877
any kind of territorial concessions
to the Vietcong...

1369
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,858
either one of these three
courses of action...

1370
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:19,794
would be interpreted as a retreat...

1371
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,787
and also a defeat, not only for South Vietnam
but for the United States.

1372
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:27,991
We had an extended interview —
almost two hours —with Ho Chi Minh.

1373
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:31,105
It was perfectly clear,
in the course of that interview...

1374
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:35,098
that Ho Chi Minh was delivering to us
certain information he expected us to deliver...

1375
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,445
back to the State Department.

1376
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,747
And on the side of Ho Chi Minh...

1377
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:43,740
understand that, first of all,
he will bring to the negotiation...

1378
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:48,545
the prestige of an unparalleled life
of devotion to his country.

1379
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,393
In the history of this century...

1380
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,396
he will be <i>the</i> great patriot.

1381
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:57,598
And be careful here.

1382
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:00,601
Don't forget that he is a Marxist.

1383
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:04,594
And don't expect him to turn a traitor
to the ideal of his life.

1384
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:09,777
He was unyielding on the point
that the bombing had to halt...

1385
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,770
before his negotiators would enter into
any kind of substantive discussions.

1386
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:17,885
But I think he was trying to make the point,
and making it repeatedly...

1387
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:21,389
that after that the agenda was open.

1388
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:25,382
There may be those who say, well,
obviously you haven't offered them enough.

1389
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,766
Well, it's true that we haven't
offered them South Vietnam.

1390
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:35,470
And it is true that we have not
agreed to assure them...

1391
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,463
that we will stop the bombing
on a permanent and unconditional basis.

1392
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:42,777
We discovered sometime later...

1393
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:46,447
when the correspondence
was made public by Hanoi...

1394
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,440
that four days
before our letter could arrive in Hanoi...

1395
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:55,879
a letter arrived there,
sent over PresidentJohnson's signature...

1396
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:59,127
which was
a very hard line letter indeed...

1397
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:03,120
which restated all the previous conditions
regarding cessation of the bombing...

1398
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,400
and even added some new ones...

1399
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,035
and which was, in our judgment...

1400
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,037
intended to do what it did do...

1401
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:14,030
which was to break off any possibility
of negotiation at that time.

1402
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:17,478
This letter,
we subsequently learned...

1403
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:21,471
had been written
two days before ours was written...

1404
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:24,018
in conjunction with
the State Department.

1405
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:27,989
We found, to our surprise
and shock, I might say...

1406
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,982
that Harriman was already saying that
he proposed to negotiate the settlement...

1407
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,553
by suggesting that there had to be
some reciprocal military action...

1408
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,901
in return for the final
cessation of the bombing.

1409
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:43,604
In other words, the same point
thatJohnson had been standing on...

1410
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:47,608
<i>before</i> he made the speech
of March 31.

1411
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,912
It was almost as though Harriman
turned off his hearing aid...

1412
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:53,047
when we told him this would not work...

1413
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,050
this was not the understanding
the North Vietnamese had...

1414
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,052
and they would certainly repudiate it...

1415
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:01,189
if he attempted to take that position
at the bargaining table.

1416
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,926
And this, of course,
is what did happen at Paris.

1417
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:08,919
In the view of the North Vietnamese...

1418
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:15,091
the reciprocity means...

1419
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,872
United States
is bombing North Vietnam...

1420
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:21,142
and North Vietnam
must bomb United States.

1421
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,578
This, in their view, is reciprocity.

1422
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:27,571
Since North Vietnam
is <i>not</i> bombing the United States...

1423
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,118
the United States
should not bomb North Vietnam.

1424
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,111
The general impression
that I came away with —

1425
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,083
and I think here I would speak
for my colleague Bill Baggs —

1426
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:44,721
was that we were dealing
with the State Department...

1427
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,837
on a basis of what we have
come to call Fulbright's Law —

1428
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,006
"Never Trust the State Department."

1429
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,710
Bombing is going on in the south.

1430
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,945
We haven't bombed
anybody's embassy in Hanoi...

1431
01:31:57,945 --> 01:32:01,938
but they've bombed
our embassy in Saigon.

1432
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,153
Arms continue to flow.
Men continue to come.

1433
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:10,146
We've tried all over the Earth
to find an answer to the question...

1434
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:14,595
what else would stop
if the bombing stopped?

1435
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:18,588
The niceties of the argument about
whether there are two Vietnams...

1436
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,868
or one Vietnam...

1437
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,805
seem quite inconsequential
when you're talking to Ho Chi Minh.

1438
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:27,008
It would seem incredible...

1439
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:31,001
that this man does not speak
for most of the Vietnamese —

1440
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,714
not all, but most —

1441
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:37,351
and the idea that there could be
some arbitrary geographic dividing line...

1442
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,787
that would cut off his influence...

1443
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:41,956
has been proved an absurdity...

1444
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:44,659
by the figure and determination...

1445
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:47,028
of the National Liberation Front...

1446
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:50,731
that fights in his name in the south.

1447
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,733
My name is Ilya Todd.

1448
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:56,737
I'm a journalist on the non-communist,
liberal, left-wing French paper...

1449
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,839
Le nouvel observateur.

1450
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:02,832
I first went to South Vietnam
when escalations started in 1965...

1451
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:06,881
and I first went to North Vietnam
at the end of 1967.

1452
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:10,284
Uh, I'm Harrison Salisbury
of the <i>New York Times.</i>

1453
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,987
Uh, assistant managing editor
of the <i>Times.</i>

1454
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:15,590
I'm, uh, Father Daniel Berrigan.

1455
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,125
I'm working here at Cornell teaching...

1456
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,828
and helping with the peace movement.

1457
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:23,397
It's about one month
since I was in North Vietnam...

1458
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:26,901
on a project to get
the three American flyers out.

1459
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:30,371
At the time I went to North Vietnam...

1460
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:34,364
the communiques which were being issued,
by Washington in particular...

1461
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:38,179
<i>about the American bombing raids</i>
<i>on the north...</i>

1462
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:41,616
<i>gave the impression, although</i>
<i>they did not say so specifically...</i>

1463
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,285
<i>that we were not killing civilians...</i>

1464
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:47,188
<i>in any substantial numbers,</i>
<i>at least...</i>

1465
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,224
<i>in the course of our</i>
<i>very heavy bombing offensive.</i>

1466
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:53,094
<i>Indeed, PresidentJohnson himself</i>
<i>said that the targets...</i>

1467
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:55,696
<i>were, uh, steel and concrete.</i>

1468
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:59,066
<i>I think almost anyone</i>
<i>familiar with war...</i>

1469
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:02,169
<i>would have been somewhat skeptical</i>
<i>of the ability to bomb with such precision.</i>

1470
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:05,840
<i>And indeed, when I got on the spot</i>
<i>in North Vietnam...</i>

1471
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,833
<i>I discovered, of course, that while</i>
<i>the bombs presumably had been aimed...</i>

1472
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,648
<i>toward military objectives,</i>
<i>as best the aviators could aim them...</i>

1473
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,384
<i>they indeed did kill many civilians...</i>

1474
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:20,254
<i>demolished large areas</i>
<i>of civilian housing.</i>

1475
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:22,256
<i>[Todd]</i>
<i>Before I left for North Vietnam...</i>

1476
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:25,326
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>that it was a small country...</i>

1477
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,762
that was just sort of
vaguely fighting back.

1478
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:31,755
But after seeing many battles
against American planes...

1479
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,901
<i>from the banks of the Red River...</i>

1480
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,870
<i>I changed my opinions completely.</i>

1481
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,839
<i>The antiaircraft in North Vietnam...</i>

1482
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:42,832
<i>in certain pockets, as the American</i>
<i>pilots say, is absolutely formidable.</i>

1483
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:46,013
<i>It's a sort of four-level affair.</i>

1484
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:49,684
<i>You have people equipped with</i>
<i>submachine guns and rifles...</i>

1485
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:53,677
<i>shooting at a first level, forcing the planes</i>
<i>to go up to a second level...</i>

1486
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:57,881
<i>where there they come against</i>
<i>the machine guns...</i>

1487
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:59,994
<i>a lot of them being Chinese.</i>

1488
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:02,997
<i>And then they're forced</i>
<i>up to a third level...</i>

1489
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,990
<i>which is that of the ordinary guns,</i>
<i>most of them, I would say, Russian.</i>

1490
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:11,227
<i>And after that they go up to a level</i>
<i>where they meet the SAMs</i>—

1491
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:16,900
<i>And I was being told that these SAMs</i>
<i>were antiquated...</i>

1492
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:20,247
<i>when in fact they are not</i>—
<i>they are formidably powerful.</i>

1493
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,751
<i>During one week in October...</i>

1494
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:27,744
<i>I saw at least 11 planes in five days...</i>

1495
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:32,059
<i>being shot by the North Vietnamese...</i>

1496
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:36,052
<i>antiaircraft defense.</i>

1497
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,303
<i>[Salisbury]</i>
<i>When you walk about the streets of Hanoi...</i>

1498
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:46,107
<i>you are struck by the fact</i>
<i>that you constantly see...</i>

1499
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:49,877
<i>civilians going about in trucks...</i>

1500
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:51,879
<i>with guns in their arms...</i>

1501
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:55,872
<i>or even walking down the streets</i>
<i>with guns strapped to their back.</i>

1502
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:59,954
It's unusual to see so many people
with guns in their hands...

1503
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,990
and it's most unusual to see this
in a communist country.

1504
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:06,460
<i>[Todd] One evening,</i>
<i>on the road to Haiphong...</i>

1505
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,463
<i>we were bombed</i>
<i>300 yards from where we were.</i>

1506
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:13,234
<i>And with my interpreter</i>
<i>we immediately went onto the side road.</i>

1507
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,569
<i>I was very frightened.</i>
<i>I was terribly frightened.</i>

1508
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:19,562
<i>As soon as we bumped into</i>
<i>a machine gun nest, fear disappeared.</i>

1509
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,011
The government has understood this...

1510
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:28,004
and I think this is one of the reasons
why it has armed most of the population.

1511
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:31,352
<i>[Berrigan]</i>
<i>We went into the countryside...</i>

1512
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,355
<i>and we saw great evidence</i>
<i>in the cities as well...</i>

1513
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:36,357
<i>that the people are generally armed.</i>

1514
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:39,326
<i>The civilian militia is very large.</i>

1515
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:43,319
<i>The women share, for instance,</i>
<i>the burden of antiaircraft gunfire...</i>

1516
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,834
<i>in defense of the city.</i>

1517
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:50,070
<i>We saw large numbers of men and women</i>
<i>on the roofs ofbuildings...</i>

1518
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:54,063
<i>preparing, in the early stages</i>
<i>of air alarms, for the bombardment itself.</i>

1519
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:58,445
<i>And they said to us quite openly</i>
<i>on several occasions...</i>

1520
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:02,438
<i>"Look, one of the most practical evidences</i>
<i>of the truth that this government speaks for us...</i>

1521
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:06,187
<i>"is that the government has armed us...</i>

1522
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:10,180
<i>"to the point where, if we wanted,</i>
<i>we could bring the government down in a day...</i>

1523
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:13,627
<i>and they themselves know this. "</i>

1524
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,996
<i>[Salisbury] At the time</i>
<i>that I was in North Vietnam...</i>

1525
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:19,989
<i>there obviously had not been any</i>
<i>breaking of the morale of the people...</i>

1526
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:24,104
<i>either in the cities or, as far as I</i>
<i>could observe, out in the villages...</i>

1527
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:28,097
<i>although they had been subjected</i>
<i>to an extremely heavy bombardment.</i>

1528
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,979
<i>At that time it was reaching</i>
<i>the levels of World War II...</i>

1529
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,249
<i>and, of course, since that time</i>
<i>has been much, much strengthened.</i>

1530
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,452
<i>The people of North Vietnam</i>
<i>are young, for the most part...</i>

1531
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:42,445
<i>and the war effort is largely</i>
<i>on the backs of teenagers...</i>

1532
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:46,660
<i>not because they're running out of manpower,</i>
<i>but because this is a young country.</i>

1533
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:49,597
There is nothing
that has not been attacked —

1534
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:52,600
There is no threat that has not
been tried to be burned...

1535
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,035
or frayed or broken by us...

1536
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,539
and yet none of it has happened,
or it's been repaired in the night.

1537
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,275
Altogether,
I think one can say, objectively...

1538
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:05,268
that there isn't a town left standing,
apart from Haiphong and Hanoi.

1539
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,983
So that there are hospitals,
there are schools.

1540
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,318
There is a trusted government...

1541
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:14,555
and there are —
there are political leaders...

1542
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:18,548
whom they don't hesitate
to call loved and admired.

1543
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:22,897
Which is to say,
the war's not working.

1544
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,299
It's a very simple judgment.

1545
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:29,003
Too simple
for the complexities of our power.

1546
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:32,996
Uh, perhaps, in a deeper spiritual sense,
too tough to face...

1547
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:36,577
because it means the end of a giant.

1548
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:40,014
It means the last days of Superman.

1549
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,583
It means that for those...

1550
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,653
with the capacity of overkill...

1551
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:48,656
kill is not enough.

1552
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:51,091
Um...

1553
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,094
the real thing required
is to live in the real world.

1554
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:58,087
As Buber says, it is to be able to imagine
the real world and imagine human beings.

1555
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:01,669
As long as the dinosaur couldn't do it,
he ended up on the museum shelf...

1556
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:05,662
and as long as Superman can't do it,
he can rave and destroy...

1557
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,709
but he cannot give life...

1558
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:12,702
and he cannot even truly,
as we know so bitterly, he cannot live himself.

1559
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,517
<i>[Todd]</i>
<i>The North Vietnamese always insist...</i>

1560
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:19,687
<i>that they are winning this war...</i>

1561
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:22,990
<i>that they are not simply resisting.</i>

1562
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:26,983
<i>And when I talked to</i>
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong...</i>

1563
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:31,487
<i>he said, "We are not underbombing,</i>
<i>we are facing the bombs. "</i>

1564
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:36,492
<i>And at first I thought</i>
<i>this was mere propaganda.</i>

1565
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:40,530
But seeing the North Vietnamese fighting,
in the country and in the towns...

1566
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,510
I think that psychologically it is true.

1567
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:47,348
I was most interested to find
that when I got to Hanoi...

1568
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:49,984
the authorities...

1569
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,554
put no restrictions
on what I wanted to send out.

1570
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:57,547
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong</i>
<i>has stressed, in his talk with me...</i>

1571
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,394
<i>the parallel between</i>
<i>the ancient struggles...</i>

1572
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:04,387
<i>of the Vietnamese people against</i>
<i>the Chinese, the Manchus and the Mongols...</i>

1573
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,768
<i>and their contemporary struggles</i>
<i>for independence...</i>

1574
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:11,739
<i>which began, of course,</i>
<i>under the French many years ago...</i>

1575
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:15,175
<i>were continued without interruption</i>
<i>through World War II...</i>

1576
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,444
<i>then resumed again</i>
<i>against the French...</i>

1577
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:20,180
<i>and are now being carried on</i>
<i>against the Americans.</i>

1578
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,173
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong</i>
<i>turned to me at one point and said...</i>

1579
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:28,277
<i>"Mr. Salisbury, how long do you want</i>
<i>to fight? Ten years? Twenty? Thirty?</i>

1580
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:32,515
<i>You pick the term of years.</i>
<i>We're ready to accommodate you. "</i>

1581
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:36,663
<i>A rather bold statement,</i>
<i>and maybe it had some bravado in it...</i>

1582
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:40,656
<i>but this is, again, in accordance</i>
<i>with the spirit of the Vietnamese people.</i>

1583
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:46,607
<i>[Berrigan] There's no one in that society</i>
<i>who doesn't remember hunger...</i>

1584
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,609
<i>in his own lifetime...</i>

1585
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:52,602
<i>and it was interesting that,</i>
<i>from the peasants to the young intellectuals...</i>

1586
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:56,050
<i>when you posed</i>
<i>the very same question</i>—

1587
01:40:56,050 --> 01:41:00,043
<i>that is, "What has the revolution</i>
<i>meant, first of all, to you?"</i>—

1588
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:02,289
<i>you'll get the same answer</i>—
<i>"We now have enough to eat."</i>

1589
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,191
<i>As simple as that.</i>

1590
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:07,795
<i>So that when the North Vietnamese government</i>
<i>makes it its pledge ofhonor...</i>

1591
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:10,230
<i>that the rice bowl will be filled...</i>

1592
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:14,223
<i>this is so great a thing that we can hardly</i>
<i>conceive of it</i>—<i>it seems to be off our radar.</i>

1593
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:18,728
<i>I think, you know, for them, the question is,</i>
<i>first of all, a very, very concrete one.</i>

1594
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,742
<i>That statement is literally true.</i>

1595
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,112
<i>And then again it begins to</i>
<i>move into the larger areas.</i>

1596
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:29,105
<i>The circumference of the bowl expands</i>
<i>and you note that the revolution has meant...</i>

1597
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,086
a passion for education...

1598
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,089
a passion for grass-roots involvement
in their own future...

1599
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,092
their own social structures,
their own politics...

1600
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,085
and that at the other end of that power,
which they are trying to move upward...

1601
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:46,122
after so many, many years
of colonial powerlessness...

1602
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:50,593
at the other end of that power is standing
a man who also has a rice bowl in his hand...

1603
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,507
and whose poverty is equivalent...

1604
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:57,500
<i>whose power has not separated himself</i>
<i>from the fate of the majority...</i>

1605
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,615
<i>who can move</i>
<i>in the same cheap cotton clothing...</i>

1606
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:04,351
<i>and with dignity among them...</i>

1607
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:08,344
<i>and whose power is not</i>
<i>an inferior backroom game...</i>

1608
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:11,592
<i>or a game of marked cards</i>
<i>under a table...</i>

1609
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:15,585
<i>or corrupt double-talk such as we've gotten</i>
<i>so used to in the chanceries of the West.</i>

1610
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,436
Yet there is one light of hope...

1611
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:25,405
and this is that...

1612
01:42:25,405 --> 01:42:29,376
throughout Vietnamese history
they had catastrophes —

1613
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,278
<i>they had Chinese,</i>
<i>Mongolian invasions...</i>

1614
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:35,271
<i>where whole provinces</i>
<i>were destroyed.</i>

1615
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:39,442
<i>You are not the first people</i>
<i>who destroyed villages in Vietnam...</i>

1616
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:41,655
<i>unfortunately.</i>

1617
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,657
<i>And so, they are used to that...</i>

1618
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:47,650
<i>and it's a great tradition</i>
<i>that the village is not lost...</i>

1619
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:51,854
<i>even when it disappears</i>
<i>from the surface of the ground...</i>

1620
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:54,434
<i>because the village is down below</i>—

1621
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:57,504
<i>down below with the tradition,</i>
<i>down below with the people...</i>

1622
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:01,497
<i>the ancestors who have</i>
made <i>the country, literally.</i>

1623
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:03,610
<i>The country is hand-made.</i>

1624
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:07,603
<i>There is not one square foot,</i>
<i>I would say, a square thumb of the earth...</i>

1625
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:12,575
<i>that has not been built as it is</i>
<i>by the peasantry in the past.</i>

1626
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,655
<i>And this survives.</i>

1627
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:18,648
<i>And when waylaid after 100 years,</i>
<i>a village comes back</i>—
