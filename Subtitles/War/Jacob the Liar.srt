1
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,706
Hitler goes to
a fortuneteller and asks.*

2
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,707
"When will I die?"

3
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,105
And the fortuneteller replies.*

4
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,471
"On a Jewish holiday. "

5
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:56,506
Hitler then asks,
"How do you know that?"

6
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,114
And she replies.*

7
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,392
"Any day you die
will be a Jewish holiday. "

8
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,472
So you ask me, as a Jew.*

9
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:10,027
"How could you tell a joke like that
at a time like that?"

10
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,711
That's how we survived.

11
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,423
Those were some of the things
that kept us going.

12
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,389
Everything else,
the Germans had taken.

13
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:23,072
They built high walls with
barbed wire to shut us in the ghetto.

14
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:27,433
We were isolated from the rest
of the world for years without news.

15
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:31,472
So we relied on the little things.*

16
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,908
A dark joke.

17
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,468
A sunny day.

18
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,512
A hopeful rumour.

19
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:41,188
That's why we'd go
and sit by the ghetto wall...

20
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,188
...and look at the tree
where I first kissed Hannah.

21
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:49,144
And it was by that wall
that it all started.

22
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,548
With a single sheet of newspaper.

23
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,790
No! It's too dangerous!

24
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,554
Where can she go?

25
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,193
Run, liebele. Run!

26
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,625
Be safe. Go, go, go!

27
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,309
Darling!

28
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:39,952
We'll see you soon!
We love you, Lina!

29
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,270
Halt!

30
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:22,666
What are you doing there?
Trying to escape f rom the ghetto?

31
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,391
Name!

32
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,311
Jakob Heym.

33
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,754
Don't you know it's punishable
by death for a Jew...

34
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,713
...to be in the streets after curfew?

35
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,946
You're right.
Of course you're right.

36
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:35,833
One hundred percent correct.

37
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,145
I don't think
the siren went off yet.

38
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,148
A smart Jew! Go over there!

39
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,070
Present yourself
to the officer on duty...

40
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:46,704
...and tell him
you were out after 8!

41
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,070
But it's not 8.

42
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,350
Are you arguing?

43
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,071
Go!

44
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:26,592
This is the radio of
the German Armed Forces Network.

45
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,234
Heil, Hitler!

46
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,031
We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.

47
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,790
During a hard-fought
defensive battle...

48
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:49,267
...heroic troops of the Fatherland,
under General von Hartung...

49
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:53,224
...succeeded in driving back
the Russian forces near Bezanika.

50
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,984
Bezanika is a very strategic point
of this sector.

51
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:01,068
We will now broadcast a message
from our Führer.

52
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,470
Bezanika.

53
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,424
The Russians are there,
only 400 kilometres away.

54
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,428
My God!
They're in Poland.

55
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,630
What are you doing here?

56
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,993
The sentry sent me to Your Royalness
for my proper punishment.

57
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:35,910
Although I hadn't heard the siren,
and with due respect...

58
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,794
...if his watch is right,
then your clock is wrong.

59
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,550
But that is for you to decide.

60
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,864
Decide?

61
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,310
What?

62
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:47,031
My appropriate punishment.

63
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:50,472
Even though, I take the liberty
of repeating myself :

64
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,507
It's not yet quite 8:00.

65
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:57,109
It still isn't 8:00.
It's only three minutes to 8.

66
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:00,384
Two minutes to 8.

67
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:06,869
Then the gentleman, the sentry,
was just making f un of me.

68
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,231
Just because there's a war...

69
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,909
...people shouldn't stop joking
with one another.

70
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,270
May I?

71
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,874
We Jews are partial to jokes too.

72
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:33,594
Do you live far f rom here?

73
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,991
Ten minutes, if I run.

74
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,384
Then hurry.

75
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,305
Please may I have a pass?

76
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:10,033
Now what do I do, Hannah?
I'm locked outside.

77
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:13,194
Gotta keep going.

78
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,274
It's crazy, Hannah.

79
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,665
I may be the only Jew
for 400 kilometres...

80
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,025
...trying to get
back into the ghetto.

81
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:31,624
To get across that distance,
you have to be a mouse.

82
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,274
Oh, God of the Jews!

83
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,629
Why didn't you make your people
a race of mice?

84
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,152
I ask you quite f rankly:
What good does it do to be a man?

85
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,269
I'm going.

86
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:44,271
I go.

87
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:46,864
Not yet!

88
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,673
Wait for the searchlight to go by.

89
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,871
-Who are you?
-Lina Kronstein.

90
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,424
I'm 10 1l2. How old are you?

91
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,189
Watch out!

92
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,469
What are you doing here, anyway?
Trying to escape?

93
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,752
Where? A Jew would not last
five minutes out there.

94
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,553
So you're going back in?

95
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:09,551
Yes.

96
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,587
May I come with you?

97
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,064
With me?

98
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,311
Why me?

99
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,183
Who else?

100
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:19,591
All right.

101
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:21,870
Come on.

102
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,314
Oh, wait! Wait!

103
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:26,385
You're scared?

104
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,427
No. Terrified.

105
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,867
Come on! This way!

106
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,624
-Here.
-Thank you, little mouse.

107
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:10,464
Hide! Police!

108
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:11,585
Here!

109
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,313
Bye-bye, little girl.

110
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,833
Thanks for saving my life.

111
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,153
You'll have to ex cuse me.

112
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,910
I'm very tired. I'm going home.
You should do the same.

113
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,346
Maybe I'll take the tram.

114
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,623
Bye-bye.

115
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,503
All right.

116
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:01,272
Where would you like to go?
Do you have money for your fare?

117
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,223
Come on.

118
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,705
You can't stay here.
You have to go home.

119
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,153
Where are your parents?

120
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,191
Come on!

121
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:44,274
Our apartment is much nicer.
We have a living room.

122
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:48,146
Well, when there were
10 people crammed in here...

123
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,465
...I'll show you no living room.

124
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,785
If you don't like it,
find another hotel.

125
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,946
That's not a nice thing
to say to me.

126
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,344
Ex cuse me.

127
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,074
-Where do I sleep?
-Upstairs.

128
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,191
Why not here?

129
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:02,507
Because some nosy neighbour
might see you and denounce me...

130
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:04,950
...and then the Germans will come.
Come on.

131
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:10,029
-Here, kitty, kitty.
-Leave the cat alone.

132
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:14,394
-Don't you like cats?
-No. I prefer a rat.

133
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,789
I don't want to see you
playing with that cat.

134
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,988
I certainly don't want to see you
catch it and eat it.

135
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,432
Any cat that lets itself
get caught is sick.

136
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,474
All right, but
what am I supposed to eat?

137
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:31,395
You don't have
any ration coupons for me.

138
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,103
That's true.

139
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,990
I'll burn that bridge
when I get to it.

140
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:41,270
Here we are.

141
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:43,510
Look.

142
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:49,266
There's heat f rom the chimney.

143
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:54,868
Here's a book about Af rica. You read
this, you'll forget you're hungry.

144
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:56,634
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

145
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,310
Now, come on.

146
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,705
-What's wrong?
-I lost my doll.

147
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:07,953
Sorry, I don't have any dolls.

148
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:09,344
Why not?

149
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:13,029
Well, me and my wife
didn't have any children.

150
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:16,188
Where is your wife?
Did they put her on a train?

151
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,988
No, they shot her!

152
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:20,863
Under a tree.

153
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:24,347
Don't ask me what kind of tree.
I didn't bother to ask.

154
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,469
Time for sleep.

155
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:30,348
It's crazy, Hannah.

156
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,704
I manage to more or less
smuggle myself through the war.

157
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,594
I even got out
of the Kommandantur alive.

158
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,464
And now I'm supposed
to take care of a little girl.

159
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:48,510
I know we wanted a child.

160
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,665
But you usually
have them as babies...

161
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,831
...and you get
a chance to know them.

162
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:56,789
That's true.

163
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:01,424
But what if the Germans find her?
I'm the one who'll have to pay.

164
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,671
If the Russians are that close...

165
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,545
...it's only a few days, right?

166
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,905
Bezanika

167
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,025
Germans are dying each day

168
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,070
Russians are on their way

169
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,824
-Kowalsky!
-We're closed. We're closed.

170
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,953
-Time to open!
-Leave me alone. Go away!

171
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,234
What are you doing?

172
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:59,228
-You can't kill yourself.
-You got a reason why not?

173
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:00,874
Yeah, I have a good one.

174
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,267
That's just between you and me.

175
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:07,506
Yesterday evening
something very f unny happened.

176
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:11,431
Actually, not that f unny.
You might not find it f unny.

177
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:14,428
-It's where I caught this cold--
-Get to the point.

178
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:19,226
The point is, my f riend, yesterday after
curfew, I was in the Kommandantur--

179
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,665
-Are you an informer?
-Are you out of your mind?

180
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,912
No Jew leaves the Kommandantur
alive ex cept informers.

181
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,510
Don't tell me lies.
I'm desperate, not stupid.

182
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:30,633
Get out of here, please.
Please leave me alone.

183
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,990
Go ahead.

184
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,830
People will say Kowalsky
didn't keep his part of a bargain.

185
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,066
I'm entitled to
daily shaves and haircuts.

186
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:42,864
In ex change, you can eat
all the pancakes you want in my cafe.

187
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,867
You haven't made any for 3 years.

188
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:47,874
What can I do?
The Germans don't let potatoes in.

189
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,429
But your beard keeps growing.

190
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,508
That's not my fault.
A deal's a deal.

191
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:56,544
Oh, good.

192
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,714
What are you complaining about?
You have a dull razor.

193
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:00,865
Sit down.

194
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,311
Barber with a dull razor
is like a blind moyl.

195
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,467
No insults. Sit down, please.
Here we go.

196
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,227
Here. Enough.

197
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,308
Good. Enough!

198
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,104
Professor!

199
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,751
No, thank you.

200
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,905
Ex cuse me.
My respects, professor.

201
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:44,067
I caught a cold last night.
Do you have some medical advice?

202
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,864
You know my prescription: A cigar
and brandy, taken in Monte Carlo.

203
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,833
Give me your hand, professor.

204
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,345
-You have a good night?
-Good night?

205
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:59,150
If three suicides balanced by
one birth is a good night, then, yes.

206
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,351
Splendid, wonderf ul night.

207
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,430
Line up two at a time!
Pick a partner!

208
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:33,072
-Herschel, you need a partner?
-Yes, but not with cough.

209
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,151
Professor!

210
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,784
Two weak men
don't make a strong man.

211
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,628
You forgot me!

212
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,706
-I unload, you carry.
-What'll I get?

213
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,184
The pleasure of my company.

214
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:56,304
I have to eat.

215
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:58,307
Do I have to feed you?

216
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,027
All right.

217
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,349
You all right?

218
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:42,710
Yes, thank you.

219
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:51,070
Mischa?

220
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:55,151
Where are you? Sneaking a cigarette?
Is that it?

221
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,784
Oh, my God!

222
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,987
Are you meshugge?
It's forbidden to do that!

223
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:07,023
It could be you and me here one day.
Shouldn't we do something?

224
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:11,154
The best thing to do is nothing!
I don't want to be shot!

225
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,632
What way would you prefer to die?

226
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,228
Go away.
Don't stand here.

227
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,985
I can't let you do something stupid!

228
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,270
Can you stop me?

229
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,107
I'm your manager.

230
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,433
You're not a very good one.

231
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:26,353
You're not a very good box er.

232
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:31,627
-You want to try me?
-We're not the same weight class!

233
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,864
Guard!

234
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,628
The guard is coming.

235
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,626
You'll make a good-Iooking corpse.

236
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:47,866
I'll take one of those
bastards with me.

237
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:48,871
Don't!

238
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,311
The Russians are in Bezanika.

239
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:54,467
And I heard Hitler's applying
to be chief rabbi in Berlin.

240
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,114
-It's the truth.
-Let go!

241
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,311
I heard it on the radio!

242
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,910
It's forbidden to talk.
Go to work.

243
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,032
What are you laughing at?

244
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:20,394
Forgive me, but...

245
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,228
...I just heard good news.

246
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,350
Go, go!

247
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,988
You'll get shot.

248
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,027
-You have a radio?
-Who said that?

249
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,027
-You said that.
-No, I didn't.

250
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,311
-What have we been talking about?
-Shut up!

251
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,587
You sneaky bastard!

252
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:53,508
You had a radio all this time!
I can't believe it!

253
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:57,065
I have no radio. I just said that
to keep you f rom getting shot.

254
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,987
Nobody'd say that if he didn't.

255
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,147
Do you realize the penalty
for having a radio is death?

256
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:04,353
I was lying!

257
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,910
Lying?

258
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:17,589
If you had one and didn't
want anyone to know...

259
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,594
...the best way would be
to say you had one...

260
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:24,191
...because no one owning a radio
would be stupid enough to admit it.

261
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,790
They'd leave you alone,
which means....

262
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,071
-What does it mean, Jakob?
-I don't know.

263
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:32,032
It means you've got a radio.

264
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:34,944
I don't have a radio.

265
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:37,864
I understand.

266
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:39,944
Go, go.

267
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,705
Don't worry, Jakob.
You can trust me.

268
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:49,508
I'll keep it under my hat.

269
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:51,911
You better.

270
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:53,304
Because if you don't...

271
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:56,831
...you better start the Kaddish now,
because I'm a dead man.

272
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:01,865
-Jakob!
-What?

273
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,873
I'm going to start training again.

274
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:05,787
Tell your new manager.

275
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:08,629
Hello, Anna! How are you?

276
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,785
Are you taking a trip somewhere?

277
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,708
I think it's too dangerous
for you if I stay...

278
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:24,469
...so I should go
with my parents after all.

279
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:26,154
May I take your book?

280
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,107
You're not going anywhere
until you eat your supper.

281
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:35,424
Aren't you eating?

282
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:39,907
Eat, always eat. It's not good
to stuff yourself till bursting.

283
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:46,549
Mischa. Have you been
in another fight?

284
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:48,865
No, it's nothing.
I have very good news.

285
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:50,992
Good news? What good news?

286
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:52,987
Hello, Mrs. Frankf urter.

287
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:54,911
Hello, Mr.--

288
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,114
How are you today?

289
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:01,945
Mr. Frankf urter,
I have something to ask you.

290
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,875
I've already beaten you, Papa.

291
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:08,664
Until the last line has been spoken,
the curtain cannot come down.

292
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,792
Ex cuse me, Mr. Frankf urter--

293
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,787
You have something to ask me?

294
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:19,551
I'm prepared to help you with
the overcrowding in this apartment.

295
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,184
Before I forget....
For you.

296
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,224
Two rutabagas.

297
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:30,945
I know it's not much. It doesn't
seem a fair ex change for....

298
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:33,394
Mr. Frankf urter.

299
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,388
Mrs. Frankf urter.

300
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:39,075
I am here to ask for
the hand of your daughter.

301
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:43,833
Come with me for a minute.

302
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,274
You know where we are?

303
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:51,871
Trains are coming to take us
and you make matrimonial plans?

304
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:56,114
We've learned to live without
firewood, potatoes, decent clothing...

305
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:59,313
...without children, but no one
can live without a f uture.

306
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:02,308
We have a f uture.
The war's about to end.

307
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:04,267
Someday, but who'll see it?

308
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:05,311
We will!

309
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:08,115
Our war is nearly over.
You can count the hours.

310
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:09,583
Don't do this to my family!

311
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:13,066
Don't come here and fill our heads
with false hope!

312
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,992
Do you know where Bezanika is?

313
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,748
Do I know where Bezanika is?

314
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:25,391
I played King Lear there three times.
"As flies to...."

315
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:26,704
"To wanton--"

316
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:30,504
"As flies to wanton boys are we
to the gods. They kill us for sport."

317
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,064
Bezanika's less than
400 kilometres away.

318
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,589
So what do I care?

319
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:38,191
The Red Army is there tonight.
Probably even closer by now.

320
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:40,585
Stalin told you this news personally?

321
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:47,185
In absolute confidence,
just between you and me...

322
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:51,191
...and Rosa and Mrs. Frankf urter...

323
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:54,509
...and A vron and Judith, and....

324
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,110
Jakob Heym told me.

325
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,270
Jakob Heym, the illustrious
pancake vendor.

326
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,187
If he said it, it must be true.

327
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,027
He's got a radio.

328
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,912
Please, don't tell anyone.
It could be dangerous for him.

329
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,471
And you never said anything about it.

330
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:37,865
You've been listening to a radio!

331
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:39,628
Don't worry, it has no plug.

332
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,706
Now I'll reduce it to splinters.

333
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,751
Close the door.

334
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:51,832
We couldn't listen to it
for a moment?

335
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:53,144
Ex cuse me.

336
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:57,388
What happens when the Gestapo finds
the pancake vendor has a radio?

337
00:26:57,635 --> 00:27:01,867
They will search the ghetto.
What will they find? This radio.

338
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:05,471
I'll say that I never listened to it.
They'll shoot me anyway.

339
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:09,543
For an encore, they'll hang me in
the square, next to that idiot Heym!

340
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:12,584
Morning!

341
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:26,746
-Great morning, Jakob.
-Good to see you, good to see you.

342
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:00,423
So what's new?

343
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:04,265
Nothing much, you know.
K vart's wife left him.

344
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:08,184
Under the circumstances,
seems a bit pointless.

345
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:09,584
That's too bad.

346
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,429
You know, women.
Since Adam.

347
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,903
You don't say.

348
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,873
Can you keep my hair f rom falling out?

349
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:18,946
How long have we been f riends?

350
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,471
What does that have to do
with my hair?

351
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,313
Do you have that green stuff?

352
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:27,833
You come every day for a f ree shave
and never mentioned a radio.

353
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,270
What radio? I have radios
like I have potatoes.

354
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:34,508
-Everybody knows you got a radio.
-What do you mean, everybody knows?

355
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,191
It's travelling at least as fast
as the news about K vart's wife.

356
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,995
Really? So by the evening,
the Gestapo will know.

357
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,225
You still have that rope?
I may need it.

358
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,670
Mischa says the Russians killed
so many Germans...

359
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:50,190
...their tanks crossed the river
on their bodies.

360
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,268
-Did Mischa say that?
-Yes, he did. Is this true?

361
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:54,789
Is it?

362
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:21,584
I want you to be the first to know
I'm engaged to Rosa.

363
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:22,950
-Mazel tov!
-Thank you.

364
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,947
But what about our news?

365
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,709
I only told family and f riends
and Frankf urter.

366
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:30,515
Schmuck! You told a barber!

367
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:33,224
A barber.
The biggest mouth in town.

368
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,034
Murderer.

369
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:39,593
I'm sorry, Jakob.
You want a partner?

370
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:42,503
Jakob, you need a partner?

371
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,628
You need a partner, Jakob?

372
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:48,304
He is my partner!

373
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:50,750
No! I work with Samuel.

374
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,031
I'm your partner, Jakob. Me.

375
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:04,154
Stop. I know bubkes.

376
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,673
How many kilometres
did they make today?

377
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,394
Get off my back.

378
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:26,867
Ex cuse me. Your f riend Jakob,
did he tell you about the f ront line?

379
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,673
Well, he asked me not to say.

380
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:30,825
What?

381
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,671
Can he get the BBC?

382
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:38,110
BBC? Of course.

383
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:40,591
-Please give me something.
-Go away.

384
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:43,429
Don't tell me you haven't listened
since yesterday.

385
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:47,992
Yesterday, there was
a program of dance music.

386
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,705
Maybe after work,
I could teach you the tango.

387
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:53,865
Shit!

388
00:30:58,515 --> 00:30:59,425
Listen.

389
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:04,075
There was a program
of music yesterday.

390
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:06,034
Russian music.

391
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:08,948
I'm telling you,
we'll never see the Russians.

392
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:19,905
We'll never see the Russians, eh?
So what are those?

393
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:46,063
Mr. Frankf urter, the Russians...

394
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,312
...they're going to bomb us.

395
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:49,984
This is the good news?

396
00:31:58,315 --> 00:31:59,464
Germans.

397
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,307
They look like Germans to me.

398
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:05,946
Your information said they were
retreating under Russian attack.

399
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,068
They're flying east and....

400
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:17,068
Use your brains a little.

401
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:20,910
If the Germans are headed in that
direction, towards Bezanika...

402
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,828
...and the Russians are
headed there also, they say.

403
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,224
There, exactly.

404
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:28,785
If the Russians are there, they're
not going to sit and have a picnic.

405
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:30,263
I don't think so.

406
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:35,230
-For this bread, three rutabagas.
-Two turnips!

407
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,705
No. For two turnips,
half a bread.

408
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,911
Three-quarters, because it's you.

409
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:41,590
Gonif!.

410
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:58,031
Stay away from the train.

411
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,785
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, please!

412
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,593
Roman, I heard voices coming
f rom those box cars.

413
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:28,224
Are you crazy? Come on, come on.

414
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:30,384
The show is over!

415
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:31,989
Back to your work!

416
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,024
I heard voices, I tell you.

417
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:37,545
Pretend there are
just potatoes in there.

418
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:41,105
Oh, yes. It's the latest German
invention: potatoes that talk.

419
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,994
It's human voices!
We've got to speak to them.

420
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:46,227
What can you say to the dead?

421
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,033
What's the matter with you?

422
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:50,545
You told us the Russians
would be there any moment.

423
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:53,554
-You want to keep that to yourself?
-It's none of our business.

424
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:54,591
What's wrong with you?

425
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:55,745
Sit down.

426
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,714
They have the right to know.

427
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:01,791
Eat.

428
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,150
I don't wanna eat.

429
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,385
Someone help me, please!

430
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:24,863
Hey! Do you hear me?

431
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:29,072
We have information.
The Russians are almost here.

432
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:30,384
They're at Bezanika.

433
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:32,834
We all saw the plane.

434
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,794
Yes, please believe me.

435
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,185
You don't understand.

436
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:40,868
We have a radio!

437
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:51,543
You want to get killed too?

438
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,508
You did this!

439
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,629
Did you have to shout f rom
the rooftops that the war is over?

440
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,592
Look where it got us!

441
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,513
Don't blame yourself.

442
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:33,987
If Herschel wanted to save the world,
that was his choice.

443
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,953
We need more Jews like Herschel.

444
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:38,663
At least he tried to give
these people some hope.

445
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:40,030
He's a hero like you.

446
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,148
I'm not a hero.

447
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,994
I'm a latke vendor.

448
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,191
A latke vendor with a radio.

449
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,153
Who just killed a f riend.

450
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,787
If you hang yourself, I'll kill you.

451
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:14,711
Are you going to listen to London?

452
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,230
I can't take anymore.
You must tell me.

453
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,351
The Russians--

454
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,587
There are no Russians!
No radio! No nothing!

455
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,348
Understand?

456
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:24,351
What do you mean?

457
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:28,907
I mean I don't have the slightest idea
where the Russians are.

458
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:34,309
I'm a liar! All right?

459
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,708
You'll burn them. Let me do it.

460
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,071
I'm perfectly capable
of f rying mushrooms.

461
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:47,670
I know. I ran a restaurant
before the war.

462
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,711
A restaurant?

463
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:51,347
A very quaint one.

464
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:54,871
We made latkes.
You know, potato pancakes.

465
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,390
And blintzes
stuffed with apricot jam.

466
00:36:57,635 --> 00:37:00,195
And in the summer,
ice creams and f ruit juices.

467
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,470
Did your wife work with you?

468
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,387
Why are you always asking questions?

469
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,194
Why do you never answer them?

470
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,231
I already ate.

471
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:10,074
Eat. After you've eaten,
you can do the washing up.

472
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,634
I hate washing up.

473
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,786
I did the cooking, didn't I?

474
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,065
When the war is over,
can I be a waitress?

475
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:19,350
What about school?

476
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:23,224
I'll go to school in the morning.
Afterwards, I'll serve customers.

477
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:27,305
You don't have to pay me. Just let me
eat as many pancakes as I want.

478
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:28,704
Just like Kowalsky.

479
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,788
Open the window.

480
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,825
Look, your f riend the box er.

481
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:43,070
Are they fighting?

482
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,744
Maybe later they're fighting.

483
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:48,185
Looks like Mischa thinks
the war is over.

484
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,665
He's trying to get her
to go to his apartment.

485
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,587
Doesn't she want to go?

486
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:55,230
-Very much.
-Then why doesn't she go?

487
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:58,114
You'll discover these things
when you're older.

488
00:37:58,355 --> 00:37:59,185
When?

489
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:01,593
No more questions.

490
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,508
Spirit...

491
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:14,745
...if the Russians have reached Pry...

492
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:17,748
...knock twice.

493
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:22,104
Ask something usef ul, like where
your daughter is this time of night.

494
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,505
-She's with Mischa.
-That's what I'm af raid of.

495
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:27,952
He's involved with this troublemaker
Heym. They'll drag Rosa into it.

496
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:31,392
On the other hand, if Rosa
doesn't sleep home, it's better.

497
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:34,103
If they arrest us, she won't be here.

498
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:36,787
Some consolation.

499
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:41,504
The days are difficult. Let them do
what they want with their nights.

500
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:52,224
So? Did you listen to the radio?
Any progress at the f ront?

501
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:54,989
Did the Russians
shoot down those planes?

502
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:59,513
Stop torturing me. The Germans are
already doing a fine job.

503
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:11,145
Samuel.

504
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:17,704
Is it suicide?

505
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:21,467
He just gave up and pulled
the blankets under his chin.

506
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:29,751
Stupid thing for Samuel to do,
when the Russians are that close.

507
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,192
Because they are, aren't they?

508
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:35,504
Yes, professor.

509
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:36,790
What?

510
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,985
The radio says they are.

511
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:50,545
So, Hannah...

512
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:53,067
... the truth can kill.

513
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:56,673
Samuel has died
because I told him the truth.

514
00:39:56,915 --> 00:39:58,951
And that crazy Herschel
died because...

515
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:02,312
...he believed in news from a radio
that doesn't exist.

516
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,591
So that's dangerous too.

517
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:08,634
Whatever I do, I'm wrong.

518
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:13,911
Hunger for hope may be worse
than hunger for food.

519
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:15,304
So what's new?

520
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:19,515
I have to feed
them something, Hannah.

521
00:40:19,915 --> 00:40:20,950
But what?

522
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,868
Elements of the 16th Army...

523
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:38,232
...supported by flamethrowers
of the shock troops...

524
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:39,914
...of the Leningrad Division...

525
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:42,750
...are advancing with
mechanized armoured units...

526
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:46,549
...of Stalin's Soviet 6th Brigade...

527
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:50,504
...in an easterly direction,
under massive air cover.

528
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,023
Easterly?

529
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:53,948
They're headed the wrong way.

530
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:00,270
It's just a feint...

531
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:01,789
...to throw the Germans off.

532
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:02,951
Exactly.

533
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:05,271
Why would they announce
that on the radio?

534
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:06,869
Strategy.

535
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:09,583
To make the Germans think
they're invading China.

536
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,632
Remember, it's a world war.

537
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:12,631
Exactly right.

538
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:14,590
For example...

539
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,150
...in Af rica, there are
tribes of cannibals...

540
00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:19,067
...who've never seen a white man.

541
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:20,714
We don't want news about cannibals.

542
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:21,910
Why not?

543
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:24,715
We want to know if the Russians
are going to get here.

544
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:30,305
Technically, they're retreating.
But strategically, they're advancing.

545
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,469
What does that mean?

546
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:34,833
Let me show you.

547
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:38,704
Here is the f ront line.

548
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:42,275
Here is Bezanika.
The Russians have that.

549
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:44,392
Here's Pry.
The Germans have that.

550
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,910
Here is the railroad junction
at the Rudna.

551
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:49,709
That's what the Luftwaffe
were protecting yesterday.

552
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,184
Exactly right!

553
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,825
Germans don't want
the Americans to take that.

554
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:56,232
The Americans are in the war too?

555
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:59,867
They didn't say they were there.
They have problems of their own.

556
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:03,551
They're fighting on another f ront.
But for now, they're sending tanks.

557
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,947
Tanks? How many?

558
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:09,071
Not many. But enough.

559
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,954
And brand-new, right off
the boat f rom Chicago.

560
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,389
Chicago?

561
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:16,310
How could you tell
they were American?

562
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:17,994
You get to know the difference.

563
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,988
American tanks,
it's a different noise entirely.

564
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:22,270
What kind of noise?

565
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:23,311
Clean.

566
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:25,193
Yeah, you can hear the horns.

567
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:26,754
-On the tank?
-No, the band.

568
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:29,948
They sent a jazz band
to cheer up their allies.

569
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:31,868
-Sax ophone?
-Clarinet.

570
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:33,184
Sounds like Benny Goodman.

571
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,550
-Lady singers?
-Three of them.

572
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:37,234
-Andrew Sisters?
-Maybe their cousins.

573
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:38,749
It sounded so beautif ul.

574
00:42:38,995 --> 00:42:42,271
And all the time in the background,
I could hear the Russian guns.

575
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:45,268
It's the most beautif ul thing
I've ever heard in my life.

576
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,303
You know, the jazz band...

577
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,227
...the artillery, everything.

578
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:03,151
It seems liberation is near.

579
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:05,903
Heym may not be the Messiah,
but he could be a prophet.

580
00:43:06,155 --> 00:43:07,827
Prophets speak in the name of God!

581
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:09,906
All the pancake vendor has
is a radio!

582
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:13,268
He's saying the same thing
Isaiah said:

583
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:16,353
" People of Israel,
I will lead you out of bondage."

584
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,391
"Out of bondage."

585
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:19,227
If this is what we get f rom Isaiah...

586
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:22,148
...I can't wait to find out
the results f rom the pancake vendor.

587
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,027
He must be stopped.

588
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:31,507
Yeah, it is crazy.

589
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:33,747
I know, Hannah.

590
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:37,594
But when I started to make up
those things...

591
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:40,031
...I almost believed them.

592
00:43:44,115 --> 00:43:45,230
I know.

593
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:50,707
The point is, what am I going
to invent tomorrow?

594
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:56,631
In my whole life, my greatest
invention was an apricot pancake.

595
00:43:58,195 --> 00:43:59,184
A latke.

596
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:05,387
My crowning achievement:

597
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:07,747
Latkes and lies.

598
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:19,231
What are you doing here?

599
00:44:23,155 --> 00:44:24,827
Look what I made for you.

600
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:26,554
I'm not hungry.

601
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,547
What do you mean, you're not hungry?

602
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:32,265
This is turnip soup,
made f rom real turnips.

603
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:35,954
It's delicious.
Try it.

604
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,548
No, thank you.

605
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:40,303
You haven't eaten cat, have you?

606
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:42,308
Of course not.

607
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:44,349
Then it's the mushrooms.

608
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:47,544
-Those mushrooms were bad.
-Don't worry.

609
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:52,467
It's better not to be hungry
than to be hungry, isn't it?

610
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:58,264
Sneaky bastard. He's got
the radio in the attic, Rosa.

611
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:00,671
He's trying to get to London.
I'm sure of it.

612
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:03,349
Are you going to marry
Jakob Heym or me?

613
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:06,545
We're not the only two people
in the world.

614
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:10,071
Think about the resistance that'll
be organized because of this radio.

615
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:12,624
Maybe I should have put up
a little more resistance.

616
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,070
Then you'd pay more attention to me.

617
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:21,827
Do you want more attention?

618
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:23,310
Maybe.

619
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,912
Come on.
Let's try to get some sleep.

620
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:29,908
Napoleon always made sure he got
a good night's sleep...

621
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:32,028
...before his big battles.

622
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,868
And he didn't do too badly.

623
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,872
Go, go!
Get away, you bad cat!

624
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:51,591
Something is going on, I knew it.
I have to see where he's going.

625
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,831
-Mischa, it's curfew.
-I know!

626
00:45:54,075 --> 00:45:57,465
What if the Russians attack
and I'm lying here! Where's my hat?

627
00:45:58,035 --> 00:45:59,354
I love you. You know that.

628
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:01,954
I love you too.

629
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:19,633
Look at this. Look here.

630
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,945
Your Mischa leaves our daughter home
so he can run around with Jakob.

631
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:28,995
Something must be done
about this nonsense.

632
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:58,951
Mischa! You f rightened me!

633
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:02,585
That snob Kirschbaum is in on it too?
Why? Because he's a doctor?

634
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,354
Yeah, because he's a doctor.

635
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:06,472
Go! Leave me alone!

636
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:08,990
I know you think I'm stupid,
but I'm not.

637
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,149
I know what's going on.

638
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:15,024
You heard a message f rom London
and you're going to tell Kirschbaum.

639
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,508
You were hit in the head
too many times, Mischa.

640
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:25,351
Good evening.

641
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:28,507
Professor doesn't see patients
at this time of the night.

642
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:30,867
I'm a personal f riend
of the doctor's.

643
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:33,066
Professional colleague
at the f reight yard.

644
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:35,829
-Your name?
-My name is Jakob Heym.

645
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:38,514
The Jakob Heym?

646
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:41,784
I imagined you much taller.

647
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:43,231
So did I.

648
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:44,590
Come in.

649
00:47:58,715 --> 00:47:59,625
Professor.

650
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:01,030
Please sit down.

651
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:03,152
Here, my diploma.

652
00:48:03,395 --> 00:48:05,192
Forty years ago,
more than 40 years.

653
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:11,233
I always knew this diploma...

654
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,068
...would come in usef ul.

655
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,467
What can I do for you?

656
00:48:16,795 --> 00:48:18,353
I have a girl in my attic.

657
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,233
I'm a doctor, not a confessor.

658
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:23,629
No, please.
She's only 10 years old.

659
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:26,344
She escaped f rom
one of the transports.

660
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,514
I've been taking care of her.
I'm doing my best...

661
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:31,029
...but I think she's very sick.

662
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,785
Come.

663
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:35,266
I'll show you my pharmacy.

664
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:37,114
There's nothing there.

665
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:38,585
Here, look.

666
00:48:39,955 --> 00:48:41,149
All I have.

667
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:46,706
The only medicine we could give her
is some of your good news.

668
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:49,549
Like the American tanks.

669
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:54,911
I mean, even if the jazz band,
it's a little too much.

670
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:56,588
Benny Goodman!

671
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:58,508
Don't you think so?

672
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:02,308
That's a wonderf ul medicine you have.
I mean, wonderf ul.

673
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:05,228
I admire what you're doing.
I really do.

674
00:49:05,755 --> 00:49:08,189
Let's go and see
this little f riend of yours.

675
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:10,587
Esther, my bag
and my coat, please.

676
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:12,992
Pancakes....

677
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:20,425
Oh, my God!

678
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,313
Come on, it's me!

679
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:31,667
What, you need an emergency shave?

680
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:35,464
The Russians will be here whether
Heym has a radio or not, won't they?

681
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:38,275
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

682
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:42,544
You and I are
in the same profession.

683
00:49:42,795 --> 00:49:46,026
Who knows more about human nature
than actors and barbers?

684
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,550
You have your stage, I have mine.

685
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:51,832
Now I risk treading on yours
to make a solemn plea.

686
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,192
Tell your f riend to destroy
the radio before it destroys us!

687
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:56,914
Destroy it? The radio?

688
00:49:57,155 --> 00:50:00,067
Your f riend, Jakob,
is preparing an uprising.

689
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:04,354
That's ridiculous. This isn't
that kind of ghetto that rises up.

690
00:50:04,595 --> 00:50:06,665
Even to think of it is blasphemy.

691
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:10,032
Jews put their trust in God
to protect them!

692
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:15,030
We must admit that line of reasoning
hasn't gotten us very far.

693
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:18,068
If you don't believe me
about the uprising, answer this:

694
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,148
Why are Jakob and the prizefighter
walking around after curfew?

695
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:22,271
Mischa is in this?

696
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:24,267
Up to his neck!

697
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:28,744
Stupid, stupid!

698
00:50:28,995 --> 00:50:30,747
My God!
Anybody could see us here!

699
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:33,631
What do you think?
They don't have eyes?

700
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:40,590
Quiet!

701
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:46,549
Professor, it's really
very important to me.

702
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,224
It's not very far.
Right this way.

703
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:08,146
Could somebody please tell me
what's the point of this, please?

704
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,513
You see? What's he doing out
this time of night?

705
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:17,144
What are we doing out
at this time of night?

706
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,463
What's this?

707
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:24,228
When a man loses
his fear of the Almighty...

708
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:26,864
...he's capable of anything.

709
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:31,670
I hope to God not to find out
disgusting things about Heym.

710
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:32,950
What do you mean?

711
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:37,394
His private affairs are none
of our concern. Look for the radio!

712
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:41,832
Only an idiot would hide
a radio in the kitchen.

713
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:43,754
Maybe we should try the cellar.

714
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:44,791
Good idea.

715
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,707
Yes, the cellar.

716
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:47,865
Let's go.

717
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:49,594
Let's get out of here.

718
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:56,194
This way, professor.

719
00:51:56,475 --> 00:51:57,590
Oh, my God! He's here!

720
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:01,068
Not so fast.

721
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:03,314
Only one more floor.

722
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,545
Hide!

723
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:09,831
Shut up!

724
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:12,988
Slow down.
I have a heart condition.

725
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:16,190
-I'm exhausted.
-Right here.

726
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:19,347
Wait, wait, wait.

727
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:22,629
I need to rest, need to rest.

728
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,826
What if the Russians said that?

729
00:52:25,835 --> 00:52:26,984
You're right.

730
00:52:34,395 --> 00:52:37,990
Kirschbaum is part of the Resistance.
I would have bet money on it.

731
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:39,827
He keeps it in the attic!

732
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:42,585
Jakob, there are thieves
in your apartment.

733
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,706
My apartment?

734
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,434
What's to steal?

735
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:47,983
Now, come on.

736
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:49,430
Lie down.

737
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:52,788
And you do everything
the professor says.

738
00:53:01,115 --> 00:53:01,911
Let's see.

739
00:53:08,675 --> 00:53:13,112
Stick out your tongue like a f rog
trying to catch a fly, and say, "Ah."

740
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:19,985
All we have here
is a little tummy ache.

741
00:53:20,235 --> 00:53:21,748
Too much ice cream.

742
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:23,469
Chocolate, maybe?

743
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:26,945
She's very sick.

744
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:29,033
Boiled water only...

745
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:31,313
...and some of your medicine, maybe.

746
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,434
It's in here.

747
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:39,111
If they're listening to the radio,
we would be considered accomplices.

748
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:40,185
Oh, my God!

749
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,346
We'd better wait for them there.

750
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:46,065
That's a good point. I love
your point. Let's get out of here.

751
00:53:50,195 --> 00:53:51,913
What are you doing here?

752
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,426
My God, Kowalsky. You too?

753
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:58,754
Yes. You know, I think it's
really for the best. I really do.

754
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:06,028
I don't know if you realize the danger
in which we have been placed.

755
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:10,154
There are ghetto informers who will
do anything for a few potatoes.

756
00:54:10,395 --> 00:54:13,228
Therefore, I beg you,
as a father and a husband...

757
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:16,547
...please destroy that radio
before the Germans find out.

758
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:22,712
You want me to destroy my radio?

759
00:54:23,715 --> 00:54:24,704
I do, yes.

760
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:26,550
All right.

761
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:28,907
I'll destroy it.

762
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:31,953
It's a dangerous thing,
I admit that.

763
00:54:33,515 --> 00:54:34,994
Destroy the radio.

764
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:39,069
But since Mr. Heym has accepted
to share the information with us...

765
00:54:39,315 --> 00:54:44,025
...there has not been a single case
of suicide in the entire ghetto.

766
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:46,992
-Is true?
-It is true!

767
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:49,514
The professor has a good point.

768
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:52,469
-Very good point.
-Think about it.

769
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:56,113
It saves lives.

770
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:01,394
That's very good reason to keep it.

771
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:03,544
I have a suggestion.

772
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:04,591
What?

773
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:08,590
We could listen to the latest news
and then destroy the radio.

774
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:09,870
That's a good idea.

775
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:14,348
My God! These idiots
want to defy you once again.

776
00:55:14,595 --> 00:55:16,984
Stop them! I beg you!

777
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:23,791
It's a power cut.

778
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:26,509
It's a miracle!

779
00:55:28,115 --> 00:55:29,150
Sorry, gentlemen.

780
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:32,273
No more radio. No more news.

781
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:34,307
Good night.
Thank you for coming.

782
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,273
No electricity. None.

783
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,194
It's sabotage.

784
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,710
-It's sabotage of the Resistance.
-Resistance?

785
00:55:40,955 --> 00:55:41,944
Stop!

786
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:44,864
-Come on. We go back.
-We can't go back!

787
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:46,104
Thank you.

788
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,954
It's a miracle.

789
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:50,514
No, it's sabotage.

790
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:52,711
-It's a miracle.
-It's sabotage.

791
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:54,911
-Miracle!
-It's sabotage, I'm telling you.

792
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:56,349
Miracle, miracle, miracle!

793
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:57,425
Shut up!

794
00:55:58,115 --> 00:55:59,548
Here, drink.

795
00:56:02,715 --> 00:56:04,592
Because you've got to get well...

796
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,150
...because your parents
are coming back.

797
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:12,269
And when they do, we're gonna have
the biggest party you ever seen.

798
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:18,114
I'll be back.

799
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:22,668
Is it true you've got a radio?

800
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:28,991
Not you too?

801
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:33,314
Please. I've heard you have a radio.
I'd really like to see it.

802
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:35,904
I was a baby
when they took ours away.

803
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:39,305
If you promise me to get well...

804
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:43,305
...I promise you,
you can listen to my radio...

805
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:45,352
...if the power comes back on.

806
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,144
Do you mean it?

807
00:56:47,715 --> 00:56:49,467
Would I lie to you?

808
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,071
-So what's new?
-New? Oy!

809
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:59,869
Anybody would think you were happy
about the power cut.

810
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:01,787
God's will be done.

811
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:04,351
I think that green stuff
is working.

812
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,551
Stamtisch never complained.

813
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:09,744
I know I'm not a member
of the club...

814
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:11,872
...but you might want to hear
my idea anyway.

815
00:57:12,115 --> 00:57:13,912
-I don't.
-You see?

816
00:57:14,155 --> 00:57:16,385
Mischa was thinking, Mr. Heym...

817
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:19,103
...if the electricity
can't come to your radio...

818
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:21,710
...you can take your radio
to the electricity.

819
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:23,513
What are you talking about?

820
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:25,154
Electricity.

821
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:30,830
See? Only certain streets
are affected.

822
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,827
We could bring the radio here.

823
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:34,514
Bring the radio here?

824
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,024
Oh, it's a great idea.

825
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:38,584
It's the best idea
I ever heard in my life.

826
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,746
What a wonderf ul idea.
Bring it here.

827
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:43,503
Absolutely. Put up a big sign
in Polish and German...

828
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:46,223
...so everyone will know
there's a radio in my shop.

829
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:50,229
I could charge admission with low
prices for the Gestapo and soldiers.

830
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:52,670
Put up loudspeakers.
I could sell ref reshments.

831
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:54,906
What about dances
between news reports?

832
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:57,749
I'll shave the Luftwaffe
before they hang me.

833
00:57:57,995 --> 00:57:59,747
I'll tell you why it won't work.

834
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:01,553
I know Jakob better than anyone.

835
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:04,554
He won't give you the dirt
f rom under his fingernails...

836
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:07,633
...let alone lend you
his precious radio.

837
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:09,310
You're saying I'm cheap?

838
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:13,946
What else do you call a man who's got
f ree shaves daily for 4 years...

839
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:17,585
...without giving so much as a sniff
of a pancake in return?

840
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:20,389
I thought you were my f riend.

841
00:58:20,635 --> 00:58:22,830
Friends can say these things
about each other.

842
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,033
So shall we go and fetch it?

843
00:58:27,075 --> 00:58:29,794
-What if the Germans see us with it?
-What if they damage it?

844
00:58:30,035 --> 00:58:31,673
It's a shame there're
no children left.

845
00:58:31,915 --> 00:58:33,553
We could've put it
in a child's coffin.

846
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:36,827
The Germans don't pay much attention
to dead children.

847
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:40,751
-Let's go.
-No. We can't.

848
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,553
-Why?
-It'd never work.

849
00:58:42,835 --> 00:58:44,826
No, he'll never let you do it.

850
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:46,986
He'll say it costs
too much in electricity.

851
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,947
-You're saying I'm cheap?
-You're not?

852
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:50,310
-I'm cheap?
-You are.

853
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:52,547
-You're cheap!
-You're cheaper!

854
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:54,951
You're supposed to have
a pancake for a shave.

855
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:58,028
But you don't have one.
You eat five pancakes every morning.

856
00:58:58,275 --> 00:59:00,152
You stuff your face
until you can't get up!

857
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:03,785
Bring the damn radio!
I'll show you how cheap I am!

858
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:06,508
No, you're not that cheap!

859
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:07,631
Now that's a mensch.

860
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,831
And a meshuggenah!
Kowalsky, wait!

861
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:15,507
I didn't mean it.
You're not cheap.

862
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:24,547
What are you waiting for?
Go!

863
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:33,031
Can't do it.

864
00:59:33,995 --> 00:59:35,064
Why not?

865
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:36,824
My nerves.

866
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:38,508
I'm a coward.

867
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:40,945
You get to know these things
about yourself.

868
00:59:41,395 --> 00:59:45,274
Some people look inside, they find
things nobody ever knew were there.

869
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:47,989
Like Jakob.

870
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:51,473
Then there's the rest of us.

871
00:59:54,835 --> 00:59:57,395
You can't force a man
to risk his life.

872
00:59:57,715 --> 01:00:00,434
I'll keep it at my place.
The power will come back.

873
01:00:00,715 --> 01:00:03,309
And by then, the news
will be even better, won't it?

874
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:05,464
Like cheese.

875
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:08,907
Kowalsky, you need a partner?

876
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:39,510
Take off your hats!

877
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:45,071
Hardtloff...

878
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:47,148
..."The Liquidator."

879
01:00:48,195 --> 01:00:50,026
What's he doing here?

880
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:51,908
What do you think?

881
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,187
Looks like it's time
to pack our bags.

882
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:59,114
What does our prophet
have to say about this?

883
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:14,868
What's the prognosis, doctor?

884
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:18,027
Supraventricular tachycardia.
Could be.

885
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,470
-Good. Sounds serious.
-It is serious.

886
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:22,592
How long can you live with that?

887
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:26,226
How long can we live with him?
That's the question.

888
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:45,509
Feeling better?

889
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:47,987
Tonight is Shabbat.

890
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:49,390
Great.

891
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,506
We'll fast like every other night.

892
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:54,905
You're not a very good Jew, are you?

893
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:57,392
Hannah used to light the candles.

894
01:01:57,635 --> 01:01:59,114
Don't you believe?

895
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:02,275
I believe we are the chosen people...

896
01:02:02,515 --> 01:02:05,951
...but I wish the Almighty
had chosen somebody else.

897
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,027
But you're still a Jew,
aren't you?

898
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,509
In the eyes of the Gestapo...

899
01:02:15,755 --> 01:02:17,985
...I'm the biggest yid
they've ever seen.

900
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,030
The light!

901
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:25,073
No miracles for part-time Jews, huh?

902
01:02:25,995 --> 01:02:28,270
You remember what you promised,
don't you?

903
01:02:30,275 --> 01:02:31,390
I remember.

904
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:33,591
I got better since then.

905
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:37,670
Now you want to listen to the radio.
Well, you can't.

906
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:38,745
Why?

907
01:02:38,995 --> 01:02:40,474
-I got rid of it.
-Why?

908
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,943
-I gave it to Mischa.
-Why?

909
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:44,470
What "why, why?" Always "why?"

910
01:02:45,435 --> 01:02:47,312
He was driving me crazy.

911
01:02:48,635 --> 01:02:50,546
-Gestapo! Open the door!
-Under the bed.

912
01:02:50,795 --> 01:02:52,626
It's not too clever,
hiding under a bed.

913
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,513
This is not a discussion!

914
01:03:05,475 --> 01:03:06,464
You!

915
01:03:06,755 --> 01:03:09,394
If the Germans only knew
the trouble they're going through...

916
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:11,512
...just to get
your radio working again.

917
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:12,870
It's f unny, isn't it?

918
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:15,629
May you die laughing.
What do you want?

919
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,866
I want to listen to the radio.

920
01:03:18,115 --> 01:03:21,710
I have to know what's taking so long.
I have to make my wedding plans.

921
01:03:22,035 --> 01:03:23,150
That's quite impossible.

922
01:03:23,395 --> 01:03:24,271
Why is it impossible?

923
01:03:24,515 --> 01:03:26,187
"Why, why?" Everybody's "why?"

924
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,984
It's not even your radio anymore.
It belongs to everyone now!

925
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:38,031
You're waiting for someone?

926
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:41,749
Who is it? Tell me.

927
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:43,553
And then you'll tell everyone else.

928
01:03:43,795 --> 01:03:45,945
Soon the Gestapo's
knocking on the door for real.

929
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,713
You're hiding someone?

930
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:54,310
Yes. Why couldn't you think
this quick in the ring?

931
01:03:54,555 --> 01:03:55,704
Someone important?

932
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:57,946
Very important.

933
01:03:58,355 --> 01:04:00,471
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
Right now...

934
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:02,831
...we need our privacy.

935
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:06,029
To think that of all people...

936
01:04:06,355 --> 01:04:08,869
...my old manager, Jakob Heym.

937
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:15,904
Schmuck!

938
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:18,273
Mischa needs the radio.

939
01:04:20,115 --> 01:04:22,549
All right. I lied.

940
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:24,788
I lied...

941
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:28,472
...because it's a sin to listen
to a radio on Shabbat.

942
01:04:28,715 --> 01:04:30,706
But you don't observe Shabbat.

943
01:04:32,195 --> 01:04:33,628
Where does it lead?

944
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:35,024
The radio.

945
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:37,391
But you must do everything I say.
Promise?

946
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:38,750
Promise.

947
01:04:42,275 --> 01:04:43,390
This is your restaurant?

948
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:46,069
It was more of a cafe.

949
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,148
You sit here.

950
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:56,626
And don't move.
If you move, the radio won't work.

951
01:04:57,835 --> 01:05:00,827
I'll turn it on, and we both
are going to listen to it.

952
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:04,988
But if I see you get up,
the radio goes right off.

953
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,274
Now I turn it on.

954
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:13,106
It takes a moment
for the tubes to heat up.

955
01:05:13,355 --> 01:05:16,153
Once they are warmed up,
you'll hear talking.

956
01:05:16,395 --> 01:05:17,987
So it's heating up now.

957
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:28,834
We don't want him.

958
01:05:30,595 --> 01:05:32,870
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

959
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,425
This is the BBC in London.

960
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:38,229
Tonight we have a special guest...

961
01:05:38,475 --> 01:05:41,785
...the Prime Minister of Greater
Britain, the very Honourable...

962
01:05:42,035 --> 01:05:43,832
...Winston Churchill...

963
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:48,711
...who is just now coming into
the studio, putting out his cigar.

964
01:05:50,435 --> 01:05:53,632
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

965
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,309
...and everybody in Poland.

966
01:05:56,595 --> 01:06:00,508
-He likes the Polish, doesn't he?
-Of course. We're his allies.

967
01:06:02,115 --> 01:06:04,913
Mr. Churchill, if we only
have a little bit of time...

968
01:06:05,155 --> 01:06:08,989
...I would like you to update us
on the events around Bezanika.

969
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:11,904
I'd be delighted.

970
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:14,431
That is my area of exper--

971
01:06:22,475 --> 01:06:24,272
Gesundheit, Mr. Churchill!

972
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:26,794
Ex cuse me.

973
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:30,385
The cigar smoke gets up one's nose.

974
01:06:31,395 --> 01:06:32,384
Where was I?

975
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:34,148
Bezanika, in Poland.

976
01:06:34,395 --> 01:06:37,546
I know where Bezanika is.
I'm not stupid.

977
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,912
And I was on the phone
with Mr. Stalin...

978
01:06:42,195 --> 01:06:45,392
...who told me his troops
were doing wonderf ully.

979
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,229
Is that not so, Mr. Stalin?

980
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:50,145
Da!

981
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:51,914
Does that mean it's nearly over?

982
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,988
That's a very good question.

983
01:06:54,235 --> 01:06:55,031
He heard me!

984
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:58,345
We remind listeners
not to ask questions...

985
01:06:58,555 --> 01:07:00,147
...as that interferes with reception.

986
01:07:00,435 --> 01:07:02,266
And please don't look at the radio!

987
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:05,627
But it's still
a very good question.

988
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:09,390
And the answer is yes!

989
01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:12,554
The whole megillah
will soon be over...

990
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:16,344
...and that schmendrick Hitler
will be gone!

991
01:07:16,595 --> 01:07:19,234
And that brings to an end
our special bulletin for Poland.

992
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:23,429
We remind young listeners to brush
their teeth before going to bed.

993
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:25,830
I turned it off now.

994
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,064
What about music?

995
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:28,545
Music?

996
01:07:29,835 --> 01:07:30,904
Turn around.

997
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:32,270
Music.

998
01:07:53,275 --> 01:07:55,948
Now, in memory of peacetime...

999
01:07:56,195 --> 01:07:58,789
...which will soon be with us again...

1000
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,273
...a little dance music.

1001
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:07,153
From the Grand Ballroom in London,
an evening concert.

1002
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:12,910
May I have this dance,
mademoiselle?

1003
01:08:14,555 --> 01:08:15,908
Do you know how to polka?

1004
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:19,310
I'll teach you. Stand on my feet.

1005
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:29,074
Here you go!

1006
01:08:45,315 --> 01:08:46,907
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1007
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:49,344
What's the latest?

1008
01:08:49,595 --> 01:08:50,869
He's not up yet.

1009
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:53,390
Good morning.

1010
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,113
But I have some good news.

1011
01:09:00,355 --> 01:09:03,586
I saw him yesterday.
He's hiding a parachutist f rom London.

1012
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,427
A parachutist?

1013
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,911
Now they have parachutists.

1014
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:11,272
How do I beat that? Flying tanks?

1015
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:13,506
They need news,
but I have no new ideas.

1016
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:16,747
What can I invent now, Hannah?
Submarines?

1017
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,583
The latest.
Ask anybody else!

1018
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:29,066
I'm the only one in this whole ghetto
who's got no news, Hannah.

1019
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:43,627
Are you gonna work today,
or is this a one-man strike?

1020
01:09:47,235 --> 01:09:50,272
-Come on! What are you doing?
-I have to go!

1021
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:52,314
Dysentery.

1022
01:09:54,635 --> 01:09:56,705
Are you out of your mind?

1023
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:00,948
You're gonna commit suicide.
That's a German toilet!

1024
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:02,310
Can't wait.

1025
01:10:03,915 --> 01:10:05,792
You're gonna get shot,
you crazy bastard.

1026
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:33,030
" Massive traffic in Munich."

1027
01:10:35,395 --> 01:10:37,704
" Miracle cure for haemorrhoids."
Shit!

1028
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:41,594
"Sunny with occasional showers
in Berlin."

1029
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,225
" Heidi, I miss you. Franz."

1030
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:48,871
" In memoriam. In memoriam."

1031
01:10:50,035 --> 01:10:52,185
" In memoriam. In memoriam."

1032
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:55,552
" Loyal son of the Fatherland."
" Dear Nazis."

1033
01:10:57,155 --> 01:10:58,110
News!

1034
01:10:59,475 --> 01:11:02,228
"The Luftwaffe Reserves
beat the Kriegsmarine...

1035
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,864
...3-2 in a hard-fought
but fair game."

1036
01:11:05,835 --> 01:11:09,305
Thank you.
The Jews will rejoice at this news.

1037
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,748
God, a miracle, please.

1038
01:11:51,035 --> 01:11:51,945
All right.

1039
01:11:54,955 --> 01:11:59,551
Your father cleans up after horses

1040
01:12:01,635 --> 01:12:04,991
Listen to me closely
I'll explain

1041
01:12:05,995 --> 01:12:08,509
Your mama sleeps nights in the park

1042
01:12:10,275 --> 01:12:12,311
You father's doing time in prison

1043
01:12:12,555 --> 01:12:14,864
Your sister sleeps with a chazzer

1044
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:17,953
Your sister sleeps with a chazzer

1045
01:12:25,315 --> 01:12:27,146
No, get off, please!

1046
01:12:33,155 --> 01:12:34,713
Kowalsky, are you out of your mind?

1047
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:36,104
Are you all right?

1048
01:12:36,515 --> 01:12:38,585
What does it matter, now that you...

1049
01:12:38,835 --> 01:12:42,510
...the illustrious pancake vendor,
get to crap like a king?

1050
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:46,344
So now that you've shared
a toilet seat with the master race...

1051
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,314
...maybe you'll feel good enough
to tell us the news.

1052
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:57,070
Yesterday, Churchill
addressed the Polish people.

1053
01:12:57,315 --> 01:12:58,191
In Polish?

1054
01:12:58,435 --> 01:13:00,471
You want the latest news
or don't you?

1055
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:02,433
Our apologies.

1056
01:13:03,635 --> 01:13:05,193
The main item...

1057
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,345
...was that
the Luftwaffe soccer team...

1058
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,625
...beat the Kriegsmarine
by 3 goals to 2.

1059
01:13:14,915 --> 01:13:15,711
That's it?

1060
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:17,873
Want the latest news?
That's it.

1061
01:13:18,115 --> 01:13:21,824
Churchill is on the BBC giving out
German army sports results?

1062
01:13:22,715 --> 01:13:24,068
Nothing about a f ront line?

1063
01:13:28,035 --> 01:13:31,027
If Churchill has nothing
more important to announce...

1064
01:13:31,235 --> 01:13:34,227
...it means to me
the war is pretty much over.

1065
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,144
That's right.

1066
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:39,072
What if 3 to 2 is a code?

1067
01:13:40,635 --> 01:13:43,707
Could mean the Russians outnumber
the Germans 3 to 2.

1068
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:46,628
Or maybe they are 32 kilometres away.

1069
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,706
I don't think so.

1070
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:53,471
I think it means that maybe
they are, I think, 32 hours away.

1071
01:13:54,115 --> 01:13:57,391
If we listen hard enough,
maybe we can hear their artillery.

1072
01:13:57,635 --> 01:14:00,945
Yes, that's what the noise
was last night.

1073
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:03,911
My wife thought it was
the heating pipes...

1074
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,350
...but there hasn't been
any steam for years.

1075
01:14:06,595 --> 01:14:09,268
-I heard it too.
-You heard it too?

1076
01:14:09,595 --> 01:14:11,426
Yes, I heard it too.

1077
01:14:12,075 --> 01:14:13,747
"E t tu, Brute?"

1078
01:14:19,715 --> 01:14:20,989
I think it's time to organize.

1079
01:14:37,155 --> 01:14:40,989
Professor, did you hear this A vron?
He plans to organize.

1080
01:14:41,235 --> 01:14:43,146
Well, maybe he's right.

1081
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:47,468
Maybe we can save a few lives if
we have an organization and a leader.

1082
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:48,870
For God's sake!

1083
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:52,630
The Russians may be pushed
all the way back to Siberia by now.

1084
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:57,749
Hardtloff is here.
We know what that means.

1085
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:02,508
What? You're going to fight
the Germans barehanded?

1086
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:04,871
And what do you suggest we do?

1087
01:15:06,195 --> 01:15:07,594
Just sit down and wait?

1088
01:15:07,835 --> 01:15:11,623
Hope is all very well, but sometimes
it takes a little action too.

1089
01:15:11,915 --> 01:15:13,234
You will understand this.

1090
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:14,544
It'll be a massacre.

1091
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:17,394
All because these Jews believe
the dreck I feed them.

1092
01:15:17,635 --> 01:15:19,148
But you started this.

1093
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:24,185
And now you have to go on. Let's only
hope that your lies were true.

1094
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:32,190
Let's hope that.

1095
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:42,591
What is it?

1096
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,149
You know what it is.

1097
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:53,827
Forgive me, but Jakob,
he's right.

1098
01:15:58,195 --> 01:15:59,184
And I am wrong?

1099
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,827
And you are wrong.

1100
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:13,871
You smelled the cooking,
Mr. Frankf urter. Come in.

1101
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:17,305
-Mr. Frankf urter!
-Papa!

1102
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:19,274
I'm happy you still remember.

1103
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,024
How's Mama?

1104
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:24,785
You know how mothers are.
She hasn't seen you in a few days.

1105
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:27,507
So I said to myself :

1106
01:16:27,795 --> 01:16:31,151
"Today is Sunday. I'll see our
daughter and bring her her things.

1107
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:33,863
And that way,
if they come to take us away...

1108
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:36,031
...she'll still have her trousseau."

1109
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:40,430
It's beautif ul.

1110
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:42,228
But is it what we need right now?

1111
01:16:42,475 --> 01:16:43,988
I know what you need right now.

1112
01:16:44,235 --> 01:16:46,954
I played Sherlock Holmes
in The Hound of the Baskervilles.

1113
01:16:47,195 --> 01:16:49,834
I always insisted on authentic props.

1114
01:16:57,635 --> 01:17:00,786
Young man, I realized I care...

1115
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:03,595
...about more people
than my immediate family.

1116
01:17:04,075 --> 01:17:06,987
Perhaps I'm wrong and
your f riend Jakob is right.

1117
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:09,714
While I'm baring my soul...

1118
01:17:09,955 --> 01:17:13,231
...I must tell you that I did not play
King Lear three times.

1119
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:16,990
I played it once,
and I forgot half my lines.

1120
01:17:22,915 --> 01:17:25,509
Try not to get killed
before you marry my daughter.

1121
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,343
And remember, until
the last line has been spoken--

1122
01:17:30,595 --> 01:17:32,870
The curtain cannot come down.

1123
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:38,832
Well, gentlemen,
I think the person we need...

1124
01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:43,227
...has to have physical
as well as moral courage.

1125
01:17:43,675 --> 01:17:47,953
He has to be a man who's proved
that he is willing to take risks.

1126
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:51,193
And I think
he should also be a man...

1127
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,230
...who's brought hope...

1128
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:58,989
...hope and dignity to the ghetto.

1129
01:17:59,515 --> 01:18:00,391
Thank you, Esther.

1130
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:02,830
Sounds like the professor to me.

1131
01:18:03,515 --> 01:18:04,470
We will see.

1132
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:07,108
"Jakob Heym."

1133
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:09,713
You see? "Jakob Heym."

1134
01:18:14,955 --> 01:18:15,751
" Blumenthal!"

1135
01:18:17,955 --> 01:18:18,785
Thanks.

1136
01:18:21,115 --> 01:18:22,787
"Jakob Heym."

1137
01:18:24,275 --> 01:18:26,345
-" Professor Kirschbaum."
-You see?

1138
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:27,994
"Jakob Heym."

1139
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:35,824
Congratulations!

1140
01:18:36,955 --> 01:18:39,423
A little apricot liqueur.

1141
01:18:39,955 --> 01:18:42,833
I was saving it
for a special occasion.

1142
01:18:48,835 --> 01:18:51,429
Gentlemen! Jakob Heym.

1143
01:18:51,675 --> 01:18:52,869
-To victory.
-To victory.

1144
01:18:56,435 --> 01:18:57,788
I get the door.

1145
01:18:58,915 --> 01:19:00,826
Gestapo! Open the door!

1146
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,952
Why are you running?
It's Mischa.

1147
01:19:04,315 --> 01:19:05,748
Good joke.

1148
01:19:06,035 --> 01:19:07,354
Very good joke.

1149
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:09,874
I know, I know.

1150
01:19:10,315 --> 01:19:12,067
I'm not invited.

1151
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:15,347
But I have something...

1152
01:19:16,275 --> 01:19:17,913
...I think you will find interesting.

1153
01:19:18,155 --> 01:19:19,907
My God.
Where did you get that?

1154
01:19:20,315 --> 01:19:22,954
You have a radio, I have a gun.

1155
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:25,548
German steel.

1156
01:19:26,035 --> 01:19:27,753
We can count on them for something.

1157
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,624
Now that you're the leader,
what's our next move?

1158
01:19:34,515 --> 01:19:35,834
We have to wait for the signal.

1159
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:37,863
The signal?

1160
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:40,786
And then we start the insurrection.

1161
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:42,390
The BBC said so.

1162
01:19:42,635 --> 01:19:43,590
What's the signal?

1163
01:19:44,235 --> 01:19:45,554
Something very special, like:

1164
01:19:45,795 --> 01:19:48,389
"The chicken is in the pot"
or "The baby is singing."

1165
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:50,148
But our signal is top secret.

1166
01:19:50,395 --> 01:19:52,545
I'm not at liberty to tell you
at this time.

1167
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:57,272
Further evidence that you are in
the best position to lead us, Jakob.

1168
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:03,913
But if I'm your leader,
I will only do it on one condition:

1169
01:20:04,755 --> 01:20:06,552
You must be disciplined.

1170
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:09,111
All of you.

1171
01:20:14,035 --> 01:20:18,347
Now we only have a little time left.
Right, professor?

1172
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:23,466
And in that time, if anybody,
anybody does anything stupid...

1173
01:20:23,835 --> 01:20:25,587
...you have to answer to me.

1174
01:20:27,675 --> 01:20:28,869
Open up! Gestapo!

1175
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,104
That's not Mischa.

1176
01:20:30,515 --> 01:20:31,504
Open the door!

1177
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:38,547
Open the door!

1178
01:20:40,275 --> 01:20:42,027
Does the Jew Kirschbaum live here?

1179
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:44,465
Professor Kirschbaum lives here.

1180
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:46,023
Do you have an appointment?

1181
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:49,074
-We don't need one.
-Tell the professor this is urgent.

1182
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:50,225
Wait here.

1183
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,989
I shall tell him you are here.

1184
01:20:57,755 --> 01:20:59,029
Come in.

1185
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:04,705
Take a seat, please.

1186
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:08,903
We have some visitors.

1187
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:11,748
Andre, dear.

1188
01:21:12,755 --> 01:21:15,030
Some gentlemen to see you.

1189
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:25,508
Best luck, Jakob.

1190
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:36,704
Shalom.

1191
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:48,865
There's only two.

1192
01:21:49,315 --> 01:21:51,112
-That's two too many.
-Give me the gun.

1193
01:21:51,475 --> 01:21:52,464
It's my gun.

1194
01:21:52,835 --> 01:21:54,268
I am the leader.

1195
01:21:54,515 --> 01:21:55,834
Gentlemen...

1196
01:21:56,275 --> 01:21:57,754
...what can I do for you?

1197
01:21:58,115 --> 01:22:01,232
Please get your bag.
General Hardtloff has had a seizure.

1198
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:04,194
That's the first good news
I ever got f rom a German.

1199
01:22:04,515 --> 01:22:05,994
Hardtloff?

1200
01:22:08,515 --> 01:22:11,029
He's not my patient.
I presume he has his own doctor.

1201
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:13,106
Are you ref using?

1202
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:15,309
I'll get your bag.

1203
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:17,833
Thank you, Esther.

1204
01:22:27,915 --> 01:22:32,272
I put in the other pills,
the ones for your heartburn.

1205
01:22:34,435 --> 01:22:36,153
With a little luck...

1206
01:22:37,515 --> 01:22:38,664
...you will not need them.

1207
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:42,189
Unfortunately, I think I will.

1208
01:22:48,515 --> 01:22:49,550
Thank you...

1209
01:22:50,395 --> 01:22:51,305
...Esther.

1210
01:23:22,075 --> 01:23:23,588
He'll be back.

1211
01:23:45,915 --> 01:23:47,826
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1212
01:23:48,075 --> 01:23:50,430
It's a nice place.
It's a very nice place.

1213
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:51,949
Come. Come on! Go!

1214
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:54,984
-Sorry.
-Idiot!

1215
01:23:55,555 --> 01:23:59,309
It's a great honour to meet you.
I attended all your Berlin lectures.

1216
01:23:59,555 --> 01:24:02,023
Berlin?
The good old days, yes.

1217
01:24:02,275 --> 01:24:03,469
Please sit.

1218
01:24:03,995 --> 01:24:05,110
Over here.

1219
01:24:05,355 --> 01:24:07,107
It seems that this little town...

1220
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:10,347
...is home to one of the greatest
cardiologists in the world.

1221
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:13,553
I had the honour
of teaching in Berlin.

1222
01:24:13,835 --> 01:24:16,110
And now I'm a professor...

1223
01:24:16,595 --> 01:24:19,746
...of latrine cleaning
in the f reight yard here.

1224
01:24:19,995 --> 01:24:21,474
I see.

1225
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:23,390
Well...

1226
01:24:24,075 --> 01:24:27,067
...the ghetto is
going to be emptied tomorrow.

1227
01:24:27,475 --> 01:24:29,352
I can see to it...

1228
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:31,313
...you are not on the transport.

1229
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:33,343
Why so generous?

1230
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:36,393
I am surrounded by incompetents.

1231
01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:39,593
These doctors are
unable to do anything for me...

1232
01:24:39,835 --> 01:24:42,986
...and the pain is unbearable.

1233
01:24:44,675 --> 01:24:46,427
Open the jacket, please.

1234
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:47,983
Let me see.

1235
01:24:51,075 --> 01:24:53,191
I know this sound, sir.

1236
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,667
I have a similar condition.
It's pretty painf ul, isn't it?

1237
01:24:58,035 --> 01:25:01,391
But only here,
I have a little problem.

1238
01:25:01,995 --> 01:25:05,465
On the one hand, as a physician,
I'm obliged to help you.

1239
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:09,067
On the other hand,
if I save your life...

1240
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:12,312
...you'll liquidate the ghetto.

1241
01:25:14,035 --> 01:25:16,549
And if you do not...

1242
01:25:16,955 --> 01:25:19,071
...my men will liquidate you.

1243
01:25:21,475 --> 01:25:25,673
This is the radio of the German
Armed Forces Network. Heil, Hitler!

1244
01:25:26,275 --> 01:25:28,914
We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.

1245
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:31,623
Our troops are engaged
in the Battle of Normandy.

1246
01:25:31,995 --> 01:25:33,348
News....

1247
01:25:36,275 --> 01:25:37,071
Sorry.

1248
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:41,191
Perhaps you would like to hear
how the war is going.

1249
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:45,950
But, of course, you have
your own sources of information.

1250
01:25:46,195 --> 01:25:47,674
Your own radio.

1251
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:51,551
-In the ghetto?
-You think we are stupid?

1252
01:25:52,075 --> 01:25:54,270
We have informers.

1253
01:25:55,115 --> 01:25:58,903
I know you listen to the BBC,
that you're dreaming about resistance.

1254
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:04,065
Why don't you give me the name
of the criminal who owns the radio?

1255
01:26:04,515 --> 01:26:07,234
I'll save you. What do you say?

1256
01:26:08,995 --> 01:26:12,829
It's a hard decision to make, yes.
It's a hard decision.

1257
01:26:18,355 --> 01:26:19,868
May I have a glass of water?

1258
01:26:20,115 --> 01:26:22,913
If it helps you
to make up your mind, why not?

1259
01:26:23,155 --> 01:26:24,429
Water.

1260
01:26:27,915 --> 01:26:29,109
Thank you.

1261
01:26:35,595 --> 01:26:36,391
Ex cuse me.

1262
01:26:37,515 --> 01:26:39,585
Ex cuse me, sir,
but I....

1263
01:26:47,155 --> 01:26:47,951
Poison!

1264
01:26:48,155 --> 01:26:49,349
It was poison!

1265
01:26:49,595 --> 01:26:52,553
You bastard yid!
I forbid you to die!

1266
01:26:53,115 --> 01:26:54,787
You really shouldn't get ex cited.

1267
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:57,026
Take my advice.

1268
01:26:57,275 --> 01:27:01,109
You know, I am
a world-famous cardiologist.

1269
01:27:03,235 --> 01:27:05,669
World-famous cardiologist....

1270
01:27:13,315 --> 01:27:14,589
I'm a famous...

1271
01:27:14,955 --> 01:27:16,274
...cardiologist.

1272
01:27:16,955 --> 01:27:17,751
Esther.

1273
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:21,471
Professor! Professor!

1274
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:22,951
Stop. He's dead.

1275
01:27:23,195 --> 01:27:24,344
Rise.

1276
01:27:26,915 --> 01:27:30,225
You let this dirty yid defy me!

1277
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:31,945
But, Herr General--

1278
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:35,187
I want to see this radio here
tomorrow morning!

1279
01:27:35,715 --> 01:27:36,625
Go!

1280
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:37,671
Heil, Hitler.

1281
01:27:53,275 --> 01:27:54,264
Halt!

1282
01:28:24,075 --> 01:28:27,112
A criminal terrorist
is hiding a radio...

1283
01:28:27,395 --> 01:28:30,228
...in the ghetto,
in defiance of regulations.

1284
01:28:30,595 --> 01:28:34,508
Unless the man responsible
brings himself and the accomplices...

1285
01:28:34,755 --> 01:28:37,189
... to the Kommandantur by midnight...

1286
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:41,110
... 10 hostages
will be shot in reprisal.

1287
01:28:44,915 --> 01:28:46,792
A criminal terrorist...

1288
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:49,913
...is hiding a radio
in the ghetto...

1289
01:28:50,195 --> 01:28:51,992
...in defiance of regulations.

1290
01:28:52,235 --> 01:28:55,625
Unless the man responsible
brings himself...

1291
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,547
...and his accomplices...

1292
01:28:57,795 --> 01:29:00,263
... to the Kommandantur
by midnight...

1293
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:05,225
... 10 hostages
will be shot in reprisal.

1294
01:29:14,955 --> 01:29:16,627
Are you there?

1295
01:29:22,755 --> 01:29:23,551
What do you want?

1296
01:29:23,795 --> 01:29:26,025
Is that a way to greet a visitor?

1297
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:27,105
Sorry.

1298
01:29:27,355 --> 01:29:30,313
Should I go to the basement,
fetch a bottle of champagne?

1299
01:29:30,555 --> 01:29:33,274
No wonder you never had any customers.

1300
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:36,789
So I wanted to tell you
about that green stuff.

1301
01:29:37,075 --> 01:29:39,543
Never worked for Stamtisch...

1302
01:29:41,035 --> 01:29:44,186
...didn't work for me
and it won't work for you.

1303
01:29:48,075 --> 01:29:51,863
The last cigarette before you tell me
to turn myself in.

1304
01:29:52,115 --> 01:29:54,629
No, that's between
you and Him up there...

1305
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:56,268
...if He is up there.

1306
01:29:56,515 --> 01:29:57,743
No, actually...

1307
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:00,664
...I wanted to ask you
about the signal.

1308
01:30:02,915 --> 01:30:07,067
I was wondering if that signal
must have come by now.

1309
01:30:09,675 --> 01:30:12,508
At least any minute now.
What do you think?

1310
01:30:22,395 --> 01:30:23,510
What?

1311
01:30:26,595 --> 01:30:30,224
For what I'm about to say,
I'd rather be in the dark.

1312
01:30:33,835 --> 01:30:35,587
I don't have a radio.

1313
01:30:36,915 --> 01:30:38,587
I've never had one.

1314
01:30:39,915 --> 01:30:43,828
And if I did, I wouldn't have had
the guts to listen to it.

1315
01:30:44,115 --> 01:30:46,106
So how did you know
where the Russians were?

1316
01:30:46,395 --> 01:30:48,545
-I made it up. Most of it.
-I don't think so.

1317
01:30:48,795 --> 01:30:50,547
I don't think you can make that up.

1318
01:30:50,795 --> 01:30:55,027
The battle for Rudna, and for
the tanks, the Luftwaffe, Churchill--

1319
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:57,584
The jazz band. All of that.

1320
01:30:57,835 --> 01:31:00,747
Actually, the soccer score
was genuine...

1321
01:31:00,995 --> 01:31:03,225
...thanks to your dancing that day.

1322
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:08,550
And Bezanika, I really did hear
that in the Kommandantur.

1323
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,345
But as for the rest of it...

1324
01:31:11,915 --> 01:31:13,143
...it's lies...

1325
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,591
...all lies.

1326
01:31:16,675 --> 01:31:19,143
Sometimes I amazed myself.

1327
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:22,313
But it's lies...

1328
01:31:23,475 --> 01:31:25,306
...and wishf ul thinking.

1329
01:31:36,995 --> 01:31:37,950
You're telling the truth.

1330
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:39,390
Finally.

1331
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,103
Go ahead.

1332
01:31:45,795 --> 01:31:47,831
Tell me how much you hate me.

1333
01:32:00,635 --> 01:32:03,707
That was our dear f riends,
the Germans...

1334
01:32:03,995 --> 01:32:05,474
...and half the German army...

1335
01:32:05,795 --> 01:32:08,025
...they were tearing
the ghetto apart...

1336
01:32:11,675 --> 01:32:14,143
...for a radio
that doesn't even exist?

1337
01:32:21,395 --> 01:32:22,794
Don't tell Mischa.
It'll kill him.

1338
01:32:42,915 --> 01:32:44,553
You're not sleeping.

1339
01:32:46,595 --> 01:32:48,870
You shouldn't
ruin your eyes like that.

1340
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:52,505
I'm not going to see
my parents again, am I?

1341
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:55,984
The Russians aren't coming, are they?

1342
01:32:56,315 --> 01:32:57,794
Yes, they are.

1343
01:32:58,155 --> 01:32:59,383
A whole battalion of them.

1344
01:32:59,675 --> 01:33:03,350
Straight f rom Moscow,
with tanks and a big band.

1345
01:33:03,595 --> 01:33:05,586
Is that another lie?

1346
01:33:07,075 --> 01:33:08,986
Why should I believe you?

1347
01:33:09,915 --> 01:33:12,475
Would I lie to you
about something like that?

1348
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,744
I heard you talking
to your f riend.

1349
01:33:17,795 --> 01:33:20,025
But I understand why you did it.

1350
01:33:21,155 --> 01:33:22,634
You wanted to be...

1351
01:33:23,195 --> 01:33:23,991
...to be good.

1352
01:33:29,035 --> 01:33:30,787
That's f rom Hannah.

1353
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:34,665
She told me she wishes
we had a little girl like you.

1354
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:37,313
Where are you going?

1355
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:40,189
I have something I have to do,
and you should sleep.

1356
01:33:40,635 --> 01:33:41,909
Why?

1357
01:33:43,515 --> 01:33:46,473
Questions, always questions.

1358
01:33:47,595 --> 01:33:49,267
I have to give the Germans my radio.

1359
01:33:49,515 --> 01:33:51,665
But you don't have a radio.

1360
01:33:51,915 --> 01:33:53,746
That's a problem, isn't it?

1361
01:33:54,115 --> 01:33:56,390
You know, maybe I'll go
and explain it...

1362
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:59,149
...all to my good f riend
in the Gestapo...

1363
01:33:59,435 --> 01:34:01,391
...and he'll see
the f unny side of it...

1364
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:03,865
...and we'll have
a good laugh about it.

1365
01:34:09,835 --> 01:34:11,712
That one's f rom me, maidelah.

1366
01:34:18,795 --> 01:34:20,228
Be caref ul.

1367
01:34:22,915 --> 01:34:25,952
Mischa, open the door.
It's me, Jakob.

1368
01:34:27,235 --> 01:34:28,111
Has the signal come?

1369
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:30,869
Not yet, but I need your services.

1370
01:34:31,155 --> 01:34:33,874
-Are we rescuing the hostages?
-That's being taken care of.

1371
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:36,504
But your mission
is to go to my attic.

1372
01:34:36,835 --> 01:34:37,790
I'll get my clothes.

1373
01:34:38,115 --> 01:34:39,150
Not now.

1374
01:34:39,395 --> 01:34:41,829
Tomorrow, if I don't show up
at work...

1375
01:34:42,075 --> 01:34:44,589
...you must go to my place
under the cover of darkness...

1376
01:34:44,835 --> 01:34:47,952
...and transfer here something special
I left for you to take care of.

1377
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,111
The radio?

1378
01:34:49,515 --> 01:34:50,948
Something special.

1379
01:34:51,195 --> 01:34:53,186
-I understand.
-Good.

1380
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:55,188
Where's my gun?

1381
01:34:55,515 --> 01:34:57,631
This mission does not require a gun.

1382
01:34:57,995 --> 01:35:00,714
It requires a good brain
and a strong heart.

1383
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,828
So I chose you, our best man.

1384
01:35:06,355 --> 01:35:07,231
Mazel tov.

1385
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:11,673
Goodbye, my f riend.

1386
01:35:17,915 --> 01:35:19,906
Dear Jakob.*

1387
01:35:20,675 --> 01:35:25,032
You'll probably hold yourself
responsible for my death...

1388
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:26,754
...and if you look at it one way...

1389
01:35:27,035 --> 01:35:28,388
...you'd be right.

1390
01:35:28,635 --> 01:35:31,672
But when you look at it
a different way...

1391
01:35:32,475 --> 01:35:34,750
...your imaginary radio
gave me a reason...

1392
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:38,550
... to keep going
for a few more days, anyway.

1393
01:35:39,755 --> 01:35:43,634
Much as I'd like to,
I don't hold anything against you.

1394
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:46,514
With a bit of luck,
you'll find some other schmuck...

1395
01:35:46,755 --> 01:35:49,064
... to shave you for free.

1396
01:35:50,115 --> 01:35:54,745
Until I see you again,
I remain your best customer...

1397
01:35:55,435 --> 01:35:56,993
...Kowalsky.

1398
01:35:57,515 --> 01:35:59,233
Shalom, chazzer!

1399
01:36:01,835 --> 01:36:04,030
Remember me? The smart Jew?

1400
01:36:04,315 --> 01:36:06,431
Why are you out after curfew?

1401
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:08,108
It's about my radio.

1402
01:36:08,675 --> 01:36:11,553
I must see the officer on duty.
I wish to give myself up.

1403
01:36:11,795 --> 01:36:14,468
Maybe you're not such a smart Jew.

1404
01:36:14,915 --> 01:36:16,314
Keep going.

1405
01:36:16,635 --> 01:36:17,988
I know the way.

1406
01:36:29,155 --> 01:36:30,429
It's in here.

1407
01:36:46,995 --> 01:36:47,950
So...

1408
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:51,272
...here we have the famous Jakob.

1409
01:36:53,395 --> 01:36:55,272
Did you bring your radio?

1410
01:36:58,795 --> 01:37:00,547
Yes and no.

1411
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:21,944
Let's go!

1412
01:38:24,675 --> 01:38:27,143
Please! Please! Please!

1413
01:38:36,315 --> 01:38:37,953
Come on! Come on!

1414
01:38:40,835 --> 01:38:42,905
You're crazy.
You're going to get us killed.

1415
01:38:43,155 --> 01:38:44,270
I have to go to Jakob's.

1416
01:38:50,795 --> 01:38:51,910
Rosa, go!

1417
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:55,913
Halt! Halt!

1418
01:39:29,315 --> 01:39:30,794
The radio?

1419
01:39:31,435 --> 01:39:33,073
The hostages.

1420
01:39:36,835 --> 01:39:37,745
Nothing yet?

1421
01:39:37,995 --> 01:39:40,065
Another few more minutes,
Herr General.

1422
01:39:40,835 --> 01:39:43,065
All right. Continue.

1423
01:39:45,995 --> 01:39:50,193
Tell us about the radio. I will see
what I can do for the hostages.

1424
01:40:14,235 --> 01:40:17,113
-Look by the window.
-There's nothing here.

1425
01:40:17,355 --> 01:40:19,107
It has to be here somewhere.

1426
01:40:26,355 --> 01:40:27,868
I hear something.

1427
01:40:30,795 --> 01:40:31,910
Sorry if I f rightened you.

1428
01:40:32,195 --> 01:40:34,026
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1429
01:40:34,275 --> 01:40:37,745
I'm Lina Kronstein. I live here.
But it's a secret.

1430
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:39,030
You're Mischa, yes?

1431
01:40:39,755 --> 01:40:41,268
Jakob said you'd take care of me.

1432
01:40:41,515 --> 01:40:42,425
Take care of you?

1433
01:40:42,675 --> 01:40:44,950
Of course, we'll be happy to.
Won't we?

1434
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:48,554
Listen to me very caref ully.
This is very important.

1435
01:40:48,915 --> 01:40:50,633
Do you know where Jakob
hid the radio?

1436
01:40:50,915 --> 01:40:51,870
-Of course I do.
-You do?

1437
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:52,911
I've heard it.

1438
01:40:53,235 --> 01:40:54,793
"This is the BBC f rom London."

1439
01:40:55,075 --> 01:40:56,144
You actually heard this radio?

1440
01:40:56,395 --> 01:40:57,908
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

1441
01:40:58,155 --> 01:40:58,951
Where is it?

1442
01:41:02,395 --> 01:41:04,386
Where is your damn radio?

1443
01:41:04,795 --> 01:41:09,027
Lina, where the radio is matters
a great deal to a lot of people.

1444
01:41:09,275 --> 01:41:11,106
Would Jakob trust us to listen to it?

1445
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:15,550
Stop.

1446
01:41:18,675 --> 01:41:20,188
I'll show you.

1447
01:41:25,075 --> 01:41:26,872
I'll show you my radio.

1448
01:41:32,995 --> 01:41:34,269
Go, Lina. Go, go!

1449
01:41:34,915 --> 01:41:36,507
Forget about the radio, Mischa!

1450
01:41:42,795 --> 01:41:43,989
That...

1451
01:41:45,155 --> 01:41:46,554
...is my radio.

1452
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:57,633
You've just told your last joke, yid!

1453
01:42:00,115 --> 01:42:01,025
Stop.

1454
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,149
Go! Run there!

1455
01:42:05,395 --> 01:42:07,192
Run. Trust me, run!

1456
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,274
Don't shoot.

1457
01:42:13,115 --> 01:42:14,673
Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

1458
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:16,314
It was you.

1459
01:42:17,075 --> 01:42:19,748
The Jew who was out after curfew.

1460
01:42:21,155 --> 01:42:24,352
And it was your radio I heard.

1461
01:42:26,595 --> 01:42:28,870
Ex cuse me, sir,
is that a problem for you?

1462
01:42:29,115 --> 01:42:31,185
You're the one with the problem,
my f riend!

1463
01:42:31,435 --> 01:42:32,868
That's true.

1464
01:42:33,195 --> 01:42:36,949
That's certainly the case.
I can't argue with that.

1465
01:42:37,635 --> 01:42:39,865
But to let a Jew hear a radio...

1466
01:42:40,115 --> 01:42:42,629
...that's a serious offense, isn't it?

1467
01:42:43,955 --> 01:42:47,504
You can shoot me,
but you still don't have my radio.

1468
01:42:54,315 --> 01:42:55,748
So...

1469
01:42:56,675 --> 01:42:59,314
...we both have a problem, don't we?

1470
01:43:01,035 --> 01:43:01,831
May I?

1471
01:43:47,315 --> 01:43:49,192
You will stand up
in front of the Jews...

1472
01:43:49,955 --> 01:43:51,991
...and tell them there was no radio.

1473
01:43:52,595 --> 01:43:54,825
You made it all up. Everything.

1474
01:43:55,075 --> 01:43:56,906
There is no radio, no resistance.

1475
01:43:58,075 --> 01:44:00,669
In return for your confession,
I won't shoot you.

1476
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:05,225
But you will put me
on a transport to the camps.

1477
01:44:06,035 --> 01:44:07,388
It's the same thing, isn't it?

1478
01:44:08,635 --> 01:44:10,785
That's not much of a deal for me.

1479
01:44:11,755 --> 01:44:13,950
You may be a good soldier...

1480
01:44:14,195 --> 01:44:16,106
...but you're not
much of a businessman.

1481
01:44:16,355 --> 01:44:18,471
Ex cuse me for saying so.

1482
01:44:20,675 --> 01:44:22,028
Who knows?

1483
01:44:22,795 --> 01:44:24,706
You might survive a week
in the camps.

1484
01:44:25,475 --> 01:44:27,545
Two weeks. Six months.

1485
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:30,912
Until the Russians or the Americans
or the British arrive.

1486
01:44:31,555 --> 01:44:33,989
You know how close they are,
don't you?

1487
01:44:36,795 --> 01:44:38,513
There's always hope.

1488
01:44:39,275 --> 01:44:40,344
Isn't there?

1489
01:44:42,435 --> 01:44:45,268
What man doesn't want to see
the next day...

1490
01:44:45,955 --> 01:44:47,673
...and the one after that?

1491
01:45:29,275 --> 01:45:31,550
You all know this man.

1492
01:45:32,515 --> 01:45:35,393
He told you he had a radio.

1493
01:45:36,075 --> 01:45:38,305
He told you
that you should resist...

1494
01:45:38,675 --> 01:45:40,791
...the German authorities.

1495
01:45:41,955 --> 01:45:44,105
He will now tell you...

1496
01:45:44,355 --> 01:45:46,915
...that this was all a lie.

1497
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:51,827
He will tell you that
there never was such a radio.

1498
01:45:52,755 --> 01:45:54,347
And that resistance...

1499
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:56,906
...is pointless.

1500
01:46:00,155 --> 01:46:01,065
Tell them.

1501
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:37,548
Tell them.

1502
01:46:55,795 --> 01:46:56,944
Hey, you.

1503
01:46:59,515 --> 01:47:00,311
Tell them.

1504
01:48:00,515 --> 01:48:02,426
So that's how it ended.

1505
01:48:02,675 --> 01:48:07,305
I never got a chance to be
the big hero and make my big speech.

1506
01:48:07,555 --> 01:48:09,625
I swear, I had a speech
all prepared...

1507
01:48:09,835 --> 01:48:11,951
...about freedom
and never giving in.

1508
01:48:12,195 --> 01:48:13,674
But somehow....

1509
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:16,750
Yes, that's how it ended.

1510
01:48:22,595 --> 01:48:24,711
They all went off to the camps...

1511
01:48:24,955 --> 01:48:26,866
...and were never seen again.

1512
01:48:32,515 --> 01:48:36,110
But maybe it wasn't
like that at all.

1513
01:48:37,835 --> 01:48:40,907
Because, you know,
as Frankfurter says.*

1514
01:48:41,195 --> 01:48:43,755
"Until the last line
has been spoken...

1515
01:48:43,995 --> 01:48:46,065
... the curtain cannot come down. "

1516
01:48:50,635 --> 01:48:52,671
About 50 kilometres out of town...

1517
01:48:52,915 --> 01:48:55,554
... the train was stopped
by Russian troops...

1518
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:58,468
...who had just
taken Bezanika and Pry.

1519
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:17,470
Roll it out, roll it out
Roll out the barrel

1520
01:50:22,035 --> 01:50:23,514
Sing a song of good cheer

1521
01:50:24,195 --> 01:50:26,265
'Cause the whole gang is here

1522
01:50:27,275 --> 01:50:28,833
Roll it out, roll it out

1523
01:50:29,035 --> 01:50:33,472
Let's do the Beer Barrel Polka!
