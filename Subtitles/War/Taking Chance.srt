1
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:08,251
<i>Blue one to blue two, checkpoint
alpha bravo has been reached.</i>

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,726
<i>Copy, leader one.</i>

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,533
<i>Blue two, we have a suspicious
vehicle on the right,</i>

4
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,458
<i>moving pretty fast.
Over.</i>

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,356
<i>Army corps four, is he slowing down?</i>

6
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,452
<i>Blue one,
why are you driving so slow?</i>

7
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:24,681
<i>- You worried about a ticket? Over.
- Sorry, guys. Just rubbing one out.</i>

8
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:34,514
<i>Phelps is down!</i>

9
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,249
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

10
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,598
Once we're quartered,
we'll give you a rundown on battalion

11
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,182
and squadron-level readiness and

12
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,457
today's brief will focus
on first marine division.

13
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,339
The slide indicates that
personnel readiness 1st mardiv

14
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,029
is not as bad as they are reporting.

15
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:52,430
However, sir, as you are aware,
last Friday they made a request

16
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:54,211
for 300 additional augments.

17
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,521
Given the insurgency in Al-Anbar

18
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,946
and the recent spike in casualties,

19
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:02,009
it's not surprising that
they made this request.

20
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,299
Sir, it's my recommendation to just
send enough augments

21
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,024
to cover their casualties
of last month.

22
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,011
How many of you have
been in Iraq since 9/11?

23
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,610
I know you've spent a lot of time
on these reports, but I cannot have

24
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,322
a bunch of analysts contradict
the commanders on the ground.

25
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,341
I don't know. With all
this administrative crap,

26
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:34,334
it makes you wonder if we're losing
focus on what really matters.

27
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,791
Sometimes I wish I was over there.

28
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,883
I don't know, sir.

29
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,142
Be careful what you wish for, right?

30
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,454
Hey, dad.

31
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,641
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

32
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,104
Guess who came in first
in her swim meet.

33
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,461
Let me guess.

34
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,693
You? High-five. That's great!

35
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,532
Listen, guys, how about we get some
homework done before dinner?

36
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,550
I think that sounds
like a great idea.

37
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:10,802
What are you cooking here?

38
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,377
White chicken chili
with a balsamic reduction.

39
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,117
- You're getting creative.
- Shut up.

40
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:48,998
Let us pray.

41
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,036
Ready. Down.

42
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:59,399
- Ready, two.
- Present arms!

43
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,346
Forward march.

44
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,602
Bearers, halt.

45
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:19,088
That is not nice.

46
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,764
Dad, I think I got all of
the words right, but I'm not sure.

47
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,517
I'll throw a quick one
at you right now. "Tortellini."

48
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:31,268
T-o-r-i...
I don't know.

49
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:06,771
Sir, last night I read the DOD
Announcement about PFC Phelps.

50
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,649
He is from my home town,
Clifton, Colorado.

51
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,300
I don't know if this falls to us

52
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,360
or to the Pentagon, but,

53
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,735
sir, if the duty does fall to us.

54
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,796
I would be honored
to escort him home.

55
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,252
It's a little unusual
for an officer to escort a PFC.

56
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,457
Yes, sir, I know that, but...

57
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,133
I would very much
like to do it, sir.

58
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:32,368
I'm going out of town for a few days.
I'm being picked up at 6:00.

59
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,655
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yeah.

60
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,897
I volunteered for escort duty.

61
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:42,588
There was this private first class,
killed in Iraq. Young kid.

62
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,534
He's from Clifton.
I volunteered to take him home.

63
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,173
What is this about, Mike?

64
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:56,486
It's not about anything.
He's from Clifton, that's all.

65
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,778
It's gonna be a quick trip, Stace.

66
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,247
I'll be back next week.

67
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:24,017
Please tell the family I'm so
sorry for their loss.

68
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:25,659
I will.

69
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,407
I love you.

70
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,922
The remains are to travel feet first

71
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,047
when being transported
from one point to another.

72
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:10,544
At every stop,

73
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,831
you must ensure that the remains
have been correctly loaded.

74
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,471
At each transfer point,

75
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,400
regardless of the mode of transport,

76
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,175
you will render honors.

77
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,196
Your duty, is not complete

78
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,245
until you have delivered
the remains to the funeral director.

79
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,699
Escorts are not required
to stay for the funeral.

80
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,532
However, should you decide to stay,

81
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:32,124
there are specific guidelines
for meeting the family.

82
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:34,116
At no point are you to discuss

83
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,267
the nature of the deceased's death,

84
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,425
no are you to speculate
on the activities surrounding the death.

85
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,060
You may deliver the personal effects
directly to the next of kin.

86
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,235
These effects must stay
on your person

87
00:13:57,624 --> 00:13:59,574
at all times until delivery.

88
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:21,057
Gentlemen, we have
our first departure of the day.

89
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:25,082
We form about in the drive and
render honors as all remains depart.

90
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,040
Detail,

91
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,492
attention!

92
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,716
Present arms!

93
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:48,995
Order arms!

94
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,183
Present arms!

95
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Dismissed!

96
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,787
I'm afraid we've taken
a lot of casualties this week.

97
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,580
He's not ready for departure today.

98
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,371
<i>... but not what he
completes in his lifetime.</i>

99
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,714
<i>Imagine an evolution
occurring over eons...</i>

100
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,873
<i>... the attack tonight comes
amid rising violence</i>

101
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:48,137
<i>between insurgents and
coalition troops throughout Iraq.</i>

102
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,069
<i>Marines in Fallujah today pushed</i>

103
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,462
<i>into the chaotic city
from several directions.</i>

104
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:56,578
<i>They met with heavy fire from assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.</i>

105
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,695
I bet you didn't know
marines could sew.

106
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,049
He was quite impresse, your PFC.

107
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,993
He's so decorated
for such a young man.

108
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:54,015
I didn't know him.

109
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,414
You can be sure that
his uniform will be perfect.

110
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,264
Appreciate it, Colonel.

111
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,837
You know, whether it's now
or later, it doesn't matter.

112
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,185
But just in case...

113
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,431
He's a military shrink.
It's all confidential.

114
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,137
I'm good, thanks.

115
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,047
It's just an FYI.

116
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,896
Colonel Strobl, sir,
you'll be leaving in about 15 minutes.

117
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,232
Transport will deliver you
to Philadelphia airport

118
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:25,415
with your final destination,
Dubois, Wyoming.

119
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Wyoming?

120
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,348
I thought I was on my way
to Colorado, Clifton.

121
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:32,514
He joined up out in Colorado,
but his parents lived in Wyoming.

122
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:34,757
That's where his family
wants him buried.

123
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,289
- That all right?
- Of course.

124
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,541
I have PFC Phelps's
personal effects.

125
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,216
We'll now do our
inventory and turnover.

126
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:48,801
Sir, Phelps's parents are divorced,

127
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:50,843
so you'll have an extra
flag to present to them.

128
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:53,711
That way, the mother
and the father will each get one.

129
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,661
If you could make sure everything's
here, then sign the inventory.

130
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:19,726
I also have a...

131
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,925
letter Phelps's platoon commander
wrote to the family.

132
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:35,054
Colonel, the mortuary specialist
did the best that he could.

133
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:37,890
However, these remains
are not recommended for viewing.

134
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,269
It's been my privilege
to care for him, sir.

135
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:50,445
That's everything, we'll need to make
a final identification before departure.

136
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,854
Sir, I need you to verify that
this is PFC Chance Phelps,

137
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:05,158
and that you are
ready for departure.

138
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,811
Present arms!

139
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,672
- Feeling okay?
- Yeah yeah. I'm good.

140
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,293
We're almost there.

141
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,639
Do you always do these routes?

142
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,278
I just started six months ago.

143
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:13,364
Nobody in my family's in the military
and none of my friends.

144
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,904
But I thought about joining up.

145
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,408
Yeah, but I was too chickenshit.

146
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:23,481
Sorry. I mean too chicken.

147
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,711
You can say shit.

148
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,055
And plus the whole haircut thing.

149
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm in a band and...

150
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,507
you know, you got to keep it long
to keep the ladies happy.

151
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,761
What about you?
What's your deal?

152
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,608
My deal? My deal is complicated.

153
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,057
When did you join up?

154
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:47,859
When I was 17.

155
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:52,468
My parents had to sign something
because I was underage.

156
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,247
Yeah, that's young.

157
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:55,984
I know,

158
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,181
but I couldn't bear
the thought of waiting another year.

159
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,659
All I wanted was to be a marine

160
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,294
and I joined up.

161
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:07,873
You graduate from boot camp,
you think you're on top and you travel

162
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,294
and you see these things
you never thought you'd see.

163
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,319
It's hard, of course, but...

164
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,838
it's fun.

165
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,964
- It's fun?
- Yeah.

166
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,121
I'm serious.

167
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,058
I've got to be honest.

168
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,267
No offense, but...

169
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,268
I don't really get what
we're doing over there.

170
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:29,081
But...

171
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,690
last summer these two guys
from my high school went,

172
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:36,765
and one of them ended up
hurt really bad.

173
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,230
And last time I heard, he was
at something Reed hospital.

174
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,005
- Walter Reed.
- Yeah.

175
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,046
The other one,
he didn't make it back.

176
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,512
I just wanted to do something.

177
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,028
Hey, Henry.

178
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:22,976
How you doin'?

179
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:26,911
Colonel...

180
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,188
whenever you're ready.

181
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,191
- Will you do me a favor?
- Sure.

182
00:22:57,983 --> 00:22:59,969
- Let the family know
we're thinking of them.

183
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,094
- Will do.

184
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,398
You're a good man, Rich.

185
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:05,948
- Thanks.
- Be safe.

186
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,082
All right. See ya.

187
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,485
<i>Attention, passengers.
Increased security measures...</i>

188
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,713
Welcome to Northwest Airlines.
ID, please.

189
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,388
I have a voucher.

190
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:28,777
He's the military escort.
I'll check him in.

191
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:38,720
I've booked you through to Billings,

192
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:41,785
but you can get your bags off
in Minneapolis tonight.

193
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,798
I upgraded you to first class

194
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,623
all the way to Billings.

195
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,104
Thanks.
Appreciate that.

196
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,541
Thank you for your service.

197
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,263
Thanks again.

198
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:12,063
Belt, shoes,
laptop in a separate bin.

199
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:17,012
All metal out of your pockets.

200
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:20,001
Sir, your bag needs to go through.

201
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,985
Yeah, you can wand this bag, but
it can't go through the x-ray machine.

202
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,677
Please don't tell me
how to do my job.

203
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,203
The bag can't go through.

204
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:30,618
Well, it's your call.
It's gonna take you longer.

205
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,649
Bag check, male.

206
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:36,702
Sir, I need you to remove your jacket
and place it in the bin.

207
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:41,083
I can't remove the jacket.
You can hand-check me.

208
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,255
- Is there a supervisor around?
- Not right here.

209
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:45,778
Remove your jacket.
It needs to go through the machine.

210
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,095
I will not remove this jacket
and denigrate this uniform.

211
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:53,599
You have a lot of metal on your jacket.
It needs to go through the machine.

212
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,990
Take me to a private room

213
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:58,889
and wand me there.

214
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:04,032
Turn around, please.

215
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,752
- Excuse me, sir. Are you the escort?
- Yes.

216
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,677
- How you doing?
- All right.

217
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:04,095
- I need to get down
to the tarmac to watch loading.

218
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
- Sure.

219
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:16,265
- So where you from?
- Colorado originally.

220
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,933
It's a long time
since I've been there.

221
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,851
- You?
- All over.

222
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,024
My old man was career air force,
so we moved around a lot.

223
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,331
- How was that?
- It was all right.

224
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,861
I actually kind of miss it
now that I'm settled here.

225
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,140
We're gonna wait right here.
He's coming around.

226
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:34,908
Yeah, the moving around is kind of cool
when you're single, and then...

227
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,559
you get married, have kids,
it's a other deal.

228
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:40,089
You do this escort stuff, mostly?

229
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,808
Me? No, I...
I work in a cubicle.

230
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:47,338
- I volunteered for this one.
- It must be hard.

231
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,750
- I need to verify.
- Yeah, go ahead.

232
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,810
- You can stand right here if you want.
- Thanks.

233
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,811
- 2A?
- It's right down on your right, sir.

234
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:56,455
Excuse me. Thank you.

235
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:15,440
Can I get you something to drink?

236
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,395
Jack daniels rocks, please.

237
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:20,509
- And for you, sir?
- Water, thank you.

238
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,266
What's the matter?
You on duty or something?

239
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,617
Yes, I am.

240
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,950
Excuse me, sir?

241
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,498
I want you to have this.

242
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:32,056
It'll be a couple of minutes.
Sorry about the delay.

243
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,074
We're waiting on a conveyor.

244
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,713
But we're gonna get
all the luggage off first,

245
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,623
then we'll remove the remains.

246
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:41,242
I'd like to keep him separate
from the baggage, if that's possible.

247
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,964
That's the plan. We're not gonna
move him with the rest of the luggage.

248
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,789
All right.
Sounds good.

249
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,740
You know, there's another escort
here from dover.

250
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,190
- I've seen a lot of you guys lately.
- Excuse me.

251
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:02,588
Evening.

252
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,427
Evening, sir. I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

253
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:12,152
I got a connecting flight.
How's your trip going so far?

254
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,046
It's been fine.

255
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:16,463
It's weird though, sir.

256
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,480
They all know,

257
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:21,783
like, without me telling anyone.

258
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:25,758
Both at Philadelphia
and so far here in Minneapolis.

259
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,511
I guess they figured it out
by the uniforms.

260
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:30,628
Yeah, you know,
I've had the same thing,

261
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:31,803
which is...

262
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:35,232
okay, because I'm not
really interested in explaining it.

263
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,074
It looks like yours
is coming out now.

264
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:44,247
Present... Arms!

265
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,066
Order... Arms!

266
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:59,857
When you're ready, we'll go over to the
cargo warehouse and get everything set.

267
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:03,093
Yeah, okay. Just give me a minute.
I still need to verify.

268
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:08,021
So what's your
destination, sergeant?

269
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:11,121
I'm headed to rochester.
It's about 90 miles from here.

270
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:16,043
My family is meeting us there.

271
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,936
Are you related to
the deceased, son?

272
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:25,738
Yes, sir.

273
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,875
He's my brother.

274
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:36,084
Present... Arms!

275
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,766
Order... Arms!

276
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:12,232
Well, you... Take care of
yourself, son.

277
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,099
Thank you, sir.

278
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:18,285
You too.

279
00:32:57,662 --> 00:33:00,155
So he can just, stay here all night?

280
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,335
- Yeah.
- There's no need to move him?

281
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,381
Don't worry.
No one's going near him.

282
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:10,428
When you're ready, we have a taxi
waiting to take you to your hotel.

283
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:14,558
Actually, I tell you, if I could
just get a chair, i'm all set.

284
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:17,433
I really don't want
to leave him here alone.

285
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,673
You want to sleep in here?

286
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:24,609
I need to check with my supervisor.
I'm not sure we're allowed to do that.

287
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,229
Could you?

288
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:29,364
I know it's late,
but I'd really appreciate it.

289
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,982
I had this in my jeep.

290
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:41,749
It should be a little
more comfortable than that chair.

291
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:43,639
Thanks.

292
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,040
- Thanks, I appreciate that.
- Take care.

293
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:48,915
Good night.

294
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:53,120
I heard we were
carrying remains today.

295
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,383
- You must be the escort.
- Mike Strobl.

296
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:57,202
- Tom garrett.
- How you doing, Tom?

297
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,661
Where'd you get that
combat action ribbon?

298
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:01,977
Desert Storm.

299
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:05,423
I was flying an A-10
in Desert Storm.

300
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:08,025
Man, we tore it up over there.

301
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,229
You guys were good.

302
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:14,541
I was a lieutenant, artillery battalion,
first marine division.

303
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:15,864
You've been...

304
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,589
back this time around?

305
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,434
No, I'm a numbers cruncher now.

306
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,191
I analyze manpower at Quantico.

307
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,649
Well, I guess you saw
enough action in Kuwait?

308
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:29,645
No, not so much.

309
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,633
I tell you,
I really miss it some days.

310
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:35,811
Excuse me.

311
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:21,616
Thank you.

312
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:25,202
Thank you.

313
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:44,153
- Annie.
- Mike.

314
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,882
I guess we're travel mates
for the next few hours.

315
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:50,807
I have tons of magazines.
I'm happy to share.

316
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:51,946
Thank you.

317
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,163
HOT SOLDIER SITTING
NEXT TO ME ON PLANE

318
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,159
It's marine, actually.

319
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:12,796
How embarrassing.

320
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,619
It's okay.

321
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:16,758
Trust me,
you're a breath of fresh air.

322
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:24,383
I can't believe how fast you get
with your thumbs on those things.

323
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,434
I have a lot to say.

324
00:37:44,944 --> 00:37:46,794
<i>Welcome to Billings, folks.</i>

325
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:50,375
<i>I'm going to ask that you
remain seated for a moment.</i>

326
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:52,460
<i>During this flight,</i>

327
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,497
<i>I've had the honor of carrying
the remains of a fallen marine.</i>

328
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,970
<i>I'm going to inconvenience you
for a few moments</i>

329
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,782
<i>while the escort
disembarks the plane.</i>

330
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:07,017
<i>- I didn't know. I'm so sorry.
- As you go about your day,</i>

331
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,238
<i>- keep the family in your thoughts.
- It's okay.</i>

332
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,806
Thanks for the company.

333
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,224
Well, I'm off to Cheyenne.

334
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,325
- Thanks for the smooth flying.
- You bet.

335
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,153
What was his name, your marine?

336
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,525
PFC Chance Phelps.

337
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:13,115
Chance Phelps.

338
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,280
I know the name of every KIA
I've ever carried.

339
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:20,511
You take care of yourself.

340
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:21,966
Thanks. You too.

341
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:54,672
I'm Gary

342
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:58,628
- from Rafferty's funeral home.
- Gary, Mike Strobl.

343
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:01,327
It's a real honor to meet you, sir.

344
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,883
I've got a hearse.
It's ready to go.

345
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:08,533
We should get started as soon as we can.
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

346
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:11,134
Took me over five hours
to get up here this morning.

347
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,986
I didn't know Chance real well.

348
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,407
I've known his dad for years.

349
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:23,528
I'm glad he's finally home.

350
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:18,698
- You must be Major Thompson.
- Yes, sir. Mike Thompson

351
00:45:18,823 --> 00:45:20,672
from I&I 223 down in Salt Lake City.

352
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:22,997
- Good to meet you, Major.
- Sir.

353
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,331
- I guess you've had a hell of a week?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:29,639
Sergeant Burton and I drove
all night to get up here on Saturday.

355
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:32,489
We notified the mother
at zero-two on saturday morning.

356
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:35,206
I tell you, sir,
I hope to never go through that again.

357
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:38,634
- So how's the family doing?
- Well, sir, it's kind of hard to say.

358
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:40,936
Sometimes I think
they're doing OK, but then...

359
00:45:41,061 --> 00:45:43,222
You know. It's hard to say.

360
00:45:44,564 --> 00:45:46,574
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

361
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,799
It's just been a long week, sir.

362
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:50,794
The VFW Post up in Dubois

363
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:53,203
is having a get-together tonight
in honor of Chance.

364
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:56,449
- You might want to come up for that.
- Okay. Sounds good.

365
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,657
- I'm glad you're here, sir.
- Yeah, me too.

366
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:17,145
Your hotel is up in Dubois,

367
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,862
where the ceremony's gonna be.

368
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:21,344
You'll want to head out
of here and get settled.

369
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,014
- I'm sorry about all the driving.
- Not a problem, Gary.

370
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,487
If I can get you to sign off
on the paperwork,

371
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:31,195
then we can call it a day.

372
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:32,524
That sounds fine.

373
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:35,750
I have some items the family would like
to have inserted into the casket.

374
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,794
They said they'd prefer
not to view the remains,

375
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,952
so I guess now would be
a good time to do that.

376
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:43,324
Yeah, that would be good,
and I need to check on his uniform.

377
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:46,869
You know it's gonna be
a closed-casket funeral?

378
00:46:47,092 --> 00:46:48,592
I understand, but...

379
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:51,624
just want to make sure
he's squared away.

380
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:08,683
Okay, go ahead.

381
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:15,333
Look at that.
He's got six ribbons.

382
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:18,195
- And he's a PFC, it's amazing.
- Yeah.

383
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,740
The folks at Dover did a great job.

384
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:27,755
They knew he wasn't gonna be
viewed and his uniform is...

385
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:29,013
perfect.

386
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,301
I'm gonna...

387
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,697
take care of the paperwork.

388
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:30,052
If you're ready.

389
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:14,761
Excuse me, sir.

390
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:17,332
Are you the marine
who brought Chance home?

391
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,107
Yes, sir.
Mike Strobl.

392
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:22,228
Semper Fi, colonel.
I'm Charlie Fitts.

393
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,819
Listen, this whole town
is grateful to you.

394
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:27,524
It was my honor.

395
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,093
Korea?

396
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:32,446
It's a privilege to meet
an old first marine division warrior.

397
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:35,161
There's some fellows here
been waiting all night to meet you.

398
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:38,768
Fellas!

399
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:40,454
This is Chance's escort,

400
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:41,981
Colonel Strobl.

401
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:44,959
Larry Hertzog. Welcome.

402
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:46,518
- Robert Rouse.
- How are you?

403
00:51:46,643 --> 00:51:47,545
A.V. Scott.

404
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,408
Here we have Gunny Mulcahy,

405
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:50,965
Chance's recruiter.

406
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,300
And Sergeant Michael Arenz.

407
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:57,117
He was with Chance when he died.

408
00:51:59,604 --> 00:52:00,604
Sergeant.

409
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,967
Jenny, let's get
this man a cold beer.

410
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,923
He's been on a long and lonely trip.

411
00:52:07,048 --> 00:52:08,432
Did you know Chance?

412
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:10,350
No, I didn't know him.

413
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,319
You missed out.

414
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:13,487
Sure did.

415
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:16,494
You know, a lot of recruits,
myself included,

416
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,410
lose a big part of their personality
when they go through boot camp.

417
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:20,801
Sort of the point.

418
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:23,247
But, Chance,
he comes back from boot camp,

419
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:25,454
he sure as hell was a marine,

420
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:26,959
but he was still Chance.

421
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,869
Same old wise-ass smile.

422
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:33,716
He could get away with anything
just by flashing that grin.

423
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,859
Our first mortar attack in Ramadi,

424
00:52:37,348 --> 00:52:40,097
everybody's yelling,
"Grab your kevlars! Grab your flaks!"

425
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:42,725
We were all scared, you know?
Like, "welcome to Iraq."

426
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,144
Everybody's running,
trying to get to the bunker.

427
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:46,121
Phelps,

428
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,813
he's got his shower shoes on,
grabs his rifle, runs outside,

429
00:52:48,938 --> 00:52:50,399
he's like, "where they at?"

430
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:55,620
Everybody's yelling, "Phelps, get
your ass back in here, man! Take cover!"

431
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:57,573
He's still standing outside

432
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,158
in his shower shoes.

433
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:13,060
If you guys would excuse us,
we need to head out.

434
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:16,508
We're building something special
to take him up to the cemetery tomorrow.

435
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,844
- Anything I can do?
- I think you've done enough.

436
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,115
- Colonel, good night. Thank you.
- Good night.

437
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:28,057
The convoy's moving along,

438
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:30,774
doing a routine patrol
south of Baghdad, and...

439
00:53:33,204 --> 00:53:35,571
Chance wasn't even supposed
to be there that day.

440
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:37,738
It was his rest day.

441
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:41,405
And knowing we were going out,
he just had to come.

442
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:45,129
Chance was up in the turret
looking out for trouble.

443
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:46,407
That was his spot.

444
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:49,240
The most dangerous job
a marine can have.

445
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:51,590
Yeah, you're totally
exposed up there.

446
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:53,799
He loved it though.

447
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:57,113
It always made me feel safe

448
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:58,717
seeing those shoes there.

449
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,596
In Iraq, Chance was just a big old pair
of size-12 shoes looking out for us.

450
00:54:05,183 --> 00:54:07,567
Anyhow, we were driving along.

451
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,638
Suddenly there's this huge boom.

452
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:13,039
Out of nowhere, an IED had gone off
in the front of the convoy, so...

453
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:16,067
I jump out, check on the rest
of the vehicles, and...

454
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:17,528
It was madness.

455
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,283
There was bullets flying everywhere.

456
00:54:20,408 --> 00:54:22,388
It was chaos,
just total chaos, but...

457
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:25,507
I could hear behind me
Chance's 240 opening up,

458
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:28,284
just unleashing an ungodly
amount of fire on the mujahideen.

459
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:31,834
So I thought, "okay,
that part of the convoy's okay."

460
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:35,490
He attracted all the fire to himself

461
00:54:35,615 --> 00:54:37,780
so that the rest of us
could take cover,

462
00:54:37,905 --> 00:54:39,322
get organized and get out.

463
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,531
So after I checked on
the first two vehicles,

464
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,858
I run back towards
our vehicle, and...

465
00:54:49,104 --> 00:54:51,091
I could see Chance was
shooting all over the place.

466
00:54:51,216 --> 00:54:53,275
He was up in the air, everywhere.

467
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,888
Just erratic, you know?

468
00:54:55,804 --> 00:54:58,261
I yelled at him.
I was like, "Jesus, Phelps,

469
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,255
don't shoot the birds, man."

470
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,622
I thought he was trying
to scare them or something.

471
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,884
His finger was still
on the trigger, shooting,

472
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:09,895
but his head was slumped over.

473
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:14,928
I got a little bit closer, I could see
some blood coming down of his head.

474
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:33,773
Inside the vehicle,
Doc checked his vitals, and...

475
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:36,315
he was gone.

476
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:41,633
Six of us...

477
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,382
held him in our hands
all the way back to the base.

478
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,254
I just keep running it,
you know, in my mind, like,

479
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:53,384
"What could I have done better?
What could I have done different?"

480
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:58,350
What do you say to somebody's mom
when they tell you,

481
00:55:58,475 --> 00:56:00,814
"it's not your fault.
You couldn't have done anything."

482
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:05,206
I owed it to him to save him.

483
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,786
I'm the one who trained him.

484
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:18,482
I just can't believe
that I'm here and he's not.

485
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,612
I'm glad you're here, Sergeant.

486
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:30,388
Thank you, sir.

487
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,140
It means a lot coming from you.

488
00:56:38,918 --> 00:56:42,567
He'd be so honored knowing
such a senior officer brought him home.

489
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,323
- Sir.
- Sergeant.

490
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,149
What that kid has to live with.

491
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:07,823
I should've been over there.

492
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:11,452
- It wasn't your time, Colonel.
- It was exactly my time.

493
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,259
I knew the clock was ticking,

494
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,420
knew my time was coming up.

495
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:18,847
But I just...

496
00:57:19,701 --> 00:57:21,377
kept ignoring it, you know?

497
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,883
Except for the middle
of the night, when I...

498
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,418
would check
those casualty lists, just...

499
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,585
praying that I didn't recognize
any of the names.

500
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:39,011
I don't know, you know, I just...

501
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:42,904
I just got...

502
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:45,495
used to seeing my wife and kids

503
00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:47,335
every day, and...

504
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:54,378
So I put in a request
for another office tour,

505
00:57:56,392 --> 00:57:57,727
and it was granted.

506
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,441
They must've needed you here.

507
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:04,416
My friends went.

508
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:07,803
Guys I was in
Desert Storm with went.

509
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:09,128
I stayed home.

510
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,299
I was trained to fight.

511
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:17,127
If I'm not over there, what am I?

512
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:19,056
Those guys,

513
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,189
guys like Chance...

514
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:26,208
They're marines.

515
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,695
And you think you're not?

516
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,279
Want to be with
your family every night.

517
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:34,654
You think you have to justify that?

518
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:37,083
You'd better stop right there, sir.

519
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,833
You've brought Chance home.

520
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,424
You're his witness now.

521
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:47,778
Without a witness,

522
00:58:48,788 --> 00:58:50,288
they just disappear.

523
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,423
You're Chance's escort?

524
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,462
- Mike Strobl.
- John Phelps, Chance's dad.

525
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:04,791
This is my wife, Chris,
Chance's step-mom.

526
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:05,876
Welcome.

527
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:08,641
- And Chance's step-dad Jeff.
- Colonel.

528
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:10,585
And this is Chance's sister Kelley,

529
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,901
- and her fiance Rob.
- Hello, sir.

530
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:15,871
I'm Chance's mother.

531
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:18,179
Thank you for your service.

532
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:19,583
It's my honor, ma'am.

533
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:22,122
I'm just so sorry for your loss.

534
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:25,480
Please come and sit.

535
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,460
A chair.

536
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,687
- Thank you.
- Come on, dear.

537
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:40,673
First, I...

538
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:43,073
want you all to know that...

539
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:45,193
all along the way,

540
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:47,394
Chance was treated with dignity

541
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:48,644
and respect

542
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,125
and honor.

543
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:56,067
I have here a letter from...

544
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:58,769
Chance's platoon commander.

545
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:01,402
Thank you.

546
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:04,986
I also have here

547
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:07,867
some of Chance's things.

548
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:23,687
It's still set on Baghdad time.

549
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:42,991
Here.

550
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:12,286
This is the medal
that grandma gave him.

551
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,022
Remember?

552
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,516
I want you to know

553
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:19,024
you do not mourn alone today.

554
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,880
All across America,

555
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,323
from Virginia

556
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,551
<i>to Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota,</i>

557
01:03:26,879 --> 01:03:28,662
<i>Montana, Wyoming,</i>

558
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:32,174
<i>people are thinking of you</i>

559
01:03:32,803 --> 01:03:34,251
<i>and praying for you.</i>

560
01:03:35,602 --> 01:03:36,873
<i>You should know that</i>

561
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:39,468
<i>Chance has touched</i>

562
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:41,931
<i>many people.</i>

563
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,002
There's one more thing
that I'd like you to have.

564
01:03:55,976 --> 01:03:59,526
A flight attendant in Philadelphia
handed this to me, and...

565
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,161
it seemed like it was
very special to her. I was...

566
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,527
<i>going to keep it as
a reminder of the trip,</i>

567
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:07,181
<i>but then I realized that...</i>

568
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,361
<i>she wasn't giving it to me.</i>

569
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:12,409
She was giving it to you.

570
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,325
<i>"April 9th, 2004...</i>

571
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,704
<i>To the family of PFC Chance Phelps.</i>

572
01:04:57,741 --> 01:04:59,480
<i>Dear Mr. And Mrs. Phelps,</i>

573
01:05:02,352 --> 01:05:05,118
<i>I'm sure by now you have
learned of Chance's death.</i>

574
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:09,170
<i>I don't have the words to tell you</i>

575
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:11,477
<i>how sorry I am for your loss.</i>

576
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:15,749
<i>Chance meant the world to me</i>

577
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:18,343
<i>and to all of us here
in the second platoon.</i>

578
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:22,442
<i>I know parents aren't supposed
to have favorites, but...</i>

579
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,952
<i>trust me, platoon commanders do.</i>

580
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:33,503
<i>Chance was a unique character.</i>

581
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,069
<i>Where most marines would
put in shows of false bravado,</i>

582
01:05:38,194 --> 01:05:40,653
<i>Chance would quietly attend
to his business,</i>

583
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:44,089
<i>and he led to get people
to underestimate him.</i>

584
01:05:45,122 --> 01:05:47,162
<i>His quick smile and friendly manner</i>

585
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:49,457
<i>were always disarming and warming,</i>

586
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,677
<i>but there was no mistaking.</i>

587
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:55,940
<i>He was as fierce in battle
as he was gentle in friendship."</i>

588
01:05:56,065 --> 01:05:57,228
Please be seated.

589
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:08,906
We are here to honor the life
of Private First Class

590
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,074
Chance Russell Phelps.

591
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:27,507
<i>"... please know
that he died a hero,</i>

592
01:06:28,305 --> 01:06:29,722
<i>but more importantly,</i>

593
01:06:30,515 --> 01:06:31,815
<i>he lived a hero.</i>

594
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,920
<i>It's ironic,</i>

595
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:52,352
<i>but I am certain that if the world
had more men like Chance Phelps</i>

596
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:57,382
<i>there wouldn't be a need
for a marine corps."</i>

597
01:07:07,075 --> 01:07:08,075
Fire.

598
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:09,659
Ready,

599
01:07:10,384 --> 01:07:11,384
aim,

600
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,886
fire.

<i>Semper Fidelis.</i>

608
01:08:05,336 --> 01:08:06,231
Thank you.

609
01:10:53,557 --> 01:10:55,710
Put your cell phones
in the tray, please.

610
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,354
Can I ask you to step up?

611
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:02,824
Remove your shoes.

612
01:11:18,727 --> 01:11:21,454
<i>Chance Phelps was
wearing his St. Christopher medal</i>

613
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:23,358
<i>when he was killed on good friday.</i>

614
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:29,202
<i>Eight days later,</i>

615
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:31,586
<i>I handed the medallion
to his mother.</i>

616
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:38,405
<i>I watched them carry him
the final 15 yards.</i>

617
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,828
<i>I felt that...</i>

618
01:11:42,252 --> 01:11:44,017
<i>as long as he was still moving,</i>

619
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:46,325
<i>he was somehow still alive.</i>

620
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:50,804
<i>When they put him down in his grave,</i>

621
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:53,673
<i>he'd stopped moving.</i>

622
01:11:58,307 --> 01:12:00,952
<i>I didn't know Chance Phelps
before he died.</i>

623
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,610
<i>But today...</i>

624
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:04,859
<i>I miss him.</i>

625
01:12:28,753 --> 01:12:30,536
Come here. Group hug.

626
01:12:31,908 --> 01:12:33,131
