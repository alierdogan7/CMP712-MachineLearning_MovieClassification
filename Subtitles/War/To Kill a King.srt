1
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,820
( horses galloping )

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,517
Man: I now believe
that all crowns

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,519
corrupt those
who wear them.

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,442
I never thought that I would lead an army
against my own countrymen,

5
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,445
but for three bloody years brothers
fought brothers in the struggle

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,697
to be treated fairly
by our king.

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,368
( men shouting )

8
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,290
We won and the king was
imprisoned in his London palace,

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,210
but the people
paid dearly.

10
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,379
I was convinced then
we could heal the nation,

11
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,466
but the path to reform
was to prove longer and darker

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,844
- than I could ever have imagined.
- Come on, over here!

13
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,013
( man screams )

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,183
- Help me here!
- Sir!

15
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,253
Nurse:
Pull it tight.

16
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,262
- Man: All right, lad. All right.
- ( soldier screaming, crying )

17
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,766
Shh shh.

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,854
Bring down the prisoners.

19
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,359
Man: Bring the next 10
prisoners down, sergeant!

20
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,281
Man:
No, move along, next.

21
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,628
Take it, be quick.

22
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,470
- Look out!
- Long live the king!

23
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,026
Man:
Stay where you are!

24
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,657
No, please, sir.
No, sir, please please!

25
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,454
Man:
Keep back, stay in line.

26
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,249
Next!

27
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,012
Man: Next!

28
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,187
( men laughing,
chattering )

29
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,151
- Man: Who's this?
- Man #2: Do you see what I see?

30
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,953
Man:
Wait, Daniel, look.

31
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,967
- General Fairfax.
- At your service.

32
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,760
I thought the rebels
wore short hair

33
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,555
to protest against
courtly decadence.

34
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,056
I didn't expect
to find their chief

35
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,018
with such
a luxuriant mane.

36
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,646
You came to talk
of hair, madam?

37
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,525
I have a message
from your wife.

38
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,695
Then you've traveled far.

39
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,157
My wife is in Yorkshire,
as I understand,

40
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,075
tending our estate.

41
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,412
Then you mistake your wife
for a dozy housemaid, general.

42
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,126
Lady Fairfax has tended house
long enough.

43
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,795
- Indeed?
- Indeed.

44
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,256
Indeed she's headed
for London.

45
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:45,260
She thinks three years is long enough
to lose her husband to the wars.

46
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,263
You kept it for me.

47
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,850
What do you think?

48
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,091
Forgive me, madam.

49
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,385
I do not sleep well.

50
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,678
Best place to look
at the stars.

51
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,056
- What is your name?
- Oliver Cromwell.

52
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,022
Well, then you are
a liar, Mr. Cromwell.

53
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,441
You guard my husband's tent
every night

54
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,986
and have done ever since
an assassin tried to take his life.

55
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,782
Why do you forfeit
your sleep for him?

56
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,742
Your husband is one
of god's beloved.

57
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,330
If he died,

58
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,833
I am his deputy.
It would be inconvenient.

59
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,044
Fairfax:
Lost your tent, lieutenant?

60
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,171
Or are you just trying
to steal my wife?

61
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,012
Time we got you back
to yours.

62
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,443
( crowd shouting )

63
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,514
( bells chiming )

64
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,156
( crowd cheering,
applauding )

65
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,333
Oh, Henry, you're safe.

66
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,014
There is our victory.

67
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,897
The lord has granted us
a great victory, brethren.

68
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,525
Give them something to eat.

69
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,610
God bless the general.

70
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,032
Man:
Well done, General!

71
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,763
Well done,
General Fairfax.

72
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,224
Well done, General Fairfax.
Well done.

73
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,018
God bless you.
Well done!

74
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,021
Do not thank me.

75
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,233
It is you who won
England's freedom,

76
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,026
Every one of you!

77
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,196
Now the king
has decreed...

78
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,740
Your majesty, step away
from the window.

79
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,876
Man: ...awarded to Lord
General Fairfax

80
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,254
for valor in the field.

81
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,889
At last,
we can all sleep soundly,

82
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,975
Knowing that for once the king
cannot impose a new tax

83
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,227
on us in the morning.

84
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,564
You make it sound as if we fought
the war only to save your profits, Holles.

85
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,775
- Where's the treaty?
- All ready for your signatures.

86
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,236
But first, let us cross
to the palace

87
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,779
and toast a new era

88
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,532
of peace and prosperity.

89
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,327
- ( quiet music playing )
- So is it true

90
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,205
men who've been to war return
with more steel in their bones?

91
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,837
- I have no complaints.
- How do you expect to drink a toast

92
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,881
without a cup of wine?

93
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,553
- To your favorite soldier.
- To his favorite soldier.

94
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,308
Man:
Make it near 600,000.

95
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,976
Good work.

96
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,648
God's blessing
on you, General.

97
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,150
And all our men.

98
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,444
The lord chose you
to be the nation's warrior,

99
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,739
as he chose our cousin
Oliver to be its conscience.

100
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,660
( chuckles )

101
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,289
Holles, when will
the troops be paid?

102
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,792
As soon as we can.
Parliament has other pressing debts.

103
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,460
This is not the treaty.

104
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,796
The armories
and gunsmiths are owed.

105
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,423
This no more than a warrant
to ensure free trade.

106
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,176
Where are the law reforms,
the guarantees of basic freedoms?

107
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,179
I believe if you read it carefully,
you will find them.

108
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,223
We'll remove the king's
power to appoint judges.

109
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,308
You do not say why.

110
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,852
Every man has a right
to fair trial and opportunity.

111
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,438
It is a fundamental
principle.

112
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,982
If you have not the guts
to write it, then let me.

113
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,486
There is a procedure.

114
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,488
Fairfax:
He's right, Holles.

115
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,990
Let us enforce
the king's limits.

116
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,284
None of us would want
to fight this war again.

117
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,127
By all means, amend it.
Ready, my dear?

118
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,254
I'm afraid we must leave.

119
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,132
Now do you see why
I saved his life?

120
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,098
- Evening, Elizabeth.
- Evening, milord.

121
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,350
Please forgive
the late hour, Elizabeth.

122
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,823
Papa, how do you?

123
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,617
How do I?

124
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,619
As well as can
be expected for a man

125
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,537
who's seen his daughter
wed a traitor.

126
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,456
It will not continue
in the future.

127
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,834
In the future? If your husband
proceeds on this course

128
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,879
- we shan't have a future.
- Milord.

129
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,633
- Come into the parlor.
- No, I won't impose.

130
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,426
Only came to see
if you're well, my dear.

131
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,055
- I am well. We both are.
- I'm glad.

132
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,642
So you've enjoyed chasing his majesty
about the country, Thomas,

133
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,394
Confining him like a child
to his rooms,

134
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,856
driving our friends and cousins abroad
in fear of their lives?

135
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,859
It was he who first raised
his flag against the people.

136
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,616
- Let us all sit down.
- No, I'll be on my way, my dear.

137
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,910
It may have escaped
your notice, Thomas,

138
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,829
but London is not
a welcome place

139
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,747
for loyal subjects
just now,

140
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,875
our friends' houses lying
empty and ransacked,

141
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,877
your rebel redcoats
lining every street.

142
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,588
To keep the peace,
not to harm you.

143
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,592
You know where
to find us, my dear,

144
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,096
for the time being,
at least.

145
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,983
( distant birds chirping )

146
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,289
Fairfax: Oliver.

147
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,793
Oliver, we have
a meeting with the king.

148
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,880
( laughs )

149
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,549
Rumor has it you have
a home somewhere.

150
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,096
What do you think?

151
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,640
You forgot to say how often
he may cut his toenails.

152
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,475
We're late.

153
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,771
It's all here, Holles,
the troops' accounts.

154
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,232
- The treaty.
- Man: Mr. Oliver Cromwell, your majesty.

155
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,152
- Anyone else?
- Lord General Fairfax,

156
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,613
Mr. Denzil Holles,

157
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,406
Earl of Whitby,

158
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,035
Mr. Henry lreton,
Lord Baker,

159
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,037
Sir Richard Pritchard.

160
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,875
We have the peace terms,
your grace.

161
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,835
Let me guess.

162
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,296
You would...

163
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,466
dismantle my arsenal,
strip me of my power.

164
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,509
Power to abuse and steal
from your subjects

165
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,887
was never
rightfully yours.

166
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,557
Parliament merely wishes
to bind your grace to the law of the land.

167
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,935
No army shall be levied,

168
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,521
no taxes imposed upon the realm,
unless by the common...

169
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,315
...council of the realm.

170
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,443
I am familiar with the Magna Carta,
Mr. Holles.

171
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,821
Your hand in this too,
Lord Fairfax?

172
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,662
I would call you "General,"

173
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,455
but it is hard

174
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,500
to forget the day
you came of age,

175
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,420
when I laid my hand
on this shoulder

176
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,465
and named you
Lord Thomas Fairfax.

177
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,220
Amusing to think you swore loyalty
to me then forever more.

178
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,306
I swore to honor and defend my king
as he is meant to be.

179
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,683
You were proud
that day.

180
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,352
Trembled a little too,
as a I recall,

181
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,480
all the court whispering
of your beauty--

182
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,857
our angel-faced
Lord Thomas.

183
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,528
Who'd have thought
you'd be seduced

184
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,656
by the cheap glory
of a rebel's cause?

185
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,324
Your majesty wronged
this kingdom.

186
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,702
Lord or not, I was
compelled to protest.

187
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,204
Once your majesty
is a true king again,

188
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,164
I shall be glad
to serve him.

189
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,584
And your wife,
the lovely lady Anne,

190
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,670
how does she like
this rebel in you?

191
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,798
The nation you claim as yours
lies shattered and bereaved.

192
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,925
If you have any love for it,
you will sign.

193
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,014
I shall consider it,
Mr. Cromwell.

194
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,058
You will grant me time
to read it, I trust.

195
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,355
We await
your grace's reply.

196
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,776
You might permit
your wife to visit

197
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,903
as a sign of goodwill.

198
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,197
Even a common prisoner

199
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,491
would consider it his right
to have a little company.

200
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,186
- Cromwell: Welcome.
- Thank you.

201
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,813
Anne: you have no wish
to live near the town?

202
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,441
Live under the gaze
of a thousand watchful eyes?

203
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,276
That is not living.

204
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,113
How can you dream
unless you look at the sky?

205
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,783
My daughter Bridget.

206
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,702
- And you've met cousin Henry.
- At the celebration, I believe.

207
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,246
God's day to you,
General.

208
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,957
Henry.

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,793
Cromwell: My wife.

210
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,462
Our husbands are so like brothers,
I feel we are sisters already.

211
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,423
Please, come in.

212
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,475
You sent for me,
your grace?

213
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,144
( distant bells chiming )

214
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,908
I've read the terms,
Mr. Holles.

215
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,910
Quite a task you had

216
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,288
in marshalling all
of Parliament's demands.

217
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,585
So, "Merchants

218
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,505
shall protect
their trade;

219
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,842
The Puritans,
their blessed consciences,"

220
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,593
And oh, yes,

221
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,637
These latter pages--

222
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,430
"The right
of every Englishman

223
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,142
to life, liberty,
et cetera"--

224
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,395
are in a wilder tone
altogether.

225
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,147
Not yours I warrant?

226
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,483
Parliament has many voices.
I am merely the speaker.

227
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,653
And your vote counts
no more than any other.

228
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,907
Sir, if these triumphal
fighting men wish

229
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,743
to scatter my goods
across the common land,

230
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,954
risk your new
trading freedoms

231
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,875
with their wilder reforms,
you may protest,

232
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,712
but the majority
will win, hmm?

233
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,381
I'll hazard
I'm not alone

234
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,092
in feeling buffeted
by this puritanical storm.

235
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,178
If your grace thinks
I prefer the days

236
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,805
when your crown officers
roamed the land,

237
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,682
taxing and arresting
at whim...

238
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,977
But if you were
to command my officers,

239
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,937
Mr. Holles,

240
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,273
as Chief Royal Councillor,

241
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,942
second only to the king,

242
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,945
that would be a different prospect,
would it not?

243
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,288
I believe your grace will wish
to withdraw that remark

244
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,666
when he sees how it might be
improperly interpreted.

245
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,256
Lord, though we are not
worthy of thy blessings,

246
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,425
yet with glad
and humble hearts,

247
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,304
we praise thee
for the gifts of thy lands.

248
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,641
All: Amen.

249
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,480
My son Richard.

250
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,650
Fairfax: Glad to
meet you, Richard.

251
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,486
A small war divided the nation
while you were sleeping.

252
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,739
This man won us
the victory.

253
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,243
Remember next time,
you owe him your freedom.

254
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,912
- He exaggerates.
- I'm sorry.

255
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,179
Excuse me.
( gagging )

256
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,932
Annie.

257
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,142
I told you
to take special care.

258
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,490
Please, no one is
to blame.

259
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,910
I think...

260
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,204
I think I'm expecting
a child.

261
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,562
Holles: Following my meeting
with his majesty,

262
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,648
I am informed that those
still loyal to the king

263
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,818
will lead us to the palace
treasures tonight.

264
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,903
Cromwell must not
hear of this.

265
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,822
With the king's
gratitude,

266
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,658
we could still maintain
our trading freedoms

267
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,660
and there is
a guaranteed profit...

268
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,830
...profit for every man
who votes with us,

269
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,541
enough to buy each
of you a new estate.

270
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,128
( men yelling )

271
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,189
- Cromwell: Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

272
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,232
- Good night.
- Anne.

273
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,199
He will go back
to Yorkshire now.

274
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,452
We must not envy, coz.

275
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,996
There are enough of us here
to plow the nation

276
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,374
into godly shape.

277
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,543
Did you not hear
the men cheer?

278
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,546
Tommy's our emblem.

279
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,673
We are brutes
without him.

280
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,135
( Fairfax and Anne
laughing )

281
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,180
An heir is better
than any victory.

282
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,059
The king will not--

283
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,729
we will not be punished too harshly
for your rebellion, Thomas?

284
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,358
If our son
should suffer...

285
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,151
A son.

286
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,910
Get this stuff
out of here!

287
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,413
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

288
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,290
Get this stuff out
of here. Hurry!

289
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,164
I don't remember giving
you permission to leave.

290
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,214
The king asked for you.

291
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,800
For me?
You didn't tell me so.

292
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,136
What does he want?

293
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,930
To have me obey him.

294
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,266
Then he must be obeyed.

295
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,272
Gentlemen,
gentlemen,

296
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,775
first to the chief business
of the house:

297
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,778
Our representations
regarding the peace settlement

298
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,364
have been delivered
to his majesty,

299
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,326
together with
the supplementary chapters...

300
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,747
Managed to part with her
for a few hours

301
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,917
for the sake
of the nation, Tom?

302
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,503
- We are honored.
- Bad dreams?

303
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,546
Have you packed to go?

304
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,342
We haven't had time
to make plans.

305
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,345
Holles: However,
his majesty proposes

306
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,265
that if we return him
to the throne,

307
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,019
he will be inclined
to do so. To which end,

308
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,855
and in the interests
of a speedy settlement,

309
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,651
I propose we return
the king in due ceremony

310
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,487
two days hence.
All those in favor...

311
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,156
- Aye!
- What is this?

312
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,451
What are you doing?

313
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,204
We cannot budge
on this, Holles.

314
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,164
What in God's name
are you doing?

315
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,124
Counting votes,
Mr. Cromwell.

316
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,544
Must I remind you
how Parliament works?

317
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,504
How Parliament works?

318
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,007
This is how
Parliament works?

319
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,426
We fight long bloody years
for justice,

320
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,595
and when the king stamps
his foot and says he will not play,

321
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,055


we give up
all we've earned?

322
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,686
- We will not vote on this!
- Mr. Cromwell!

323
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,649
What are you plotting,
Holles?

324
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,859
Did the king turn your
feeble bowels to jelly

325
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,445
or did you strike
some Judas deal?

326
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,534
You would shed blood,

327
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,203
risk other mens' lives,
some of you your own,

328
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,080
yet you dare not
reform the king.

329
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,045
Digby, Proctor,
you fought with us at Marston.

330
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,463
Why this treachery now?

331
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,924
- Holles: And those against...
- Nay!

332
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,415
- Man: 46, sir!
- Holles: The motion carries!

333
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,460
( men cheering )

334
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,098
How is your father,
madam?

335
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,476
In good health,
your majesty.

336
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,188
And he wishes
the same for you.

337
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,608
I will not ask
after your husband,

338
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,736
although I trust
he will soon recover.

339
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,661
I knew it, Tom.
All the palace treasure gone.

340
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,120
I'll kill Holles for this.

341
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,957
Oliver, Oliver,

342
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,376
Let us prove it first.

343
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,799
- ( playing quiet tune )
- It's very pretty.

344
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,717
Sing with me.

345
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,719
Your majesty, I'm no match.

346
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,680
Please your king.

( stops playing )

357
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,225
Can you hold a tune,
Mr. Cromwell?

358
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,692
I have some business
with the king.

359
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,278
What a pity.
We were just getting started.

360
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,029
You will come again
tomorrow, my dear.

361
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,869
Well, Anne?

362
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,954
Excuse me, your majesty.

363
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,378
Who proposed the deal,
you or Holles?

364
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,173
- I beg your pardon?
- You think all men are born

365
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,967
to be your playthings,
given lips to kiss your hand,

366
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,344
knees to grovel at the edge
of your well-fingered gown?

367
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:28,348
( chuckles )
You've lost me, Mr. Cromwell.

368
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,351
Parliament is not a whorehouse built
to serve your private needs.

369
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,188
If you expect to buy back the crown
with your pirates' gold,

370
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,356
you're not only a thief
and a whoremaster, but a fool.

371
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,026
ls that so? I think your mother
omitted something

372
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,320
from your early education,
Mr. Cromwell.

373
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,948
Most men learn in the cradle
that I am the king

374
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,034
by divine appointment

375
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,120
and will not be taught
good government by you!

376
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,459
Was anything removed
from the palace last night?

377
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,628
Did you see anything?
You?

378
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,799
Holles.

379
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,842
Holles,

380
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,303
I see the palace goods have gone.
If you would explain it,

381
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,222
we might believe they
were not simply stolen.

382
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,973
These are transitional
times, Thomas.

383
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,726
One must expect a certain
amount of redistribution.

384
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,937
Our victory has been sold,
the troops betrayed,

385
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,815
and I've led God knows how many men
to their deaths for nothing.

386
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,900
Lady Fairfax.

387
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,403
Oliver is shouting
at the king.

388
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,988
He dismissed me
in a way I thought--

389
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,658
- Man: General.
- Holles: Drive on.

390
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,952
- I'll explain.
- Man: General!

391
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,837
Tom, is this
where they came?

392
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,381
Fairfax: Only the king's guards
have access to these tunnels.

393
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,633
- The king does not deny it.
- Nor Holles.

394
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,010
Then we are all that remains
of an honest government.

395
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,555
We still have the army.

396
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,640
But our general
is going home.

397
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,684
Not yet.

398
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,663
Hear this, men:

399
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,958
You long for your homes.
So do I,

400
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,169
but last night the nation's treasures
were plundered.

401
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,214
We must wait to dig
our neglected fields.

402
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,553
- Parliament has betrayed us.
- ( murmuring )

403
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,639
89 men voted today

404
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,975
to discount your efforts

405
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,645
and destroy the victory
you have won.

406
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,648
And unless those 89 men
are contained,

407
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,485
I fear there is no chance we shall see
the rewards we are owed.

408
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,196
I must ask you

409
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,033
for one last march--

410
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,328
not war, not bloodshed,

411
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,330
one brief call
to wake the nation.

412
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,666
Shall we crawl home
in meek silence

413
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,169
- because they wish us to?
- No!

414
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,172
- Or finish what we started?
- Finish it!

415
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,051
- Victory will be ours!
- ( cheering )

416
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,390
Man: Victory!

417
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,732
- Cromwell: So what next, Tom?
- The men must be ready to move at dawn.

418
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,778
We must act quickly
to keep the advantage.

419
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,238
So, to Parliament.

420
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,533
- If I've seemed out of temper lately...
- I understand.

421
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,869
You look in the mirror
after all these years without one,

422
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,788
It must be a shock
for an old man.

423
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,791
- ( laughs )
- Careful, Tom.

424
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,377
You're in
my territory now.

425
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,545
Perhaps I'll command this raid.

426
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,423
I only obey men
who know north

427
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,258
from south.

428
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,010
Tomorrow.

429
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,222
How are you feeling?

430
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,058
I'm not ill.

431
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,228
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I can see you're busy.

432
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,855
How did you find the king?

433
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,109
A little saddened, but willing,
I think to hear your demands

434
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,528
- if treated with a little courtesy.
- Fairfax: One moment.

435
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,090
Fairfax: I have arranged
for the king to be moved

436
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,134
to safety until
the treaty is signed.

437
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,927
He will not be harmed.

438
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,929
But tomorrow we will
arrest the traitors

439
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,597
who shared in
the palace treasures.

440
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,392
One half of the nation
already hates you.

441
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,020
Now you make enemies of the rest--
Margaret Holles, all our friends.

442
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,938
I am a soldier.
If I do not finish this--

443
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,024
What kind of inheritance
do you think you build

444
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,443
for our son?

445
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,612
You chose this course.
He will pay for it,

446
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,198
born into a world his father
turned upside down.

447
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,076
Think.

448
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,162
Think what his life will be.

449
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,319
I will send Holles
away to exile.

450
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,823
Naming him as thief
will be due punishment.

451
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,411
He will never serve
in Parliament again.

452
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,382
Thank you.

453
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,944
Fairfax:
"Dear Holles,

454
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,614
you and Margaret should leave
for France immediately.

455
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,741
Parliament is
to be disbanded

456
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,410
and the conspirators
arrested.

457
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,373
I need not tell you the risks
I've taken sending this letter.

458
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,708
I give you this warning
in the expectation

459
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,752
that should it
become necessary,

460
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,338
my son will have
one friend at least.

461
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,967
Go now, but understand
you may never return.

462
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,637
Yours, Thomas."

463
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,348
Urgent,
for Mr. Holles, please.

464
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,539
Holles: Hurry, my dear.

465
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,125
Margaret, quickly!

466
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,766
I shall see you...

467
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,020
this evening.
Mmm!

468
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,731
- That's mine.
- Hungry work in Parliament.

469
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,743
Tell the chef we have
guests this evening.

470
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,578
To the house.

471
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,136
Why have we stopped?

472
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,354
Cromwell:
Take him to the cells.

473
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,401
Man: Unhand me!
Unhand me! Get off me!

474
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,906
Unlike Holles to be late.

475
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,575
( clamoring )

476
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,026
For the safety
of the kingdom,

477
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,195
this house is disbanded.

478
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:06,116
The following members
will accompany my officers:

479
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,243
Sir Thomas Soame.

480
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,706
Hands off me, sir.

481
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,041
Nathaniel Fiennes...

482
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,006
Sir Walter Erle.

483
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,554
How dare you?
How dare you?

484
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,431
( laughs )

485
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,141
And one can only suppose

486
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,769
that Mr. Cromwell has cast
a spell upon your husband

487
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,188
and this made him forget
his God, his king,

488
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,358
his duty and his
privilege as a lord.

489
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,487
But I have no doubt your
influence will be enough

490
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,905
to remind him, my dear.

491
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,741
Thomas only wishes
for the treaty.

492
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,160
Have him take care,
madam.

493
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,957
My son and court
are in exile,

494
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,459
not dead.

495
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,302
- Move along.
- Unhand me, sir.

496
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,264
Man: Come on, get in line.
Keep up, get in line.

497
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,642
Get your hands off me!

498
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,816
( shouting )

499
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,630
Get your hands off me!

500
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,174
Not so high and mighty now,
are you, lord?

501
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,677
Unhand me, sir!

502
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,726
Man:
General Fairfax, sir?

503
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,395
He's with his troops.

504
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,438
Thank you.

505
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,819
I came to see if you--
if it was finished.

506
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,073
You think it's time Tom stopped running
around taking risks for the nation.

507
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,243
My wife was the same
when expecting her first child.

508
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,869
But by the second,
you taught her obedience?

509
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,498
Some men have
greatness in them.

510
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,000
You never saw Tom
in battle.

511
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,503
That man was put on earth
to lead armies and build nations,

512
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,672
not stay at home.

513
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,716
You're quick
at reading destinies.

514
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,802
You think I've misread his?

515
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,349
You think Tom should follow
the path of his forefathers,

516
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,601
suspect whatever is new,

517
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,021
change nothing,
question nothing.

518
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,107
I don't believe
I said that.

519
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,111
I'm not convinced that running
so fast is the best way to proceed.

520
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,155
You sent for me, father?

521
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,785
Come with me, son.

522
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,557
We caught him at the docks, General.
He was headed for Antwerp

523
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,392
With instructions
for Mr. Holles to exchange

524
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,686
all these goods for gold.

525
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,980
- Good work, officer.
- Sir.

526
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,065
ls our work done, sir?

527
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,568
Done.

528
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,612
- You can have your pay and go home.
- ( cheering )

529
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,495
They are the faces of
greed and treachery, son.

530
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,455
Take a good look.

531
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,836
Which one is
Mr. Holles, father?

532
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,308
- Guard.
- Yes, sir.

533
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:17,659
Where is he?

534
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,581
Tom.

535
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,169
Don't worry.
The worst is over.

536
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,631
Then you must tell the king.
He is not pleased with his new quarters.

537
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,551
If he accepts the terms,
he will escape them.

538
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,013
He's hinting that the prince
in the court

539
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,807
will avenge
his ill-treatment.

540
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,267
In war he sends
an assassin,

541
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,435
and in peace he makes
threats to my wife.

542
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,313
- So much for the godliness of kings.
- Cromwell: Tom!

543
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,148
Tom, where's Holles?
Was he not in Parliament?

544
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,650
- No.
- Traitor.

545
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,611
We have a traitor!

546
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,744
Was it you?
Did you warn Holles?

547
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,080
Or you?
Are you a traitor?

548
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,124
Oliver!

549
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,219
These men have no reason
to betray you.

550
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,055
Holles must have
heard the march.

551
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,224
Let's set up the trials.

552
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,774
- We'll need more guards in Whitehall.
- Best to keep the whole army.

553
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,527
Once the king's allies abroad
find we're putting him on trial...

554
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,072
The king? We haven't
discussed this.

555
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,617
What is there
to discuss?

556
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,036
You fought a war against
the king's corruption.

557
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,830
Why stop now?

558
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,751
I will talk to him.

559
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,422
He seems reluctant
to grasp the sword

560
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,382
which the Lord
holds out to us.

561
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,217
Tom fights in the field.

562
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,054
These corridors
are new to him.

563
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,614
Lord General Fairfax.

564
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,742
Sit.

565
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,912
Have a plum.
They're quite delicious.

566
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,122
Your wife brought them.

567
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,791
A splendid woman,

568
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,753
Your lady Anne. You'd be a fool
to lose her, Thomas.

569
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,047
I came to discuss
the kingdom.

570
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,096
She's expecting a child,
I understand.

571
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,514
Congratulations.

572
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,142
And I'm curious--

573
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,646
if it is a boy...

574
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,233
do you expect
to pass him your title?

575
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,778
We have lost half
our government to corruption

576
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,697
and still await
an olive branch

577
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,448
from our king.

578
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,450
All the country hopes
and would believe

579
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,328
you care for the people's
welfare above all else.

580
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,290
If you would
agree our terms,

581
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,626
we could be certain of it.

582
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,379
Am I your...

583
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,548
divinely-appointed king

584
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,466
set on earth by God

585
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,343
to rule this nation?

586
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,262
To reign, perhaps,

587
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,806
rather than to rule

588
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,683
as a shepherd cares
for his flock.

589
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,644
Doubt the sanctity
of your king

590
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,980
and you cannot
by that reasoning

591
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,692
think your own bloodline
divinely privileged.

592
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,612
Even if some
hypocrisy on your part

593
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,990
allowed the Fairfax
line to continue...

594
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,660
I shall not grant it.

595
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,792
Your son will be
plain "Mister," General,

596
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,920
and his sons too.

597
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,506
I hope your
wife understands

598
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,258
the sacrifice you make.

599
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,761
Your majesty, please.

600
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,724
( sighs )

601
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,945
I sign here?

602
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,408
( sighs )

603
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,414
No man commands a king.

604
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,751
No man tells
a king his limits.

605
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,378
A king

606
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,672
rules by God's grace.

607
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,800
Now get out.

608
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,188
( neighs )

609
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,976
I do not recognize this appetite.
( chuckles )

610
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,144
It will most likely
be a boy then, ma'am.

611
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,481
The king will
go to trial.

612
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,319
I did not wish it,
but he leaves us no choice.

613
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,739
There must be some
public penance

614
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,283
to heal the nation's wounds.

615
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,951
Pardon me, sir,
your secretary.

616
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,246
And if he will
not apologize?

617
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,998
A jury will decide.

618
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,459
A few years
in exile, perhaps.

619
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,462
- Or deposition.
- Deposition?

620
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,592
( whispers )
Thomas, you cannot.

621
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,013
Mr. Cromwell
would see you now.

622
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,561
( footsteps leaving )

623
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,905
( man whimpering )

624
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,663
( moaning )

625
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,796
I know
all about Holles...

626
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,593
and his accomplice.

627
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,726
( groaning )

628
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,311
Tell him.

629
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,104
Man: The king promised
to make Holles

630
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,231
his chief royal councillor

631
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,692
in exchange
for votes in his favor.

632
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,597
( moans )

633
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,142
They see a man seated on a throne
by accident or fate

634
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,269
doling out favors
in payment for loyalty.

635
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,397
- ( man screaming )
- ls it any wonder they grub for rewards?

636
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,940
It's done, sir.

637
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,238
What gave you
the right to kill a man

638
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,824
using an army officer,
my officer,

639
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,952
as your private
executioner?!

640
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,080
- This is reform.
- We are not butchers, Oliver!

641
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,666
- This is not war!
- ls that so, Tom?

642
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,462
When did it end?
I must have missed it.

643
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,955
Annie?

644
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,794
Elizabeth, where's--?

645
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,231
Annie?

646
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,650
( Anne crying )

647
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,848
Our child?

648
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,237
I'm so sorry.

649
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,037
Come home with me, please.

650
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,666
Try to sleep.

651
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,756
We weren't meant
for this, Thomas.

652
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,050
Our families have
always defended kings.

653
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,389
You have a duty.

654
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,896
( sighs )

655
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,951
( sobbing )

656
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,674
And how were the goods
to be exchanged?

657
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,514
Sir, you are under oath.

658
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,727
Sir!

659
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,315
( men chattering )

660
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,817
Man:
...The Lord is with us in his righteousness.

661
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,698
Cromwell:
How do you like it, Tom?

662
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,117
A fine robe
in which to try a king.

663
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,871
- Get yourself measured.
- ( distant bell ringing )

664
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,334
We lost the child.

665
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,004
Leave us. Go.

666
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,678
I'm so sorry, Tom.

667
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,241
Two gentlemen, madam.

668
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,825
They will not
give their names.

669
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,536
Shall I tell them
it is not convenient?

670
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,080
No no.

671
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,165
Send them in.

672
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,419
Gentlemen,
please come through.

673
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,755
Forgive this
intrusion, madam.

674
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,257
You may not remember,

675
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,883
but we are friends
of your father Lord De Vere.

676
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,261
I stayed at the manor
some years ago.

677
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,429
James, what a pleasure.

678
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,348
Madam, the Earl of York.

679
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,849
Madam.

680
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,851
I fear we find you
in ill health.

681
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,395
No no.

682
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,980
- I'm sure--
- Madam, we must be brief.

683
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,357
Our very being here
puts us all in jeopardy.

684
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,610
There are rumors of a trial.

685
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,154
It has lord Fairfax's blessing,
madam?

686
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,367
Well, as you can see...

687
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,577
my husband is not here
to explain his views.

688
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,623
Lady Fairfax, we do not
wish to embarrass you,

689
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,458
nor to alarm you,
but out of respect

690
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,043
for our former acquaintance,

691
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,379
it seems only right
to inform you.

692
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,631
The actions of your husband,
like those of his...

693
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,425
friend Cromwell,

694
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,678
are being daily reported
to the prince in exile.

695
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,638
We cannot expect
the prince to see his father

696
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,224
being insulted
without recompense.

697
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,728
Your husband has his own reasons
for the course he takes,

698
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,605
but I think the gracious
and respectful

699
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,232
young lady I met
those years ago

700
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,984
at your father's house

701
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,819
would still, I hazard,
have a proper

702
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,739
and admirable
reverence for the king.

703
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,285
Cromwell's bloody reign
of terror in the name of freedom

704
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,454
is turning the country
against them.

705
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,458
If we could only
visit his majesty

706
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,752
to alleviate his
situation somewhat...

707
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,428
I'm not at liberty
to help you, gentlemen.

708
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,474
Or even to offer
our condolences?

709
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,359
Now we have our victory,
what will you do, Tom?

710
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,695
Will you send Anne
home now?

711
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,410
You must not let her
blame you for this.

712
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,044
What say you we take
some air, you and I?

713
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,176
( birds twittering )

714
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,393
What was it you said
when we first met

715
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,478
and you trained me
at guns?

716
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,940
"One thing at a time."

717
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,485
Let's mend the nation, Tom.

718
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,072
You have years afterwards
to create an heir.

719
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,409
Perhaps I'm better
at taking life than giving it.

720
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,830
We are fathers
to the nation, Tom.

721
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,456
Man:
Mr. Cromwell, sir!

722
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,916
I said no interruptions!

723
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,793
The king escaped.

724
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,003
We caught him at the river, sir,
but his accomplices

725
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,005
- fled before we could get to him.
- From the safe house?

726
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,799
But no one knows
where it is.

727
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,055
I'll return with you
and see to his restraint.

728
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,484
Pardon me,
ma'am, visit--

729
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,410
I am sorry for your loss.

730
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,875
The king escaped
a few hours ago

731
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,877
with plans to raise
invasion troops

732
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,004
from his cousins
in France.

733
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,343
A messenger was found with letters
written in the king's hand

734
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,471


urging new war
on this country.

735
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,308
( sobbing )

736
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,060
Tell me you
did not do it.

737
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,438
I have not
left the house.

738
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,444
My maid is my witness!

739
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,866
What moves you most, Anne--

740
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,494
your love of Tom
or your hatred of me?

741
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,331
Why do you think
I hate you?

742
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,208
I underestimated you, Anne.

743
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,170
I see there are
two generals in this house.

744
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,970
( crying )

745
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,950
Oliver?

746
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,745
( whip cracks )

747
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,886
What have you done?

748
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,597
For god's sake, Annie,
do you blame me so much?

749
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,266
Respect my judgment
so little?

750
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,020
They told me
they wanted

751
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,273
to offer the king
their sympathies.

752
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,400
- And you believed them?
- I don't know.

753
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,195
I don't know what
I believed, Thomas.

754
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,993
I have tried to embrace
your new world,

755
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,370
tried to see
why everything

756
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,747
I once thought right and fit
must be torn down

757
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,916
because you
and your friends say so.

758
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,588
I don't have any
friends left to talk to.

759
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,675
The only people
who come to this house

760
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,635
come to warn me that--

761
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,681
that you may
soon be dead.

762
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,060
What was I supposed to do?

763
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,067
Not this, Annie.

764
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,702
I grieve the child too.

765
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,845

why a man should
hold power over a nation.

773
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,952
- Because he is born to it.
- Cromwell: I said a reason,

774
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,413

Man:
The Commons of England

786
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,139
are hereby assembled

787
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,057
on the 27th day of January

788
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,894
in the year
of our Lord 1649

789
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,063
for the trial
of Charles Stuart,

790
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,690
King of England.

791
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,918
Yours is the last name, General.

792
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,012
- Let us go.
- Fairfax: Wait.

793
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,555
Wait!

794
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,519
We are jurors.

795
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,396
We are here
to serve justice.

796
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,857
This is a mockery of it!

797
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,905
You cannot,
will not execute a man,

798
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,324
a king, before
he is found guilty!

799
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,244
Brethren...

800
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,997
How long have you been
plotting this, Oliver?

801
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,085
Since your traitor wife
colluded with the king

802
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,003
and proved him
rotten beyond repair.

803
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,383
You should be grateful

804
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,760
I've not made
a warrant for her too.

805
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,679
Do you kill the king
to spite me, Oliver,

806
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,266
to punish me
for the wife you envy?

807
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,059
I was fool enough
to think we were fighting

808
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,270
to better the world.

809
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,022
The king lives
or the man,

810
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,900
patronage or opportunity...

811
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,945
old world or new.

812
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,074
This is it, Tom.

813
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,577
This is our victory,

814
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:37,205
our chance
to set England free.

815
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,082
I am a reformer,

816
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,126
as I thought you were.

817
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,128
I will reform the king.

818
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,881
Anything less
is brutal cowardice.

819
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,929
Too late.

820
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,702
( doors slam )

821
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,579
Start the proceedings.

822
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,084
Charles Stuart,
King of England...

823
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,339
this parliament holds

824
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,342
that you have abused the power entrusted
to you by the law and--

825
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,053
Hold, Little.

826
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,305
I would know
by what power

827
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,682
I am called hither,

828
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,225
by what authority.

829
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,357
I am your king.

830
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,901
I have a trust
committed in me by God

831
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,946
by old and lawful descent.

832
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,447
I...

833
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,241
will not betray it
to answer a new,

834
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,453
- unlawful authority.
- Cromwell: You have heard the charge.

835
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,373
Answer it in the name
of the people.

836
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:04,376
I do stand more for the liberty
of the people of England

837
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:08,088
than any here that come
to be my pretended judges.

838
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,131
I ask again--

839
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,093
Your way of answer is
to interrogate the court.

840
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,761
Every man here
has lost a friend

841
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,930
to your
butchering troops.

842
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,099
We are satisfied
with our authority.

843
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,686
If power without law
may make laws,

844
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,314
may alter the fundamental
laws of this kingdom,

845
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,150
I do not know what
subject he is in England

846
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,819
that can be
sure of his life

847
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,570
or anything
he calls his own.

848
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,030
They sit here
by the authority

849
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,782
of the Commons
of England!

850
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,201
You and all your predecessors
are responsible to them!

851
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,203
Show me one precedent.

852
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,539
Cromwell: I understood you had
read the Magna Carta.

853
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,750
There is a contract between people
and king which you have broken.

854
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,169
Charles: The Commons of England
was never a court of judicature.

855
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,547
- I would know how they came to be so.
- ( doors open )

856
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:53,049
By choice, sound reasoning
and proven honesty,

857
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,135
which is a fairer
method than that

858
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,638
by which you became king.

859
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,915
( crowd murmuring )

860
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,862
I thought
we were fighting

861
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,947
for the same end at least,
but all this time--

862
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,366
Will you fetch the troops and return
with the king's friends?

863
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,495
...and destroy their pride
and hope in all that is sacred.

864
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,789
- Guilty.
- I'm speaking.

865
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,333
- Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
- Charles: I will be heard.

866
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,876
Sir, did you not
hear me?

867
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,878
I am your king!
( shouting )

868
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,891
We should be
at home by now.

869
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,103
I'm taking you
to your father's.

870
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,945
The troops are
agitating, brother.

871
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:39,781
There is a danger they may
storm the king's cell.

872
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,158
- See they don't.
- Without the general?

873
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,203
We must surely seize the general
before he reaches his noble friend.

874
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,664
Or bring him back
to control the troops.

875
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,750
He's a traitor! He could raise
a troop to ride against us.

876
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,468
I shall be general now.

877
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:33,793
Man #1 : Thomas has found
his way back to us.

878
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,588
He'll help us crush
this blasted rebellion.

879
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,340
- We've heard about your refusal to sign.
- Man #3: We'll have the king

880
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,759
back on his throne and every courtier
returned to his rightful--

881
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,971
Thomas: The king is dead.
His blood is written in the warrant.

882
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,598
If you want to
renew the nation

883
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,391
and not merely
his privileges,

884
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,393
you will plot ways to forge
a new and better government

885
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,646
instead of condemning us all
to fresh slaughter and old corruption.

886
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,762
I'm the only one
who can tame him.

887
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:29,265
- You explained that.
- Annie, he is no good without me.

888
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,975
And are you
no good without him?

889
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,686
Annie, please,
I can make him see.

890
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,858
I must at least try...

891
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,655
for all of us.

892
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,258
( bell ringing )

893
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,810
I have a good cause

894
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,854
and a gracious god.

895
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,860
I will say no more.

896
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,186
I go from a corruptible

897
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,854
to an incorruptible crown

898
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,899
where no disturbance
can be, none at all.

899
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,071
Remember.

900
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,303
Await my sign.

901
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,224
( gasps )

902
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,643
- ( slices )
- ( crowd gasping )

903
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,235
Red.

904
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,863
This is red blood...

905
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,448
like our own.

906
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,032
He was God on earth!

907
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,368
He was your prisoner,

908
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,912
your enemy,

909
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,831
a man who killed
your brothers for gold.

910
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,833
Have you forgotten?

911
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,086
With this, you are
subjects no more...

912
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,631
but citizens, free men.

913
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,092
You do not have to
kneel to any other man!

914
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,889
You are your own masters
commanding your own fate.

915
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,599
- You're back.
- I need to talk to Oliver.

916
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,186
He's very busy.
Make an appointment.

917
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,729
I'll wait,

918
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,773
if that's all right
with you, Henry.

919
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,614
- ls it for me?
- No, madam.

920
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:50,503
James invites us all
to his estate...

921
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:56,300
so that we may
ride and talk together,

922
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,554
think how best
to help the prince,

923
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:01,597
console ourselves.

924
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,892
I shall stay and wait here.

925
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,688
For how long?

926
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,023
For how long will you continue
to suspend your life,

927
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,276
waste your
youth and health,

928
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:16,195
forget your loyalty
to your true friends

929
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,406
in the hope that that
traitor may remember his?

930
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,792
Word from Scotland.

931
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,544
It's urgent.

932
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:39,010
Man: The Scots have declared
Prince Charles their new king.

933
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,053
Cromwell:
Then we shall invade before they do.

934
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,681
Full weapons. All troops ready
three days hence.

935
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,368
Building nations
is not the glorious affair

936
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,329
one might suppose,

937
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:08,789
just short nights
and fools asking questions.

938
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,084
If you've come to tell me
the people hate me,

939
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,337
you can save your breath.

940
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,213
I am not looking
for medals.

941
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:18,716
I brought them liberty.
They will learn to value it.

942
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,801
You will teach
them liberty?

943
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,056
Do not test me, Tom.

944
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,642
You've seen the traitors hanging
by their necks. You wish to join them?

945
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,894
You're not God, Oliver.

946
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:31,562
You cannot control the world.

947
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,814
No one has ever ruled
this country without a king.

948
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:35,650
I suggest you go
back to your wife!

949
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:38,736
Those holy fools
will never tell you the truth.

950
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,321
They dare not.

951
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,699
From this day on,
all you'll hear is lies.

952
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,743
The prince is
not even in Scotland!

953
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,413
The Scots are no threat
unless you make them so.

954
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,251
Do not provoke me, Tom.

955
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,920
Here's your choice, Oliver:

956
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,755
Listen to me,

957
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,840
or doom this republic
to an ill-planned,

958
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,009
brutal tyranny more hated
than the king's.

959
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,193
Tom...

960
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,465
I thought you'd
left me for sure.

961
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,329
( fire crackling )

962
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:38,731
You came back.

963
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,595
( chattering )

964
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:20,314
Portraits of the king.
Portraits of the king.

965
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,195
Here, madam. Only a shilling
for a lock of the king's own hair.

966
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:29,281
Oh, careful with that. That was
the last thing he ever touched.

967
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,953
- Arrest him.
- I've done no crime!

968
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,163
My trade, sir,
is an honest trade.

969
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:39,375
- Your trade makes children of grown men.
- Oliver, no!

970
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:42,253
( crowd screaming,
horses whinnying )

971
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,463
( screaming, moaning )

972
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,132
How can we expect
to build a nation of men

973
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,634
if they will ever
act like sheep?

974
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,095
- ( all screaming )
- ( gasping )

975
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,307
( man gagging )

976
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,513
I'm not armed, Thomas.

977
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,350
I merely come to offer
his majesty's greetings,

978
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,856
and to thank you
for sparing my life.

979
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,691
I told you to stay away.

980
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,109
And so I have.

981
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:51,322
The prince has been
good to us in exile.

982
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,825
He noted you refused to sign
his father's death warrant

983
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,119
and wonders at your role
in this republic.

984
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,667
How much is he
paying you to find out?

985
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,587
Yours is the only will
that can bend Cromwell's.

986
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,548
That's why you're here,
I warrant--

987
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,342
to reform him,

988
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,469
contain him
within the law.

989
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,933
But if that fails,
what then?

990
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,354
You've always been
the nation's warrior.

991
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:26,190
You raised your sword
against the last tyrant.

992
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,153
Get out.

993
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,239
Get out!

994
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,625
( door opens, closes )

995
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,680
Holles has been seen
in the city.

996
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,765
He's doubtless
visiting old friends.

997
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,411
Still not in
republican uniform, Tom?

998
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,454
I will wear it when you
sign the constitution.

999
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,415
You do remember.

1000
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:27,334
After the investiture.

1001
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,712
lnvestiture?

1002
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:31,463
Some say you keep
your courtly locks

1003
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,424
to welcome
the prince, Tom.

1004
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:35,175
Some say you're
the messiah.

1005
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:37,344
That does not
make it true.

1006
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,444
Thomas: Joyce.

1007
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,616
I'm going to do
what's necessary.

1008
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,493
I'll need your help.

1009
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,667
You'll die for it, sir.

1010
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,669
Not if you make
some distraction.

1011
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,838
To attention, sergeant!

1012
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,465
- Sir.
- Sir.

1013
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,469
Better I lift the gun.

1014
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,095
No, make a distraction.

1015
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,847
I shall do it.

1016
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,005
- ( chattering )
- Man: What's this, brethren?

1017
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,882
Man #2:
News of Cromwell.

1018
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:03,597
Thomas: How many times did
I save him in the field?

1019
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,643
I can't believe, after all
we've been through together,

1020
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:10,020
that it falls upon me

1021
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,730
to kill him.

1022
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,579
Cromwell:
Will you congratulate me, Tom?

1023
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:30,707
I know you cannot.

1024
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,168
You think I've fallen
in love with gowns and glory,

1025
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,004
but you're wrong.
I despise them.

1026
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,841
You told me to study
the lay of the land. So I have.

1027
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,512
And I see our countrymen must have
a captain, a monarch of sorts.

1028
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:47,182
Last night
I stayed up with a globe,

1029
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,892
planning.

1030
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,897
So many things--
fill ships with men,

1031
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,774
honest, working men,

1032
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,110
send them to trade
in the furthest lands.

1033
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,989
Learn new science,
raise new crops.

1034
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:04,241
You understand, don't you,

1035
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,785
What I'm trying to do,
what I'm reaching for, beyond all this?

1036
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,455
You want to find
a wilderness.

1037
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,303
Now, Lord Protector
of England.

1038
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,153
Your highness.

1039
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,124
( crowd chattering )

1040
01:27:02,842 --> 01:27:05,302
- It has been a long time,
- ( applauding )

1041
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,013
But I'm glad
you could be here.

1042
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,307
You never thought I'd come
this far, I warrant.

1043
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,850
The crowds must surprise you.

1044
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,644
You always surprise me, sir.

1045
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:16,980
And we've barely started.

1046
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,233
Come and dine
at Whitehall tomorrow.

1047
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,693
We'll tell you how we plan
to conquer the world.

1048
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:25,113
( crowd cheering )

1049
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,659
I'd get there
faster with you, Tom.

1050
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,872
( cheering loudly )

1051
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,124
They've always
loved you more.

1052
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,144
There is an adventurous
spirit in the nation.

1053
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:00,148
I know, I have seen it.

1054
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:03,944
I saw you risk
your lives in the war,

1055
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,071
sacrifice your
sons and brothers

1056
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,573
because you knew--

1057
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,993
because you knew that
this nation could be,

1058
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,036
- must be improved.
- ( crowd cheers )

1059
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:15,455
We knew.

1060
01:28:15,498 --> 01:28:18,500
Did we fight those years together
shoulder to shoulder for nothing?

1061
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,171
This is our chance to build
on the peace we've earned

1062
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:24,840
and create
a new world together.

1063
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:27,759
I am asking
for your silver,

1064
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,761
not your lives,

1065
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,097
roads to unite the land,

1066
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,308
ships to expand
the empire.

1067
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,146
Would you give up your gaming
and whoring to have these?

1068
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:41,523
( cheering, shouting )

1069
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,319
You are the new model
citizens of the world!

1070
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,407
Give up your courtly vices.

1071
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,909
Rise above this private greed.

1072
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,955
- Fix your eyes--
- ( crowd gasping, screaming )

1073
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,438
( wheezing )

1074
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,777
- Perhaps now you can see our concern.
- ( Cromwell screams )

1075
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:31,156
I saw that traitor's face.

1076
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,035
It was Sergeant Joyce.
You remember Joyce, sir.

1077
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,665
( grunting )

1078
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,173
That's the last time
you write my speeches, Little.

1079
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,550
( running footsteps
approaching )

1080
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:55,263
We'll never win them
with words in any case.

1081
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,765
A cause will unite them,

1082
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,600
holy cannon fire.

1083
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,813
What say we march
on the Scots, Tom?

1084
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:06,566
Still against it?

1085
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:09,444
I gave the order.

1086
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,905
Shine our civic torch on the brutes
before we teach the rest?

1087
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,533
I ordered the man
to shoot you.

1088
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:21,164
Don't be absurd, Tom.

1089
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,749
You saved my life.

1090
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,044
Man:
Make way! Make way!

1091
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,505
( panting )
We got the traitor covered, sir.

1092
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,883
He's on horseback.
My men are in pursuit.

1093
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:37,305
Don't tell me something
I can't hear, Tom.

1094
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:40,100
We're on the ridge.
It's all ahead of us.

1095
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:47,107
Soldier:
Take him to the tower, sir?

1096
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,318
No, to Tyburn.
Burn him in public.

1097
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:52,446
No, you have the wrong man!

1098
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,370
I find I cannot kill you,

1099
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,290
but one day soon a man
who loves you less well than I

1100
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,126
will raise his gun
to stop you.

1101
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:08,587
And he'll be right.

1102
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:18,263
Lord Protector was
but another name for king

1103
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,932
and you are a cruel one.

1104
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,685
I wish I could believe
that you will change,

1105
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,645
listen to reason,

1106
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,690
act with mercy,

1107
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,984
but I have seen enough
of your bloodlust

1108
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,487
and contempt for mens' lives
to know that you will not.

1109
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,533
Arrest him.

1110
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,911
Arrest the traitor.

1111
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,624
Take him!

1112
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,002
Burn him!

1113
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,298
Take him away!
Burn him!

1114
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,593
You would regret it, coz.

1115
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:04,267
- ( cheering )
- Woman: Our brave general!

1116
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,395
Man:
Our brave general Fairfax!

1117
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,571
( panting )

1118
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,091
( sobbing )

1119
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:56,486
Fairfax's voice: Anne and I
returned to our Yorkshire estate.

1120
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:58,488
Word of Oliver's exploits
reached my ears

1121
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,991
and his army grew more brutal
in pursuit of a vision

1122
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:03,535
that I no longer shared.

1123
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,245
I had turned my back
on a soldier's life.

1124
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:09,499
I was not to see him
again for many years.

1125
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,586
Then one night
news came from London.

1126
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:26,683
It's Oliver.
He's dying.

1127
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,190
You know I have to go.

1128
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,131
Oliver.

1129
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,931
If I could kill you,
I would have done it years ago.

1130
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,982
( grunting )

1131
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:21,112
They tell me you're building
quite an empire up there--

1132
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,741
new roads,

1133
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:25,950
bridges.

1134
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,580
You trying to outdo me, Tom?

1135
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,624
I cannot yet
match you for ships.

1136
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,253
ls this a game to you?

1137
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:39,547
Has it always been so?

1138
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,217
Did I merely imagine
we once fought a war,

1139
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:44,302
shared the same ambitions?

1140
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,970
What happened
to the general I once knew?

1141
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:47,472
He would have
finished the fight.

1142
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:50,934
He would have rallied
the people to this republic.

1143
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:53,311
His was the pretty face
they wanted.

1144
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:05,198
Do you not realize
how well you are loved?

1145
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:10,954
I warned Holles.

1146
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:14,666
Part of me wanted
to stop what we had started.

1147
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,711
I wanted my son,
the heir I was expecting,

1148
01:35:17,753 --> 01:35:20,171
to have at least
one friend.

1149
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,812
( crying )

1150
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:43,027
And your daughter?

1151
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,196
Molly-- a small rebel.

1152
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,282
She's learning left from right.

1153
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:49,159
Come to Yorkshire.
She can teach you.

1154
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:51,244
These fools will not
let me out of the room.

1155
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,207
I'd have to
slip out in disguise.

1156
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,334
( chuckles )
Make it soon--

1157
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:01,129
for the hunting. No chance
you'll shoot anything, of course.

1158
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,089
So my deer are safe.
( laughs )

1159
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,637
I was counting on you.

1160
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:15,351
You let me down.

1161
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,072
Fairfax's voice:
We were never to meet again

1162
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:29,908
and he died
soon afterwards.

1163
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,954
Two years later
we had a king once more.

1164
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,915
On his return from exile,

1165
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,250
Prince Charles ordered that
Oliver's corpse be dug up

1166
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:41,669
and displayed
on the public gallows.

1167
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,259
I see his face still,
hear him asking me,

1168
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,637
"What has changed?"

1169
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:52,764
I tell him that I have.

1170
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:59,145
I wonder
after all these years

1171
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,064
how things
might have turned out

1172
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:03,608
had I stayed
by his side.

1173
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,528
To be true to myself,
I had to let him down.

1174
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,281
He was a man I loved,

1175
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,575
but one I failed.
