-Oh, yes, sir.

483

What'll I tell the blacksmith ?
Tell him Mr. Mason
is my friend...and my guest.

484
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,657
He won't ask
any other questions.

Go ahead, Pat.

486
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:12,667
Go with her, Barry.
Barry, I know, is your name.

487
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,604
Your voice explained to me
that "Mason" isn't.

488
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:20,309
But as I told you before, names are
of such little importance.

-Not very...right along here.

is he really all right ?

I'd be kinda happy to know.

a parallel for the present
world predicament.

We stand defeated
at the outset.

637

You, Esmeralda, have sympathy,
yet you're willing to remain passive,
and let the inevitable happen.

638
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:13,291
I have a belief, and yet I'm tempted
to let myself be overridden by force.

The rest of you, with the exception
of this malignant jerk,

and, therefore, confused.

- Fascist !

You know how we stand so far.
The twins, as usual, are on opposite sides.

644

And so their votes pair.

Titania's on both sides at once
and, therefore, neutral.

646

The major is for delivering
these young people to the police,

647
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,822
and I, frankly,
am against it.

648

is up to you.

any more than anybody else,

Never a question.

655

And I've been thinking,
it's the good people that stick
when anybody's in trouble,

656
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:14,555
and there aren't many
good people in the world.

I think that we, all of us,
know that better than most.

You'll abide by the will of the majority.

It's more crowded and a guy
doesn't stand out, like here !

Hang onto your nerve.

the place spotted ?

You'll have to find another
place and store all this stuff.

fellows are probably headin' for New York.

Now, if you'll give me your address

we can contact you
back there.

Or maybe you could wire me
about which plane you're taking...

We may want
to get a hold of you fast.

I can do that when I
get back to my uncle.
-Okay, Miss Martin, just keep in touch.

I'm glad we came this way.
It adds a few miles, to our trip...

825
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:34,058
but somehow, I've become
a little sentimental.

01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,494
I want to take
a last look at it.

827

A great monument to man's unceasing industry...

and to his stubborn
faith in the future.

Are you carrying any cameras
or firearms at all ?

Nothing at all, officer.

No, sir.

for the defense plants there.

-Do you know Tobin very well ?

836
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:09,695
No.  I met him just that once at his ranch.
-Did he have the child with him ?

837
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:13,132
His grandchild ?  Yes.  He seemed to be
very fond of her.

838
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,068
Yes.  That's one of the things
I like about old Tobin:

839
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:18,305
his love for that little girl.

840

Evidence of a good heart.

-Oh ?

842
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:27,947
Two boys.  Nice little fellows.
Aged two and four.

843
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:30,216
The four-year-old
is naughty at times.

844
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,219
He's quite a problem.

845
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:37,758
We get him a new toy and within
half-an-hour it's smashed to bits.

846
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:41,762
And then, sometimes,
after it's all over,

847
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:45,365
he seems almost sorry.

848
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:48,503
Sometimes I wish my younger child
had been a girl.

849
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:53,074
In fact, my wife and I often argue
over a little idiosyncrasy I have.

850
01:02:53,142 --> 01:02:55,643
I don't want his hair cut short
until he's much older.

851
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,612
Do you think it'd be bad for him ?
-Well, I don't know, it might be.

852
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,217
When I was a child,
I had long golden curls.

People used to stop
on the street to admire me.

We're in trouble now.

951
01:09:32,694 --> 01:09:36,897
So the most important thing is to
make sure of everyone around us.

952
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:40,235
Mr. Kane.  I'm just not sure.
I want to know that he's all right.

953
01:09:40,303 --> 01:09:43,472
[ Tobin ]  All right ?
What an understatement!

954
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:45,540
He's much more than that !

955
01:09:45,608 --> 01:09:48,777
He's noble and fine and pure.

956
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:53,149
And so, he pays the penalty that the noble
and the fine and the pure must pay
in this world:

957
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:55,318
he's misjudged by everyone.

958
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:59,321
Why, even the police have a
completely erroneous impression of him.

959
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:02,959
I can assure you that,
contrary to what is supposed,

960
01:10:03,026 --> 01:10:05,761
and to what he may have told you,

961
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:08,665
that young man is certainly not one
of his country's enemies.

962
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:12,736
[ Mrs. Sutton ]  Charles, you're joking !
-I mean exactly what I say.

963
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:16,139
Mr. Kane is definitely no part
of our little organization.

964
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:20,310
Your protege.  Well, you've done splendidly.
You bring him here, you idiot !

965
01:10:20,378 --> 01:10:23,014
What in heaven's name
are we going to do with him ?

966
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:25,517
That's a very appropriate question.

967
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:30,087
Not much we can do with him.
I made the mistake once of
turning him over to the police.

968
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:34,591
That's even more impossible at the moment.

969
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:39,164
I'm afraid there's only
one thing we can do.

970
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:43,701
You see, the new law threatens all of...

971
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:46,271
us...with the death penalty.

972
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:50,643
So I'm afraid we'll have to apply
the ancient axiom:  a tooth for a tooth.

973
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:52,711
A Kane for a Tobin.

974
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:55,048
Please don't discuss things
of that sort here.

975
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,417
It's rather nauseating and quite out of place.

976
01:10:58,484 --> 01:11:01,954
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.

977
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:05,491
We must take all precaution.
-Of course, we must also continue
with our work.

978
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,596
It's too risky now.  We're abandoning
the dam.  We must remain inactive for a while.

979
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:13,499
Inactive ?  You are utterly mistaken.
Once we do that, our organization is finished.

980
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:16,502
We must carry on at all cost.
- What about tomorrow's work ?

981
01:11:16,571 --> 01:11:19,974
Tomorrow's work ?  You can't
abandon that after all your preparations.
-But Charles,  the risk !

982
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,509
Is great !  I know that.

983
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:26,881
Unfortunately, we will have
to carry out our orders.

984
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,050
I'm leaving for the Caribbean now.

985
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:33,521
My position here is more impossible
than all of yours.

986
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,092
I'm rather looking forward
to Central America.

987
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,994
Havana will be very gay this season.

988
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,398
You know, somehow I've suddenly
had enough of this country.

989
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,934
The war has made it grim.

990
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:49,505
You're leaving us here to face
everything, and you'll be on a boat...

991
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,673
sailing along...it all sounds idyllic.

992
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:56,245
Oh, Charles, Charles,
It's...This whole thing...It's impossible !

993
01:11:56,313 --> 01:12:00,382
It's...panicky.
-I'm deeply sorry.

994
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:05,054
Ah, there you are, darling !
How unbecoming for a hostess
to hide herself away.

995
01:12:05,122 --> 01:12:09,291
Am I intruding ?  I'm so sorry, but I just
must kidnap Henrietta.  She'll be back.

996
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,862
I've had some trouble with these people.
They're doing the catering.  And making a
rather horrid mess of everything!

997
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:16,100
Our boy will appear any minute
with the caviar !  I assure you !

998
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,502
[ Tobin ]  Don't be a fool !
Get to the house phone.

999
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:21,238
How'd you get here ?
-They met me at the airport.
I thought they were the police.

1000
01:12:21,305 --> 01:12:25,342
Wait a minute.  No use
trying the way I came in.

1001
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:28,879
Let's walk right out through
the front door !  Might as well !

1002
01:12:28,947 --> 01:12:31,782
Yes, sir !  We'll watch the back exit.
They won't get out.

1003
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,820
<i># [ Dance Band ]</i>

1004
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:46,165
No good.  See the one on the other side ?
He's one of them.  We'll never get out that way !

1005
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:49,768
What can they do ?
Plenty.  They'd grab us.
We wouldn't have a chance.

1006
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:53,705
These people would see them.
If anyone had a question,
we're gate crashers.

1007
01:12:53,773 --> 01:12:56,175
[ Exhales ]  Barry, this is awful !

1008
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:59,645
It's like a bad dream.  All these people.
Isn't there anyone we can trust ?

1009
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:02,247
Sure.  All of them.
Only which one ?

1010
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:13,160
Excuse me.  Uh, this may
sound sort of crazy.

1011
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:15,696
I don't even know
how to start.

1012
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:19,733
But this whole house is a hotbed
of spies and saboteurs.

1013
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:22,435
I'm not being silly.  I assure you,
even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton...

1014
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:25,873
What's the matter
with you, sir ?  You're drunk.

1015
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,642
You're not even dressed.

1016
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:33,980
What'd he say ?
He thinks I'm drunk.

1017
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:37,517
[ Guest ] When I read in the papers
what those Japs are doing...

1018
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:41,122
[ Man Snapping Fingers ]  Beat it out !
Eight to the bar.

1019
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,791
Yeah, man.  Stay in there and pitch.
#  [ Swing ]

1020
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:47,695
Pardon me.  Did you pay $25
to get in here tonight ?

1021
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:49,897
No, not exactly. The boss gave
me a ticket.  Why ?

1022
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:53,869
I need your help.  We're in the middle
of the biggest fifth columnists in this country.

1023
01:13:53,937 --> 01:13:56,671
Are you kiddin' ?  What's the gag ?
-No.  I'm on the level.

1024
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,741
Aw, you're kiddin' ?  We got a wagon to join,
The guy's tryin' to rib me.

1025
01:13:59,808 --> 01:14:04,279
Aw, sling him your curve.
Beat it out, son; beat it out!

1026
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:16,392
Excuse me, sir.  I'd like to talk to you
about something very important.

1027
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,594
What is it, Mr. Kane ?

1028
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,464
You know it's hopeless.

1029
01:14:21,531 --> 01:14:25,469
Why don't you join Mr. Tobin
upstairs in a little supper ?

1030
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:27,371
I'll show you the way.

1031
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:58,135
Barry, before they get to us, stop
the music and tell them !
Tell them all !

1032
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:01,971
This is the Sutton mansion.  I'm just
a guy from Glendale, California,
wanted by the police.

1033
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,073
They'll grab me as soon
as I open my mouth.

1034
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:08,546
What are you gonna do ?  We can't
just stand here.  I know where we'll be safe.
 [ # ]

1035
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,852
Barry, I'm scared.

1036
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,289
It's so unreal, all these people dancing
and having a good time.

1037
01:15:18,357 --> 01:15:20,592
And when you try to warn them,
they laugh at you.

1038
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:25,564
They think you're drunk. That grey-haired
man you spoke to seemed like such
an honest citizen.

1039
01:15:25,632 --> 01:15:30,401
Mmm, just a friend of the family.  I guess
the room's well sprinkled with them.

1040
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,503
They're so smart.
That's what frightens me.

1041
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:34,707
Yeah, they're smart,
because they're ruthless.

1042
01:15:34,774 --> 01:15:37,643
It's easy to win when you
forget about the rules.

1043
01:15:37,711 --> 01:15:40,846
[ Sighs ] A man named Fry drops
a wallet in California,

1044
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:43,181
and we wind up here,
you and me.

1045
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:45,150
That's the only good part:
I'm with you.

1046
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:48,788
I wish it were somewhere else...
the North Pole...I wouldn't care.

1047
01:15:48,856 --> 01:15:53,426
We might wind up there too, chasing
Fry over an old glacier !
[ Chuckles ]

1048
01:15:53,494 --> 01:15:57,764
Fry.  He seems so small now.
I'd forgotten about him.

1049
01:15:57,832 --> 01:16:00,166
So had I.

1050
01:16:00,234 --> 01:16:04,437
We can't just go on dancing
like it's Saturday night
at the Palladium.

1051
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:06,406
We can't just wait
'til they get us.

1052
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:08,608
What do you think
they'll really do ?

1053
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:11,745
Well, right now, they're probably haggling
over the price with Murder, Incorporated.

1054
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:16,851
Oh, Barry, please !
-Sorry, Pat,  I hate to be out of it now,
there's still so much to do.

1055
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:20,053
If staying alive was ever important.
You heard what they said...

1056
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,390
Something about a job they're going
to do tomorrow in Brooklyn.

1057
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:25,559
The navy yard.
-One of us has got to get out of here.

1058
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,895
Maybe if I start something,
you can make a break for it.

1059
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:31,266
What about you ?
-You can't worry about me, we've
gotta take a chance.

1060
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,769
[ Sighs ] Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have
met you a hundred years ago ?

1061
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:37,205
On a beach somewhere.

1062
01:16:37,273 --> 01:16:41,376
Bathing suits looked awfully funny
a hundred years ago.

1063
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:44,713
I'll bet you'd look
beautiful though.

1064
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,290
Afraid we're not behaving
very well.

1065
01:16:54,357 --> 01:16:57,092
What's the difference ?
We weren't invited anyway.

1066
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:07,436
Pat, this moment
belongs to me.

1067
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:10,839
No matter what happens,
they can never take it away
from me.

1068
01:17:10,907 --> 01:17:12,809
Oh, pardon me.
Do you mind ?

1069
01:17:23,254 --> 01:17:26,589
Oh, excuse me. Would you, uh...
Would you care to dance ?

1070
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:29,493
Why, yes.  Certainly.

1071
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:32,796
Oh, you're really
a much better dancer.

1072
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:35,298
Thanks.  Who was the man
you were dancing with ?

1073
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,667
I have no idea.
I never saw him before.

1074
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:39,769
No, I mean the man
that just left you.

1075
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:43,240
I know.  That's who I'm
talking about.  I never
saw him before in my life.

1076
01:17:51,816 --> 01:17:55,052
Oh, what a pity.
That was lovely.  I hope
you will ask me again.

1077
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,090
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1078
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:05,262
Well, young man, you seem to
be enjoying yourself.
Charming party, isn't it ?

1079
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,501
Where is she ?
-Your young lady ?  I thought
you were taking care of her.

1080
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:12,938
Perhaps she has a headache
and is lying down somewhere.

1081
01:18:13,006 --> 01:18:16,408
Would you like to come with me
and look for her ?

1082
01:18:16,476 --> 01:18:18,377
Hold on.

1083
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:29,489

Your attention, please.

1085
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:35,928
I...I have something
to tell you.

1086
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:40,234
Something you ought to know about
this house and about your hostess.

1087
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:51,045
Sir, before you go on, take a look
at the curtain on the balcony.

1088
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:11,299
I'm...uh, not much
of a...public speaker,

1089
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:14,436
Ladies and Gentlemen,
and, uh...

1090
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:17,838
some of you are probably wondering
how I can tell you anything
about your hostess...

1091
01:19:17,906 --> 01:19:21,343
that you, uh...
you don't already know...

1092
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:25,214
her graciousness,

1093
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:27,450
her kindness,
her many charities.

Well, I want to tell you that you
have a big surprise coming,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

Tonight, in this house, for the benefit
of this great cause...

1096
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:40,629
for which she's already done so much,

1097
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:44,333
our hostess, Mrs. Sutton, is
putting up for auction...

1098
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,902
one of her most
treasured possessions,

01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,372
one of the famous Sutton jewels.

1100
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:06,356
Mrs. Sutton, would you
kindly step forward ?

1101
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:19,070
Thank you.
- Mr. Kane, the young lady

Will someone please, uh,
uh...Admiral ?

1105
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:37,388

1115
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,528
You seem to have a soft spot
for that young lady.

1116
01:21:15,596 --> 01:21:17,831
You can't afford to make
yourself that vulnerable...

1117
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:20,701
not when you're out trying
to...save your country.

1118
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:25,839
Why is it you sneer every time
you refer to this country.  You've
done well here, I don't get it.

1119
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:29,877
No, you wouldn't. You're one
of the ardent believers...
a good American...

1120
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:33,748
all the millions like you, people
who plod along without
asking questions.

1121
01:21:33,816 --> 01:21:38,052
I hate to use the word stupid,
but it seems to be the only
one that applies...

1122
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,456
the great masses,
the moron millions.

1123
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:46,060
Well, there are a few of us who are
unwilling to just troop along;

1124
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:49,531
a few who are clever enough to see
that there's much more to be done...

1125
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:53,000
than just live small,
complacent lives;

1126
01:21:53,068 --> 01:21:57,306
a few of us in America, who
desire a more...profitable
type of government.

1127
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:01,210
When you think about it,
Mr. Kane,

1128
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:05,281
the competence of totalitarian
nations is much higher than ours.

1129
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,283
They get things done.

1130
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,919
Yeah.  They get things done.

1131
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:13,223
They bomb cities, sink ships,
torture and murder...

1132
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,592
so you and your friends can eat
off a gold plate.  It's
a great philosophy.

1133
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:20,529
I neither intend to be bombed
nor sunk, Mr. Kane.

1134
01:22:20,597 --> 01:22:22,698
That's why I'm leaving now.

1135
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:27,872
And if things don't go right for you...
If, uh, WE should win...

1136
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:29,774
then I'll come back.

1137
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:33,778
Perhaps I can get
what I want then: Power.

1138
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:37,748
Yes.  I want that as much as you
want your comfort or your job...

1139
01:22:37,816 --> 01:22:40,118
or...that girl.

1140
01:22:40,186 --> 01:22:43,988
We all have different
tastes, as you can see.

1141
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:48,660
Only I'm willing to back my tastes
...with the necessary force.

1142

You certainly make it sound
smooth and easy.

1143

Well, that's a trick.

1144

I know the results of
that power you believe in.

1145
01:22:57,236 --> 01:23:00,272
It killed my friend, and it's
killing thousands like him.

1146
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,341
That's what
you're aiming at.

1147
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:04,943
And it doesn't bother you,
I can see that.

1148
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:07,012
Because you
really hate all people.

1149
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,148
Let me tell you something.

1150
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:12,117
The last four or five days
I've learned a lot.

1151
01:23:12,185 --> 01:23:14,620
I've met guys like you,
and I've met others--

1152
01:23:14,688 --> 01:23:17,489
people that are helpful and
eager to do the right thing,

1153
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:21,660
people that get a kick out of
helping each other fight the bad guys.

1154
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,830
Love and hate.

1155
01:23:23,897 --> 01:23:26,733
The world's choosing up sides.
I know who I'm with.

1156
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:30,503
There are a lot of people on my side...
millions of us in every country.

1157
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:32,905
And we're not soft;
we're plenty strong.

1158
01:23:32,973 --> 01:23:35,842
And we'll fight standing up on
our two feet, and we'll win !

1159
01:23:35,909 --> 01:23:38,846
Remember that, Mr. Tobin, We'll win,
no matter what you guys do.

1160
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:41,782
We'll win if it takes from now
until the cows come home !

1161
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:47,821
Mr. Kane, I think we've discussed
the rights of man sufficiently.

1162

arrange for Mr. Kane to sleep
somewhere tonight ?

-Very good, sir.

-Yes, sir.

-Yes, thank you.

It doesn't matter what
arrangements we've made,
to what trouble we've gone.

1171
01:24:43,113 --> 01:24:45,814
This whole job hangs
on one thing: timing.

1172
01:24:45,882 --> 01:24:48,584
If the section of the slipway goes up
before the actual launching,

1173
01:24:48,652 --> 01:24:50,686
then all our efforts have been wasted.

1174
01:24:50,754 --> 01:24:53,223
If you blow her too late,
then you just scare the crowd.

1175

Timing, timing, timing.

1176
01:24:56,127 --> 01:24:59,829
That button must not be pressed
until the ship starts to move.

1177
01:24:59,897 --> 01:25:01,932
What arrangements
have been made for getting out of there ?

1178
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,670
As soon as the cables are unhooked,
this truck goes.
We got it fixed at the gate.

1179
01:25:06,738 --> 01:25:09,140
Who's handling the camera
near the slipway ?
-I am.

1180
01:25:09,207 --> 01:25:13,243
The wires to the explosives were
laid last night.  All I have to do is
to hook them up to the camera.

1181
01:25:13,311 --> 01:25:16,513
Too bad we have to
lose a good camera.

1182
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:20,117
Well, everything seems to be taken 
care of.  I'll be waiting for you
at the newsreel office.

- Yes.

How is she ?
-Okay.  She's having her breakfast.

1186
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:39,471
Any trouble keeping her quiet ?
-No.  I made a deal with her.

1187
01:25:39,538 --> 01:25:44,208
You see, she got tired of 
having that adhesive tape
over her eyes and mouth.

Well, I hope you get rid
of her soon.

-There it is.

I'm sorry we couldn't keep
you at the house,

-Oh, that's a trade secret.

for you here.

Mr. Kane's quarters are nearer
the ground, but he's being
well looked after...

01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,916
