1
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,119
All right, oars up.

2
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,139
Welcome to Rocky Point, boys.

3
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,184
Bring her in.

4
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,461
(men chattering)

5
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:30,909
Another one.

6
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:32,898
Got it.

7
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,649
- What now?
- We go visit an old friend.

8
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:38,561
Come on.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,756
Our target lives in the hamlet
known as Rocky Point.

10
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,907
He's a former resident of Setauket

11
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:50,424
using his wealth and standing

12
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,924
to masquerade as a Tory,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,510
hiding in plain sight.

14
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,013
Today we rein in this traitor

15
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,415
quietly poisoning the countryside.

16
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:08,792
His name is Samuel Culper.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,856
- <i> (door bursts open)</i>
- (screams)

18
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,074
Don't move! Don't move!

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,828
- Don't move!
- (guns cocking)

20
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,331
Caleb Brewster?

21
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,534
Hello, Beekman.

22
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,252
You men will leave with me.

23
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,168
The rest of the unit
will keep their posts.

24
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,561
We shall return after daybreak tomorrow.

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,593
Sir, all this for one man?

26
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:34,929
Kill a Queen's Ranger? Are you insane?

27
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,383
A touch. But I wouldn't worry
yourself about this one.

28
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,118
<i>He'll be dead before
he knows what hit him.</i>

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,293
I imagine it will be quite
the surprise for him.

30
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:45,940
Fall out!

31
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,232
(Robert growls)

32
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:56,885
Ah.

33
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,437
Dead man marching.

away from Thomas.

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,960
You must think I'm foolish.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,024
A mother's concern is never foolish.

53
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:37,664
In fact, your sensibility
is why I'm here.

54
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,329
I need your help.

55
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,323
I'm doing everything I can
to broker a truce

56
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,125
between Abraham and Major Hewlett.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
- I doubt that can be done.
- But I've done it, Mary.

58
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,162
Nearly, that is.

59
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:02,251
Hewlett has agreed to let you, Abe,
and Thomas leave Setauket unharmed.

60
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:05,504
But Abe has no plans
to honor this agreement.

61
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,425
In fact, he plans to betray it

62
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,508
and murder Hewlett.

63
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:14,980
The major is using me
as collateral against my husband.

64
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:17,266
Forgive me if my sympathy
for him is lacking.

65
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:19,351
I'm not appealing to your sympathy.

66
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:22,620
Abe has no plans to leave
even after the deed is done.

67
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:26,825
He is determined to stay
and continue his work for Washington

68
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,028
no matter how much danger it puts him in

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,794
or you or Thomas.

70
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,225
Reason with him, Mary.

71
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,785
He won't listen to me anymore.

72
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,206
- Perhaps he'll listen to you.
- I believe in Abraham.

73
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,042
And I have faith
that he will protect us.

74
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:45,980
If you don't share that belief, maybe
it's you who should leave Setauket.

75
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,946
Maybe that's what's best for everyone.

Reverend. Morning.

79
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:13,755
Ah, Benjamin.

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,515
Will you be traveling
along with the camp?

81
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,326
No, no, I'm off to Fairfield.

82
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,660
What, New Jersey?

83
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,380
Yeah, the good Reverend Martin

84
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:23,882
has been ministering to my home
church in my stead.

85
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,251
He hasn't been paid in quite some time.

86
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,754
Riding out after the morning
benediction to see it done.

87
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,889
That means you'll be crossing
through no man's land.

88
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,391
That's far too dangerous.

89
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,728
I can't abandon my duties
because the road is rough.

90
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:38,897
Reverend, you haven't read
the scouting reports.

91
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,067
Tory cowboys hunt
for men traveling alone.

92
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,319
Let me send an escort along with you.

93
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,271
I've made the trip before, my son.

94
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:50,159
Don't worry. I'll be back before
the camp reaches Middle Brook.

95
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,781
<i>Now, let's begin with
the words of salm 23.</i>

96
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,868
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

98

<i>He leadeth me beside the still waters.</i>

<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

100
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:13,882
<i>He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness</i>

101
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,434
<i>for His name's sake.</i>

102

103
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,807
<i>I will fear no evil</i>

104
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:24,476

- Anything?
- Not yet.

108
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:37,382
The men are patrolling
the main route into town

109
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:40,219
and they're to report to me
any news of Simcoe's return.

110
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:42,221
Or lack thereof.

111
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:45,224
I know this is difficult, waiting,

112
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,142
but try not to worry.

113
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,394
I have faith we'll hear the right news.

114
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,013
It's not that. It's...

115
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,450
I never gave you an answer

116
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,904
when we spoke before
about your proposal.

117
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,050
Oh.

118
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,542
I understand. I know
these things take time.

119
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,005
I have considered it.

120
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,248
And I do wish to marry you.

121
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,634
Oh.

122
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,589
But if we are to live
as husband and wife,

123
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,516
it can't be here in Setauket.

124
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,478
But you... you live here.

125
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,821
What's this?

126
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:29,285
It's from my husband.

127
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:31,877
From Selah.

128
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:36,525
He's in Philadelphia now
and wishes to remarry.

129
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:39,361
He's arranged to purchase a divorce

130
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,044
and has asked me to sign.

131
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:45,181
The truth is I received this weeks ago

132
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,171
and I've been busy pretending I didn't.

133
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,624
But now with things as they
are between you and me,

134
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,042
I just... I can't...

135
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,794
He's asking you to assume the fault.

136
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:59,168
And to confess to committing
adultery with Abraham Woodhull.

137
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,352
Well, we will not concede
to this blackmail.

138
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,554
Selah Strong is a traitor to the Crown

139
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,139
and we can petition the magistrate

140
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,890
for a divorce on the
grounds of desertion.

141
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,226
- Judge Woodhull despises me.
- No, not at all.

142
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,228
He holds me in no favor.

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,030
And the truth is I did commit adultery.

144
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,816
And I won't allow
my shame to become yours.

145
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:22,321
Anna, nothing you can do
can cause me to feel shame.

146
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:23,560
Nothing.

147
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,329
If you truly mean that...

148
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,832
you'll go away with me.

149
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:36,501
Where?

150
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:37,751
To your home.

151
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,063
To Scotland.

152
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,508
But you'd still be married.

153
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,422
We'd be guilty of bigamy.

154
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:48,943
That wouldn't follow us
across the ocean.

155
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,900
We can start a new life together.

156
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,487
This is our chance, Edmund.

157
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:59,135
Then we shall seize it.

You've strayed from the path, Reverend.

161
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,463
Benjamin. What are you doing here?

162
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,887
We received word
that you were a traitor,

163
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,384
but now I have the proof.

164
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,545
Proof?

165
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,589
Oh, no, this... this isn't what...

166
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,342
- let me... let me explain.
- Explain what?

167
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:10,312
How you were paid
by Royal Governor Tryon

168
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:13,265
and Mayor Mathews to spy on our camp?

169
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,733
- No.
- No?

170
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,768
Well, perhaps
the contents of that letter

171
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,294
can clear things up, eh?

172
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,440
Why not read it to me?

173
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,746
Read the letter.

174
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:39,040
(stuttering) "I write to you

00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,607
near the Bridgewater Township."

180
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,662
Why?

181
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:02,471
Why do this, hmm?

182
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,034
Why, for politics? For money?

183
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,966
As an act of grace.

184
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:15,327
I minister to the sick
and dying every day.

185
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,927
I see their agony

186
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,783
while I pray for their deliverance.

187
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,002
Washington is a fool.

188
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,004
(gunshot)

189
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,973
(gasping)

190
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,047
<i>(groaning)</i>

191
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,901
(gasping)

192
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,354
Arnold: <i>General Howe left
this place a pigsty.</i>

193
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,357
Holes in the floorboards.
Garbage in the cellar.

194
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,053
Flies everywhere.

195
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,529
I've restored her to her former glory.

196
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,236
As I did Philadelphia.

197
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,701
Hmm, the spoils of war.

198
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,903
She's quite the prize.

199
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,840
I only hope to provide for Peggy

200
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,252
as well as her father has.

201
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:19,212
Benedict, you need not worry
yourself to impress my family.

202
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,264
Oh, I'm not sure I agree.

203
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,517
As the eldest sister, I must assure
our youngest is in good hands.

204
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,054
You must forgive Betsy. She takes her
responsibilities very seriously.

205
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,772
As she should. And I concur
with you, Elizabeth.

206
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,407
I want nothing but the best
for my exoneration.

207
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,030
Exoneration? From what?

208
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,567
From the baseless charges that
Joseph Reed sought to tar me with.

209
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,369
General Washington advised me

210
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,738
to apply for a court-martial to
clear my name once and for all,

211
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,456
and, mercy, was he right.

212
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,875
The slanders were referred to a
committee headed by William Paca

213
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,910
and he saw fit to dismiss them all.

214
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,148
How fortunate for you.

215
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,414
Fortune favors the bold, sir...

216
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,050
- <i> (door opens)</i>
- ...and smiles upon the righteous.

217
00:13:57,085 --> 00:14:00,387
I sent Paca a case
of Bourgogne to thank him.

218
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,049
I'm even feeling generous enough to
invite the Honorable Mr. Reed,

219
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:04,591
-  to dinner tonight.
- <i> (door closes)</i>

220
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,179
Sir, Major Edward Burd has arrived.

221
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,016
- Neddy?
- Neddy.

222
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,319
Arnold: <i>As I said, we
have much to celebrate.</i>

223
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,271
An exoneration and a homecoming.

224
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:21,157
I can't thank you enough, Betsy.

225
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,443
During the darkest days of my captivity,

226
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,195
your letters kept me going.

227
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,664
How long will you be joining us?

228
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,219
Indefinitely.

229
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,701
General Arnold interceded
with Washington

230
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,503
<i>to grant me a furlough from his staff</i>

231
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:37,291
so I might finish
my recuperation at home.

232
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,877
I think you will find
the restorative powers

233
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,296
of the Shippen ladies
to be quite an elixir.

234
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,613
<i>(Neddy chuckles)</i>

235
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:45,587
Neddy.

236
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:49,853
How... when did you manage this?

237
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,690
I will move the heavens for you.

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,980
- (Abe humming)
- (hammering)

239
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,490
It's a shame I can't remember,
isn't it, Sprout, huh?

240
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,799
You know, your grandfather
used to sing that to me

241
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,001
and your uncle before bed.

242
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,586
And you wouldn't think it
to look at him,

243
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,755
but he actually had quite a nice voice.

244
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,008
You want to build the house? Yeah?

245
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,677
Come on.

246
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,762
Come on. Give it a go.

247
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,731
See this nail right here?
Give it a whack.

248
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,149
Go on. There you go.

249
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,151
A little harder, like this.

250
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,187
Right?

251
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,689
There you go.

252
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:44,595
(grunts)

253
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,528
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

254
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,071
There you go.

255
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,311
(clears throat)

256
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,622
Any word on Simcoe?

257
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,377
He set off this morning.
We won't hear for some time.

258
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,144
All right.

259
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,048
But...

260
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,430
whatever happens,

261
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,052
I've just come here to tell you

262
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,438
that you don't have
to worry about the major.

263
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,774
No, we're not talking about this.

264
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,495
You told me to make a choice.

265
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:24,613
I have.

266
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,286
There's no one coming for you, Abe.

267
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,646
You really think I'd do that?

268
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,742
All right, then.

269
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,007
Why don't I have to worry?

270
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,220
Because we're going to be married,

271
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:49,721
Edmund and I, in England.

272
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,675
He'll resign his post here,
then we'll leave from New York.

273
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,394
So you don't have to kill him

274
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,094
because he'll be gone.

275
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,267
What are you doing?

276
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:02,861
Anna.

277
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,438
- I just told you.
- Why?

278
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,107
You wouldn't listen before.
Why should I explain it now?

279
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,409
What about the ring, hmm?

280
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,527
Townsend signals through the "Gazette."

281
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,758
I'm no longer needed.

282
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,869
What about... what about us?

283
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,862
There is no us, Abe.

284
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,006
- You saw to that.
- Oh, I saw to that?

285
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,508
What, are you doing this just to
spite me? Is that what it is?

286
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,427
- No. - You'd marry a man out of spite?

287
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,295
- It's not about spite.
- Well, what is it about, then?

288
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,707
Love?

289
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:37,372
Why...

290
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,228
do you love him?

291
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,894
I love him enough...

292
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,068
to save his life.

293
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,506
(grunts)

294
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:08,444
That's no way to treat a
man of God, Tallmadge.

295
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,983
- (gun cocks)
- No need to move.

296
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:12,842
<i>You're fine there.</i>

297
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,702
Gamble?

298
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,473
So you do know my name.

299
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,906
Spares me the introduction.

300
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,794
Tell me, Major, what did your
lot do with that fool Shanks?

301
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,307
Hang him? Enlist him?

302
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,754
You were the reverend's contact.

303
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,385
So he was working for André.

304
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,054
<i>We were supposed
to meet today, actually.</i>

305
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,890
Looks like you spared me
that introduction as well.

306
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,677
Move to shore.

307
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,203
Slow and steady.

308
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,057
That's far enough.

309
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,332
Turn around.

310
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,045
Now kneel down.

311
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,220
I am an officer in the Continental Army.

312
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,190
Protocol dictates... (grunts)

313
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,752
- (playing)
- (men chattering)

314
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:50,564
I bet you never tell your wife about
the old days, do you, Beekman?

315
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:51,879
<i>No?</i>

316
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,213
When you were the terror of Setauket.

317
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,070
No?

318
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,290
<i>Oh, he used to put cow pies in
mine and Abe and Ben's food.</i>

319
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,043
Used to beat up on us just 'cause
he was bigger and he could.

320
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,410
Well, little Caleb Brewster here,

321
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,501
he ain't so small anymore, is he?

322
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,253
(muffled shouting)

323
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,194
(gasps)

324
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,641
Caleb, please.

325
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,761
Whatever I did, it was a long time ago.

326
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,564
We were young. I was rowdy and...

327
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,933
- And you were an arsehole
and you still are.

328
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,235
- (muffled screaming)
- Caleb:<i> Hey!</i>

329
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,321
- Settle down, you.
- What?

330
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,739
Just trying to have a bit of fun.

331
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,274
Caleb: <i>Yeah, well, I
need you able and ready,</i>

332
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,742
not messing with the ladies, all right?

333
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:37,027
Can't have you going off like last time.

334
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:42,499
It might be a while
before Simcoe gets here.

335
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,785
I've got to pass the time somehow.

336
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,121
You listen here.

337
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,839
I'm only gonna say this once.

338
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,931
I had my chance with
Simcoe before, all right?

339
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,178
But the bastard slipped
through my fingers.

340
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,046
That won't be happening again.

341
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,442
Still not used to all
the quiet in the house.

342
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:18,627
It's so strange not having Thomas here.

343
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,456
I hope Abraham is all right
with him alone on the farm.

344
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:26,577
Perhaps Abraham should have considered
that before he betrayed us all.

345
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,496
- He'll do fine.
- How do you know that?

346
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,467
Because I raised him on my own.

347
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,335
Abe and his brother
after my wife passed.

348
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:35,970
Look how well that turned out.

349
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:40,724
I've heard rumblings there's a
room available at Strong Manor.

350
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,677
When exactly will you be depriving
us all of your presence?

351
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,973
Richard, please.

352
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:47,982
I'll be damned if I let this harlot

353
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,100
speak to me in that
manner in my own house.

354
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,319
You will address her with respect, sir.

355
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:54,238
<i>And if you cannot manage to do that,</i>

356
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,939
<i>then that will be our friendship ended.</i>

357
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,074
Why are you defending her?

358
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,194
Because, sir, she is to be my wife.

359
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:03,197
(laughs)

360
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,037
- Is this true?
- Anna: Yes, it is.

361
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,006
We're to be married as soon as possible.

362
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:17,711
Congratulations. I hope that you
two will find happiness together.

363
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:21,382
Thank you, Mary. She makes me
more happy than you can imagine.

364
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,554
So you've gone hand in hand
with the enemy once again.

365
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,630
- What are you talking about? - Abraham.

366
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,395
You've made some sort of
pact with him, haven't you?

367
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,899
- What?
- I give up my own son as a traitor

368
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,951
to stop my grandson
following in his footsteps,

369
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,928
only now the boy is back with
his father who walks free.

370
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:44,922
Why?

371
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,875
Because he's gifted you this woman?

372
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,910
- <i> (chair scrapes)</i>
- That is enough, Richard.

373
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,712
This has nothing to do with Abraham.

374
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,290
<i>You've only got yourself
to blame on that account.</i>

375
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:57,668
If you'd have told me what you knew sooner,
then none of this would have happened.

376
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,671
(utensils clatter)

377
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,474
Excuse me.

378
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,096
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- (exhales)

379
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:14,749
We're not leaving.

380
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,404
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- What?

381
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
We'll stay here in Setauket

382
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,492
and be married here.

383
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,527
Edmund, please.

384
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,113
I don't care what Richard
or anyone else says.

385
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,450
I love you for who you are

386
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,201
and for all that you are.

387
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,170
And I want the world to know it.

388
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,039
No. No, you can't stay.

389
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,374
We can't stay.

390
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,759
What, because of your reputation?

391
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,879
Because... because of the danger.

392
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,297
B-because of Simcoe.

393
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,798
Yes, and that is being taken care of.

394
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,968
- You don't know that.
- I am done running, Anna.

395
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,772
If not for you, I would have fled as
soon as I came back from Connecticut.

396
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:53,607
But you gave me the strength to stay on.

397
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:57,644
It would be wrong of me to now
encourage you to flee from your home,

398
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:02,116
especially when I'm capable
of keeping you safe here.

399
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:05,013
<i>Now, write your husband</i>

400
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,988
and tell him that you agree
to his terms of divorce

401
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,040
and then we'll be married immediately.

402
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,997
Though we will surely have to
find another magistrate to do it.

403
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:28,509
- (horse snorts)
- <i> (owl hooting)</i>

404
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,944

405
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,875
<i>(bird calling)</i>

406
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,884
<i>(bird calling)</i>

407
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,873

408
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:38,412
(horse whickers)

409
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,799
<i>(horses approach)</i>

410
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,341
(whispers) Wait till they
get to the front door.

411
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,095
<i>(metal rattling)</i>

412
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:58,732
- Rangers out back.
- What?

413
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,269
- Sons of whores.
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

414
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,272
(gunshot)

415
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,943

(cocks rifle)

419

(groans)

420
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:26,426
Back to the shore!

421
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,137
(groans)

422
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,818
All right, next volley,
fire and then we run.

423
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,987
On the way back to the
beach, you, then me.

424
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,322
You ready?

425
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:56,573
(clicks)

426
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,492
<i>(gunshot)</i>

427
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,883
- Run, you bastard.
- Run!

428
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,635
Don't let him get to the shore!

429
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,504
<i>(gunshot)</i>

430
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:13,640
Take cover! Look to the rear.

431
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,277
Psst.

432
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,749
<i>(Simcoe whispering)
Flank him, carefully.</i>

433
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,083
(rifle cocks)

434
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:56,107
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- Neddy endured deplorable conditions

435
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,027
during his captivity and
braved them with distinction.

436
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,853
Betsy: <i>Do you think
he's here to propose?</i>

437
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:04,639
Oh, Neddy marches to the
beat of his own drummer.

438
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,369
We shouldn't hasten the tempo.

439
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,277
There's no reason why you
shouldn't be married immediately.

440
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:12,697
Long engagements are for milksops
who can't finish the job.

441
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,499
But, sir, I haven't even proposed.

442
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:17,569
I would ask for Betsy's hand, Uncle,

443
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:21,706
<i>but I fear I don't have the means to
support her on a soldier's wages.</i>

444
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,791
If it's money that you're
worried about, then don't.

445
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:25,910
I've arranged for you
to begin a law clerkship.

446
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,162
Is this another favor
to be accounted for?

447
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,574
An appointment.

448
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,398
One granted by Judge Shippen himself.

449
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:35,253
After Neddy's valor on
and off the battlefield,

450
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,555
it's the very least that we can
do to honor his sacrifice.

451
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:40,342
Yes, I'm in need of a prothonotary.

452
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:42,894
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court

453
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,513
would do well to have
a man of your acumen, Neddy.

454
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:47,899
This young man survived
a British prison ship

455
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,350
and Haller's battalion.

456
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,250
I'm quite certain he can handle a desk.

457
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,939
Perhaps you should stop seeing
demons where there are none.

458
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,858
Perhaps you're right.

459
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Esther: <i>So, you two can agree.</i>

460
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,220
The impossible is possible.

461
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,034
Joseph, would you show me that
lovely painting in the foyer?

462
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,202
I want to see all its beauty up close.

463
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,954
Of course. If you'll excuse us.

464
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,131
General.

465
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:16,187
I've always fancied a Christmas wedding.

466
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:19,380
You expect Grandfather to
travel through ice and snow?

467
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,935
Spring is a grand time for a wedding.

468
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,467
Perhaps even summer.

469
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:28,439
The city will be flush and in bloom

470
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,391
and you'll be even more radiant.

471
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,139
I'm not you, Peggy.

472
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,448
I'm not the most beautiful
girl in the colonies

473
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,033
or Father's favorite.

474
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:42,070
Why delay my only chance at happiness?

475
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,595
(clinks)

476
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,577
(clears throat)

477
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,163
I would like to thank
you all for being here

478
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,585
to celebrate the good fortune that
has graced many of us in this room.

479
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:00,931
After trials and adversities,

480
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:03,975
<i>we all have much to be grateful for.</i>

481
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:05,459
A toast.

482
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:09,147
To young love renewed

483
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,649
and to honor restored.

484
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,602
Hear, hear.

485
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,992
Now, I believe that
Major Burd has something

486
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:23,861
that he would like to... Neddy?

487
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,448
<i>(door opens)</i>

488
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,450
A message for you from camp, sir.

489
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,419
I'll see to it after dinner.

490
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,588
<i>It came with a note from
General Washington, sir.</i>

491
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,590
<i>He expressed that you were
to read it immediately.</i>

492
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,899
Betsy...

493
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,627
Elizabeth.

494
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,630
<i>It seems as if I have
known you my entire life,</i>

495
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,466
<i>which I have, of course.</i>

496
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:48,112
<i>And I have always loved you</i>

497
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,834
as more than a cousin.

498
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,861
Excuse me.

499
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,980
- Sir, if I may...
- Not now, Franks.

500
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,448
Benedict.

501
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,816
Benedict, what's wrong?

502
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,618
Congress has rejected Paca's decision

503
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,787
and referred the charges against
me back to a court-martial.

504
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:08,289
- But I thought you said...
- Reed. It was Reed.

505
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,124
He threatened to split
Pennsylvania from the body

506
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
and they gave in to him.

507
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:14,295
I'm right back to where I started.

508
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,733
Hello, Quarles. How are you?

509
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,319
- Major Rogers?
- Drop it.

510
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:40,855
Hello, boys.

511
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:44,075
Well, this is...

512
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:46,911
unexpected.

513
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:50,164
(laughs) I suppose you
must be used to that.

514
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,700
I could have crept up
on you in broad daylight.

515
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:56,003
The famed Robert Rogers.

516
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,955
I've longed to meet you in person, sir.

517
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,758
<i>Oh, well, you'll just have to
keep on longing, won't you?</i>

518
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:03,544
Because I'm going to make
haste with Quarles here.

519
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:07,465
And I suppose we'll have tea and scones
sometime at Westminster, shall we?

520
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,433
Drop it. Drop it, Brandon.

521
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,854
I'm afraid they don't take
orders from you anymore, Major.

522
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:14,472
We'll see about that.

523
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:18,559
You take one more step to me, I
will cut his throat wide open.

524
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,561
Go ahead.

525
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,280
Rogers: <i>You hear that, boys?</i>

526
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:26,033
That ghost would have you dead.

527
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,236
<i>You think I'd have done that to you?</i>

528
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:31,038
I would die for you boys.

529
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,957
You know that.

530
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:35,042
I would die for you!

531
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,911
Put your guns down!

532
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:40,584
That's all right.

533
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:45,056
We can settle this in the old fashion.

534
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,080
Weapons down, gentlemen.

535
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:54,095
Weapons down!

536
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:57,993
If Major Rogers manages to kill me,

537
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,236
<i>I order you to let him leave unharmed.</i>

538
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:04,739
Or follow him if you so choose.

539
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,526
Get out of here.

540
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:14,916
I am going to carve you up, ginger.

541
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,621
Come on. Come on, boy.

542
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:22,290
Yeah?

543
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:29,597
You're old, fat, and slow.

544
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,048
You're the past.

545
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
(shouts)

546
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:37,471
(grunting)

547
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,390
And I'm the future.

548
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:42,610
- (shouts)
- (screams)

549
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:49,617
The only thing I can't work out

550
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,037
is why you decided
to return to Long Island,

551
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:57,825
especially after the king
signed a warrant for...

552
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,414
you're Culper.

553
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,585
Oh, that's brilliant.

554
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:10,721
You hid your treachery in plain sight.

555
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:13,057
A mercenary through and through.

556
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:16,811
Playing both sides against one another.

557
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:19,931
A true American.

558
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,188
Are you looking for this?

559
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,157
(laughs)

560
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,861
It's a shame, really,
when... when the mind goes.

561
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:36,030
Pistol, please.

562
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:50,211
(grunting)

563
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:57,101
Find him!

564
00:35:57,136 --> 00:36:00,521
He's got one eye! Find him!

565
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,644
(whickers)

566
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,406
(coughs)

567
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:20,207
<i>(birds calling)</i>

568
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,710
Ah, he wakes.

569
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:28,382
Hungry?

570
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:31,916
Where are we?

571
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:34,088
You're on your way to meet Major André.

572
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:36,474
<i>That's the least you could do for me</i>

573
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,843
seeing that you fouled my mission.

574
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,511
I won't talk.

575
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:42,763
You might as well kill me now.

576
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,926
Oh, I'd love to.

577
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,430
Give you a second smile

578
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,238
like I did for your old man Sackett.

579
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:53,357
<i>But I got chastised, you see.</i>

580
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,023
Won't make the same mistake twice.

581
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,330
Though after the major
gets done with you,

582
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,867
<i>I expect he'll have me see you vanished.</i>

583
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,055
After all, you're not in uniform,

584
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,358
so the rules are off the table.

585
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:22,937
(horse whinnies)

586
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,138
(gunshot)

587
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,057
(horse whinnies)

588
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:43,050
Are you sure there's nothing we can do?

589
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,551
No, dear, I'll look after him

590
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,886
and make sure he has all he needs.

591
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,972
You're not intending to stay here?

592
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:51,191
I understand your concern, but
there's propriety to be considered.

593
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,561
It would be improper not to
support my future husband.

594
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,730
He just received word
that his sister is unwell.

595
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,365
Imagine his distress, Father.

596
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,986
I'll send the carriage
back for you in an hour.

597
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,241
My dear.

598
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:06,837
Please give the general our best wishes.

599
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:07,907
<i>(door opens)</i>

600
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,744
Yes, and be sure to thank him
for a grand evening.

601
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,713
As much as we've been in conflict,

602
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,062
I'm glad that he has found
the justice he deserves.

603
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,641
<i>- (Arnold grunts)
- (loud crash)</i>

604
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:30,264
(grunts)

605
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:32,766
<i>(panting)</i>

606
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:35,653
"Making degrading requests
of a militiaman."

607
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,655
Oh, please, I asked him for a barber.

608
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,428
This is a farce.

609
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:41,828
Reed has always sought to ruin me,

610
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:44,351
<i>ever since he was a
sniveling clerk in Congress</i>

611
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:47,590
hiding behind my protection
while stabbing me in the back.

612
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:50,167
I should know to expect
nothing from them.

613
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,504
But I counted on better from Washington.

614
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,995
"In a future letter

615
00:38:57,574 --> 00:39:00,127
I shall communicate my reasons."

616
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,110
<i>(paper crumples, thuds)</i>

617
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,808
Don't I deserve an explanation now?

618
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,510
Don't I deserve the loyalty
that I have always given him?

619
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,472
He wouldn't even have an army to
command if it weren't for me,

620
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,307
and yet he deprives me of command.

621
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,725
He deprives me of glory.

622
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:17,141
And now he deprives me of my honor.

623
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,298
If they want to make an enemy of me,

624
00:39:22,177 --> 00:39:23,649
then I will make them mine.

625
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:27,071
If only they knew what I
could do to them, Peggy.

626
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:29,336
I could destroy them if I wanted to.

627
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:32,233
Destroy them.

628
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:38,754
Then perhaps you should.

629
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:45,426
When the city was occupied,

630
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:48,475
I became acquainted with a royal officer

631
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,511
by the name of John André.

632
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,679
He wanted to end this war.

633
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,182
Said England should make
peace with the colonies.

634
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,624
When the army left for New York, he said

635
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,521
if I came across any Patriots
who thought likewise,

636
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,857
<i>I should write to him and let him know.</i>

637
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,110
I listened politely,

638
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:09,029
but never expected
to take him up on his offer.

639
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,825
Until now.

640
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:21,208
Now that I see
I can help the man I love.

641
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:26,013
I just thought you should know...

642
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,134
I have a way to reach out.

643
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:37,391
If your friends won't
appreciate you, Benedict...

644
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:42,196
then perhaps his will.
