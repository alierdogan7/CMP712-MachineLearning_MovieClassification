How the hell does lottery
even work now,

368
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,494
when there's barely any currency?

369
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,886
I've seen it in Hong Kong, mate.

370
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,627
People put in whatever they have...

371
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,542
A chicken, a bag of rice.

372
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,882

off the top, of course.

from the funeral.

He, uh, he couldn't get away.

412
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,128
Maybe, or maybe sending a signal

413
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,920
that he's not in support
of our administration.

414
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:23,151
Well, the senator
wasn't particularly fond

415
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:25,651
of how the last president
used him as a rubber stamp.

416
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:27,882
- Meaning?
- Croft: Sir, you've been away.

417
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:30,238
I don't think you realize
what a mess this country is in.

418
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:33,000
Maybe they don't remember what
a mess we had five months ago,

419
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:35,576
before Michener and the<i> James</i>
came home with the cure.

420

Wilson: No, they remember, sir.

421
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:38,436
And they're grateful for the cure,

422
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:40,190
but that doesn't give the government

423
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:42,070
a free pass for everything else,

424
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:45,127
especially since people think
that most of the decisions

425
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,596
that have come out of here
have been disastrous.

Hell, you can't even prove
you rescued your own people.

We're all pleased

and we're sure you'll sort that out.

435
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,105
The more pressing issue
is our domestic policy.

436
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:12,892
I think we can all agree
that Michener jumped too quickly

437
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,350
to federalize everything.

438
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:16,729
If you were to curb
some of his measures,

439
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:19,557
I'm sure it would go a long way
to smoothing things over

440
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:22,526
with Senator BEATTY
and the American people.

441
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:27,433
The ration-card program has been
the chief cause of unrest,

442
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,768
and the limits to bank withdrawals...

443
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,572
The people do not want the government

444
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,713
interfering with
how they spend their money.

445
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,213
Wilson: Come on, Alex. It's all of it.

446
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,348
The land-claim issues
are just as contentious.

447
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:38,768
What do you all want?

448
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,658
To go back
to dog-eat-dog?

449
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:44,639
That's appealing when
you're at the top of the heap,

450
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:47,143
but there are people out there
going hungry

451
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,424
while we are producing more than
enough food to feed everyone.

452
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,549
That's why President Michener
started those ration cards,

453
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,541
so that all of our citizens
can have their fair share

454
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:56,682
of what they need to get b...

455
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:57,885
River: Commander Green.

456
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:04,354
If we need your advice
as it pertains to our military,

457
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:05,712
we'll ask for it.

458
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,707
Sir, I know that you were skittish

459
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,846
about instituting these policies
from the beginning.

460
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,869
Oliver: It doesn't matter
what I thought then

461
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,658
or if they're unpopular.

462
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,260
Are they working or not?

463
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,807
I think it's fair to say
that these policies

464
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:34,479
are doing more harm than good, sir.

465
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,526
What happened in there?

466
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:42,099
Everything we worked for,

467
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,097
everything
President Michener stood for.

468
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,448
We're in a crisis.

469
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,432
It's our job
to hold the country together.

470
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:51,229
You sat with the President
and wrote those policies.

471
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,783
You didn't fight for them.

472
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,679
If President Michener
couldn't make them work,

473
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,416
then Howard Oliver certainly can't.

474
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,690
So you're gonna let Oliver

475
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:01,619
capitulate to the regional leaders.

476
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,760
He just gave them authority
over local militias

477
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,369
without speaking to Captain Chandler.

478
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,986
Chandler's the acting head
of our military,

479
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,190
and he never would have allowed it.

480
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:13,116
Captain Chandler is 12,000 miles away.

481
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,401
The regional leaders need to
be able to call their own shots.

482
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,526
If they can't control
their own regions, who will?

483
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,166
They're the ones stoking the unrest.
President Michener...

484
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,791
President Michener isn't here!

485
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:24,322
He took the easy way out!

486
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,987
So if they sit in that office

487
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,697
and they reverse every decision
that he made as President,

488
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,627
there's nobody to blame but him.

489
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,189
Sir.

490
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:40,080
Uh, thank you for coming down.

491
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:42,314
I've made some progress, sir,

492
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,213
but I-I still have
more questions than answers.

493
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:49,737
Um, this is an image of our cure
from Dr. Scott's notes.

494
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,862
I've isolated the compound
in Takehaya and Kyoko's blood.

495
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,425
It's exactly the same as ours.

496
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,916
Structurally uncompromised,
as far as I can tell.

497
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:01,151
This is an image of the red flu
from Dr. Scott's files,

498
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,573
and this...

499
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,651
This is the virus in Kyoko's blood.

500
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:07,958
It's different.

501
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,971
- Chandler: Bulkier.
- Exactly.

502
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,864
That bulkiness is present
in Takehaya's virus, as well.

503
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,641
The virus in their blood is
similar enough to the original

504
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,619
that my preliminary tests
identified it,

505
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,349
- but it is somewhat altered.
- A mutation.

506
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,721
I can't say for sure,

507
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,822
but whatever's causing the bulkiness

508
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,713
is preventing the cure from working.

509
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,027
That means everyone on this ship

510
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,121
who's come in contact
with Takehaya could be infected.

511
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,324
That was my worry, too,

512
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,826
but none of us from the
prison camp have any symptoms.

513
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,010
I crossed the virus in Takehaya's blood

514
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,221
with a sample of my own

515
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,151
and from several sailors
who had no contact

516
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,885
with Takehaya, Kyoko,
or any of us who were prisoners.

517
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,596
The bulkier virus doesn't make us sick.

518
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,175
Somehow, the cure in us
defends against it.

519
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,878
If Takehaya and Kyoko
both have the same cure,

520
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,252
why is the virus harming them?

521
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,943
I wish I knew, sir.

522
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,939
I'll keep digging.

523
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:03,479
We're at 19.83 North
by 112.5 East.

524
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,026
Course 1-0-0,
speed 20 knots, sir.

525
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,690
There's a small land mass here
which should provide cover

526
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,248
from hostile radar detection

527
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:12,722
while giving us a vantage point
on the shipping lane

528
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:14,013
indicated on that card.

529
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:16,047
Helo is standing by
to execute fly overs.

530
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,535
We expect many vessels
to have AIS switched off

531
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,854
on account of pirates.

532

She's Alpha Charlie Foxtrot 79831396.

533
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:38,322
Any of the markings?

534
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:42,010
<i>Uh, just a couple of dings
