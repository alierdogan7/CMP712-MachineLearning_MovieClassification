00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,479
has he ever sailed west himself?

00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,463
Now, this candle is the sun.

up into the sky until noon.

146
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,738
See how the shadow shortens?

147
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,070
At noon, it is at its shortest.

148
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,843
That only tells me
how far south I have traveled.

149
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,283
Didn't I just tell you to listen?

150
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,884
The day before sailing,
you mark a circle around the pointer

151

its shortest at noon.

The next day at sea,

153
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,960
you place the board
back into water around noon

154
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,466
and watch the shadow.

155
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,404
If the shadow only touches the circle...

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,970

00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,365
Yes.

158
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,873
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

159
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,806
Then you have drifted,
and you must steer further south.

160
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,077
Yes.

161
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,882
And what if it never reaches the circle?

162

and must steer more to the north.

He's not a god.

365
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,344
Why didn't he come to the thing?

366
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,748
Because...

367
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,744
Because he's shy.

368
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,617
(SHOUTING GIBBERISH)

369
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,747
(LAUGHS)

370
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,455
Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.

371
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,663
Hello. How are you?

372
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,396
Well. Thank you, sir.

373
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,932
Let me see.

374
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,974
You have your father's eyes

375
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,173
unfortunately.

376
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,877
Why unfortunately?

377
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,344
It means he will be like you,

378
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,184
and therefore
he will want to do better than you,

379
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,247
and you will hate him for it.

380
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,590
(SNIGGERS)

381
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,163
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

382
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,221
It's the same with trees.

383
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,164
I can tell which trees will make

384
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,668
the best planks just by looking at them.

385
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,296
(WHISPERS) I can look inside the tree.

386
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,509
Floki is a boat-builder.

387
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,538
Among other things.

388
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,510
This is one.

389
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,547
Inside this tree
are two almost perfect planks.

390
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,880
They will bend, then curve,

391
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,580
like a woman's body
from the thighs to the back.

392
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,351
When I split this tree, I will find them.

393
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,327
You can see that?

394
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,757
Do you think I'm joking?

395
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:11,340
(WHISPERS) I joke about many things,
son of Ragnar,

396
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,782
but never about ship-building.

397
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,052
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?

398
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,918
So, what about our boat?

399
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,495
It will be lighter and carry a bigger sail.

400
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,931
The construction is different.

401
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,969
It's built with a strong central plank.

402
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,663
The two strakes above it are nailed

403
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,000
directly onto the knees of the frame.

404
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,041
But the ones below... Look!

405
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,872
Are cleated and lashed onto the frames,
not nailed,

406
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,037
so they can move in relation to each other.

407
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,139
This means the boat won't butt against
the waves like a goat,

408
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,945
but move over them like a ripple.

409
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,711
LOTHBROK: The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?

410
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,688
FLOKI: I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,

411
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,987
and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.

412
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,093
And you think
it could handle long sea voyages?

413
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,789
(CHUCKLES) That's why I'm building it.

414
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,126
But will it be strong enough?

415
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,030
We won't know that until we try.

416
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,142
For the anchor.

417
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,146
It's all I have left from
last summer's raids.

418
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,681
Don't worry.

419
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,917
We'll soon be as rich as dwarves!

420
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,550
(SNIGGERS)

421
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,161
I missed you.

422
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,170
Did anything happen while we were away?

423
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,040
No.

Did you miss me?

00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,192
I ached with love longing.

428
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,390
My belly was empty of laughter.
(WHISPERS)

429
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,729
Is that what you want? Hmm?

430
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,370
You want me to make you laugh?

431
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,539
I don't want to laugh now.

432
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,678
I want to ride you,

433
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,280
like a bull.

434
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,788

437
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,316
Hello, young Bjorn.

438
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,256
Hello, Rollo.

439
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,723
Where are your parents?

440
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,618
They are having sex.

441
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,822
Well...

442
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,531
I guess we'll have to wait.

443
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,449
So, Gyda,

444
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,779
is your mother teaching you
how to use a shield?

445
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,256
Yes, I know how to use a shield.

446
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,354
Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.

447
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,751
Was?

448
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,162
Is a famous shield-maiden.

449
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,826
LAGERTHA: Come on, children, to bed.
GYDA: Do I have to?

450
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,163
Let's leave the men.

451
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,261
But I'm a man. I have a ring.

452
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,536
ROLLO: Let him stay awhile.

453
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,938
To bed!

454
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,211
Say good night.

455
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,747
Good night, my children.

456
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,609
GYDA: Good night.
BJORN: Good night.

457
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,004

- Good night.

00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,313

BJORN: Good night, Father.

461
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,695
Tell me your news.

462
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,759
What about the boat?

463
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,999
It's nearly ready.

464
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,102
(LAUGHS) I won't go under your command.

465
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,580
I won't go unless we're all equal.

466
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,382
We are brothers.

Then we must find a crew.

Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

471
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,399
Many will be afraid.

472
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,803
Some may even go to him and betray us.

473
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,607
I must go piss.

Thank you.

480
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,593
I didn't see her face.

00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,830

Why not?

485
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,948
I think about you all the time.

486
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,945
(WHISPERS) That's too bad.

487
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,844
Don't insult me, shield-maiden.

00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,617
No.

489
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,988
I would never insult you.

00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,550
You're too great a warrior,

491
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,091
but perhaps not so great a man.

What did you see?

00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,111
(CHUCKLES) A sign.

496
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,211

we're doing the right thing.

Good night, brother.

498
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,645
Set the sail.

Floki! The sail!

500
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,613
She'll sink.

501
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,119
No, she bloody won't.

502
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,021
I shouldn't have pretended
to build such a boat.

503
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,421
It's beyond my humble capabilities.

504
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,492
I'll set the sail.
