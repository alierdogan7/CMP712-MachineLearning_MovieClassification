- She's our daughter.

- Rosa.

We could turn him in tomorrow.

00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,105
The authorities would understand.

481

- He came to us.

- I owe his family everything.
- I know.

485

I'm going to bed.

1291
01:51:23,774 --> 01:51:26,015
Don't stay up too late, you two.

1292
01:51:38,756 --> 01:51:41,134
Your mama told me what you did.

1293
01:51:44,762 --> 01:51:46,366
I shouldn't have.

1294
01:51:46,764 --> 01:51:48,573
Maybe you had to.

1295
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:54,413
I keep thinking about Max.

1296
01:51:55,339 --> 01:51:56,579
Wondering where he is.

1297
01:51:58,008 --> 01:51:59,578
Me, too.

1298
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:03,584
I'm not sure what it all meant.

Everything he went through.

1310
01:52:48,793 --> 01:52:50,238
<i>and my brother.</i>

1311
01:52:53,497 --> 01:52:57,172
<i>Outside the car,
the world was thrown inside a snow-shaker.</i>

1312
01:52:57,501 --> 01:52:59,503
<i>And on a place called Heaven Street...</i>

1313

like a quiet owl with no wings...</i>

1317

Good night, Your Majesty.

NARRATOR: <i>I've always quite liked
the image of me with a sickle and cape.</i>

<i>Dark and formidable.</i>

1324
01:54:32,796 --> 01:54:37,006
<i>Unfortunately, I'm far more
ordinary and commonplace.</i>

1325
01:54:39,003 --> 01:54:42,917
<i>No one intended to destroy
a street named after Heaven.</i>

1326
01:54:43,674 --> 01:54:46,154
<i>It was a misread on a map.</i>

1327
01:54:46,343 --> 01:54:48,653
<i>No sirens that evening.</i>

1328
01:54:50,014 --> 01:54:52,392

01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,463
<i>Then, I kissed his mother.</i>

1331
01:55:08,098 --> 01:55:11,978
<i>And stole the meanness
from Franz German's heart.</i>

1332

<i>Rosa, I caught mid-snore.</i>

1333

<i>I could swear I heard her call me a bastard.</i>

1334
01:55:24,315 --> 01:55:29,958
<i>Then I felt her regrets
for not sharing more of her very big heart.</i>

1335
01:55:30,854 --> 01:55:35,803
<i>As for Hans, his soul was
lighter than a child 's.</i>

1336
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:40,040
<i>I felt his itch
for one last tune on his accordion...</i>

1337
01:55:40,664 --> 01:55:43,110
