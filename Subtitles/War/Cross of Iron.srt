The German soldier no longer has any ideals.

97

00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,398
Come here, son.

178
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,481
Steiner!

179
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:01,481
I want to show you
what our new army looks like.

180
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:12,689
- What's your name, son?
- Private Dietz, sir.

181
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:15,023
They're sending us babies now.

182
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,231
Hello, child.

183
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,814
Private Dietz.

184
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:23,439
How long have you been soldiering?

185
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,231
Six weeks, sir. I volunteered, sir.

186
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,731
Don't volunteer for anything around here.

187
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:32,106
Just keep your eye on Krüger here,
and myself.

188
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,064
Do exactly as we say or you'll be wearing
boots up your ass for a long time.

189
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,606
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!

190
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:41,523
- And don't call me sir.
- Excuse me.

191
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:46,064
Go with this foul-smelling one over here.

192
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:48,064
Put him in Schiller's bunk.

193
00:21:53,857 --> 00:22:00,231
Kern, see if you can find a jacket or a blanket,

194
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,523
something for the boy.

195
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:04,981
Get Schiller's jacket.
He must have something over there.

196
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,189
Yes, sir! Oh, excuse me.

- My report.
- Thank you.

201
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,939
I regret the incident this afternoon, Corporal.

202
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,064
But orders are orders.

203
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:31,148
We have enough trouble with the feeding
of our own troops without taking prisoners.

204
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,398
Anyway, it's very bad for security.

205
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,981
I've read your preliminary report,

206
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:43,856
and it gives me great pleasure
to inform you that

207
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,731
Colonel Brandt and I have
agreed to recommend you

208
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:51,439
for promotion to Senior Sergeant,
effective at once.

209
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,648
Your promotion doesn't seem to have
made much of an impression.

210
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:02,773
No, it doesn't.

211
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,564
All right.

212
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,773
I've read your report. Anything to add to this?

213
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:17,731
Russians, sir. We should be
hearing from them very soon, sir.

214
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:20,231
- An offensive?
- Yes, I should think so, sir.

215
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,814
- Starting when?
- Soon.

216
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,481
- What about your platoon?
- Two killed, one missing.

217
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:31,314
Two killed, how?

218
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,731
Bullets. Mortar fire. Artillery.
Heavy salvos. Bad luck.

219
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:42,273
Terminal syphilis. The usual things, Captain.

220
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:46,856
The missing man,
did you look for him, Steiner?

221
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,231
- No, sir.
- Why not?

222
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:53,481
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me
to risk the safety of the entire platoon

223
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,773
for the sake of one man.

224
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,273
You felt what?

225
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:10,981
A non-commissioned officer does not permit
a missing man in such a case, in any case!

226
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,689
I'll try to do better next time, sir.

227
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:15,273
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- If you wish.

228
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,814
You know, Corporal... Sergeant,

229
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:28,231
I have a feeling you somewhat
overestimate your importance.

230
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:33,564
At the moment,
I am free of any such illusions, sir.

231
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:40,856
Well, may I suggest to you that you do not
underestimate your present company.

232
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,564
Everything you are and may become
is dependent upon this present company.

233
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,314
No, I will not forget that, sir.

234
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:56,148
But I may add that a man is generally
what he feels himself to be.

235
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:05,814
Of course.

236
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,898
You're dismissed.

237
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:14,314
I shall be back soon, sir.

238
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:16,106
Is that a salute?

239
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:20,648
Yes, sir.

00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:25,064
- Triebig.
- Yes, sir.

just another Nazi Party type.

military aristocracy and rich.

Come now, Lieutenant,
what's left for them to rule?

249
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:56,273
Don't be naive.

250
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:59,731
Stransky will survive this war
one way or another.

251
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:03,231
And he'll still have his land, his wealth,

252
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,773
and his status.

253
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,231
But he'll be very dangerous in defeat.
Be careful with him.

254
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:14,898
He doesn't live in the same world we live in.

Were you present when Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

774

I accompanied Captain Stransky to the field

775

and saw him calling several men around him.

776

Then he sent me back to the command post.

777

Then how do you know that Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

to that effect, Triebig.

of the results of our investigation.

Our investigation so far has disclosed

787
01:13:38,857 --> 01:13:45,273
that the men in the second company who
took part in the action declared unanimously

788
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,939
that the action was led by Lieutenant Meyer.

or Lieutenant Triebig.

more contemptible

properly belong to a man

Yes, Colonel Brandt?

1236
02:03:55,232 --> 02:03:58,106
Situation is worsening here. You're needed.

1237
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:01,856
If my orders are here...

1238
02:04:03,899 --> 02:04:04,981
And they are here, sir,

1239
02:04:05,065 --> 02:04:07,398
then my replacement is already
with the Company.

1240
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:09,148
You may leave, Stransky.

1241
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,856
Your Triebig is dead.

1242
02:05:22,232 --> 02:05:24,189
It didn't work, Captain.

1243
02:05:25,315 --> 02:05:26,731
I live.

1244
02:05:27,065 --> 02:05:28,523
You are dead.

1245
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:34,898
Lieutenant Triebig has not been
under my command for several hours.

1246
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:40,148
- He has been transferred.
- You aristocratic...

Leaving without your Iron Cross, Captain?

1249
02:06:12,232 --> 02:06:14,023
Just a matter of time.

1250
02:06:18,732 --> 02:06:20,814
Where's the rest of your platoon?

1251
02:06:27,107 --> 02:06:31,398
I said, "Where's the rest of your platoon, "
Sergeant Steiner!

1252
02:06:41,399 --> 02:06:42,731
You are...

1253
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:46,148
Captain Stransky.

1254
02:06:49,565 --> 02:06:51,856
You are the rest of my platoon.

1255
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:11,856
- Know how to use it?
- Yes, of course.

1256
02:07:34,857 --> 02:07:38,064
Fine, I accept.

1257
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:42,273
I'll show you how a Prussian officer can fight.

1258
02:07:48,732 --> 02:07:50,356
And I'll show you

1259
02:07:51,774 --> 02:07:53,606

Stransky, God damn it! Get off your ass!

1271
02:10:00,815 --> 02:10:02,773
I have to reload.

1272
02:10:03,482 --> 02:10:05,898
