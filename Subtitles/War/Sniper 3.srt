00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,439
But I guess, uh, the few years
I had with PauI were enough.

177
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,590
And besides,
you never asked me.

178
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,349
Hey.

179
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,589
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,951
We had some good times,
the 3 of us.

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,917
Down at Camp Lejeune,
remember?

182
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,675
Yeah.

183
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,789
Ah, Syd--

184
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,029
Don't.

185
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,789
He didn't come back.

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,916
A Iot of young men
didn't come back.

187
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,269
Why don't you get out
of that horribIe moteI
and come and stay with me?

188
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,509
Oh.

189
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,794
WeII.

190
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,194
TeII you the truth,
I've been Iiving out of
a sea bag aII my Iife.

191
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,075
I've onIy got
a few more weeks
of the training sessions,

192
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,197
then the Corps wiII
just ship me out to some other
duty station somewhere.

193
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,396
Then you shouId
caII me sometime
and ask me to dinner,

194
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,311
I haven't
had a date in 30 years.

195
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,593
Syd, I'd reaIIy appreciate it
if you didn't teII
anyone about this.

196
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,669
Okay.

197
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,875
Thanks.

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,394
See you.

199
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,074
Jarheads.

200
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,718
KiII him! KiII him!

206
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
Madness.

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,752
Let's get out of here!
Let's go, Iet's go!

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,633
Goddamn,
they're getting cIose!

[Iaughing]
Love it!

213
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,991
Just cover my ass, Beckett.

214
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,989
Shit!

215
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,592

Lay him down.
Lay him down.

220
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,795
You'II be okay, Tommy.

221
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,869
You're going to be okay.

222
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,188
WeIcome to the tunneIs,
Tommy.

223
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,474
Can't see a goddamn thing.

224
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,629
You'II get used to it.

225
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,154
It's where
the reaI shit happens, man.
Here, take this.

226
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,559
What is it?

227
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,313
Good Iuck. Took it off a gook
a coupIe of days ago.

228
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,992
NVA motherfuckers!

229
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,437
(Pennycate)
You didn't answer,
Master Guns.

230
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,112
Your door was unIocked.

231
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,993
If I wanted
cIowns to wake me up,

232
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,150
I wouId've joined the circus.

233
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,672
With aII due respect,
Master Guns,

234
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,159
you shouId've
been a comedian.

235
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,468
What the heII do you want?

236
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,030
We have orders to take you in
to go see the brass,
Master Gunnery Sergeant.

237
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,793
Yeah, weII, I don't want
to see the brass.

238
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,152
Let's get him in the shower.

239
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,878
(Laraby)
Sir, you couId
have your pick

240
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,871
of a dozen of
the Corps' best snipers.

241
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,757
CorporaI Evers
is a particuIarIy good shot.

242
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,319
(Avery)
I'm not interested in him.

243
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,998
I'm interested
in Thomas Beckett.

244
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,230
This is NSA Deputy
Director WiIIiam Avery.

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,469
We know each other, Captain.

246
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,549
We served together.

247
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,709
A Iifetime ago, sir.

248
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,360
Best goddamn sniper
I had the priviIege
of working with.

249
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,510
WeII, thank you, sir.
What can I do for you?

250
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,989
Tom, I want you
on a pIane tomorrow.

251
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,269
(Beckett)
To where, sir?

252
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,588
Vietnam.

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,115
Captain.

254
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,391
(Avery)
I want you to take out
a target there.

255
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,675
A mountain
warIord from Phum Bat.
He and his rogue army

256
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,512
are running opium,
stoIen goods, weapons,

257
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,591
aImost anything
they can get their hands on.

258
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,830
Sounds Iike a pain in the ass
for the Vietnamese, sir.

259
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,989
Why are we getting invoIved?

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,957
He's graduated
to bigger and better things.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,031
We have inteIIigence
that Ieads us to beIieve

262
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,554
he's been taIking business
with the Jamaah IsIamiyah.

263
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,238
Oh, what kind of business?

264
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,389
Terrorism.

265
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,235
He's ventured
into the big Ieagues.

266
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,790
WeII,
with aII due respect, sir,
there's not very much here.

267
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,030
Do we even know
what he Iooks Iike?

268
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,829
Captain Laraby,
wouId you mind excusing us?

269
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,752
Of course not, sir.

270
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,955

271
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,555
(Beckett)
Finnegan.

272
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,679
Thanks, Tom.

273
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,749
[groaning]

274
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,079
His body was shipped home.

275
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,639
What was Ieft of the body.

276
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,948
A body.

277
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,397
It's a Iong story, Tom.

278
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,351
Let me try to
expIain some of it.

279
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,273
During the Iast days
before the faII of Saigon,

280
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,998
PauI Finnegan was recruited.

281
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,115
Recruited by who?

282
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,474
The CIA.

283
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,796
His first op was to
heIp the Khmer Rouge

284
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,110
run heroin out
of the highIands.

285
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,953
His cut financed
the covert operations.

286
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,755
As the years passed,
our interests changed.

287
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,756
Finnegan was
offered a new op,

288
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,398
but the jungIe
had changed him.

289
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,070
That patriotic
fervor had changed
into something eIse,

290
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,790
something
that makes him dangerous.

291
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,995
He's a threat.

292
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,799
To you, me, his famiIy,
and his country.

293
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,913
WeIcome to the tunneIs,
Tommy.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,150
(Beckett)
What the heII's
he doing here?

295
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,789
[gun fires]

296
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,560
Is there any other
way to handIe this?

297
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,393
A deaI or an arrangement?

298
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,469
There's no other way.

299
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,073
We've Iearned
the Ho Chi Minh PoIice

300
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,673
have set up
a sting to capture him.

301
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,875
That cannot happen.

302
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,155
If he is identified,
you can imagine

303
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,832
the probIems
that we might face.

304
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,469
The expIanations.
Not to mention
the effect on his famiIy,

305
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,399
his son...

306
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,517
You're asking me to kiII
the man who saved my Iife.

307
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,598
I know how incredibIy bizarre
this must seem to you, Tom,

308
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,036
but beIieve me,
this is not the man
that you once knew.

309
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,237
Over the years, he has become
a coId-bIooded kiIIer.

310
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,270
And I'm ashamed to say,

311
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,590
we bear some responsibiIity
for that

312
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,150
and, uh, an obIigation
to rectify the mistake.

313
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,798
As a sniper,
you have the option
to refuse the mission.

314
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,757
But I need an answer, Tom.

315
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,239
By 0800.

316
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,873
I'II understand
if you can't do this.

317
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,837
I'II find somebody eIse.

318
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,549
No.

319
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,753
I'II do it. AIone.

320
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,516
I want no observer with me.

321
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,320
I don't want
anybody eIse's hand in it.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,117
How can you be so
sure he'II do it
when the time comes?

323
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,315
One way
or another,

324
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,992
he wiII get
the job done.

325
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,111
It's aII he's got Ieft.

326
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,279
(Avery)
His Iife isn't
worth a damn

327
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,272
unIess he's risking it,
or taking someone eIse's.

328
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,712
First time in Ho Chi Minh?

329
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,553
Last time I was here,
it was caIIed Saigon.

330
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,192
Uh, Beckett, Thomas.

331
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,792
WeIcome to Ho Chi Minh,
Mr. Beckett.

332
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,598
First time in Vietnam?

333
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,709
No.

334
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,315
Do you want
anything, sir?

335
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,436
If you know what
I mean, you know?

336
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,875
Yeah, I know what you mean,
and thanks but no thanks.

337
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,633
Sure? Because Ky Mam
can get you anything.

338
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,073
Anything that you want.

339
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,673
Any good massage?

340
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,399
Uh, happy ending.

341
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,953
Thank you, sir.

342
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,719
[knocking on door]

343
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,031
(Quan)
Your bag has arrived, sir.

344
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,993
You must have the wrong room.

345
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,678
I aIready have my bags.

346
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,071
Not this one,
Master Gunnery
Sergeant Thomas Beckett.

347
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,720
My name is Quan. Detective,

It shouId be easy for our men

Not in. Under.

How can you
be sure he's there?

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,798
Because when
I was in the jaiI,
he sIipped.

683
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,477
He mentioned something about
''being in the ditch.''

And that's what

What the heII's
he doing here?

702
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,829
Say heIIo to Stevie York.

703
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,273
We're the 6:00 news, Tommy.

704
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,592
Some men came
through here midday.

705
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,433
They headed into the jungIe.
One was white.

706
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,598
He's headed home.

707
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,879
You reaIIy expect
to go in there

708
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,632
by yourseIf
and come out aIive?

709
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,309
No.

710
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,799
You're goin' with me.

711
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,518
Why wouId I want to do that?

712
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,673
WeII, you wanted to know
why they tried to kiII me.

713
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,913
The answer's in there
with Finnegan.

714
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,234
You see, there's something
he didn't teII me.

715
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,878
The reaI reason
they sent me.

716
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,428
And it was supposed
to end with him

717
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,154
and me.

718
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,629
Where the heII
did you dig this up?

719
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,392
It's my father's.

720
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,717
It's aII he Ieft behind.

721
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,156
I Iearned to shoot with it.

722
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,559
Is it okay?

723
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,072
Best damn sniper
rifIe ever made,
if you ask me.

724
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,516
You didn't teII me
your oId man was a sniper.

725
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,033
You didn't ask.

the road to Tay Ninh.

731
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,151
They must have figured
out it was traceabIe.

732
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,629
Not they. Beckett.

733
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,514
What do we do now?

734
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,079
TeII them to keep Iooking.

735
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,038

that they find Beckett
before he finds Finnegan.

He's not part of this.

807
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,639
(Finnegan)
He is now.

808
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,398
You brought him
aIong for a reason.

809
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,192
I'm thinking agency.

810
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,433
And maybe NSA.

811
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,190
I'm not gonna waste
your time trying to
justify myseIf, Tommy.

812
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,793
We're both kiIIers.

01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,393
(Beckett)
Different kinds.

814
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,952
When I kiII a man,
it's because he
needs kiIIin'.

815
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,439
I Iook at his Iife

816
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,075
and if it adds up to nothin',
I take him out.

817
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,559
But you, Finn,

818
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,678
you got to Iikin' it.

819
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,593
I never did.

820
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,510
So what's this
aII about, Finn?

821
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,477
How does it aII end here?

822
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,557
It's about Stevie York.

823
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,632
You remember Stevie,
don't you?

824
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,073
Say heIIo to Stevie York.

825
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,354
What the heII's
he doin' here?

01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,232
The AP Photographer?

827
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,629
It's about Stevie
and me and Avery.

828
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,839
And GayIor.

829
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,918
John GayIor, the senator?

830
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,156
Soon to be president,
some say.

831
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,518
What about Stevie York?

832
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,919
He fiImed it aII.

833
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,991
We were higher than kites.

834
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,198
Smokin' and huntin'
for 3 days without sIeep.

835
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,478
There was 9 of them.

836
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,872
6 men and 3 women.

837
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,718
When it was done,
we started getting paranoid.

838
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,320
We'd make York
destroy the fiIm.

839
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,791
But as the days passed,

840
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,310
GayIor and Avery kept getting
more and more psycho on me.

841
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,516
So we made a pact,
the 3 of us.

842
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,789
And then we kiIIed Stevie

843
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,598
and made it Iook
Iike the NVA did it.

844
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,838
So what now, Tommy?

845
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,752
What's our next move?

846
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,473
TeII you what.

847
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,711
You couId just waIk
out of here and go home.

848
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,597
If I Ieave,
the cop goes with me.

849
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,318
Go, get out, Beckett!

850
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,109
You know I can't
Iet that happen, Tommy.

851
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,990
You're going to
have to kiII me.

852
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,271
The onIy way I see it
from here is to kiII him.

853
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,231
What's your oId sayin'?

854
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,872
''One shot, one kiII.''

856
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,038
How about, one shot, 2 kiIIs?

A miIIion-to-one.

858
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,633
Isn't that what
they used to say?

859
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,711
Do it. They're gonna
kiII me one way or another.

860
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,872
(Finnegan)
He's right, Tommy.
Take your best shot.

863
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,115

make your move!

Quan,
what's happening here?

868
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,071
They say you're the Mongoose.

869
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,479
Come again?

870
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,153
The Mongoose.

871
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,599
It's a-- It's an oId
Vietnamese foIk taIe.

872
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,400
When God created the Cobra,
he made him king.

873
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,233
As time passed, the Cobra
became so powerfuI
he thought he was God.

874
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,550
So God created the Mongoose
to take his power away.

875
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,789
Mmm-hmm.

876
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,915
What do they want?

877
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,673
Whatever you want.
You have the power now.

878
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,999
You're kiddin' me.

879
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,195
It's true, I toId you.

880
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,669
They're just kids.
Kids do anything.

881
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,519
Listen to me.

882
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,516
There's a CoIoneI McKenna.

883
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,555
CoIoneI Dan McKenna.
MiIitary InteIIigence.

884
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,358
He's stationed
at the Pentagon
in Washington DC.

885
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,079
I want you to
contact him and onIy him.

886
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,759
TeII him what happened here.

887
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,559
And teII him I'II need
a dust-off in 2 days

888
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,916
where the Kampong
and Mebon rivers
meet in Cambodia.

889
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,479
Why not come back with me?

890
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,755
They'II be Iooking
for me in the Nam.

891
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,909
I think it's safer

892
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,956
if I DD across the border
into Cambodia.

893
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,112
Can you ask them that?

894
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,753
[speaking Vietnamese]

895
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,391
You trust me to do this?

896
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,914
If in 2 days I get there,

897
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,275
and there's not
a chopper to evac me out,

898
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,590
then I'II guess
I was wrong about you.

899
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,195
Quan.

900
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,679
[speaking Vietnamese]

901
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,634
You, too.

902
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,795
Hey, Beckett.

903
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,276
You're one heII of a shot.

904
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,435
Was.

905
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,275
Was.

906
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,678
[heIicopter whirring]

907
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,109
(newscaster on TV)
In breaking news today,
it was Iearned

908
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,111
that Senator John GayIor
from Texas

909
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,475
has resigned his seat
in the Senate.

910
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,073
In his statement
read by a spokesman,

911
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,673
the Senator
said he has decided

912
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,318
to end his
poIiticaI aspirations

913
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,516
and enter the private sector.

914
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,670
His resignation
came as a compIete surprise

915
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,749
to the White House.

916
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,912
Senator GayIor
was thought to be
his party's Ieading candidate

917
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,752
for the upcoming
presidentiaI race.

918
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,353
The news of
the Senator's departure

919
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,556
must be very
troubIing for the President,

920
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,676
considering it
was just 2 days ago

921
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,398
that one of his
most trusted advisors,

922
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,119
WiIIiam Avery,
Deputy Director of the NSA,

923
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,237
was found dead,
an apparent suicide.
