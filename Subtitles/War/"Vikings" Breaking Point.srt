They say...
The gateway to paris.

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,072
The entrance to paradise.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,540
This city is impregnable.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,310
-(horn blowing)
-they are coming!

6
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,045
Whatever happens,
they must not get
through the gates.

7
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:13,779
They must not
get
into the city.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,450
Show no mercy!
Fight on!

00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,620

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,394
Your highness is
to be congratulated

13
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,462
For the brave defense
of our city.

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,164
Hail the emperor!

15
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,166
-Has my son died?
-I don't know.

16
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:37,169
Next time, we will not
make the same mistakes.

17
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,439
-All of this disaster
is my fault
-athelstan.

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,808
Paris is everything
you told me it would be.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,611
And I am bound and determined
to conquer it.

00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,611
I don't understand why
we failed, ragnar.

38
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,548
I did everything to make sure
we would succeed.

39
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,623

try again tonight.

The anti-christ

I pray to god
and our holy mother
that they will not get in.

But if, god forbid,
they were to do so,

Ah!

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,104
(yelling)

108
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,250
Your highness!
Your highness!

109
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,284
You have to come.

110
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:28,987
Why?

111
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,223
The northmen are almost
inside the city.

112
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:36,094
What can I do to stop them,
that the holy mother
cannot do?

113
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,396
Odo: The men
are so hard-pressed.
So many killed,

114
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,331
So many wounded,
I cannot count them.

115
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,234
But if you were to walk
among them, it would
renew their courage.

116
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,770
It would restore
their strength,
just to see you.

117
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,841
Why? Does it not give
them courage to see you?

118
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,144
-You are their
commander.
-You are their emperor.

119
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,086
I beg you. In the name
of the holy mother, I beg you.
Come with me now.

120
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,821
Come with me
before it's too late.

121
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,892
You cannot speak for her,
count odo.

122
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,895
I thought you would come!
I thought I would not
have to plead.

123
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,465
Not when you heard
that our beloved city
was in mortal danger.

124
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,800
And why did
you think that, pray?

125
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,837
Because I know what your
grandfather would have done.

126
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,441
He would have put on
his armor and come
with us to the bridge.

127
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,314
Alas for you, count odo,
I am not like my grandfather.

128
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,182
I am not charlemagne.

129
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,292

130
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,896

Come!

(screaming)

134
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:09,187
Louis: Count odo! I put
my men at your disposal.

135
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,123
-The devils are not
attacking the walls!
-Thank god. Come quickly!

136
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,825
It may not be too late.

137
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,393
(crowd screaming)

138
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,035

144
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,097
Ah!

145
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:53,965
(grunts)

146
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,611
Rollo!
We can't get through!

147
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,948
Fall back!

148
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,086
Fall back!

149
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,327
(man shouting)

150
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,496

(groaning)

154
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,680
(shivering)

155
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,029
(suspenseful music playing)

156
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,704
Don't abandon me.

157
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,108
(snarling)

158
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,361
â™ª

160
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,780
(groans)

161
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,354
I am told you
speak our language,

162
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,723
But you were
with our enemies.

163
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,360
I have been here before.
I am a wanderer.

164
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,630
I have been to many places.
No one is my enemy.

165
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:20,371
He can, perhaps, be
of great help to us.

166
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,608
I would love to be
a great help to you. Whatever
it is you wish.

167
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,377
I belong to no country,
I belong to no people.

168
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,247
I just belong
to the wide, wide world.

169
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,720
-Who is that?
-Sinric: Earl siegfried.

170
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,599
There was someone else.
A great warrior.

171
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,136
He spiked our machine
and he did it alone.

172
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,540
I have never seen
a man of such strength
and such violence.

173
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,410
Who is he?

174
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,281
His name is rollo. He is
the brother of king ragnar,

175
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,316
The leader of the northmen.

176
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,652
He is a famous warrior.

177
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,821
He fights like
a crazy bear.

178
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,759
Your highness, this man,

179
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,496
Sinric, will be of use
to us.

180
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,099
Gisla: And this earl?

181
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,804
Perhaps he could be bartered,
fetch us a good price.

182
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,174
If you care for me at all,
count odo, you will
bring me his head.

183
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,367
-You wanted to see me,
my lord?
-Yes, yes.

184
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,240
How are you?
How are my grandsons?

185
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,408
How is alfred?

186
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,378
-Both are well.
-Good.

187
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,353
I have received news that
my son and your husband,

188
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,689
Aethelwulf, is even now
returning home.

189
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:22,293
His mission in mercia
was successful,

190
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,195
I'm pleased to say.

191
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,932
-Thank god.
-Indeed.

192
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,269
Thank god.

193
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:45,816
Judith, there are some things

194
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,686
That need to be said,

195
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,590
But other things which
only need to be understood.

196
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,496
I've promised you faithfully

197
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,665
That I will protect you
and your sons,

198
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,367
Especially alfred,

199
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,905
Against anyone
who might offer you
or him some injury.

200
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,812
You do understand what
I'm talking about, don't you?

201
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,585
We both know
what my son is capable of.

202
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,503
My protection I freely offer.

203
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,344
But... (sighs)
there must be recompense.

204
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,514
Recompense.

205
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,286
My lord... Some reward?

206
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,357
Of course...

207
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,393
...Some reward.

208
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,405
(grunts)

209
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,641
(indistinct conversations)

210
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,482
Aslaug: Who is this young man?

211
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,685
-His name is ansgar.
-What is he accused of?

212
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:32,590
He is a stranger, a christian,
a missionary, so he claims.

213
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,860
He has been in the marketplace
denouncing our gods.

214
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,896
(all protesting)

215
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,666
Aslaug: Is it true?

216
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,367
It's true that
I begged the people here

217
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,369
To desist from worshipping
false gods

218
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,672
And serving the devil.

219
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,707
Your gods are made
with human hands

220
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,809
And are deaf, dumb and blind.

221
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,480
What salvation
can they bring you?

222
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,083
Who being senseless
can save themselves?

223
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,686
(crowd clamoring)

224
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,390
I may admit that
your christ is a god.

225
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,827
But even so,
our gods are greater,

226
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,629
Their signs and wonders
mightier.

227
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,963
Is it not true?

228
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,332
(crowd agreeing)

229
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,601
No!

230
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,470
God, the father, the son

231
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,039
And the holy ghost
are the one god!

232
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,874
The rest are just false idols!

233
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,084
And will you subject
your bold assertions

234
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,119
To the judgment
of the gods?

235
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,858
I will.

236
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,394
(crowd murmuring)

237
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,903
(metallic tapping)

238
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,783
Let us begin.

239
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,508
(sizzling)

240
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,438
(rod clatters)

241
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,557
(screams)

242
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,226
(all cheering)

243
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,999
(screaming)

244
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,571
(wailing)

245
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,912
(continues wailing)

246
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,848
(crowd clamoring)

247
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,535
(speaking in native tongue)

248
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,745
(speaking french)

249
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,180
-(thud)
-(screaming)

250
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,750
(laughing)

251
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,752
(screaming)

252
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,689
(giggles)

253
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,727
(laughing)

254
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,576
What might have been
is an abstraction,

255
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,113
Remaining a perpetual
possibility

256
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,050
Only in the world
of speculation.

257
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:30,821
What might have been
and what has been
point to one end,

258
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,024
Which is always present.

259
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,997
Footsteps echo
in the memory...

260
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,233
Is the reward
what I think it is?

261
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,105
...Down the passage
we did not take,

262
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,643
Towards the door
we never opened.

263
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,878
I don't understand.

264
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,017
Somehow, we are always here
at this moment,

265
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,686
You and I.

266
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,025
No, not always. Just now.

267
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,796
You're wise.

268
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,199
I'm not stupid.

269
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,404
(inhales deeply)

270
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,242
(exhales deeply)

271
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,678
The moon is a strange god.

272
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,085
I want you to be my mistress.

273
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,793
Then you will protect alfred?
Look after him?

274
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,409
(softly) get into the bed.

275
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,917
(woman sobbing)

276
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,198
(coughing)

277
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,809
-(baby crying)
-(men coughing)

278
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,251
My god. My god.

279
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,055
So many.

280
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,994
Your highness,
in the last few days

281
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,463
Over 200 of our citizens
have succumbed to

282
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,732
This unknown sickness
and died.

283
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,266
God knows how many more
will likewise die.

284
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,336
What's more,
we're running out of

285
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,771
Fresh vegetables,
fresh fruits.

286
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,372
The city is beginning
to starve.

287
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,912
And yet, we won
a great victory?

288
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,481
Odo: We may have
repelled the pagans

289
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,082
And stopped them
from entering the city,

290
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,152
But that is not exactly
a victory.

291
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:18,856
Who knows? The next time
they may well succeed.

292
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,325
Your highness, we have lost
too many good men.

293
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,365
(sniffling)

294
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,111
What is your advice?

295
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,914
I believe we must attempt
to come to terms with them.

296
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,315
There is, alas, no other way.

297
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,483
Father, I beg you,

298
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,519
Ignore this counsel
of despair.

299
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,855
We should never give in
to these vile pagans,
to these brutes.

300
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,490
Otherwise we will have failed,

301
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,793
And that is how
we would be judged.

302
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,194
Your highness,
I think you must...

303
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,029
Allow me some time to decide!

304
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,175
I understand both
these points of view,

305
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:19,416
But I must pray alone
and try...

306
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,553
And try to discover
the will of god.

307
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,839
(rain falling)

308
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,913
(shivering and grunting)

309
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,887
(coughing)

310
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,634
A toast to my son.

311
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,607
I give thanks to god
for your success
and safe return.

312
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,243
Thank you, father.

313
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,549
I confess to you that

314
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,452
Queen kwenthrith tried
to use her female wiles
upon me,

315
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,956
But with god's help,
I managed to resist
the devil's snares.

316
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,961
I always knew she'd try
to win you over that way.

317
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,430
It's in her nature.

318
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,134
It's what she does.

319
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:47,471
But I also knew that you
would be able to resist her,

320
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,541
For your morals and faith
are such as even I look up to.

321
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,980
I'm sure your wife

322
00:31:56,982 --> 00:32:00,017
Is also happy to hear
that you avoided temptation.

323
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,689
(gasping)
of course.

324
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,328
But... I am not so
much of a hypocrite

325
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,696
As to say so.

326
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,667
No longer be afraid of that.

327
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,636
However painful it was for me,

328
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,440
What happened between
you and athelstan,
was god's work.

329
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,945
It was for a higher purpose.

330
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,714
And although I can't
even guess at that purpose,

331
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,250
I am prepared to bow
before god's will.

332
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,020
I praise your attitude,
my son.

333
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,725
If only we were all so humble
and so righteous.

334
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,297
However... There is

335
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,068
Something I need
to ask you, father.

336
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,971
And you must forgive me,
but there is no help for it.

337
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,111
I need to ask you whether
you were prepared,

338
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:05,215
Secretly, to let
kwenthrith kill me

339
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,985
As the price you were
prepared to pay for
the conquest of mercia.

340
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,222
I was not.

341
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,529
And frankly the
accusation shocks me.

342
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,640
Let me say this to you,

343
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,747
No saxon king
has ever managed

344
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:41,118
To hand over their kingdom
peacefully and successfully
to their son and heir.

345
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,156
But I intend to be the first.

346
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:49,192
And what I intend
to pass on to you

347
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,528
Is not only
the kingdom of wessex,

348
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,398
But the kingdom of England!

349
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,611
Well, let me, in turn,
raise a toast

350
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,147
To my father.

351
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,051
The most loving,
loyal,

352
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,088
And true father
in the world.

353
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,432
(glasses clink)

354
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,499
My son.

355
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,385
(drumming)

356
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,418
Sinric.

357
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,521
I am saddened to see you
a prisoner.

358
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,425
After all,
you're a wanderer.

359
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,861
(grunts)

360
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,699
King ragnar,

361
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,568
-The franks want to discuss
a way to end the siege.
-Why?

362
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,806
They believe it would
be better for both sides.

363
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,709
Why would that
be better for us?

364
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,912
They don't believe you
are capable of breaching
the city walls.

365
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:52,215
-I say we are!
-What will they give us
if we lift the siege?

366
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:59,256
At a meeting between
you and the commander
of the city, count odo.

367
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,627
Bjorn: And where would we have
this meeting?

368
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,330
Because I know that
if my father enters the city,

369
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,834
He will be
captured or killed.

370
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,937
The count suggested
the meeting take place
outside the city walls,

371
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,639
With no weapons.

372
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,243
Tell them they'll have
their answer tomorrow.

373
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,413
(speaking french)

374
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,340
Why should we make
any kind of deal with them?

375
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,808
Bjorn: We've lost
nearly a thousand men,

376
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,643
We can't breach the city,
and winter is coming.

377
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,779
Do you need more reasons?

378
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,915
Why do they offer terms,
if they are so sure
we can't get into the city?

379
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,483
They have probably
run out of food.

380
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,352
Then we should
let them starve.

381
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,920
Ah, then they will
hate us even more.

382
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,990
(all speaking at once)

383
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,359
I have something to say.

384
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,333
I did not become earl
because I aspired to be one.

385
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:22,372
It came about because of
other peoples' actions.

386
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,508
And I did not become king
out of ambition.

387
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,979
But once again
I had no choice,

388
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,250
As a result of
other people's actions.

389
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,020
But nonetheless, I am king.

390
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,757
King ragnar! Hmm.

391
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,460
That is my name. King ragnar!

392
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,265
What does a king do, bjorn?

393
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,835
-He rules.
-Ragnar: Yes!

394
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,337
Good. He rules.

395
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,007
And as a ruler, I...

396
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,413
(softly) ...Have the last say.

397
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:04,481
Me!

398
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,018
Not you! Not you!

399
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,387
Not you! And not you!

400
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,926
You have all had your ideas,

401
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,662
And they have all failed!

402
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,967
I will not.
(grunts)

403
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,637
(coughing)

404
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,876
(spits)

405
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,919
Now, with no more discussion,

406
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,888
We shall meet
the franks tomorrow.

407
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,955
(groans)

408
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,627
(chuckles)

409
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,337
Ragnar: Come with me.

410
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,678
(inaudible)

411
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,983
(laughing)

412
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,826
Give him to me.

413
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,395
Ivar.

414
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,767
Hmm.

415
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,770
-Ivar.
-(footsteps approaching)

416
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,412
What is it?

417
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,381
What should we do
with the christian?

418
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,448
(kisses)

419
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,484
Kill him.

420
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,063
(indistinct conversations)

421
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,634
Ragnar is not here.

422
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,504
He's already left.

423
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,846
(odo speaking french)

424
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,151
Sinric:
How much treasure do you want
to lift the siege and go away?

425
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,462
(speaking french)

426
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,033
5,760 pounds
in gold and silver.

427
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,706
(speaking french

428
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,613
He urges you
to accept the offer.

429
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,449
Reinforcements are
on their way to paris.

430
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,722
Tell him I know that
no one is coming
to save him.

431
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,492
(sinric speaking french)

432
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,860
Ragnar:
And the offer is not enough.

433
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,998
There is something I also seek
that has no tangible worth,

434
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,901
But to me is more precious.

435
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,937
(speaking french)

436
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,508
I want to be baptized.

437
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,244
(speaking french)

438
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,717
He doesn't understand.

439
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,153
Ragnar: I am a dying man.

440
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:35,592
And when I die,
I want to be reunited
with my christian friend,

441
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:36,993
Who happens to be
in your heaven.

442
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,264
(speaking french)

443
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,535
(speaking french)

444
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,203
He says you will go to hell,
not heaven.

445
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,277
That is not
your decision to make.

446
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,848
(speaking french)

447
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,117
Sinric: They will make
arrangements for the ceremony.

448
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,286
This is a man of god,
is it not?

449
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:11,528
And this is water, am I wrong?

450
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,063
You will do it here,
and you will do it now.

451
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,609
(priest praying in
french)

452
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,150
(horses neighing)

453
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,661

in french)
