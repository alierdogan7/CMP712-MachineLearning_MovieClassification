00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,587
I want out, Major.

182
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,489
What are you saying?

183
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,158
You sent us into a country we
weren't even supposed to be in,

184
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,427
with a team that wasn't
qualified for the job.

185
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,529
We lost one today.
We'll get him next time.

186
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,501
No, I had five kills today and we
were only sent out for one target.

187
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,370
It's tough work.

188
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,840
Not really, that's what bothers me.

189
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,043
It was easy, five shots, five kills.

190
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,846
I was on the scope, correcting
for wind and velocity,

191
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,547
doing the trig work in
my head, on the fly.

192
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,216
Yeah, it's just math.

193
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,018
No, everything was easy.

to question his destiny.

Medulla shot, two
days back in London.

Shots were from 1,500 meters

- How high?
- Fifty.

That's not a just a kill,
that's a statement.

It was a home-made bullet with
its own calculated spindrift.

Conditions?

231
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,131
Hopkins' shot required an
adjustment for extreme wind.

232
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,636
- From 1,500 meters?
- Mmm-hmm.

He's been in the shit too long.

01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,388
Listen, Colonel, I know
this thing has gone

710
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,463
a bit sideways and I'm
willing to wear that,

711
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,561
but I've got a piece of business
right in front of me now.

712
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:41,929
What kind of business?

713
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:46,107
A captive hostile.
How far can I take this?

714
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:51,205
No limits. Major, don't let
this ax come to my door.

715
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:53,483
Roger that.

716
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,123
Now where were we?

717
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,220
(SCREAMS)

718
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:10,698
Now you talk or you die.

719
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:12,694
(GROANS)

720
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:42,065
He's gone.

721
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,032
Dad?

722
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,501
Hello, son.

723
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,980
BECKETT: You need to
rendezvous with the team.

724
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,016
BRANDON: You're a hard man to
find, Master Gunnery Sergeant.

725
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:11,089
BECKETT: Yeah.

726
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,729
I guess that's the idea.
Scout Sniper and all.

727
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:47,722
It's me.

728
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,658
Easy, Master Guns.

729
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,100
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

730
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,105
Still leaving the unit?

731
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:03,513
I don't know.

732
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:07,742
You're fighting a good war, Brandon.

733
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,781
We're on the right side of it.

734
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:14,215
Yeah. Well, maybe I just
joined for the wrong reasons.

735
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,356
You should go talk to him.

736
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,393
(SCOFFS) I don't even know him.

737
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:30,333
And the next thing I knew, I became
him. I'm not sure where to begin.

738
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,735
"Where the fuck you
been my whole life?"

739
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:37,115
Start there.

740
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,315
Don't let this moment pass you.

741
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,804
(CLEARS THROAT)

742
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:13,808
Look here, I know there's some
questions you want to ask me, Gunny.

743
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:17,979
And I'm afraid you're not
gonna like the answers.

744
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,515
A sniper is just not a father.

745
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:25,090
I walked. It happened.

746
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:30,594
Should I go on or can we skip
this sad story with all its tears?

747
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:38,706
Let's skip it. Let's
talk about the mission.

748
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,840
Okay.

749
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,543
- Simpson, the assassin...
- BIDWELL: Simpson's working alone.

750
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,848
Major?

751
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:50,878
No, he was never with them.

752
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,883
How do you know that?

753
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,617
Well, my guy turned out
to be quite talkative.

754
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,686
- Huh.
- So how do we catch him?

755
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,521
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

756
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,523
Question.

757
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,525
Who sent all of you out here?

758
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,127
Who else?

759
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,195
The last thing Simpson
said to me was

760
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,398
that he was gunning for
you and the Colonel.

761
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,966
Sounds like a trap to me.

762
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,608
Or a misdirection.

763
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:17,872
Maybe he wants us to lead him there.

764
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,081
The Colonel's in Santorini.

765
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:24,045
In Greece?

766
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,084
That's his new pivot point?

767
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,487
Nice.

768
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:33,766
Well, looks like we'll
need a cruise ship.

769
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,615
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

770
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:04,785
Him?

771
01:12:04,786 --> 01:12:07,121
He's the only one we didn't
take on the mission.

772
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:11,526
Welcome to the shit, Reese.
All right, let's load up.

773
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:20,506
Reese, we good?

774
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,570
I'm good.

775
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,882
Unless you wanna go again?

776
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,144
Not really. But we can.

777
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,786
Let's not. You kicked
my ass the first time.

778
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,825
Are these scanners operational?

779
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:46,327
They should be.

780
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,595
What do you got in mind?

781
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:51,298
You said this shooter uses a
remote control firing platform.

782
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:54,101
Remote-firing systems are
linked in to cell signals.

783
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:56,270
With a cell-tuned scanner,
I could pinpoint

784
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,208
the exact location of
his firing platform.

785
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:03,480
Get on that.

786
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,354
So, who is this guy anyway?

787
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,950
He's working for someone.

788
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,652
Or he's crazy.

789
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,657
Or both.

790
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,998
I hunted this kid once.

791
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:24,198
He did the hero side of Afghanistan

792
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,300
from the Fifth Stryker Brigade.

793
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,238
A 15-month deployment in
the Helmand River Valley.

794
01:13:29,437 --> 01:13:33,250
Heavy action, really heavy.

795
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:38,913
You know, he was a good Marine,

796
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:42,386
but it got to his soul.

797
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:46,527
Messed him up really good.

798
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:53,128
The psychs tagged him with PTSD,
but they didn't discharge him.

799
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,874
They didn't really treat him either.

800
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,812
For three months he wandered
the base with a weapon.

801
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:07,041
January first,
he went into his hooch,

802
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,549
grabbed his weapon and he
shot up a New Year's Party.

803
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:15,957
Then he trekked up to
Yosemite National Forest.

804
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:20,065
No food, no shelter,

805
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,900
temperatures dropping
below freezing.

806
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,066
When we finally spotted him, he was
up the mountain above the snow line.

807
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:39,745
Just sitting there, staring
into dawn's early light.

808
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,758
And then he ate his gun.

809
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:49,290
If Simpson's broken,

810
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:52,753
he makes a perfect
puppet for the Colonel.

811
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,758
What? You think he's in on this?

812
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,128
I sure hope to God he's not.

813
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,385
You don't drink coffee?

814
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,721
Not much.

815
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,755
No bad habits?

816
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:03,196
I like cars.

817
01:16:03,858 --> 01:16:05,626
That's a bad habit?

818
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,597
It is if they're expensive.

819
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,371
How about you?

820
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:16,241
I like to fish.

821
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,848
Well, maybe we'll
cast a line someday.

822
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,385
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah.

823
01:16:29,617 --> 01:16:32,337
Might want to get square,
if you're gonna go see a colonel.

824
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,229
Right.

825
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,902
If you get this Simpson
in your sights,

826
01:16:48,903 --> 01:16:50,804
you put some hot lead into him.

827
01:16:50,805 --> 01:16:52,877
One shot, one kill.

828
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:54,909
Yes, sir.

829
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,978
Brandon?

830
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,886
You hold my weapon.

Excuse me, sir.
You have a phone call.

01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,353
Excuse me, please.

836
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:41,315
Yes, who's this?

01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,389
Former Master Gunnery
Sergeant Thomas Beckett, sir.

838
01:18:44,752 --> 01:18:46,353
Beckett?

839
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:47,488
Thought you were dead.

840
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:51,125
You mean you heard I was dead,
but I'm betting you didn't believe it.

841
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,426
That's true.

842
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:53,527
Where are you?

843
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,962
<i>On my way to see you.</i>

844
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,898
Are you close?

845
01:18:57,098 --> 01:18:58,198
Very.

846
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,167
<i>Should I send someone?</i>

847
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,869
No, I'll cab it.

853
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:54,155
If Simpson's here, I want him dead.

854
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,394
Wow. Nice office.

855
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,769
You certainly made a
deal with the devil, sir.

856
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:17,230
This is a breach of protocol.

857
01:22:17,231 --> 01:22:19,576
You didn't have to see me, Colonel.

858
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:24,538
You call me up from the grave
and expect me not to respond?

859
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,906
Do you know who I have up there?

860
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:27,979
Yeah.

861
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,443
The, uh...

862
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,346
The US Attorney
General, Phil Daniels,

863
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:35,955
the esteemed Senator
from North Dakota,

864

and the Syrian Rebel Forces.

And from the looks of it,
a couple of <i>Playboy</i> Bunnies.

01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:48,173
Well, we don't all wear a
ghillie suit and creep around.

867
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,531
Question.

868
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,933
Did you send an assassin to track me

869
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,068
and the other members
of Mission Sentinel?

870
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:58,372
If I sent a kill squad for you,

871
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:01,275
you would not be here
having this conversation.

872
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:04,822
Damn, Thomas, we go back a long way.

873
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,956
Yeah, yep.

874
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,084
- Twenty-five years.
- That's right.

875
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:13,453
So, if you think I'm
gonna stand here

876
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:15,455
and let you point your
finger in my face,

877
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:16,990
you can go to straight
to hell, Beckett.

878
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:18,392
Well, then tell me what's happening.

879
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:21,495
What's happening is David Simpson.

880
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:24,876
He's been in the game too
long and he had a meltdown.

881
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,336
And let me tell you something,
there is no conspiracy here.

882
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,375
I'm telling you what I know.

883
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:38,812
Well, tell me something, Colonel,

884
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:43,388
does this, um, black-on-black
work ever wear you out?

885
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:50,024
Yeah, it does,
when I think about it.

886
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:54,366
