(Warriors scream)
(Arne and Floki grunt in pain)

3
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:07,039
Is this what you really want,
brother?

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:08,978
Why do we fight each other?!

5
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:10,230
If we raided together,

6
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:13,533
we would not need to kill
anymore of our young folk.

7
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,702
My mind tends the same way
as Ragnar's.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,737
I will raid with you.

9
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:21,074
I have to leave.
Everyone hates me here.

10
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,878
But you were going to leave
and not even say goodbye to me?

11
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:25,995
Who is Aslaug?

12
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,797
She is a Gotaland princess.

13
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:29,099
Did you have sex with her?!

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Yes.

15
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:32,552
I don't love her.

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,671
But this woman is carrying my child.

17
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:36,473
You must accept her.

18
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,142
You insult and humiliate me.

19
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:41,845
I have no choice but to leave you.

20
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,930
I'm coming with you.

34

Let's go find out what your
your brother Hvitserk is doing?

35
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,723
All right.

36
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:06,295
(Hall buzzes with chatter and laughter)

37
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,103
(Laughter)

38
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,717
The axe is much better
than the sword because...

39
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,943
- TORSTEIN: How?
- And the range!

40
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:23,029
EVERYONE:
(Cheering and whistling)

41
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,617
Hello, Floki. You made it.

42
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:28,981
- Helga.
- Torstein.

43
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,787
Torstein, you're standing
in the way of the fire.

44
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,989
As usual.

45
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,124
Hello, Priest.

46
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,043
(Speaking Norse)

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Ooh!

48
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,513
Why do you still say such things?

49
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,716
So where is he?
Where is our Earl?

50
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,103
Behind you.

51
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:51,057
- Hey, Ubbe! Hey!
- Hello, Floki.

52
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,508
We've kind of missed you.

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,144
Well, I've been busy like a dwarf,

54
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,981
building your new boats,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

55
00:02:58,065 --> 00:02:59,899
even in the ice and the snow.

56
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:01,618
So busy,

57
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:04,570
yet he still have so much time
to complain.

58
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:06,906
FLOKI:
The boats are nearly finished.

59
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,993
I think we all want to know
where we'll be raiding this summer.

60
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:13,830
Every year, all your people wonder
when you will order another raid West

61
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,965
and every year you disappoint them.

62
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,418
I've even heard some people say

63
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:21,754
that Earl Ragnar is becoming
like Earl Haraldson.

64
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:25,591
Let me put their minds at ease.

65
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,043
You should.

66
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:34,183
Welcome, everyone.

67
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:37,153
As you all know,
it has taken a long time

68
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:39,772
to prepare ourselves.

69
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,824
To build our ships,

70
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,995
and to replace the young men
that we lost to the plague.

71
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:51,617
But now, now we are ready,

72
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,954
and this summer
we shall finally go West again.

73
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:57,206
(Enthusiastic cheers erupt)
Yay! Yeah!

74
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,709
We will return to England,

75
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:04,533
for that land was so generous
to us the last time.

76
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:06,799
But this time, we shall not go alone.

77
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:11,554
For King Horik and Jarl Borg
have agreed to join us.

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,859
And perhaps we will not have
to return so quickly,

79
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:19,112
but stay in their land for awhile,

80
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,598
explore it, maybe even winter there.

81
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Who knows?

82
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:28,121
But, I tell you,
these are interesting times.

83
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:32,075
The world is changing
and we must change with it.

84
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:38,498
We must act together,

85
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,683
for everyone's sake.

86
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:50,009
And now that I have
put your minds to rest,

87
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,460
who is hungry?

88
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:55,264
TOWNSFOLK:
(Cheering and clapping)

89
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,736
(Light kiss)

90
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,905
(Hall buzzes with excited chatter)

91
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,407
(Weary exhale)

92
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:07,994
(Geese honk, goats bleat)

93
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,542
(Low moan)

94
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,014
(Sighs heavily)

95
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,635
(Water splashes as ice breaks)

96
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:40,810
(Gasping and sputtering)

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,215
(Gasping)

98
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:49,986
(Hall buzzes with excited chatter)

99
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,738
Thank you.

100
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,876
I've never seen you before.

101
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,628
What is your name?

102
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:01,664
My name is Hild, my lord.

103
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,867
Where are you from?

104
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:07,669
- Upsalla.
- Upsalla.

105
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,173
Thank you.

106
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,648
What were you talking about
with her?

107
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:29,242
We were talking about movements
in the shield-wall.

108
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:38,584
Girl, bring me some more food.

109
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:42,672
- I have to eat for two.
- Yes, my lady.

110
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:49,128
How old are you?

111
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,763
I don't know.

112
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:52,798
Old enough, I'd say.

113
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:57,987
Be careful who you choose
to be familiar with.

114
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,256
Yes, my Lady Aslaug.

115
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:03,776
(Door slams shut)

116
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:05,811
What is it?

117
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,564
What is what?

118
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,901
You...

119
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:15,988
You are acting very...strangely.

120
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,638
Oh, you think it is strange
for a pregnant woman

121
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:25,564
to want her husband
to be supportive and kind?

122
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,416
No.

123
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:30,169
Then why do you think
I'm acting "strangely"?

124
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:33,289
I don't know.

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,007
You don't know that you're
flirting with other women

126
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,059
and showing them
you want to bed them?

127
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,595
I am not doing that.

128
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,864
(Grunts)

129
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:49,671
You're saying such things
because of your condition.

130
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,194
(Coldly furious)
My "condition"?!

131
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,700
Tell your beautiful mother

132
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:03,986
that I am not doing what she thinks.

133
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,822
(Ragnar gasps)

134
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:11,093
Yes, you are.
Women know these things.

135
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:14,579
I know it especially,
because I have certain gifts.

136
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:18,017
(Snorts)
Gifts?

137
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:21,520
I see things others cannot.

138
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,474
Ah!

139
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,977
You mean you are a Volva?

140
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:34,426
Seeress? I may be.

141
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:41,157
They say that Volvas practice
forbidden sexual rites.

142
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,527
Shall I stay awake?

143
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:46,429
The fact is, you want to sleep
with that girl,

144
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,582
even though she is barely
above a slave girl.

145
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,734
That is such an insult to me.

146
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:58,207
I do not want to sleep
with that girl,

147
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,977
whatever her name is.

148
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:07,566
Good night, little one.

149
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:11,854
And now I'm going to sleep.

150
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:22,531
I won't let you sleep
until I have told you this:

151
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,533
I will bear you another son.

152
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,619
If you like, you can feel him
stirring in my belly.

153
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,338
But, because you treat me
like an idiot,

154
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,040
I make this prophecy.

155
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,042
My father killed the dragon Fafnir,

156
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:38,463
and our new son will be born
with the image of the serpent in his eye.

157
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,751
This much I know.

158
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,357
SEER:
What is it you want?

159
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,194
The gods have given me sons,

160
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,262
as they promised.

161
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:56,698
But I want to know
what the future holds.

162
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,700
what will become of them?

163
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:03,205
The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok
will be spoken of

164
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:07,476
as long as men have tongues to speak.

165
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:14,183
They will enjoy that much fame?

166
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:18,320
One of them will marry
the daughter of a king.

167
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:22,324
Another will discover
and sail around the sea

168
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,426
that has no tides.

169
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:29,264
All this, and more, have I foreseen.

170
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:32,067
Then they will have more fame than I,

171
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:33,652
their father?

172
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,605
(Chuckles softly)

173
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:39,074
What about Bjorn?

174
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,143
What about my son Bjorn?

175
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,713
What of him?

176
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:47,049
Is he alive?

177
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,751
It was of him I was speaking.

178
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,372
Will I ever see him again?

179
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,757
You ask too many questions.

180
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,760
I have said enough.

181
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:04,499
(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)

182
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,768
(Geese honk)

183
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,955
- See for yourself. Good salted fish.
- Not today.

184
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,362
You're a disgrace.

185
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,455
(Flame crackles)

186
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:36,581
I have lost everything!

187
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:41,219
My sons, my husband,
finally my daughter.

188
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,756
I am not going to lose you.

189
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:55,067
Yesterday your brother spoke
of the summer's raid.

190
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,053
He's going west again,
with King Horik.

191
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,690
You must ask him
to take you with him.

192
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:04,609
(Pathetically)
Look at me!

193
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:09,531
You will look better
if you have something to believe in.

194
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,702
I am giving you a choice, Rollo.

195
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,989
Go and speak with your brother,

196
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,411
or...

197
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,047
(Blade scrapes)

198
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:27,299
or take this blade,

199
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,719
push it into your ribs right now.

200
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:34,723
Stay in hell for all eternity.

201
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,287
(Flesh sizzles)

202
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:51,406
(Stifled gasps)

203
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,626
(Stifled grunts of pain)

204
00:12:57,884 --> 00:12:59,618
ASLAUG:
One day, Hvitserk,

205
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:03,538
you will ride a horse, just like this.

206
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,677
(Approaching footsteps)

207
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,495
Ragnar.

208
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,723
(Goats bleat)

209
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,677
You should all leave.

210
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,869
- Come on, boys.
- Ubbe, go with your mother.

211
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,855
I said everyone.

212
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:40,525
Well, I just thought...

213
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,744
Everyone.

214
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:58,376
Well, are you going to take a seat?

215
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:09,404
(Sighs)

216
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:13,658
So where have you been
for so long, brother?

217
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:17,662
Carrying around my heavy heart,

218
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,082
cursing the gods,

219
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,785
cursing myself,

220
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:29,424
and then drinking ale until
I almost forgot everything.

221
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,078
So why are you here now?

222
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:37,799
I am your brother.

223
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:43,254
You chose to fight against me.

224
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:45,757
I remember when we were boys,

225
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:49,311
we often fought against each other.

226
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,731
Isn't that always the way
with brothers?

227
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:56,568
They hate and love each other
all the time.

228
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:59,571
You could have killed me,

229
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:02,073
like you killed One-Eye.

230
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,659
I could never have killed you.

231
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:09,764
Tell me, why should I
ever trust you again?

232
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,019
Because I ask you to.

233
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:18,106
Shouldn't you be asking
for forgiveness

234
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,308
after everything you have done?

235
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:25,196
I ask only for the opportunity
to regain your respect,

236
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:30,035
to fight beside you again in battle.

237
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,972
I have nothing.

238
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,575
You have suffered.

239
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:46,051
But many people suffered more
because of what you did.

240
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,478
Let me think on it.

241
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:02,650
Then I'll give you my decision.

242
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,136
(Sniffs)

243
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,774
You broke my heart.

244
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:17,532
(Metallic clanking, steam hisses)

245
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,086
MEN AND WOMEN:
(Fighting grunts)

246
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,147
MAN:
Good!

247
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,355
(Weapons clank, slash, and thud)

248
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,692
MAN:
Use your fear!

249
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:30,011
Not bad for a shield-maiden.

250
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:37,051
(Men and women grunt)
(Weapons clang and thud)

251
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:43,608
Do you ever miss England?

252
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,043
No.

253
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:47,112
(Weapons clank, warriors grunt)

254
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,319
Sometimes.

255
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,036
I want you to come with me.

256
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,154
Of course.

257
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,873
I don't want to stay here
with the old people.

258
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,058
Good.

259
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,994
Perhaps you will come in useful.

260
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:07,031
(Lunging grunt, weapons clank)

261
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,335
We will need the help of all the gods,

262
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,053
including yours.

263
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,506
(Weapons clank, hard blows)

264
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,074
- Ungh!
- Ooh!

265
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:18,343
(Panting)

266
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:23,314
(Weapons clank, Athelstan grunts)

267
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,916
(Gasps)

268
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:28,553
(Weapons clank)
(Men and women grunt)

269
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:30,388
MAN:
That's better!

270
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,490
- MAN: Yah!
- WOMAN: Ungh!

271
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,329
It is one thing to use a weapon,

272
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:40,698
but another to kill.

273
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,203
Ungh!

274
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,955
Never hesitate.

275
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:49,374
(Horn bellows)

276
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,245
RAGNAR:
King Horik!

277
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,130
Welcome indeed.

278
00:17:56,248 --> 00:18:00,051
Earl Ragnar, my great friend.

279
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:03,021
I heard you came by horse.
Where are your ships?

280
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,890
My ships are being prepared.
I could not wait.

281
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:08,226
I have waited an eternity already.

282
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,313
Ja. I said to my sons,
hmm, I have to set off.

283
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,649
I cannot even wait for the ice to melt.

284
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,535
My ships will arrive soon enough.

285
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,038
And I look forward to getting
to know your sons

286
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,273
and introducing mine.

287
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:25,109
There is someone here
that you will well remember.

288
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,499
(Approaching footsteps)

289
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,507
FLOKI:
Come here, Ubbe.

290
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:44,365
I can see, King Horik,
that you're not too...

291
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,482
delighted to see me,
but I hope you're not surprised.

292
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,936
We all made an agreement to raid together
and I've come to honor it.

293
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,622
The last time we met, Jarl Borg,

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,873
I had the distasteful task

295
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,293
of burying many of my kinsmen
and friends.

296
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:00,745
And for the past four years,

297
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:03,464
I've been paying you profits
from my lands.

298
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,551
But still, it is true,

299
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,804
I am not surprised to see you.

300
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,474
Good.

301
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:24,635
Is this not Rollo,

302
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,604
the brother who fought against us?

303
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,606
Yes.

304
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,359
And you spared his life?

305
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:34,979
The gods spared his life.

306
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,315
What is your decision?

307
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:42,253
I accept you back, Rollo.

308
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:44,705
I acknowledge you as my brother,

309
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:47,758
but I forbid you to raid with us.

310
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,665
I accept your judgment.

311
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,026
(Sighs uneasily)

312
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:10,514
(Music plays)
(Rowdy laughter and chatter)

313
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:13,734
MAN:
Drink to the gods!

314
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,853
(Laughs)

315
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:18,022
JARL BORG:
King Horik.

316
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:20,491
(Ale pours)

317
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,129
(Chatter and laughter fills hall)

318
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:29,750
(Music continues playing)

319
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,039
KING HORIK:
Ahh!

320
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,041
I have to tell you, Princess Aslaug,

321
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:40,678
it is the greatest privilege and honor
to be seated beside you,

322
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,546
the daughter of Sigurd.

323
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:44,381
Thank you, King Horik.

324
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,767
Such a compliment,
from a man like you,

325
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:47,885
is always welcome.

326
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:50,554
Mm. Oh, it is true,
I have also slain dragons,

327
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,389
just like your father.

328
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:53,691
Unfortunately, like most men,

329
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:56,527
the dragons were only inside my head.

330
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,746
(Laughs)

331
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,698
How old are you, Ari?

332
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:03,567
Seventeen. Nearly eighteen.

333
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,236
Will this be your first raid?

334
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:10,257
Yes. I can't wait
to prove myself in battle.

335
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,576
I want my father to be proud of me.

336
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:16,246
I have a son about your age.

337
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,915
Where is he?

338
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:21,585
I would like to meet him.

339
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,588
I do not know where he is.

340
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,857
That is by his choice.

341
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,929
I should never have mentioned him.
Drink.

342
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:38,636
I have made a decision.

343
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:42,323
I do not wish Jarl Borg
to raid with us.

344
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,442
But we had an agreement.
Why not?

345
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,462
Why do you not want
your brother beside you?

346
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,163
Because you don't trust him enough.

347
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,332
It is the same for me with Jarl Borg.

348
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,385
I cannot bring myself
to trust him completely.

349
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,472
You must inform him of our decision.

350
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:03,510
(Loud buzz of chatter)
(Fire crackles)

351
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:06,963
(Sighs heavily)

352
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,567
- Skol.
- Skol.

353
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,915
MAN:
Come look!

354
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:39,269
(Water splashes and churns)

355
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:42,055
Are you jealous?

356
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:44,992
Hmph! They won't even
make it out of the Fjord.

357
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:46,910
(Laughs)

358
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,913
They are beautiful, King Horik.

359
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:51,698
(Pleased)
Mm-hm.

360
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,540
Jarl Borg, thank you for waiting.

361
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:03,427
So... when do we set sail?

362
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,466
Forgive me, Jarl Borg,

363
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:13,136
but we have decided
not to seek your help.

364
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:20,644
I thought we had an agreement.

365
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:23,447
It is not my desire
to break that agreement.

366
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,266
Believe me,
I wish it to remain intact.

367
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:32,406
- But on this occasion...
- On this occasion?

368
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,475
On this occasion,
the silver thread is slit,

369
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,577
the golden cup breaks

370
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,796
and the pail is smashed at the spring.

371
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,503
I know much about what happens here
that you do not.

372
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:50,724
I know things about Ragnar Lothbrok
you do not know.

373
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,845
I knew his first wife, Lagertha,
and their son Bjorn.

374
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:58,432
I know his strengths,
and I know his weaknesses.

375
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,354
Why should I need to know
his weaknesses?

376
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,973
Because he is your his ally.

377
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:14,865
It is always a strength

378
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:18,151
to know the weaknesses
of your friends,

379
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,505
is it not?

380
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:27,377
I might be interested
in what you know.

381
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:31,598
But how do I know
you and I can trust each other?

382
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:33,066
(Fire crackles)

383
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,167
Hmm?

384
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,603
(Ale pours)

385
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,859
Your brother gives with one hand
and takes away with the other.

386
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:46,513
How many times must you suffer
his injustices?

387
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:50,033
(Strums a chord)

388
00:24:55,189 --> 00:25:00,494
If only you had stayed strong,
we would have overcome.

389
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:05,031
And now he does with you
as he wishes.

390
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:12,019
It's terrible to witness the state
into which you have fallen...

391
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,731
you, Rollo,

392
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:19,564
the greatest warrior.

393
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:22,148
What do you want?

394
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:25,902
Abandon your brother for good.

395
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:28,204
You will never be anything here.

396
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:34,077
Why would you stay?
What can you find?

397
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,162
Myself.

398
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,081
Yourself?

399
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:41,568
(Laughs)

400
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:43,503
Yourself?!
(Slaps knee)

401
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,006
(Chuckles softly)

402
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:47,373
If you want to find yourself...

403
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:49,976
(Hard punch, chair crashes)

404
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:54,881
(Grunting and panting)

405
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,834
You're a fool.
(Spits)

406
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,522
Yes.

407
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,410
But someday I hope to be wise.

408
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:11,498
(Moans of pleasure)

409
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,035
(Sigh of pleasure)

410
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,244
(Metallic clanking)
MAN 1: We can take three more!

411
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:34,437
MAN 2:
We can take both of them!

412
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:35,889
You'll have need of these!

413
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,774
MAN 3:
It can't come soon enough!

414
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,826
MAN 4: That's my axe,
so keep it with me!

415
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:42,228
MAN 5:
Okay, get it.

416
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:47,266
(Exhales)

417
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,936
All right.

418
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,910
Hey.

419
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:01,915
Now you be a good boy,

420
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:05,952
and you do what your mother tells you.

421
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:10,306
(Whispers)
Most of the time.

422
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,292
Hey. Ooh!

423
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,151
(Ragnar sighs heavily)

424
00:27:21,268 --> 00:27:23,403
(Whispers)
I love you.

425
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:26,406
Good boy.

426
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:38,835
(Sighs heavily)

427
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:43,289
Farewell, my wife.

428
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:48,461
And you, Sigurd.

429
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,932
We will make a sacrifice to Thor,

430
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,802
but I believe you shall
cross the sea safely.

431
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:03,893
I shall get word to you
as soon as I can.

432
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:10,016
I will miss you... your pride.

433
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:17,791
So will I.

434
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:23,213
CAPTAIN:
Hoist sails!

435
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,998
- WARRIOR 1: Heave!
- WARRIOR 2: Hoist sails!

436
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:28,301
- WARRIOR 1: Heave! Heave!
- CAPTAIN: Hoist!

437
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,537
WARRIOR 1: Heave!
CAPTAIN: Dig in the oars! Oars!

438
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,058
Hold!

439
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,436
Steady now!

440
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:49,772
Row!

441
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,943
(Grunt of seething frustration)

442
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:56,229
(Axe splashes)

443
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,438
(Water churns)

444
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:11,177
(Ship plows through the water)

445
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:27,014
(Foreboding music plays)

446
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,373
(Ship creaks)

447
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:43,164
What do you think?

448
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,335
That we ought to be near land
by now.

449
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:49,587
(Raven cries)

450
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,975
(Wings beat loudly)

451
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,710
What now?

452
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,481
We wait.

453
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:05,019
(Thunder rumbles)
(Rain pours down)

454
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:09,357
(Waves crash forcefully)

455
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,108
(Shouts in fear)
Oh!

456
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,078
MAN: (In Norse)
Aesir is angry!

457
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:17,615
(Waves crash forcefully)

458
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,068
MAN: (In Norse)
Odin, help us!

459
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,339
(Waves crash forcefully)
(Rain pours down)

460
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,709
You having fun yet, Horik?

461
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,745
(Laughs)

462
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,217
(Sail rips)

463
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,753
It's going to tear, get it down!

464
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,140
(Grunts of effort)

465
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
(Booming crash)

466
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,098
What is that?

467
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,368
That's the sound of waves
hitting rocks.

468
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,708
(Booming crash)

469
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:06,464
Set the oars! Prepare to pull away!

470
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,833
Pull away!

471
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,219
(Grunts of effort)

472
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,221
Quickly!

473
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,490
(Struggling grunts)

474
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,600
You asked to see me?

475
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,302
Yes, sit.

476
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,986
We have not made friends.
It is my fault.

477
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:49,373
But, if you want to,
we can be friends now.

478
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,459
After all, we a family

479
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:55,729
and Ragnar has forgiven his brother.

480
00:31:56,982 --> 00:32:00,367
I would be honored
to be considered your friend.

481
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:05,839
Let's not fool one another.

482
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:08,676
You were once where I am now.

483
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:12,379
Perhaps you wish to return
to this status?

484
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,367
If so, I don't blame you.

485
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:19,653
But in the meantime,
let's not be enemies.

486
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,425
Women should stick together more.

487
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,627
That's true.

488
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,495
And we should rule!

489
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:31,599
(Laughs)
All things would be better.

490
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,008
Friend.

491
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,278
Friend.

492
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:57,291
We've been blown miles off course,

493
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,526
who knows where we are?

494
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:01,962
The gods know, Priest.

495
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,634
What I want to know...
Where are all the ships?

496
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,842
How many do you see?

497
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,477
Only four.

498
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,846
Some of the others
may have been scattered.

499
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,765
Or they all might all have foundered.

500
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:25,402
(Ship creaks)

501
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,273
Father! Father, come see!

502
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,824
(Chuckles)
What did I tell you, boy?

503
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:31,909
Land!

504
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:35,245
I told my sons
Ragnar always finds land!

505
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,901
Where do you suppose we are?

506
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:45,589
I build boats Ragnar,
you're the navigator.

507
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:52,346
(Sighs)

508
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,599

(Water splashes and churns)

514
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:51,972
(Footsteps squelch in the sand)

515
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,983
(Seabirds cry)

516
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,993
(Bush rustles)

517
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:23,670

Ha!

518
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:40,814
(Footsteps splash)

519
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,979
(Birds chirp and twitter)

520
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:56,329
Ragnar, Ragnar. There's fish.

521
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:04,371
(Birds chirp and twitter)

522
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,546
(Men converse quietly,
laugh, sharpen blades)

523
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:13,947
WARRIOR 1:
...tell you about it.

524
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,767
WARRIOR 2: You were the strong man
at the back of the ship, weren't you?

525
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,084
WARRIOR 3:
Learn to tell a joke!

526
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:20,353
(Boisterous laughter)

527
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,567
WARRIOR 1:
Oh, you're gonna need your fill, lad.

528
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,475
WARRIOR 2: I feel like I'm going
to have nice sleep now.

529
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,310
That's all I need.

530
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,946
Ha!
(Victorious giggle)

531
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,232
MAN:
(Heavy breathing)

532

He's paying no heed.

534

Ari! Ari!

(Arrows whistle, warriors cry out)

540
00:36:58,526 --> 00:36:59,926
Shields!

- Shields!
- Get down! Get down!

542
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:04,431
Priest! In!

543

Meet everything head-on.

556
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:54,497
Whether we live or die today
is in the hands of the gods.

557
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,382
They already know
if we sup with them tonight,

558
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,634
so fear not.

559
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,802
Fight well, and if you fall,

560
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,938
surely Odin will take you
to Valhalla.

Aghhhhh!

577
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:55,358
Perhaps he can strike
them dead with his holy book!

578
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:58,745
Agggghhhhhh!
(Shields and weapons clash)

(Exhales painfully)

604

You did not hesitate today.

Take it, if you want.

What have you heard
about King Ecbert?

622
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:28,538
That he's just like you.

623

(Approaching footsteps)

624
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,145
What on earth has caused you

625
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,233
to bring your muddy boots
into my bathhouse?

626
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,236
Forgive me, sire.

627
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,788
But the Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.

628
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:06,292
They defeated a large force
of our men.

629
