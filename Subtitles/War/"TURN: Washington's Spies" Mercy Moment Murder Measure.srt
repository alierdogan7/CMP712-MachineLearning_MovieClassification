Warden: No.

00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:34,433
Tallmadge.

3
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:37,236
No.

4
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,471
Tallmadge. No.

5
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:43,175
Samuel.
Samuel Tallmadge.

6
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,512
Rebel officer,
captured at Valcour Island.

7
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,148
- No.
- Aye?

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,505
Ah, Tallmadge.
Here he is.

9
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,890
Or was.

10
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:57,192
Died just before Christmas.

11
00:00:58,306 --> 00:01:01,183
Dysentery, supposedly.

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,331
- ( Body splashes )
- Thank you for visiting the Jersey.

13
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,636
Who was his bunkmate?

14
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,373
Bunkmate?

15
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,844
You know what I mean. The
man he talked to the most.

16
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:22,681
- How should I bloody know...
- Go and find him now

17
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,584
before I heave you
over the side, eh?

18
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,853
( Chuckles )

19
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,456
Go on.

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,159
All right.

21
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,863
I spent three years
on a bucket like this.

22
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,633
<i>You make a friend fast
or you die.</i>

23
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,473
A ship like this
brought me over.

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,378
They pitched so many
bodies into the sea,

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,614
the sharks would
follow us like dogs

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,616
- waiting on table scraps.
- ( grunting )

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,321
We're the sharks now.

28
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,724
You remember that.

29
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,227
<i>( Chains rattling )</i>

30
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,665
Well, they say
this is the man you want.

31
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,240
You knew Samuel Tallmadge?

32
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,776
Huh?

33
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,846
Hey, what's your name?

34
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,383
Hmm?

35
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,685
Where are you from?

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,756
( Whispers ) Setauket.

37
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,892
What?

38
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,560
( Louder ) Setauket.

39
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,694
Setauket?

40
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,565
<i>Where the Tallmadge boys roam.</i>

41
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,836
So, you and Sam
were kindred or kin?

42
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,273
<i>- What's his name?
- Jordan: Major.</i>

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,946

Hey, Woody.

58
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,709
You got any breakfast here?

59
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,377
Oh, you bastard.

<i>- Bastard!
- All right.</i>

61

What are you doing here?
This is my home!

62
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,719
Aye, and a fine little home
it is, albeit a bit lonely.

63
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,821
And you are aware
that the soldier

64
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,489
who is quartered here
will be back soon.

65
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,625
Well, we'd better
eat quick, then.

66
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,331
It's fine silver.

67
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,867
I'll get you a good price for it
across the Sound, if you like.

68
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,603
Give me that. We're supposed
to meet in the cove.

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,006
Yeah, and you're supposed
to hang a petticoat.

70
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,608
When I'm ready with the intelligence.
That was the plan.

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,543
When you're ready?
It's been two months

72
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,812
<i>since you passed on that little
morsel about sauerkraut.</i>

73
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,547
I've been having trouble
getting into the city

74
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,684
without raising
suspicions, all right?

75
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,886
It's not as easy
for me as you'd think.

76
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,389
<i>Caleb: No one thinks it is easy.</i>

77
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,791
<i>But this is about
more than just you.</i>

78
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,869
- What's this?
- That is your new Bible.

79
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,040
<i>It's a code dictionary.</i>

80
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,775
<i>Makes sure that anything
that you write</i>

81
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,611
<i>can't be read by the enemy.
In case of intercept.</i>

82
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,980
Each word has its own number.

83
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,050
Ben chose the words
he thought we'd use most.

84
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,951
Now, look.

85
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:26,491
Here, 722.
That's you.

86
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,761
721 is Benny boy.

87
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,397
725, yours truly.

88
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,732
Yeah, but hang on a sec.

89
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,769
Look, 722 says here
Samuel Culper.

90
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,871
Culpepper. Yeah?

91
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,874
That's your alias, all right?

92
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,078
It's the only name we use for
you back at headquarters.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
Woodhull does not exist.

94
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,882
Culpepper.
Culpeh-per.

95
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,017
Cul-pepper.

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,753
Peeper, Piper, Pepper.

97
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,421
I hate it.

98
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,358
Well, Washington
picked that one.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,893
And Ben picked Samuel
on account of his brother.

100
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,896
Washing... Washington?
General Washington?

101
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,934
That's right.
Old 711 himself.

102
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,443
"Mercy, Moment,

103
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,912
Murder, Measure."

104
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,515
I'm not gonna
remember all this.

105
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,953
That's why you keep
the book hidden.

106
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,590
<i>Now, when can I tell them
you're heading back</i>

107
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,925
<i>to British headquarters?</i>

108
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,697
This draft note confirms
that I gave half my hay

109

to the King's Army
on October 12th.

110
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,434
But Colonel Beecham
will not accept it

111
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,902
in exchange for new seed.

112
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,470
<i>Hewlett:
Nor should he.</i>

113
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,972
<i>Colonel Beecham
is the land commissary.</i>

114
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,541
That certificate
is meant for Captain Dodd.

115
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,476
<i>Richard: Dodd will
convert that note,</i>

116
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,612
but you need to get Faro and
Harborough to sign off.

117
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,615
- Yes, but...
- Next in line, please.

118
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,654
State your name and your case.

119
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,756
Anna Strong to seek parole
for my husband, Selah Strong.

120
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,758
<i>Richard: On what grounds
do you seek parole?</i>

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,428
It has been four months since he
has been remanded to the Jersey

122
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,830
and still no evidence has been
brought forward against him.

123
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,699
We have several witness
accounts of a petition

124
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,103
naming your husband as
delegate to an illegal body

125
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,106
known as the New York
Provincial Congress.

126
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,575
Counsel recommends
no parole at this time.

127
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,043
Next in line!

128
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,712
Major, please. You are a man of honor.
I beg you, listen.

129
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,181
Madam, you will address
the magistrate.

130
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,217
Unless this so-called
petition is produced,

131
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,119
the charge against
my husband is hearsay.

132
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,855
<i>Richard: Selah Strong
confessed to insurrection.</i>

133
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,557
You forced him to confess

134
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,025
so you could
lay claim to our land

135
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,093
and sell it off piece by
piece to your friends.

136
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,829
Mrs. Strong.

137
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,097
( Quietly )
You forget yourself.

138
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,606
<i>Woman: Patriot princess. How

139
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,141
Well, now I will charge her...

00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,543
Richard.

141
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,111
Let's continue, shall we?

142
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,053
<i>Rogers:
So, Selah Strong.</i>

143
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,822
You knew Samuel Tallmadge
very well?

144
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,692
All my life.

145
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,862
And his brother Benjamin?

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,032
Well, I have to tell you,

147
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,501
I've been to your little town

148
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,904
and I've met
your lovely wife, Anna.

149
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,708
Poor woman has been pining after
ya, ain't that right, Jordan?

150
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,712
Yes, every week she asks the
king's head man to release you.

151
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,181
You've got many friends

152
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,985
who are very anxious
to see your bondage end.

153
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,687
Friends who pay men like me

154
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,891
to get men like you
out of places like this.

155
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,928
So, what do you say,
Mr. Strong?

156
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,632
Would you like to go home?

157
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,685
Mrs. Strong?

158
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,687
I'm closing up for the night.

159
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,623
Mr. DeJong asks I send the rum
down to the cellar at 10:00.

160
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,258
No, that's fine.

161
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,195
I've come to deliver this,
courtesy of Major Hewlett.

162
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,798
It came tonight via dispatch
rider from New York.

163
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,306
<i>A Major John Andre sent it for
the child of his housemaid,</i>

164
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,775
who Major Hewlett remembered is in
your care and asked me to bring...

165
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,677
Cicero!

166
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,614
I'm almost done folding, miss.

167
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:46,217
Look, it's a birthday
gift from your mother.

168
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,957
Look what she made.

169
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,903
Mr. Baker.

Tomorrow, then, all right?
Somewhere private. Our tree or...

176
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,024
This is where I work now,

177
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,761
at the tavern I was forced
to sell to Maarten DeJong.

178
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,797
And tomorrow he expects
me to work all day.

179
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,066
I'm going to New York
to sell your crop.

180
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,106
The cauliflower, all of it.

181
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,108
( Cup clatters )

182
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,011
( snoring )

183
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,183
Are you saying this to hurt me?

184
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,787
( Quietly ) It's to
hurt them, all right?

185
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,424
<i>Listen to me, I need... I
need you to ride with me.</i>

186
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,293
I need you to...

187
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,799
I need you to pose as...

188
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,269
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,772
So you can sell off the last
of my husband's estate?

190
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,240
No, it's the only way
into the city, all right?

191
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,342
- I can't ask Mary.
- Excuse me, Miss Anna?

192
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,378
I think this is for you.

193
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,229
Anna, what is this?

194
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,165
<i>What is this?</i>

195
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,967
Anna, I don't understand.
What is this?

196
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,136
I told you, Abigail promised to
keep an eye out in New York.

197
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,938
No, no, I mean
I don't understand

198
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,973
how is Simcoe still alive?

199
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,143
- You told me that he was...
- Dead.

200
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,715
Caleb Brewster.

201
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,416
I am gonna kill him.
That lying...

202
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,019
Caleb didn't lie to you, I did.

203
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,992
He and Ben took Simcoe captive,

204
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:12,263
but Simcoe got freed somehow.

205
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,736
And so you lied to me

206
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,339
so that I would stay the
course for the cause.

207
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,441
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,849
Come tomorrow, we'll both be.

209
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,171
<i>( Seagulls squawking )</i>

210
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,290
Captain Simcoe!

211
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,325
Welcome back
to Setauket, Captain.

212
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,294
We're glad to have you.

213
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,864
Major Hewlett apologizes that he
couldn't be here in person to greet you.

214
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,234
But he asks that you proceed to
Whitehall and give your report.

215
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,944
Conspiracy?

216
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,946
<i>Simcoe:
I'm afraid so.</i>

217
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,817
Whilst enduring torture at the
hands of my rebel captors,

218
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,987
I managed to wheedle out the fact that
they hailed from Setauket itself.

219
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,089
<i>- Setauket?
- By your leave,</i>

220
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,826
I'd like to conduct an inquiry

221
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,328
beginning with the family names

222
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,398
of Tallmadge and Brewster.

223
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,135
Yes, very well.

224
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,471
But tread lightly.

225
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,340
Lightly?

226
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,010
The tactics which we employed
on our first days here

227
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,513
are no longer to be tolerated.

228
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,450
We must show these people that
we are better than the rebels.

229
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,988
We must win the battle
for their hearts and minds.

230
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,627
<i>I intend to.</i>

231
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,363
Believe me.

232
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,655
Mm.

233
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,557
Mrs. Woodhull.

234
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,926
Mr. Baker.

235
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,427
Is... is my
husband here?

236
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,398
Uh, no.
I haven't... he's not.

237
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,440
Whose silver is this?

238
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,044
Uh, I believe...

239
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,413
I believe it was a gift
for the household.

240
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,549
A gift? From whom?

241
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,056
Mrs. Strong.

242
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,033
She was here?

243
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,503
You saw her here?

244
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,040
With Mr. Woodhull?

245
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,544
I... at the Epiphany.

246
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,080
I came in one night.

247
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,116
They were here.

248
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,732
<i>I'm sorry, I...</i>

249
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,210
<i>( door closes )</i>

250
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,546
( clatters )

251
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,982
Stupid man.
Stupid.

252
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,249
Come here.

253
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,320
What did you say
to distress Mrs. Woodhull?

254
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,458
Please tell me, Ensign Baker.

255
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,095
<i>( Pub patrons chattering )</i>

256
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,335
- ( gasps )
- Don't scream, it's just me. It's Abe.

257
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,637
( Panting )

258
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,042
( quietly ) I thought
you were Simcoe.

259
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,410
( Quietly ) Has he come by yet?

260
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,146
- No.
- Well, he will.

261
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,548
Tomorrow...
tomorrow he will.

262
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,617
- Soldiers at supper said they saw him.
- Yeah?

263
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,552
He had to report
to Hewlett first.

264
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:06,090
Abe, if Simcoe at all
puts together

265
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,360
a suspicion about
what led to the ambush,

266
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,230
maybe you should flee now while
you still have a chance.

267
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,365
Flee?

268
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,234
Leave Long Island?
And do what? Go where?

269
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,736
- I don't know.
- What about my family?

270
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,073
What about you?

271
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,374
I...

272
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,510
- What about Mr. Culper?
- Who?

273
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,678
<i>- ( Thuds ) More ale, please!
- I have to go.</i>

274
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,081
Anna.

275
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,250
Anna, wait, wait.
Listen.

276
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,353
I say we finish the job
Caleb promised he'd do.

277
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:39,123
A simple note could
lure him out at night.

278
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,060
And then a robbery on the road.

279
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,729
I have seen how an explosive
can be used to set a trap.

280
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,697
Maybe if we...
if we both work

281
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,267
together, we can...
we can do this.

282
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,204
Abraham, you've never
killed anyone.

283
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,405
What else...

284
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,507
And you're not about
to start now.

285
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,479
Go.

286
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,716
<i>( Anna ascends stairs )</i>

287
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,795
Father?

288
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,299
Are you too busy
for a kiss good night?

289
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,767
No, no, no.

290
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,238
You're rescuing me from the
drudgery of my ledgers.

291
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,873
Hmm.

292
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,509
Good night, my little soldier.

293
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,778
( Kisses )

294
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,848
I do like it when
you call me Father.

295
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,484
I think of you that way.

296
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,694
Anything I can do to improve
your comfort while you're here?

297
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,270
Can you convince the major to
grant Selah Strong a pardon?

298
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,473
<i>To release him from prison?</i>

299
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,242
I can no longer
be blind to the fact

300
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,911
of Abraham's feelings
for Anna Strong.

301
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,914
Was it true that they
were engaged to be wed?

302
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,450
- Who told you that?
- Is it true?

303
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,620
<i>Were they engaged before
Abraham was obliged...</i>

304
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,222
Abraham was not obliged.

305
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,158
He loves you.

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,761
Anna Strong was
a childish infatuation.

307
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,264
You are his wife.

308
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,338
All wives want to be
with their husbands.

309
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:41,312
Perhaps if Anna can be reunited
with hers, then I can be with mine.

310
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,249
I know that there are legal
and business concerns,

311
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,287
but please... please just
think on it, Father.

312
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,457
That's all I ask.

313
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,756
<i>Simcoe:
Evening, Woodhull!</i>

314
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,239
Came by your home today
to offer you an apology.

315
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,777
Now it seems
I must retract it with vigor.

316
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,385
- Captain Simcoe.
- Hmm?

317
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,520
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

318
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,521
Well...

319
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,923
( grunts )

320
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,625
Far from it, actually.

321
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:04,328
Time for redemption,
Mr. Woodhull.

322
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,464
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,932
No, wait, wait.

324
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,533
Okay.

325
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,935
If you have
a grievance with me,

326
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,670
I suggest that we
settle this lawfully

327
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,405
with Major Hewlett, all right?

328
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,773
We'll settle it now.

329
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,043
( Yells, gasping )

330
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,614
( laughing )

331
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,484
You prefer to strike
at the wound, don't you?

332
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,554
That explains why you forced
yourself on her at Christmas.

333
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,823
- What?
- When her spirits were low.

334
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,826
Ow!

335
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,462
( Choking )

336
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,466
( grunting )

337
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,872
Mr. Woodhull!
Mr. Woodhull!

338
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,640
Mr. Woodhull.

339
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,610
Apologies, Captain.
Direct order from the major.

340
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,346
Your father's looking for you.

341
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,847
It's an emergency.

342
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,450
I have to bring Mr. Woodhull
to the magistrate away...

343
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,585
er, straightaway.

344
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,391
Emergency?

345
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,727
Isn't that what you'd call it?

346
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,029
He attacked me first.

347
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,465
You all saw that.

348
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,833
Yes?

349
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,836
Saw what, sir?

350
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,012
<i>Caleb: There's definitely something
going on between those two.</i>

351
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,748
I just don't know what.

352
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,519
You know, when I suggested
that he take Anna to New York

353
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,688
to get past the checkpoint,

354
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,490
he got very upset.

355
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,893
Anyway, I suppose
none of this is our concern.

356
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,895
They're my only two agents
on Long Island.

357
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,498
If there's trouble between
them, I want to know about it.

358
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,034
Well, how's about you jump
on a whaleboat with me, Major?

359
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,403
Get your arse
out of this woodpile?

360
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,038
( Sighs ) I'd like to.

361
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,541
Washington needs me here.
Compiling.

362
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,377
That and there's
Sackett's homework...

363
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,078
tradecraft, as he calls it.

364
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,114
I feel like I'm back
in school again.

365
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,417
Yeah? See, this is
exactly the reason why

366
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,452
I've been careful
to avoid success.

367
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,653
( Chuckles )

368
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,156
- Sir?
- "Sir," he says.

369
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,525
I have an urgent report
from the provost marshal.

370
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,428
He thought perhaps you'd like to see
the latest prisoner exchange proposal.

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,797
Thank you, Corporal.

372
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,806
- What is it?
- Samuel.

373
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,542
It's Samuel.
He's alive.

374
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,877
He's being released.

375
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,712
<i>( Caleb laughs )</i>

376
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,481
Sammy boy!
Huh? Huh?

377
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,016
When do we go get him?

378
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,818
I...
( sighs )

379
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,720
oh, I have to report
to Washington tomorrow.

380
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,655
Oh, come on. He'll
release you for this.

381
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,524
No, he won't.

382
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,426
He'd consider it
special treatment.

383
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,428
There are other men's
brothers on that list.

384
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,563
All right.
Well, I'll pick him up.

385
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,965
Yeah, I'll go and get Samuel

386
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,101
and then I'll bring him
back straight here.

387
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,836
Actually, I'll get him
drunk first.

388
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,772
No, I'll get him drunk
and then I'll get him a screw.

389
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,940
Wait, Caleb.

390
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,842
Yeah?

391
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,511
Thank you.

392
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:10,848
Hey, what are
brothers for, right?

393
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,086
( Sighs )

394
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,728
Captain Simcoe.

395
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,834
Step forward.

396
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,975
Mr. Woodhull,
what are you doing here?

397
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,877
The law requires it.

398
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,681
<i>Hewlett: I had hoped my words
to you had been clear...</i>

399
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,050
respect one's host.

400
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,154
<i>Simcoe: I agree.</i>

401
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,122
Then I learned
from Ensign Baker

402
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,559
that Mr. Woodhull had assaulted
the virtue of a lady...

403
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,761
Mrs. Anna Strong.

404
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,935
I assume you
divulged that, too.

405
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,140
- It was...
- Yes?

406
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,978
What I saw between
Mr. Woodhull and Mrs. Strong

407
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,847
was entirely inappropriate,

408
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,250
and I told him
as much at the time.

409
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,719
But he did not rape her.

410
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:29,193
So far as I could tell,
the dalliance was consensual.

411
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,599
He must've initiated it, then.

412
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,800
It was not against her wishes.

413
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:40,671
- This is shameful.
- Yes.

414
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:46,210
Major, abuse of any kind

415
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,279
<i>is abhorrent to me,</i>

416
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,015
<i>and when I heard
of a lady in distress,</i>

417
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,583
I leapt to her defense.

418
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,786
<i>It now appears
I may have been rash.</i>

419
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,087
Appears?

420
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,657
And if that is the case,

421
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,327
I apologize sincerely
to Mr. Woodhull.

422
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,768
It appears that neither
is in the right or the wrong.

423
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,572
This has all been a terrible
misunderstanding, Richard.

424
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,207
<i>I'm sure we can agree</i>

425
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,578
to make an exception
in this case

426
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,148
<i>as long as Abraham
accepts the apology.</i>

427
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,716
Now, shake on it.

428
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,380
Woodhull!

429
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,148
Wait!

430
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,155
Are you satisfied?

431
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,828
Neither am I...

432
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,998
which is why I propose
we settle this decisively.

433
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,899
What's between us
cannot be settled.

434
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,102
Of course, it can.

435
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,404
With a duel.

436
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,174
- A duel?
- Between gentlemen.

437
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,677
Two pistols.
Somewhere private.

438
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,012
Choose Baker as your second

439
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,913
and I'll select the most
discreet man I know.

440
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,783
- Yeah, I know what a duel is.
- Of course you do.

441
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,252
Or shall you
run and tell Father?

442
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,292
Or shall you
pretend to manhood?

443
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,429
( Whispers )
You know I'll never stop.

444
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,233
I accept.

445
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,074
Apology accepted.

446
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:08,185
<i>( Singing drunkenly )</i>

447
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,978
Ale, please.

448
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,150
Captain Simcoe.

449
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,122
Let me fetch it.

450
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,423
( Singing continues )

451
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,831
( breathing heavily )

452
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,869
<i>- Simcoe: I apologize, Mrs. Strong, for my tardiness.
- ( gasps )</i>

453
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:02,306
I suppose it's too late
to pick up my laundry?

454
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,746
You don't remember?

455
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,117
I feared we would
never see you again.

456
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,186
I always knew I'd see you.

457
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:20,190
<i>In fact, I could never have
endured such ill treatment</i>

458
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,359
<i>had I not clung onto
the hope of one day</i>

459
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:26,530
resuming our close
friendship we embarked upon.

460
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,503
I'm so relieved...

461
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,272
to hear of your survival.

462
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,180
And...

463
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,050
now that you've returned...

464
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,456
there's something

465
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,992
I've been meaning
to discuss with you.

466
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,927
Oh?

467
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,132
My husband's imprisonment

468
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,535
has cost me

469
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,137
Strong Manor,

470
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:12,109
this tavern,
and my status in the town.

471
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,077
And yet...

472
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:20,117
there's something
I cling to, as you did.

473
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,355
My honor.

474
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,597
And while I remain
a married woman,

475
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,501
I ask your help
safeguarding it.

476
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,373
Absolutely.

477
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:51,381
Tomorrow at dawn
at the millpond,

478
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,952
I intend to avenge it.

479
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,189
You no longer need to worry

480
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,426
about unwelcome advances
from inebriated farmers.

481
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,628
I'll see to that.

482
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,976
Abe!

483
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,015
Luke!

484
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,617
Jeremiah!

485
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,085
Mrs. Anna.

486
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,420
Luke, I can't find Abraham.
Where is he?

487
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,290
- I thought him home.
- No, no one's home.

488
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,225
No one's answering the door
and his horse is gone.

489
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,593
Did he say he
was going anywhere?

490
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,161
No.

491
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,498
He was shooting.

492
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,570
On that old scarecrow
over there.

493
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,140
Taking shots with some old
rusty pistol he had.

494
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,510
Don't think he hit it, though.

495
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,345
Maybe that's why he mad.

496
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,547
No.

497
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,390
<i>( Footsteps descending stairs )</i>

498
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,026
Judge Woodhull, I'm sorry
to barge in at this hour,

499
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,494
but I desperately
need your help.

500
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,063
- It's taken care of.
- It is?

501
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,665
After conferring
with Major Hewlett,

502
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,466
who is also sympathetic
to your plight,

503
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,202
we have agreed to pardon
your husband on one condition.

504
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,405
That he signs an agreement
not to challenge

505
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,608
the attainder
following his release.

506
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,378
Yes, yes, and you
will make sure he signs it.

507
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,080
No, no, that's not
why I'm here.

508
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,015
You need to get dressed.
I'll explain on the way.

509
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,351
You'll explain it right now.

510
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:37,487
Your son has made
a terrible mistake

511
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,191
and unless you hurry, he's going
to pay for it with his life.

512
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,677
Should you lose
the coin toss, remember,

513
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,713
it is not considered
cowardly to turn aside

514
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,182
to present your adversary
with a smaller target.

515
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,085
That is perhaps the best way
to think of the captain...

516
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,253
as merely a target.

517
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,609
I know you must be concerned
about killing a man

518
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,378
<i>for the first time today.</i>

519
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,148
Let me reassure you.
It's very unlikely to happen.

520
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,386
Well, there's
a first for everything.

521
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,287
Indeed.

522
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:50,594
Baker: Agree to these conditions
on your personal honor,

523
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,629
before your respective seconds,

524
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,298
before one another,
and before God.

525
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Get on with it, man.

526
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,143
The obverse side
represents Mr. Woodhull.

527
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,350
The reverse his challenger,
Captain Simcoe.

528
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,201
Soldier:
Congratulations.

529
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:35,338
Mr. Woodhull, you will have the
opportunity to draw first blood.

530
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,612
She's mine.

531
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,783
<i>Baker:
Commence.</i>

532
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:24,654
One, two, three, four, five.

533
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,490
<i>Turn!</i>

534
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,703
<i>Ready?</i>

535
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,510
<i>Fire, Mr. Woodhull.</i>

536
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,816
( clicks )

537
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,816
My turn.

538
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,965
I want you to know, Woodhull,

539
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,601
that whilst I've killed
many such as you...

540
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:47,737
( clicks )

541
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,440
...I shall treasure
this particular encounter.

542
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,879
Of course, I may

543
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,481
just decide

544
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,350
to cripple you.

545
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,361
<i>Richard:
Abraham!</i>

546
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,797
What do you think you're doing?

547
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,865
This doesn't concern you!

548
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,370
Do it.

549
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,573
Sir, I can't let you interfere.

550
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,242
Mr. Woodhull
has had his shot.

551
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,345
- This is an affair of honor.
- Whose honor? Mine?

552
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,547
Because I assure you,
it is not my honor

553
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,649
that has been offended here.

554
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,585
It seems far more likely
that it is your own honor...

555
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,256
yours and yours, sirs,
that is at stake here.

556
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,024
I am prepared
to receive your fire.

557
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,894
Please, John.

558
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,899
As I told you, I'm a married
woman before the law.

559
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,804
What happened at Christmas
was a mistake...

560
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,974
for which
we were both at fault.

561
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,278
<i>I swear, sir. There is
nothing between us.</i>

562
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,346
It is over.

563
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,049
<i>We have both
returned to our vows</i>

564
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:10,287
until fate
determines otherwise.

565
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,323
Fate?

566
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,760
No one knows
what the future may bring.

567
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,361
But if you go through
with this now,

568
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:21,531
I don't know what
our fate here can be.

569
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,478
<i>( Anna breathing heavily )</i>

570
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,714
I have satisfaction.

571
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,588
<i>Abe:
Reload, please.</i>

572
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,331
Reload!

573
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,073
Mr. Woodhull, you can stop
now with your honor intact.

574
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,441
Just load the pistol.

575
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,042
- Mr. Woodhull...
- Load the pistol.

576
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,878
This is illegal!

577
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,747
Hold him!
Hold him!

578
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,649
Abraham, come to your senses!

579
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,819
This is my battle.

580
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,420
I don't need your protection.

581
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,390
Protection?
I will show you no mercy!

582
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:24,394
<i>If by some miracle you succeed in
wounding or killing this officer,</i>

583
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,496
<i>I will personally prosecute you</i>

584
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,032
<i>to the full extent
of His Majesty's law!</i>

585
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,768
( cocks gun )

586
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,770
Abraham, don't throw
your life away.

587
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,710
If not for me,
then for your wife,

588
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,379
your son!

589
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,649
This is about more than you!

590
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,469
Hey, ain't Rangers
supposed to range?

591
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,004
On the back of a horse, say?

592
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:43,706
Best if nobody hears us coming.

593
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:47,544
Especially our good friend,
Benjamin Tallmadge.

594
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,017
( Whistling )

595
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,834
- Ready?
- Yeah.

596
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,673
We're off to New York
to free Selah.

597
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,842
It seems possible that you
could manage a smile.

598
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,544
After I convince him
to sign away his property.

599
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,913
Is that why you're upset?

600
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,117
You should've killed Simcoe
when you had the chance.

601
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,021
You were the one that was
trying to talk me out of it.

602
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,925
That was to save you. Then
Simcoe gave you an opening.

603
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,037
You heard my father.
He would've prosecuted me.

604
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,508
( Scoffs ) You can't tell
a bluff when you hear it?

605
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,179
Your father would've done
everything he could to protect you.

606
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,816
Simcoe made the challenge, so the
blame would've fallen on him.

607
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,018
( Sighs )

608
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,189
This is business we're about.

609
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,191
So let's get about it.

610
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,700
She's off
to retrieve her husband

611
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,103
and he's off to sell
the rest of their crop.

612
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:23,907
Trust me, there's no love
lost between those two.

613
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,319
