1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,959
France, 1 561 .

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,839
The most powerful country in Europe
is torn apart by a religious war.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,839
On the one side: the Catholics,
who control the court in Paris.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,439
On the other side: the Protestants,
known as the Huguenots.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,119
In the beginning,
they were a smaII minority.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,599
Soon they were joined

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,239
by anyone who was discontented
with the government in Paris.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,319
Catherine de' Medici rules there.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,239
She is trying to hoId on to power
for her three sons.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
But in Southern France,
in the smaII Kingdom of Navarre,

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,239
an adversary is growing.
One she knows nothing about.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,119
Henry of Navarre

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,719
Spread your legs
or we can't see a thing!

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,279
I want to have a go!

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,399
- Get lost, you aren't one of us.
- I am the Prince.

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,919
Exactly!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,719
A prince can do the same as
anyone else and even more.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,479
We'll see.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,039
- Hit him.
- Knock him down!

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,439
You're stronger than the Prince.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,759
I can have you put on a spit
and roasted like a pig.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,519
All I need to do is order it.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,559
I guess I went a bit too far there.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,919
But I had to gain their respect.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,239
EvidentIy, it worked.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,199
I can say I had an easy chiIdhood
in our small region, Navarre,

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,279
at the foot of the Pyrenees.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
At Ieast untiI that fatefuI day
in September, 1 563.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,279
When unfortunateIy,
everything changed.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,159
That was the devil.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,039
- Henry, where are you, my Prince?
- Here.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,359
I am over here, Beauvois.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,959
You must return to the castle.
We have an important visitor.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,319
What are you doing
with these peasants?

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,079
Now you need a bath!

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,119
- Peasant girls have pretty legs.
- You take after your father.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,919
- He was a hero!
- A hero with the ladies.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
I will be too!

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
God forbid!
That's nothing to be proud of.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,759
- And why not?
- You are too young for that.

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,679
I'm freezing, Beauvois.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,079
Mother!

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,679
What a brave countenance.

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,039
He is the one.

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,999
He is still but a child.

46
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,519
Yet he has more power
than any other living person.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,999
Protect your son.

48
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,719
He has the mark of a king.

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,319
Of the King of France.

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,879
I thank you, Master Nostradamus.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,279
Where is Paris?

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,279
Fine, I'll show you.

53
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,759
This is Paris.

54
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,399
And we are here.

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,759
This little territory is Navarre.

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,519
Your kingdom.

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,359
- And all of this is France?
- Yes, that's France.

58
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,639
- They're bringing in the harvest.
- You're not a peasant, Prince.

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,039
You are to be the King of France
if your mother has her way.

60
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,399
I don't want to go to Paris.

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,359
I want to stay here, with you.

62
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,639
My boy. You shall have no choice.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,439
Run along.

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,079
Take this sword, my Prince.

65
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,559
It was your father's.

66
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,359
Please bless him, Admiral.

67
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,439
From then on Admiral Coligny,
the great Ieader of the Huguenots,

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,639
was to be a father to me.

69
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,559
You are our hope
for the throne of France.

70
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,119
You shall champion
the just cause and lead us to triumph.

71
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,239
l was taught that
the Catholics were our worst enemies.

72
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,399
No one couId teII me why.
Not even my teacher, Beauvois.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,959
Lances ready!

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,199
I'm scared!

75
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,919
We are all scared, my Prince.

76
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,159
Mother!

77
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,119
Go away, get lost!

78
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,759
Go to hell!

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
You are very brave, my Prince.

80
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,479
What are you doing?

81
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,879
I'm washing my pants.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,519
Your first battle?

83
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,399
I filled my pants
in my first battle too.

84
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,759
No one is born a hero.
Here, take these.

85
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,879
Their owner won't need them.

86
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,399
He did more than sprain his neck.

87
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,359
Agrippa, I've been looking for you.

88
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,199
We wanted to see the Admiral.

89
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,559
Who is that?

90
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,719
Someone with battle-browned britches.

91
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,279
The Prince of Navarre.

92
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,839
I am delighted to meet you, Prince.

93
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,599
- Who are you?
- I am the Prince of Navarre.

94
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,919
Forgive me, Prince. I didn't know.

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,319
And who are you?

96
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,079
Two poor poets whose verses
serve no one in such times.

97
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,879
He is Agrippa d'Aubigné
and I'm Guillaume du Bartas.

98
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,759
You, a poet? That's news to me!

99
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,199
And you, a clothes thief.
That's nothing new.

100
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,639
He's right!

101
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,759
Ideal company for a prince.

102
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,319
I want to go home, Beauvois.

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,839
This tent is your home, my Prince.

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
For many years thereafter,
this mean tent wouId be my home.

105
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,839
War and death wouId be my escorts.

106
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,279
And hatred for everything CathoIic.

107
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,759
This is the Catholics' doing.

108
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,919
I want to eat you up.

109
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,599
My Prince, Prince Henry!

110
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,799
Your mother, Queen Jeanne, is coming.

111
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,279
She's here.

112
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
It reeks of fish in your tent.

113
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,439
And garlic. That's me.

114
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,079
Come to the Admiral's tent.

115
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,039
Word from Paris.

116
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,999
They made an offer.

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,279
Because they fear us.

118
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,279
As they should.

119
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,319
Catherine wants peace
with the Huguenots.

120
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,039
The slaughter can end.

121
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,559
We agree.

122
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,439
That's new.

123
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,599
But as a sign of reconciliation,
she expects a sacrifice.

124
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,719
The Queen of France

125
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,319
offers you her daughter Margot
in marriage.

126
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
- Never was the throne so close!
- Nor peace.

127
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
That's what you always wanted.

128
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,839
I don't even know this Margot.

129
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,679
They say her beauty is beyond compare.

130
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,359
Paris, Louvre Palace.

131
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,879
Margot is a sow!

132
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,159
One does not speak so of one's sister.

133
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,599
- You are the King!
- In the eyes of the world maybe.

134
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,399
In truth...

135
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,519
Leave us.

136
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,119
Mind your words before my maids!

137
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,079
Is it not true?

138
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,679
- You hold the power.
- I speak of Margot.

139
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,559
That bitch slept with Guise!

140
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,399
Lord Almighty!

141
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,599
Does she have to spread
her legs for everyone!

142
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,039
- I hate Guise!
- Me too.

143
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,999
On that we agree.

144
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,679
If there's a threat to you, it's Guise!

145
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,879
He pretends to be
even more Catholic than us.

146
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,159
The people love him.

147
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,839
I'll have him castrated, mother.

148
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,439
- I am the King.
- You are nothing.

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,079
Nothing at all, without me.

150
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,719
Let me take care of it.

151
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,159
What is my brother, the King,
saying about me?

152
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,239
- The truth.
- Why did you sleep with Guise?

153
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,319
You know he covets the throne!

154
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,959
How dare you?

155
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,159
With Guise!

156
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,279
You...

157
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,799
How dare you?

158
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,319
- You whore!
- Put her over your knee.

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,919
You'll pay for that!

160
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,599
You'll pay.

161
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,239
That's enough.

162
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,559
We shall marry you off.

163
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,199
But certainly not to Guise!

164
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,799
To Henry of Navarre.

165
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,359
You can't be serious?

166
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,639
We've never been more serious.

167
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,999
You've lost your minds.

168
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,319
I want peace in my country.

169
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,399
- This marriage is the price.
- Never!

170
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,039
Why does it matter
which cock pecks you?

171
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,559
He smells of garlic, mother,
and behaves like a peasant.

172
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,119
He is a Huguenot, mother!

173
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,319
Your marriage is a symbol.

174
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,319
- The reconciliation of our faiths.
- Over my dead body!

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,639
My son, you made a wise decision.

176
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,679
No farewell kiss?

177
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,439
We shall negotiate skilfully.

178
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,119
Catherine shall not have it all her way.

179
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,479
Remember our maxim:
Conquer or die.

180
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,319
Enough have died.

181
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,519
Dear Catherine,
take care of our mother.

182
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,239
Henry, I'm scared.

183
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,839
The Admiral will protect you.

184
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,359
Go.

185
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,439
What do you think, Beauvois?

186
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,919
There are worse sacrifices than
sharing a bed with a beautiful woman.

187
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,119
You know I love you like a son.

188
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,439
Nothing will make you happier than
the joy of those you bring peace to.

189
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,079
For violence is strong

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,039
but kindness is stronger.

191
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,439
I hope you had a good journey.

192
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,199
Paris is far away.

193
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,799
And I am all the more grateful
that you came.

194
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,039
Don't be too hasty.

195
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,359
Dear friend,
we will come to an agreement.

196
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,919
What is religion in the end?

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,319
Religion is the substance of my life!

198
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,839
Who knows
how long God shall grant it to us?

199
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,759
It's been a long time
since I've felt this good.

200
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,839
Cheers!

201
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,919
Come here, Fleurette!

202
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,759
My Prince, my Prince.

203
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,119
My Prince!

204
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,679
A messenger has arrived from Paris,
sent by your mother.

205
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,039
You are expected!

206
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,399
I shall return, my beauty,
and finish our dance.

207
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,039
The Huguenots are coming!
Retreat to your houses!

208
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,559
The Huguenots!

209
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,719
The Huguenots are coming!

210
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,879
Make haste, hide!

211
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,879
Come, get inside!

212
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,159
I imagined Paris would be livelier.

213
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,879
So did I.

214
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,719
At arms!

215
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,279
Paris seems deserted, Admiral.

216
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,199
- Where are the people?
- They are afraid of your vengeance.

217
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,999
Vengeance for what?

218
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,999
I greet the King of Navarre.

219
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,039
I am not yet King.

220
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,479
Yes, my King, you are.

221
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,839
There has been a great tragedy.

222
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,759
Your mother is no longer alive.

223
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,599
Is this a vicious game you play?

224
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,799
No, my King.

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,119
I refused to give her a farewell kiss.

226
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,359
How did she die?

227
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,959
- She was poisoned.
- That is not true!

228
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,199
An evil rumour! Spread by people who wish
to stop your marriage.

229
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,719
Tell me the truth.

230
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,799
Come to my home.
There I shall tell you.

231
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,119
Henry, the Admiral is lying.
We are surrounded by liars.

232
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,039
Our mother was right, this is hell.
This is hell!

233
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,479
I will be on my guard. I promise!

234
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,119
- Stay calm.
- Yes.

235
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,359
Stay calm.

236
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,119
Your mother was very ill.
She could hardly breathe.

237
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,079
Then her lungs failed her.
Any other charge is nonsense.

238
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,799
And my marriage?

239
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,399
Your marriage was her wish
to the very end.

240
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,559
- She asked me to tell you that.
- What does the King say?

241
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,479
Charles and I are now friends.

242
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,159
- Is he fond of us Huguenots now?
- Not yet.

243
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,639
But I support him against his mother.

244
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,199
She is our only threat.

245
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,919
Give me a kiss, my son.

246
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,599
Kiss me.

247
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,439
You have my sympathy.

248
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,199
From now on,
allow me to be your mother.

249
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,039
If you so wish.

250
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,719
The virtuous Jeanne.

251
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,719
Even our best doctors
were unable to help her.

252
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,199
Her wicked lungs failed her.

253
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,439
So it appears.

254
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,239
Let us think about your future.

255
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,759
This marriage is as vital to me
as it was to your mother.

256
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,519
I want to have peace in my country.

257
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,319
You mean in your son's country.

258
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,559
He is the King, that is true.
Have you seen him yet?

259
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,599
My first visit
is devoted to you, Madame.

260
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,599
My son...

261
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,999
...is peculiar at times.

262
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,359
He speaks foolishly of murder.

263
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,199
Please don't listen to him.

264
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,199
But now, you should see
my beautiful daughter.

265
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,639
I am very curious, indeed.

266
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,359
You are a goddess.

267
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,119
Did you hear, Charlotte?

268
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,119
He is flattering me.

269
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,439
Give me your hand.

270
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,759
Allow me to kiss it.

271
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,919
Take the birds back, Charlotte.

272
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,119
Stand up then.
My little King of Navarre.

273
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,239
I wish to gaze upon your eyes.

274
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,679
I know exactly
what you wish to gaze upon.

275
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,159
- I shall not marry you.
- That is your right.

276
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,599
Really?

277
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,279
I would never force a woman
to act against her wishes.

278
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,519
You haven't the power to do so.

279
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,679
But I can wish for it.

280
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,919
That depends.

281
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,519
I wish to take you in my arms,

282
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,839
to kiss and caress your exquisite neck

283
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,399
and to explore
your ear with my tongue.

284
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,119
- I thought you were a peasant boy.
- Not in love.

285
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,599
I don't want to love you.

286
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,919
- I'll love you all the more.
- You're not allowed to.

287
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,719
Who shall forbid me?

288
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,319
Me.

289
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,879
What have we done?

290
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,919
Already been under my sister's robes?

291
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,159
Everyone knows what's underneath.

292
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,759
D'Anjou, my brother, was the first.

293
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,319
We are a magnificent family.

294
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,639
You couldn't have done better.
Welcome, brother-in-law.

295
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,479
As you can see, I am healthy.

296
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,279
You'll have to wait
awhile for my death.

297
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,959
But I do not wish your death.

298
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,679
Then you are alone in that.

299
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,479
Everyone else wishes for my death.
Even my mother, my brothers.

300
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,559
What do you think of Paris?

301
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,879
It is no place for us.

302
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,519
Be on your guard.

303
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,599
I will, Beauvois.

304
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,079
I will.

305
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,479
I shall not wed that peasant.

306
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,119
You will do as you are told!

307
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,479
Their church looks like a fairground.

308
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,079
Not like the house of God.

309
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,399
You should not enter it. Not even once.

310
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,159
Then we'll get married in front of it.

311
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,319
Henry of Bourbon...

312
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,279
In front of the church!

313
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,519
In this heat!

314
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,079
I'll never forgive you.

315
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,639
...to be your lawfully wedded wife?

316
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,639
I do.

317
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,119
Marguerite de VaIois,
Princess of France,

318
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,959
do you take Henry of Bourbon
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

319
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,839
Then, before God and man,
I now declare you

320
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,319
husband and wife. Amen.

321
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,079
Don't fret, we'll stay down here.

322
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,719
And stand guard.

323
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,279
Close the door.

324
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,639
Are you invisible, my beauty?

325
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,599
Not for a Iover's eyes.

326
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,959
My love could not be greater.

327
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,439
Welcome, brother-in-law.

328
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,039
To your health.

329
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,479
You look as if
she had her way with you.

330
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,079
Let me introduce my brothers.

331
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,239
That is d'Anjou.

332
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,079
He lusts after men.

333
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,679
And the throne.

334
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,439
He is mother's favourite.

335
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,439
Look out for him.

336
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,519
This one's always sick.

337
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,439
The little monster, d'Alençon.

338
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,039
He too aspires to my throne.

339
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,679
Do I care?

340
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,679
I don't give a damn!

341
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,039
- The words of a king.
- Shut up. You bastard!

342
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,519
Calm down, my King.

343
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,439
I will crush him into little bits!

344
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,399
My father...

345
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,199
Stand by me against my enemies.

346
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,799
You must stand by me
against my enemies!

347
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,199
Yes.

348
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,639
Sire.

349
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,279
- You ought to go to bed.
- No.

350
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,519
Not to bed!

351
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,279
Death lurks.

352
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,359
Navarre.

353
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,239
My dear Henry.

354
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,599
Whatever may happen,

355
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,439
I am not at fault.

356
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,119
I am just afraid.

357
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,319
Of all people on this earth,
I live with so much fear.

358
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,279
Guise!

359
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,559
Come. Lend a hand, Navarre.

360
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,839
We must flank the throne.

361
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,159
I know what you mean by that.
Hands off, you bastard!

362
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,319
You've both been
under Margot's robes.

363
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,799
But she left you.

364
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,319
You spawn of the devil!

365
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,639
You, however...

366
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,719
She loves you.

367
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,679
Just as I do.

368
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,479
What a celebration?

369
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,319
- Music!
- There's the devil.

370
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,399
I must speak with you, Majesty.

371
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,439
Henry, Duke of Guise.
And my brother, Mayenne.

372
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,639
Who invited you?

373
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,439
The King did not, I'm afraid.

374
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,439
He must have forgotten.

375
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,639
Wipe your mouth.

376
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,119
The people are full of hatred.

377
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,359
They want blood!

378
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,319
- My blood?
- You fool!

379
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,439
Not yours. You are the King.

380
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,239
They hate the Huguenots,
and want the Admiral's blood.

381
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,599
No, do not touch him!

382
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,439
Never!

383
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,319
Is that your last word?

384
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,759
My very last.

385
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,879
Then I'll have to decide
what I consider correct.

386
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,279
Go.

387
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,119
There is only one way
to save the throne.

388
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,599
Guise must bloody his own hands.

389
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,199
He has long wanted
revenge on Coligny. Let him have it.

390
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,599
The Huguenots will want revenge
and our problem will solve itself.

391
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,439
Your shrewdness, dear mother,
is deadly.

392
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,439
Not for you.

393
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,079
- Does the King know?
- He is beside himself.

394
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,439
Who is behind it?

395
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,799
- Allegedly Guise.
- He lives!

396
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,359
- God be praised, he is alive.
- We must go see him. Quickly!

397
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,199
This is what comes
of their reconciliation.

398
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,039
How do you feel?

399
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,519
Betrayal, my King,
causes me more pain than their bullet.

400
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,479
You're sure it was Guise?

401
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,839
A long story.

402
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,279
He believes...

403
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,759
He believes I am to blame
for his father's death.

404
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,959
Are you?

405
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,359
No.

406
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,239
My father,

407
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,039
if you have something to confess,

408
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,479
then tell me.

409
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,599
Tell me.

410
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,919
It was his father
who wanted to kill me.

411
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,559
I merely pre-empted him.

412
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,759
Guise wants the throne

413
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,519
and the people are on his side.

414
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,879
Go.

415
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,679
Come.

416
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,999
Huguenots live here.

417
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,799
Stop!

418
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,799
- Are you Catholics or Huguenots?
- We're Catholics.

419
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,959
Good. Keep going!

420
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,639
Get up.
Your throne and life are at stake!

421
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,479
The Admiral, is he dead?

422
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,879
- I will avenge him!
- He lives. And you will do nothing.

423
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,039
Guise merely fulfilled my wish.

424
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,639
- You ordered it?
- Desired. I have no power to order.

425
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,079
What luck that he still lives.

426
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,319
What bad luck.

427
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,439
Now you must order his death.

428
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,079
Never! Never!

429
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,639
Then he will destroy us. You and me!

430
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,559
The whole city is arming itself.

431
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,879
The people are crying out for action.

432
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,479
The Admiral must die.

433
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,439
- Give the order!
- I cannot! I cannot! Never!

434
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,279
Come.
We must leave to save our lives.

435
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,799
The King is a pathetic coward.

436
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,919
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!

437
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,399
All of them.

438
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,279
Huguenots.

439
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,719
Protestants.

440
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,239
All of them!

441
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,879
Burnt! Quartered!

442
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,079
- The Admiral as well?
- Him too, my father.

443
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,079
Away with him!

444
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,439
Cross the street.

445
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,599
Hurry, they'II get away.

446
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,079
Henry, I've been looking for you!

447
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,119
The people are rebelling!

448
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,119
Against us Huguenots?

449
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,519
Your marriage didn't appease them,
quite the opposite. I think...

450
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,999
What?

451
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,879
We were lured to the city.

452
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,319
That's impossible.

453
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,079
Prince, both sides have suffered
so much injustice and death.

454
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,119
Peace cannot be decreed,
not even by the King.

455
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,799
Look at the people.

456
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,079
They want revenge, not reconciliation.

457
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,039
You said that violence is strong
but benevolence is stronger.

458
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,839
And so it is.

459
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,639
But one needs great strength.
Many do not have that.

460
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,279
- Seek safety. I have friends close by.
- No.

461
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,239
I must return to the Louvre.

462
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,879
To the right!

463
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,079
Now!

464
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,919
- Is it done?
- Yes, Lord! I've taken care of him!

465
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,439
I want to see him.

466
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,719
Throw him down!

467
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,199
It's him.

468
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,959
The Catholics!

469
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,839
A trap!

470
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,799
Defend yourselves!
We must find the King!

471
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,159
Only he can stop them!

472
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,079
Sire, open the door!
Open the door!

473
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,319
Close it, close it!

474
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,919
Bolt the door, quickly!

475
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,319
Navarre!

476
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,439
Sire. What did you order?

477
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,839
Me? Nothing! I did nothing!

478
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,239
I am not responsible.

479
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,679
I gave no orders!

480
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,079
You're massacring my Huguenots.

481
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,559
You are massacring my Huguenots.

482
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,479
We had to be quicker than you!

483
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,359
It's true.

484
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,039
I had no choice.

485
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,039
I had no...

486
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:56,239
I'm bleeding.

487
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,599
As Jesus bled on the Mount of Olives.

488
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,039
This is fear.

489
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,879
I'm dying from all this fear.

490
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,879
Lord, let this cup pass from me...

491
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,479
They're butchering our people, Sire!

492
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,559
And us? We don't lift a finger!

493
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,919
We are saving our lives, that's all.

494
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,879
Why sacrifice ourselves?

495
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,159
For our beliefs, Sire!

496
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,959
You wish to die for that?

497
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,559
- Not me.
- I did not want any of this!

498
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,519
Who did?

499
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,159
She did!

500
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,639
My black-hearted mother!

501
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,399
No. I'm not mad, like they all think.

502
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,559
I'm not mad, Navarre!
They leave me no choice.

503
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,599
Not my mother and not you!

504
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,359
My governess is a Huguenot!

505
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,319
Brother, do not leave me!

506
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,959
I beg you!

507
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,839
Wait.

508
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,079
That's my Beauvois.

509
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,559
- What are you doing with him?
- Throwing him in the Seine

510
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,719
along with the others.

511
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,519
- But he's alive!
- What?

512
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,999
No!

513
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,799
Navarre.

514
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,559
Navarre!

515
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,519
There is someone lying in your bed.

516
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,759
A Huguenot.

517
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,559
A Huguenot!

518
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,079
Sire, spare this man.

519
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,239
I was alone. He entered my room
pursued by monsters.

520
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,279
I had no choice.
Look at him.

521
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,439
I will lie next to him!

522
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,759
I am no better off than him.

523
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,919
Even the birds have stopped singing.

524
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,439
Henry?

525
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,679
Why did you leave me alone?

526
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,439
Our wedding...

527
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,479
What a celebration.

528
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,759
You knew about this?

529
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,839
I knew nothing.

530
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,599
Your mother ordered this massacre.

531
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,319
You are alive, Henry.

532
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,479
Henry.

533
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:46,079
I love you.

534
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,519
Love died tonight, Margot.

535
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,959
- Our love has been wiped out.
- No.

536
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,759
Not our love.

537
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,079
We cannot become enemies.
We must not.

538
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,519
We must not.

539
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,319
Sit with me, Navarre.

540
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,759
You saint of the Pyrenees.

541
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,199
Be on guard. Here comes death.

542
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,999
We survived.

543
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,919
Let us celebrate
the Resurrection and Ascension.

544
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,839
Music!

545
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,039
My lords and ladies!

546
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,359
I present fear! Captured.

547
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,799
You show us how cruelty conceals itself.

548
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,719
And you show us the opposite.

549
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,359
The Admiral was our enemy.

550
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,079
What happened
afterward was not intended.

551
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,119
You blame the dead
to make your life tolerable.

552
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,879
- Do you want to kill me?
- Perhaps.

553
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,199
Then do it!

554
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,839
I need to get out of here!

555
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,839
You can't leave the Louvre.

556
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,839
That was the condition.

557
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,839
- Condition for what?
- That you stay alive.

558
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,799
So you knew after all?

559
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,999
Not everything.

560
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,399
Nobody could have foreseen that!

561
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,479
The entire city is full of these birds.

562
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,039
I miss my friends.

563
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,879
- They are under my supervision.
- Good.

564
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,919
If it keeps them alive.

565
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,039
Do you sleep peacefully, Madame?

566
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,279
My sleep is good and bad,

567
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,439
befitting my age.

568
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,519
All this killing disgusts me.

569
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,639
The mob too.

570
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,639
Do you expect me to believe you?

571
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,839
Why do you think you are still alive?

572
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,559
Because it was my wish.

573
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,039
- Convert to Catholicism.
- You take me for your fool?

574
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,919
You lack the wit to be a fool.

575
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,519
In your presence,
that is hardly surprising.

576
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,559
What is your answer?

577
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,079
It requires no effort on your part.

578
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,479
It will cost me my friends.

579
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,959
- And my beliefs.
- Foolish prattle.

580
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,079
You are not your mother.

581
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,119
We both believe in the same God.

582
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,679
I thought you were Catholic
with heart and soul.

583
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,079
With heart and soul, I am the Queen.

584
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,959
You sacrificed thousands for that?

585
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,879
It had to be so.

586
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,519
For the sake of millions.

587
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,639
For your sake.

588
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,679
What's the difference?

589
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,639
Good.

590
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,759
I agree to become a Catholic.

591
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,359
But on one condition.

592
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,959
My sister and my companions go free.

593
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,959
- And nothing else?
- Nothing else.

594
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,359
Nothing else.

595
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,239
I am a king of sorrow.

596
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,279
Dear governess. Am I not?

597
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,079
Who's there?

598
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,359
Are the bells ringing again?

599
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,919
No.

600
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,319
Sit.

601
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,799
How many survived?

602
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,959
Not many.

603
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,599
Thirty thousand were killed.

604
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,599
- Thirty thousand!
- In your name.

605
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,359
I will also die, Navarre. I can feel it.

606
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,879
Navarre, were you my friend?

607
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,839
I suppose so.

608
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,239
That makes it easier.

609
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,759
You must know, my brother,
your life was also in danger.

610
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,759
I did not allow it.

611
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,159
I've heard so from everyone.

612
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,239
What do you think, governess?

613
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,559
Does this one outweigh the rest?

614
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,519
You will not be able
to bargain with God.

615
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,759
The fear...

616
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,079
Navarre.

617
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,319
If only I'd been less afraid...

618
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,039
I would have been a good king.

619
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,039
Put up the bars.

620
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,599
Long live King Henry III.

621
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,319
Long live the King!

622
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,519
Long live d'Anjou!

623
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,879
Enough.

624
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,679
Me too.

625
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,039
Come kiss my back,
my little Navarran kingbird.

626
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,959
Lust and pain, the poles of my life.

627
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,159
- I win!
- Not if you'd played fairly.

628
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,439
What is fair, Monsieur Mayenne?

629
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
Not the court!

630
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,759
The little kingbird has figured us out.

631
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,199
- You promised me a hunt, Guise.
- My offer stands.

632
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,279
Hunting in the forest?

633
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,719
How do I know I can trust you?

634
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,799
Trust me like I trust you.

635
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,959
There! The stag!

636
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,799
Go! Go! Go!

637
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,679
Navarre is fleeing!

638
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,039
After him! He must not escape!

639
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,079
Sire!

640
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,639
Sire!
Quickly, come here!

641
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,199
- Sire! Come to me!
- They're right behind me!

642
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,039
To the boat! Quickly!

643
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,239
The river! Hurry!

644
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,959
Take cover! Head down!

645
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,599
Did we get him?

646
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,559
- And you?
- Never mind me!

647
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,239
I don't think so. Reload!

648
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,479
Were you waiting long?

649
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,599
For three days, Sire.

650
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,519
Thank you.

651
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,359
It's an honour.

652
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,999
He has escaped?

653
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,879
Yes, alas Madame. On the hunt.

654
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,679
But Henry is my friend.

655
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,559
You have no friends here.

656
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,679
Margot!

657
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,879
- Did you know about this?
- I knew nothing, I swear.

658
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,359
Save your oath!

659
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:30,399
He was not to escape.
Under no circumstances!

660
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,239
Now it starts all over again.

661
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,719
How I hate war.

662
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,799
Do not give up, Pastor.

663
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,079
Pray!

664
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,759
God will come to you
if you renounce the Pope

665
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,759
and return to the bosom of our Church.

666
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,159
Repeat after me: I swear...

667
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,079
He cannot hear me.

668
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,799
Pastor.

669
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,879
It is not your time to die.

670
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,239
There will be other opportunities.

671
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,759
I will try, my friend.

672
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,559
Come here.

673
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,319
- What's your name again?
- Rosny, your Majesty.

674
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,399
Rosny.

675
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,119
Drink with me, my friend Rosny.

676
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,239
I owe my life to you.

677
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,159
And to the grace of God.

678
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,599
Where would I be with God
but without my friends?

679
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,119
Before everything.

680
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,039
Before time.

681
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,799
Before matter, form and place,

682
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,079
God was one and all,
and all was in God.

683
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,279
lneffable and infinite.

684
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,439
Unchanging, impassive.

685
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,919
AII spirit, aII Iight, immortaI,

686
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,959
invisible,

687
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,839


pure, wise.

688
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,559
Just and good.

689
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,639
My country is poor.

690
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,039
We must make it bIossom again!

691
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,479
In my kingdom, everyone will be free
to think and believe as they please.

692
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,559
They will have enough to eat
and to drink.

693
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,799
And on Sundays every peasant's wife
will have a chicken in the pot!

694
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,479
Who is it?

695
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,039
Enough with the music.

696
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,359
But we just started.

697
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,639
Your brother, d'Alençon,

698
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,319
is dead.

699
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,359
Poor beast.

700
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,279
He was so insignificant.

701
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,799
We Valois die before our time.

702
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,959
Even these dogs might outlive me.

703
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,479
I am the last of the House of Valois.

704
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,759
You must finally sire a son.

705
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,839
It is not in my power.
I tried my best with a woman.

706
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,719
Who disgusted me!

707
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,319
But to no avail.

708
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,239
I too cannot bear children.

709
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,239
Any simple peasant girl can
but I cannot.

710
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,959
Is this my fault?

711
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,239
Bring back your husband.

712
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,559
Brilliant, Mother.

713
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,799
He has a claim to the throne, after me.

714
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,959
Only with him can we hold power.

715
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,239
And beat Guise once and for all.

716
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,959
Such audacity!
How can you treat me this way?

717
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,439
I shall complain!

718
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,959
Let go of me!

719
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,159
This is how you greet your wife?

720
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,599
Visitors from Paris
are treated with caution.

721
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,319
- I have a message from your King.
- What is the message?

722
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,959
Not even a kiss?

723
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,599
Not even a little tenderness?

724
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,399
Good.

725
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,959
I come with a request.

726
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,399
Yes?

727
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,039
Must I tell you here?

728
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,279
In the cellar?

729
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,559
Better the cellar than the dungeon.

730
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,879
My... My brother and mother

731
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,359
- want you to come to Paris.
- No.

732
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,879
No? That's all?

733
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,719
I hate you! I hate you!

734
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,679
I hate you! You Devil!

735
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,319
- Did you hear that, Joyeuse?
- Yes.

736
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,959
I should have sent you.

737
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,479
My sister can't negotiate
with her husband.

738
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,679
What a shame!

739
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,479
Sire,

740
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,359
if you can't win him over,
eliminate him.

741
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,839
Checkmate.

742
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,719
It doesn't count!

743
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,679
Yes, it does!

744
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,759
I won't go to war.

745
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,759
He escaped.

746
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,759
First he leaves me,
then abandons you.

747
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,519
Guise is my worst enemy.
It's him I fear the most.

748
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,559
I still think of Navarre as a friend.

749
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,599
No! Why?

750
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,479
He was never your friend.

751
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,599
Are you blind orjust a coward?

752
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,479
Probably both. I don't know.

753
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,799
It's so confusing.

754
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,479
It's not my fault.
It's the times we live in.

755
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,119
What do you think, Mother?

756
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,319
I think you've been given no choice.

757
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,199
I am as afraid of dying as you are.

758
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,999
Trust me.

759
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,559
But if you look for me,

760
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,999
you will find me
in the thick of the fray.

761
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,559
We are not fighting for glory or honour.

762
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,639
We are being forced to fight.

763
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,519
Over there,

764
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,879
they fight only for power.

765
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,399
We are fighting for our survival!

766
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,719
And for the honour of God!

767
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,639
And for the honour of God.

768
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,999
May you grant us victory, oh Lord!

769
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,559
Fight those, oh Lord,
who would fight us.

770
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,399
Make war with those
who would make war with me.

771
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,039
Take up your shieId and arms.

772
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,599
What are they up to, Marshal Biron?

773
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,679
They're praying.

774
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,719
It won't help them.
We have three times as many men.

775
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,079
The Huguenots are not
to be underestimated.

776
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,039
They're fighting for their faith!

777
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,599
Who rescues the poor
from those who rob them.

778
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,679
You will win, brother, for you fight
for your faith and your freedom!

779
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,879
You are fighting for peace!

780
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:11,799
You fight for your family!
Forget not, my brothers!

781
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,359
To battle!

782
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,119
- Do you wish to rally the soldiers?
- Should I?

783
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,839
It won't hurt.

784
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:28,799
Your commitment to the King
will be royally rewarded.

785
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,039
We will destroy the heretics!
Fire the cannons!

786
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,239
Split up!

787
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,479
To battle!

788
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,439
Joyeuse is dead!
Joyeuse is dead!

789
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,159
The battle is lost! Withdraw!

790
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,639
We've lost!

791
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,639
Did we win, Rosny?

792
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,239
What does reason dictate?

793
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,439
The enemy fled.

794
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,199
That can only mean it was a victory.

795
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,879
Despite all the dead.

796
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,399
We counted over a thousand.

797
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,999
Why?

798
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,319
Over there, Sire,

799
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,679
lies someone who loved you.

800
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,119
This is not the time to die, du Bartas.

801
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,959
My brother!

802
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,519
- What are you doing here? Get out!
- What have you done?

803
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,879
You advised me, you stupid cow!

804
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,959
The royal army has been beaten!

805
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,999
Your little knave is dead!
The whole city is against you!

806
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,759
They are calling for Guise
and for your head! As they should!

807
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,199
That would suit you, you whore!

808
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,239
What did you call me,
you pathetic fool?

809
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,599
You're absolutely incapable.

810
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,439
A caricature on the throne
calls me a whore!

811
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,839
Leave the court! Immediately!

812
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,439
I'll show you who's King
by banishing you.

813
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,119
You can't do that.

814
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,759
Oh yes, I can! Away with you!

815
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,679
You are banished!
Don't dare come back!

816
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,999
Sire, your army is vanquished
whilst you cower in bed.

817
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,279
- You call that ruling?
- I owe you no explanation!

818
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,399
Do you hear what they are shouting?

819
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,359
- You're finished!
- No, Guise, you're finished!

820
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,759
Go ahead! Stab him!

821
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,959
Is he really dead?

822
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,759
Yes, he's dead.

823
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,479
We've eliminated him, Mother.

824
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,759
We've eliminated him.

825
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,639
The people are against you.

826
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,519
That's much worse.

827
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,639
What should I do?

828
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,439
My poor darling.

829
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,599
Make peace

830
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,479
with Navarre.

831
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:49,679
- I'm as hungry as a wolf.
- This is all I have.

832
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,719
Thank you.

833
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,719
It's better than nothing.

834
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,839
Since we're not allowed to plunder...

835
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,279
- We are not robbers.
- Nice words won't fill our bellies.

836
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,879
Roaming around like stray dogs...

837
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,599
What gain has our victory brought us?

838
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,479
Castle Coeuvres isn't far from here.

839
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,199
The owner, d'Estrées,
was never a friend to the King.

840
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,839
Stop!

841
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,679
Not one more step!

842
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,999
You hope to kill both of us
with a single arrow?

843
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,599
- We come in peace.
- That's what thieves say, too.

844
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,919
I am the King of Navarre.

845
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,719
Of course you are!

846
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,239
He really is! Our Henry.

847
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,599
- You vanquished the royal army?
- Indeed.

848
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,119
Along with my friend Agrippa

849
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,079
and my army
which is waiting in the woods.

850
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,599
I'm Diane d'Estrées.

851
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,439
I wanted to ask your father...

852
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,399
if maybe...

853
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,599
My sister, Gabrielle.

854
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,559
The King of Navarre,

855
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,759
and his friend.

856
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:48,919
Words fail me, Mademoiselle...
You render me speechless.

857
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,399
A pity!

858
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,959
Then we won't learn
what brings you here.

859
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,399
We came to ask your father
to grant us shelter.

860
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,599
Our father has gone to Paris
to attend the Queen's funeral.

861
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,879
- Madame Catherine is dead.
- She died peacefully, in her bed.

862
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,879
Catherine de' Medici.

863
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,359
She fought all her life
for her sons' power.

864
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,279
- In vain.
- D'Anjou can't hold power without her.

865
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,599
Me, however, I'm sitting in the bath
while two beautiful women bring me water.

866
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,759
- What did he whisper?
- I'll return, my beauty.

867
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,439
- He's in love with you!
- He smells like a goat!

868
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,039
- He's the future King!
- So?

869
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,319
Gabrielle, you're too dumb to be a whore!

870
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,119
You make a good target, Sire.

871
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,679
What should I fear?
D'Anjou requested this meeting.

872
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,599
Not me.

873
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,839
Help! The King is dying!

874
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,559
He stabbed the King!

875
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,679
Henry.

876
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,239
Sire, what a reunion.

877
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,679
You are closer to the throne

878
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,439
than ever.

879
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:39,079
You must become Catholic.

880
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,799
Henry... Swear it.

881
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,719
The King is dead.

882
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,799
In France, kings don't die!

883
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,919
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

884
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,079
A Huguenot king? Never!

885
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:20,439
The King is whoever controls Paris.
That's us. The Catholics!

886
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,439
Whoever won't bow to me may leave.

887
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,839
I won't renounce my faith.

888
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,399
I want to be King of all the French.

889
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,919
Sire, you were my enemy,
as I was yours.

890
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,239
That is in the past.

891
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,679
I won't risk my neck for Mayenne!

892
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,519
You are my King!

893
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,959
Marshal Biron,
with you we will conquer Paris!

894
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,439
4 months later

895
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,319
The town can't be conquered!

896
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,759
Paris is tougher than I thought.

897
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,439
They won't just open the gates.

898
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,399
The siege is having an effect!

899
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,519
But not the effect I want.

900
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,999
They'll only accept a Catholic king.

901
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,479
Let them starve!

902
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,159
I won't be a king
who lets his people starve.

903
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,039
We withdraw!

904
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,359
- So close to our goal?
- Yet so far from it!

905
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,119
Unless you convert to a Catholic.

906
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:04,439
As a Huguenot,
I cannot advise you to do so. But...

907
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,519
Paris is worth a Mass, Sire.

908
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:22,319
Peace and unity are better.
Stubbornness costs too many lives.

909
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,319
Rosny wants tolerance.
And that's what I want as well.

910
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,679
Rosny has no idea!
You're considering treason!

911
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,879
- Who am I betraying?
- Us!

912
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,799
Everyone who fought in your name.

913
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,679
But I'm not doing it for myself!
I'm doing it for France!

914
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,359
I won't abandon my Huguenots!

915
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,439
You already have!

916
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,319
- Sire, you have a visitor.
- I don't want visitors.

917
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,439
Gabrielle!

918
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,479
You're more beautiful than I recall!

919
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,839
Monsieur, tell me what you want.

920
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,839
I want to take you in my arms.

921
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,119
I want to kiss you. I want to...

922
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,679
I want to love you.

923
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,079
What do I get in return?

924
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,799
You want to barter?

925
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,039
Very well.

926
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,639
Very well,

927
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,359
let's barter.

928
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,759
The King's patronage for my family.

929
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,839
But I'm not the King.

930
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,439
You will be.

931
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,999
Then I grant you my patronage.

932
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,919
Henry, what is it you seek?

933
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:10,319
I desire to be taken into the fold
of the Roman Catholic Church. Amen.

934
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,119
Do you desire it wholeheartedly?

935
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:20,079
Yes, with all my heart.

936
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,919
Credo in unum Deum,
Patrem omnipotentem

937
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,039
factorem caeli et terrae,

938
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,999
visibilium omnium et invisibilium.

939
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:49,559
Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum,
Filium Dei unicum,

940
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:53,559
et ex Patre natum ante omnia saecula.

941
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,359
Deum de Deo,

942
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,159
lumen de lumine,

943
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,799
Deum verum de Deo vero,

944
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,319
genitum non factum,

945
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,959
consubstantialem Patri,

946
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,719
per quem omnia facta sunt,

947
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,679
qui propter nos homines

948
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,319
et propter nostram salutem.

949
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,999
Who hired you? Tell me!

950
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,079
Who's behind this?

951
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,639
Who?

952
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,159
The Louvre.

953
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,319
Cold and hostile.

954
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,919
How I hated this place!

955
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,959
You return as King, Majesty.

956
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,279
King of France!

957
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,879
An amazing moment.

958
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,879
Henry IV enters his palace!

959
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,559
It's been so long
since we enjoyed such an evening.

960
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,159
Cannon fire simply forjoy.

961
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,439
Hope to God
our enemies share your opinion.

962
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,519
The Spaniards threaten us with war.

963
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,879
I beg you! No more. Not tonight!

964
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,079
- Sire, Monsieur Zamet, an old friend.
- Sire...

965
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,559
Majesty...

966
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,719
My King...

967
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,679
Which title do I choose?

968
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,759
Stand up, Monsieur Zamet.

969
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,399
Monsieur Zamet is a worldly man.

970
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,879
And a wealthy man!

971
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,839
Keep him in mind.

972
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,439
What do you want from me?

973
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,439
My father!

974
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,439
That belongs to me!

975
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,479
Give it back!

976
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:13,159
- It's not yours!
- Your Majesty.

977
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,959
What's the matter, Monsieur d'Estrées?

978
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,479
He stole my ring!

979
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,639
Lies, your Majesty!

980
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,759
- I bought these!
- Bought?

981
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,919
He stole them!

982
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,719
Calm down. Please listen to me.

983
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,679
All of this was arranged.

984
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,999
I had a wager with Governor d'Estrées

985
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:43,159
that he couldn't pass for a thief.

986
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,079
I've won.

987
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,919
Monsieur d'Estrées,
give back their belongings.

988
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,519
As I see it, nothing's been lost.

989
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,359
- Well then?
- Let's have it.

990
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,439
Forgive him.

991
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,239
There won't be a second time.

992
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,479
Henry, make amends with him.

993
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,159
I should? He's indebted to me.

994
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,599
You're the King.

995
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,159
Who could be indebted to you?

996
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,799
I won't often ask you for favours.

997
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,119
And I shall refuse you nothing.

998
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:54,199
My father would like to be
General of the Artillery.

999
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,239
Does he know
anything about cannons?

1000
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,119
He'll learn.

1001
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,639
I promised Rosny that post.

1002
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,319
Do it for me.

1003
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,879
The whole country is like this!

1004
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,559
The peasants can't plant their fields
for lack of grain.

1005
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:45,159
Then we'll buy some.

1006
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:47,719
With what money?

1007
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,079
I'll invest everything I own.

1008
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,559
I finally have the power

1009
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,839
to change everything.

1010
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,599
France will blossom again!

1011
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,959
And I'll forgive your Catholicism.

1012
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,679
All these roads are in bad condition.

1013
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,799
But trade needs good roads.

1014
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,439
We need schools.

1015
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,279
The people have to learn
to read and write.

1016
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,439
Don't forget my peasants!

1017
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,399
That means work for at least ten years.

1018
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,479
6 months later

1019
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,239
Out of my way!

1020
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,919
That was the Battle of Arques.

1021
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,479
And this, the one of Ivry.

1022
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,479
As you see, no sleep for me.

1023
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,239
At least, not with my wife, Margot.

1024
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,999
It's other bums
on which my favours I bestow!

1025
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,439
A small contribution.

1026
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,559
Your laughter surprises me, Sire.

1027
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,279
Why? Do you find me too common?

1028
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,719
That, too! But there's something else.

1029
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,039
Calais has been invaded
and is under occupation.

1030
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,559
Calais first, now Amiens.

1031
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,639
May the devil take the Spaniards!

1032
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:29,439
Money, Money!
I don't want to taIk about money!

1033
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,879
I suppose you already know.

1034
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,919
Amiens has also fallen. I know.

1035
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,719
40 cannons lost.

1036
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,959
Thanks to Monsieur d'Estrées.

1037
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:49,999
There is nothing to stop them.
No army, no river.

1038
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,559
They can march straight to Paris.

1039
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,679
Another war.

1040
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,279
No, Sire.

1041
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,839
No war.

1042
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:02,279
You can't fight a war
with empty coffers.

1043
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,959
Why are they empty?

1044
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,559
You bought grain
for the poor peasants.

1045
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,839
We're building roads everywhere.

1046
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,679
The beautiful lady, Sire, at your side.
It all costs money.

1047
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,999
It's my fault
that we can't pay an army?

1048
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,199
That's absurd!

1049
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,839
- I know what you say about me!
- Enough!

1050
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,479
Calm yourself, Gabrielle, please.

1051
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,279
I will find a solution.

1052
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,719
I am quite intrigued, indeed.

1053
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,159
Where are our cannons,
Monsieur d'Estrées?

1054
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,999
The artillery refuses to fight.

1055
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:12,239
Refuses?
You didn't order it?

1056
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,239
They say they won't fight without pay.

1057
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,879
My men are moaning too.
I had to threaten them.

1058
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,199
You can no longer count on
the loyalty of your Huguenots.

1059
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:26,559
Rosny is looking for funds,
but he needs time.

1060
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,159
If they defeat us today,

1061
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,439
all our efforts will have been in vain!

1062
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,359
There's Rosny.

1063
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,399
Gabrielle?

1064
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,719
Open the lock.

1065
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,599
Ten sacks of gold, Sire!

1066
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:34,079
- From whom?
- From Monsieur Zamet.

1067
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,679
I mortgaged everything
to win this battle.

1068
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,119
Just for your victory!

1069
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,079
France has prevailed!

1070
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,959
We've won.

1071
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,479
You are alive.

1072
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,959
It was his last battle.

1073
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:25,319
Glory and honour
to a courageous soldier!

1074
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,479
And, above all, to a friend.

1075
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,319
Long live the King of France!

1076
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,039
And his fair Lady!

1077
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:58,639
We owe this victory to you as well.

1078
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,959
In gratitude for your assistance

1079
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:05,799
you shall be the Duchess of Beaufort!

1080
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,839
You promised me something else, Sire.

1081
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,919
Ever since I was
the little King of Navarre,

1082
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,199
uncertain of my future,

1083
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,119
a long way from France's throne,

1084
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,559
I've longed for this great hour.

1085
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,279
Now I am strong enough

1086
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,599
to declare that you shall be free.

1087
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,759
Free in your beliefs...

1088
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,119
and free in your thoughts.

1089
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:56,279
That he should permit heresy
is blasphemous!

1090
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:59,879
No one knows what he believes in.
Probably nothing at all.

1091
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:07,119
Nobody will be persecuted
for different beliefs than the majority.

1092
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:11,519
Catholics and Huguenots,

1093
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,359
all of you are my people.

1094
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,319
I love you equally.

1095
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:34,399
This shall be the law in France
from now on.

1096
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,759
Long live the great King!

1097
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,239
As great as he may be,
he's merely mortal.

1098
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:58,079
I hear the future King's heart beating.

1099
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,959
You will be King.
I promise.

1100
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,399
I can't live without you.

1101
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,039
I am going to marry you.

1102
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:28,319
Majesty. The Papal Legate from Rome!

1103
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,799
We congratulate you on your victory.

1104
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,839
You are a great king.

1105
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,239
Too great, perhaps...

1106
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,439
You're turning
the natural order upside down.

1107
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,599
Because I believe
in religious freedom?

1108
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,159
This freedom

1109
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,239
cannot exist.

1110
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,759
I am the King of all the French.

1111
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:35,239
But your power depends
on the Pope's grace. Don't forget.

1112
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,239
How could I?

1113
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:40,319
There are people who hate you.
I do not.

1114
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,079
I seek your friendship.

1115
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,519
However, should something
happen to you...

1116
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,959
You came to threaten me?

1117
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:00,359
I came because you asked
the Pope for a divorce.

1118
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,399
My marriage to Margot was childless.

1119
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,759
I need an heir.

1120
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:09,999
The Duke of Tuscany
has a very beautiful niece.

1121
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,119
Marie

1122
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,959
de' Medici.

1123
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:18,999
No, thank you.
I am familiar with the House of Medici.

1124
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,479
Not Gabrielle d'Estrées.

1125
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,439
This is the Holy Father's will.

1126
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,199
And if I don't obey?

1127
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,919
Your Majesty,

1128
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,439
the tree that refuses
to bend in the storm...

1129
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,999
May I give you counseI?

1130
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,959
You've always advised me well.

1131
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,759
Before your wedding

1132
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,359
spend some time at a monastery

1133
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,159
to reflect and to demonstrate
your piety to the Pope.

1134
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,559
Who put that idea in your head?

1135
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,719
The Papal Legate did.

1136
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,439
In a monastery with Catholic monks?

1137
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,039
It seems too obvious to be a trap.

1138
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,999
I entrust you with my most
valuable possession, my friend.

1139
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:17,239
- Sire, have I ever disappointed you?
- No.

1140
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,119
We both wish you a safe journey.

1141
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,759
I fear for you.

1142
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,879
I beg you,
please don't leave me alone.

1143
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:35,359
Don't be afraid, my beautiful angel.

1144
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,639
I will be well guarded at all times.

1145
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,399
Till my return,

1146
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,919
my Queen!

1147
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:42,159
Agrippa!

1148
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:48,239
Where were you?
There was a man in my room!

1149
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:12,319
Sire, it's time for Mass.

1150
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,959
My Lady is expected.
The password is Black Chicken.

1151
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,119
Thank you Monsieur Zamet.
You save me a second time.

1152
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,199
For the future Queen, I...

1153
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,599
No one can learn of this! No one!

1154
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:44,199
Madame, I give you my word.

1155
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,639
Your condition requires that...

1156
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,679
May I stay until the King returns?

1157
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:56,199
Yes, Madame. My bedroom is yours.

1158
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:00,599
Let me just check
that everything is in order.

1159
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,679
Good morning, Monsieur Zamet.

1160
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,119
You have a royal bed.

1161
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:43,679
As long as the ladies slept well.

1162
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,359
Please sit.

1163
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:02,039
Why all this caution?
Do you expect enemies in your home?

1164
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:04,439
You never know, Madame.

1165
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,719
That would be a shame.

1166
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,599
I'd only like an orange.

1167
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,199
An orange, quick!

1168
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:16,719
Your home is very pleasant.
Much more light than in the palace.

1169
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:20,519
God grant that it remains so.

1170
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:32,279
Now you're exaggerating.
That's enough. I'll do it.

1171
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,199
- It's bitter.
- No! Oh God, why me!

1172
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,279
Go! Everyone leave!

1173
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:52,759
Out of my sight!

1174
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:54,519
Monsieur Zamet! Calm down!

1175
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:57,159
She is pregnant
and thus very sensitive.

1176
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:00,039
No need to be so upset!

1177
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,359
Catherine!

1178
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,959
Gabrielle!
Somebody do something!

1179
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,439
Where is she?

1180
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,679
We couldn't prevent it, Sire.

1181
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,399
Tell me where she is!

1182
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,159
A tragedy, Sire...

1183
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:31,999
Sire, your beloved

1184
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,519
is no longer alive!

1185
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:45,879
No.

1186
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,399
You were supposed to protect her!

1187
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,119
Why didn't you?

1188
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:58,559
Why?

1189
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,079
Sire!
Agrippa is not to blame!

1190
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,999
Please listen to me!

1191
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,639
Gabrielle died because of the child.

1192
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,759
What is this, Catherine?

1193
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:54,239
It's just a doll, Henry.

1194
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,359
We wanted to spare you
the sight of her.

1195
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:12,479
Majesty.

1196
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,879
The doctor who stood
by your beloved in her final hour, is here.

1197
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,439
Is it true that you are in contact
with the Medici?

1198
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,999
Who told you that?

1199
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:32,199
Have you no shame?

1200
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,879
This is about France! He's the King!

1201
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:40,999
You have no heart and no conscience.

1202
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,319
Sire, please open the door!

1203
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:03,799
Listen to him. I beg you.

1204
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,559
- I swear...
- That she wasn't poisoned?

1205
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,559
Yes, Sire.

1206
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,519
- Upon my oath.
- Keep your oath.

1207
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,799
I left her alone.

1208
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,199
You didn't kill her.

1209
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,639
That's all we know.

1210
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,559
We opened her body.

1211
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:49,799
Her own body poisoned her.
The child was in the abdomen,

1212
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,879
- nearly rotten...
- Spare him the details.

1213
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,359
I loved her, Rosny!

1214
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:07,959
I loved her as my one true love.

1215
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:16,279
I loved her body
as much as her whole being.

1216
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,279
You say the blame...

1217
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:30,679
- The blame lies with nature?
- That's correct, Sire.

1218
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,319
But we can't punish nature.

1219
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,799
As reason dictates, Sire.

1220
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,399
My heart is dead!

1221
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,839
It will never thrive again.

1222
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:01,839
Think of your responsibility, Sire.

1223
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:09,359
I do.

1224
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,639
Let reason govern.

1225
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,719
Stop!

1226
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,519
I have to pee!

1227
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,599
Turn around!

1228
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,959
What do you think, Leonora?

1229
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:55,959
This is France?

1230
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,559
I didn't expect much!

1231
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,879
Announce my presence.

1232
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,719
- Open for the King of France!
- I'll open.

1233
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:39,519
- Sire.
- That's just her dwarf, Sire.

1234
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,039
Long live the King!

1235
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:45,519
No. You cannot enter!

1236
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,479
Welcome, Sire.
You alone.

1237
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,599
You may go.
I doubt there is any danger here.

1238
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,399
Go.

1239
02:07:58,520 --> 02:07:59,959
You too.

1240
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:10,519
Pardon me, my goddess.

1241
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:16,039
I must get used to the fact
that we are already married.

1242
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:20,879
A marriage of convenience
contracted in Florence

1243
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,759
without us even meeting.

1244
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,479
It is somewhat unusual.

1245
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,999
It is colder here than in Florence.

1246
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:33,279
We Medici love our city
and don't like having to leave it.

1247
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:40,879
I can't understand you, dear wife.

1248
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,999
Good!

1249
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,879
Let's get to the task at hand.

1250
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:50,159
As you know, this country needs an heir.

1251
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:52,359
Leonora! Help!

1252
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:53,919
My lady?

1253
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:57,759
Madame, the two of us can manage.

1254
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,879
You're not needed?

1255
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,759
In accordance with our Father's order,

1256
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:25,519
I will fulfill my duties.

1257
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:27,759
Me too.

1258
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:37,879
Slowly, dear husband, slowly.

1259
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:43,399
What are you doing?

1260
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,319
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1261
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:03,999
Excuse me, please. Sorry.

1262
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:13,959
Noble Lords and Ladies, the Dauphin!

1263
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:37,719
Our reign is assured!

1264
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:41,319
Are you mad?

1265
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,919
He is not a toy!

1266
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,919
The Dauphin!

1267
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,199
Louis de Bourbon!

1268
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:43,479
- Who's that young woman?
- I think her name is Henriette.

1269
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,919
Old goat!

1270
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,479
I'll find you!

1271
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:19,399
Where's the horny old goat?

1272
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:24,159
Who do you mean, Madame?

1273
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,919
You know exactly, you swine!

1274
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,159
You'll find nothing here!

1275
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:38,079
I can throw you in the dungeon.

1276
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:41,479
- What for?
- For turning my husband's head!

1277
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,519
Bitch!

1278
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,159
Madame. Madame, it's unjust!

1279
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:49,439
Who told you
to dance naked in front of the King?

1280
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,399
Princess Margot.

1281
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,359
Where is this Margot?

1282
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:00,559
Alone. Banished to Auvergne.

1283
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:05,319
She should stay there.

1284
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,679
Pig!

1285
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:14,479
I hate you!

1286
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:17,879
You measly old goat! Pig!

1287
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,959
You want to leave?

1288
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:32,919
I'm asking you, Sire.

1289
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,039
Forgive me
for having briefly imagined

1290
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:47,839
that you were responsible
for Gabrielle's death.

1291
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,999
Already forgotten, Sire.

1292
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:59,519
Do not think leaving is easy for me.

1293
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,599
Is it because of Marie?

1294
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,279
Your wife...

1295
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,919
is no Gabrielle.

1296
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:16,079
I can see that you don't love her
and that saddens me.

1297
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:29,919
We've been through a lot.

1298
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:39,319
Enough to retreat
from the worldly stage.

1299
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:53,559
I'll never forget you.

1300
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:57,319
You'll remain in my heart...

1301
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,039
until I die.

1302
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:23,159
How is he?

1303
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,439
He has a high fever.

1304
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,159
May I speak to him?

1305
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:52,679
Sire, allow me...

1306
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:58,839
For some time something has been
weighing on my soul.

1307
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:01,319
On mine as well.

1308
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,559
Sire, your...

1309
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,559
The love of your life...

1310
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:16,399
Was poisoned.

1311
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:31,439
Back then, I suspected

1312
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:37,599
that the Pope would never
tolerate your marriage to Gabrielle.

1313
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,719
I knew nothing about the poison.

1314
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,999
Maybe I could have prevented it.

1315
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:54,199
But I didn't.

1316
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:04,079
Too late did I realise that Gabrielle
was the love of your life.

1317
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:08,559
I was thinking only of France.

1318
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:13,879
If you should condemn me now...

1319
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:23,799
Forgive me.

1320
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:29,079
We can't undo the past.

1321
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:35,239
We can, however,
be honest with each other.

1322
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:37,199
Like true friends.

1323
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,359
Where does this garter come from?

1324
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,759
You'll tell me, I suppose.

1325
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:55,519
It was found under your bed!

1326
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:01,239
- How nice.
- Nothing is nice.

1327
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:05,039
A piece of your whore.
It is not mine!

1328
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,999
The whole court...

1329
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:09,799
Everyone says
you're a horny old goat!

1330
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:13,759
Forbid them to say so.

1331
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:19,239
I...

1332
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:23,199
I became your wife for a lot of money.
That's all.

1333
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:25,439
You don't love me.

1334
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:28,239
You never have.

1335
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,879
Why?

1336
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,959
I bore you a son.

1337
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:35,759
It was so important.

1338
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,679
That's true.

1339
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,519
I hate you!

1340
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:51,719
I'll hate you for my whole life.

1341
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:59,079
I'll cut your whore's head off!

1342
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,839
Not as long as I am alive, Madame.

1343
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,479
That could change.

1344
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,959
You have many enemies.

1345
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,679
The worst sits in front of me.

1346
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,879
You want me to crown that woman,

1347
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,799
knowing that she detests me?

1348
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,639
It would be helpful, Sire.

1349
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:32,999
Your son is too young
to govern this country

1350
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:34,919
if something happened to you.

1351
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,999
This is what reason dictates, is it not?

1352
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:40,399
I hate you, Madame!

1353
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:42,159
Be careful, little man.

1354
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,279
You could break your neck.

1355
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:49,079
Leave, little rat!

1356
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:54,239
Monsieur Ravaillac! We welcome you.

1357
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:57,159
Papa!

1358
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:59,679
Mama is meeting a red man!

1359
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,399
A red man?

1360
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:03,959
Sounds dangerous, a red man.

1361
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:06,559
He's red here and here.

1362
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:23,439
Tu Rex gIoriae, Christe.

1363
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:27,639
Tu Patris sempiternus es FiIius.

1364
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:32,519
Tu ad liberandum
suscepturus hominem,

1365
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:36,079
non horruisti Virginis uterum.

1366
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:39,759
Tu, devicto mortis aculeo,

1367
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,279
aperuisti credentibus regna caeIorum.

1368
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:55,679
Papa!

1369
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:20,079
Make way for the royaI coach!

1370
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,319
Your Majesty!

1371
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,759
Marie, look! Our King!

1372
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,439
Stop the coach!
What's in your pot?

1373
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:45,919
A chicken, Majesty.
Would you like some?

1374
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:46,959
No, thank you.

1375
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,879
Thanks to you,
with bacon and beans!

1376
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,079
Another time!

1377
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:54,199
You see?

1378
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:57,439
Our efforts were not in vain!

1379
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:05,719
Coachman, what's the matter?

1380
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:10,959
She reminds me of my GabrieIIe.

1381
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,159
Get him out!

1382
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,759
Get him out of the coach!

1383
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:31,319
Down with the Huguenots!
I've saved the world.

1384
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:32,879
I've murdered that heretic!

1385
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,439
Why doesn't anyone help?

1386
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:36,199
Down with the Huguenots!

1387
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:37,639
Sire!

1388
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:41,279
Sire! Please God!

1389
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,839
Your King is dying!

1390
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:48,039
Someone help!

1391
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:51,119
Coachman, drive!


430
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,559
The whole city is arming itself.

431
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,879
The people are crying out for action.

432
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,479
The Admiral must die.

433
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,439
- Give the order!
- I cannot! I cannot! Never!

434
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,279
Come.
We must leave to save our lives.

435
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,799
The King is a pathetic coward.

436
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,919
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!

437
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,399
All of them.

438
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,279
Huguenots.

439
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,719
Protestants.

440
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,239
All of them!

441
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,879
Burnt! Quartered!

442
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,079
- The Admiral as well?
- Him too, my father.

443
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,079
Away with him!

444
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,439
Cross the street.

445
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,599
Hurry, they'II get away.

446
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,079
Henry, I've been looking for you!

447
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,119
The people are rebelling!

448
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,119
Against us Huguenots?

449
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,519
Your marriage didn't appease them,
quite the opposite. I think...

450
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,999
What?

451
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,879
We were lured to the city.

452
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,319
That's impossible.

453
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,079
Prince, both sides have suffered
so much injustice and death.

454
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,119
Peace cannot be decreed,
not even by the King.

455
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,799
Look at the people.

456
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,079
They want revenge, not reconciliation.

457
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,039
You said that violence is strong
but benevolence is stronger.

458
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,839
And so it is.

459
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,639
But one needs great strength.
Many do not have that.

460
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,279
- Seek safety. I have friends close by.
- No.

461
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,239
I must return to the Louvre.

462
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,879
To the right!

463
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,079
Now!

464
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,919
- Is it done?
- Yes, Lord! I've taken care of him!

465
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,439
I want to see him.

466
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,719
Throw him down!

467
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,199
It's him.

468
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,959
The Catholics!

469
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,839
A trap!

470
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,799
Defend yourselves!
We must find the King!

471
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,159
Only he can stop them!

472
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,079
Sire, open the door!
Open the door!

473
00:46:43,320 --
