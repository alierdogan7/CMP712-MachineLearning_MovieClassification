00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,406
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Medieval England...</i>

2
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,317
<i>the early years of</i>
<i>the reign of Edward I.</i>

3
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,878
<i>A troubled land in those days.</i>

4
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:34,256
<i>Her great feudal fortress castles,</i>
<i>born in that uneasy time...</i>

5
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,318
<i>stand now as stately</i>
<i>monuments...</i>

6
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,696
<i>to how unyielding were the enmities</i>
<i>that caused their building.</i>

7
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,167
<i>More than two centuries</i>
<i>have passed...</i>

8
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,727
<i>since the Norman conquests have</i>
<i>brought the last infusion...</i>

9
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,138
<i>of what was one day</i>
<i>to be English blood.</i>

10
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,872
<i>Yet, the bitterness between the Norman</i>
<i>conqueror and the Saxon conquered...</i>

11
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,278
<i>lay still unhealed.</i>

12
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,045
<i>It had separated the neighboring</i>
<i>great houses of Bulaire and Gurnie...</i>

13
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,078
<i>by far more than the scant</i>
<i>few miles that lay between them...</i>

14
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,556
<i>in those days that began</i>
<i>with the death of Rauf...</i>

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,423
<i>Earl of Lessford and</i>
<i>Lord of the House of Bulaire.</i>

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,805
You there.
What's your business?

17
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,979
- I was sent for by the earl's man of law.
- And what might your name be?

18
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,647
They call me
Walter of Gurnie.

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,157
I should have known
you're his son by the look of you.

20
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,059
You had a good man to father you,
I'll say that. You'd best come this way.

21
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,792
Saxons of any breeding won't find much
welcome here now that he's dead.

22
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,652
- What do you want here?
- He wants to see Simeon Bautrie,
the earl's man of law.

23
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,255
Oh, so you're the lad
from Oxford.

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,563
- I'll take you to him.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,448
- Walter, my lad.
- Simeon, I'm glad to see you.

26
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,509
You've grown.
Thickened out anyway.

27
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,987
Did you find
your grandfather well?

28
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,787
Well, l- I didn't stop at home.
I came straight here.

29
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,056
I thought-Well, I was afraid
that he'd forbid my coming.

30
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,689
My grandfather never
stopped hating him.

31
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,995
You'll not have eaten then.
Sit down, lad.

32
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,534
I keep bite and sup handy.

33
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,211
Fall to, lad.

34
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,641
Tell me, young scholar...

35
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,481
what have they taught you
in this Oxford of yours?

36
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,421
Oh, numbers.
Ma- Many things.

37
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,482
- I can read as well as you, Simeon Bautrie.
- And write too?

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,825
Yes, I know a little Latin
and some Greek too.

39
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,864
And French too, perhaps?

40
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,595
No, I'll not learn
that Norman tongue.

41
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,639
Let them learn ours.
Two hundred years since they came here...

42
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,697
and their court still
clatters with that foreign-

43
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,972
Easy, lad, easy.
You forget this is a Norman house now.

44
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,036
Do you want to
get us hanged?

45
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,916
Simeon, tell me,
why did you send for me?

46
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,889
Reason enough.

47
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,017
- You're in the will.
- By name?

48
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,254
I mean, he acknowledges me
as his son?

49
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,025
<i>Yes, he says you're his son.</i>
<i>I knew he would.</i>

50
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,625
But don't count on
too much from it, lad.

51
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,897
Tell me.
You knew my father well.

52
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,372
He loved my mother,
didn't he...

53
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,001
more than he loved
that Norman... woman he married.

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,705
<i>He loved me too.</i>

55
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,748
<i>I know he did.</i>

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,283
I remember once
when I was little...

57
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,979
I admired a pair of boots
he was wearing.

58
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,319
They were black
with gold leopards.

59
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,915
He said that he'd
get me a pair like them.

60
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,726
He never did, of course,
but I knew that he wanted to.

61
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,062
If he could have done
what he wanted, he-

62
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,363
he would have made
things different, wouldn't he?

63
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,165
Your father, Walter,
bore a stout lance in battle...

64
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,210
and he was gentle enough
of heart, there's truth in that.

65
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,612
Yes, I think he loved
your mother best...

66
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,946
and that you were
the son he wanted.

67
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,387
<i>But it may be too that he's done you more harm</i>
<i>than good by mentioning you in the will.</i>

68
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,324
There's no love here for Saxons
of any breeding now.

69
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,520
They gave their allegiance
to your father...

70
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,029
and well that Norman wife
of his knows it.

71
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,532
She's already thrown a score of them
into her dungeons...

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,125
hostages against trouble.

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,229
So I'll not have you come charging into
this business with all your emotion.

74
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,874
You can be present at
the reading of the will...

75
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,674
but only if you'll stand
well back in the hall.

76
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,274
If my lady sees you,
she'll do you harm if she can.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,052
<i>[Fanfare]</i>

78
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,301
- [Speaking French]
<i>- Oui.</i>

79
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,365
Begin.

80
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,839
In the name of God, amen.

81
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,884
This is the last will
and testament of Rauf...

82
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,852
Earl of Lessford
and Lord of Bulaire.

83
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:06,187
First, he gives and bequeaths his soul
unto the Lord God Almighty...

84
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,625
<i>and to all saints...</i>

85
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,357
<i>and his body to be buried</i>
<i>in the chapel of his castle at Bulaire.</i>

86
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,267
Item- He wills that
all such manors, lands and rents...

87
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,363
which were descended unto him by way
of inheritance, shall remain unto his heirs...

88
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,037
namely, Eleanor, his wife,
and Edmond, his lawful son.

89
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,342
Item.

90
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,780
He wishes to acknowledge
a known truth...

91
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,217
that he had another son,
who, for lack of his name...

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,848
is known as Walter of Gurnie,
and for whom he had affection.

93
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,793
To this said Walter of Gurnie...

94
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,093
he bequeaths his black boots of
Spanish leather with the golden leopards.

95
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,232
<i>Further,</i>
<i>and of most importance...</i>

96
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,932
it was his wish to will this son's life
into the service of our king...

97
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>confident that he will make a fitting and</i>
<i>honorable place for himself in such service.</i>

98
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,681
Item-

99
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,446
<i>He gives and bequeaths to</i>
<i>the high altar of the chapel of Bulaire...</i>

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,217
<i>- the chalice-</i>
- There's no more in that will
concerns that nameless lout!

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,123
<i>- Let him take what was given him and leave.</i>
- Why should I?

102
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,289
Shall I crawl out on my hands and knees
because some Norman tells me to?

103
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,494
- Watch your Saxon tongue!
- And I'll serve no Norman king either.

104
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,197
I'm a Saxon. He had no right
to hand me over to a Norman tyrant.

105
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,072
- This is treason!
<i>- [Lady] And may you hang for it, Walter of Gurnie.</i>

106
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,305
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>By your leave, my Lady of Lessford.</i>

107
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,359
There's something here, I think,
that touches on a matter...

108
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,091
with which I am
very much concerned.

109
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,292
I should like to
question this young man.

110
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,235
You have no need to ask,
Your Majesty.

111
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,036
It would seem that the prospect
of entering the service of your king...

112
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,077
does not altogether
fill you with pleasure.

113
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,774
I'd like you to tell me freely
why this feeling is so bitter.

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,288
You may speak up, lad.

115
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,323
As you see, I came
this way while hunting...

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,418
<i>so let us say that for the moment</i>
<i>I am not your king...</i>

117
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,157
so we talk as
between two men.

118
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,426
There'll be no penalty
for the truth.

119
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,025
You're a Norman,
that's reason enough.

120
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,430
But it's not.

121
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,373
It's over 200 years
since the conquest.

122
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,603
Surely Saxons and Normans
should have found a way...

123
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,340
to live together
in that time.

124
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,383
Your father did not feel as you do.
He was a Saxon.

125
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,044
He knew that if this
bitterness was not healed...

126
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,748
it would be
the worse for England.

127
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,623
This is a problem that must be
dealt with one way or another.

128
00:09:54,694 --> 00:10:00,326
Tell me, when you refuse me
your loyalty because I am a Norman...

129
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,960
have you not considered that
I have no choice in the same matter...

130
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,869
that I must be king
for Norman and Saxon alike...

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,874
whether I like it or not?

132
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,673
Do you Saxons not owe something
besides hatred to the same cause?

133
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,340
What do I owe the Normans?

134
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:21,011
We lived at Gurnie when the Normans
were no better than wolves of the sea...

135
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,318
and it was a better Gurnie then
before they came to rob us.

136
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,824
She's a Norman...

137
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,190
and she robbed me
of my name.

138
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,822
She robbed my father of the chance
he had to have a Saxon son.

139
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,332
<i>It was her doing</i>
<i>that I never knew my father.</i>

140
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,065
He willed me into the service of a Norman,
but he can't make me serve them.

141
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,473
I have heard nothing in this
that touches my problem.

142
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,075
This seems to me to be a matter
between a son and his father.

143
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,782
I would not like the lad to be hanged
merely because he has been hurt.

144
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,417
It is our wish
that he be let go free.

145
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,804
Do you suppose this house could give
a traveler rest? Let's say if he was born here?

146
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,279
- Master Walter!
- It's good to see you, old Will.

147
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,816
You've grown, and well too.

148
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,875
Come in. Come in.

149
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,055
You're home again.

150
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,860
I hoped you'd come by suppertime.
I laid a place for you.

151
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,761
You knew I'd left Oxford then.

152
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,699
Aye. We have a guest who came
from Oxford. About you, I think.

153
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,534
- Who's that?
- Bacon. Friar Roger Bacon.

154
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,438
Oh. Friar Bacon. He was
a teacher of mine. I'd like to see him.

155
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,305
I'll tell him, Master Walter.

156
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,640
Will-

157
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,909
Uh, what did he say when
he found I'd left school?

158
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,511
- My grandfather, I mean.
- You know him, Master Walter.

159
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,113
He never says anything.
He just looks.

160
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,126
- Well, how is he?
- You saw that pile of iron in the moat?

161
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,128
Yes, I did.
I meant to ask.

162
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,187
We have gone into trade.

163
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,790
A belted knight
of Gurnie in trade...

164
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,200
dealing in armorers'
iron and swine.

165
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,570
And just like he does everything else,
not a word to anyone.

166
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:00,442
One morning, the horses were gone
and the swine came.

167
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,447
And then the iron.

168
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,279
And when they wanted to know
where he wanted it put...

169
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,583
he told me to have them
put it in front of the gate.

170
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:14,183
They didn't know what he meant,
but I did.

171
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,664
If we were going to be in trade,
put it out where the world could see.

172
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,860
If there's a price
to pay, pay it.

173
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,996
And when he walks by it...

174
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,404
he looks neither to
the right nor to the left.

175
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,537
I'll call Friar Bacon,
Master Walter.

176
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,917
<i>[Man] I trust this reception</i>
<i>is not planned for me.</i>

177
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,625
Oh, Friar Bacon.
L- I couldn't help doing that.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,101
When I was very little,
that was my measure of growing up...

179
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,138
when I could wield
that sword.

180
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,140
I could wish I'd given you
so much of feeling about your books.

181
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,870
Perhaps you would not have
given them up so readily.

182
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,846
Oh.

183
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,913
What happened
concerning your father?

184
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,923
Was it all you hoped for?

185
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,293
No.

186
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,259
Will you return with me then?

187
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:05,334
I, uh-
I don't know.

188
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,398
Never mind.

189
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:10,502
There'll be time to talk of that later,
perhaps with your grandfather.

190
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,412
[Chuckles]
That won't be so easy.

191
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,951
Why not?

192
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,388
Well, you see, my grandfather and I only
talk to each other through someone else.

193
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,856
It, uh- It makes
discussion difficult.

194
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,894
You mean
you don't speak?

195
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:29,021
Generally we talk
through old Wilderkin...

196
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:32,897
but I should warn you that it may
very well be you if no one else is here.

197
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:36,570
No, you mustn't think
that he's unkind.

198
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:40,574
It- It's just an oath he took after
the great quarrel with my father.

199
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:48,549
Well, perhaps I ought to tell you
a little bit about it to make it clear.

200
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:53,145
My father was betrothed to my mother
before he went on his crusade...

201
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:58,454
but when he was returning, he fell ill
of a wound-very nearly died of it.

202
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,758
They cared for him
in a Norman house.

203
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,731
Well, after a long time,
when he was well again...

204
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,759
he married the daughter of that house,
the one who had nursed him.

205
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,328
It was out of
gratitude, I suppose.

206
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,431
He didn't know that I'd been born.
How could he?

207
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:17,968
As soon as he found out,
he came straight here.

208
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:23,245
And then there was a quarrel,
so bitter that I can still remember it.

209
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,651
My grandfather swore that he would
never speak to my father again...

210
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:29,247
nor to anyone else
of his blood.

211
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,849
That included me,
of course...

212
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,895
although he didn't
mean it that way.

213
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:38,626
I've often thought that
he was sorry for it afterward.

214
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,897
But my grandfather, you will find,
is a man who does not take an oath...

215
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,303
- nor anything else, lightly.
- I see.

216
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:48,639
I, uh- I think that
I should tell you something-

217
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,942
<i>[Man] Wilderkin! Is our supper ready,</i>
<i>and is our guest here, Wilderkin?</i>

218
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:55,108
<i>[Will]</i>
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

219
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:10,290
Uh, Wilderkin, tell my grandson
that I'm pleased to see him...

220
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,697
and to see that he's grown
the shoulders of a man.

221
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:16,226
- My lord wishes me to tell you-
- Tell my grandfather, Wilderkin...

222
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:18,966
that I'm glad to see him,
and that I hope the shoulders...

223
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,168
are broad enough to be
of service to him soon.

224
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:25,202
- My lord, Master Walter says-
- Well spoken, Wilderkin. Well spoken.

225
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,373
<i>Ah, and our guest!</i>

226
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,816
- Welcome to our table, Friar Bacon.
- Thank you, my lord.

227
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,057
Ah. Pig.

228
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:41,357
Not the best of meats to offer a guest,
Friar, but it's stout and it fills the belly.

229
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,662
Uh, Wilderkin, ask my grandson what
he thinks about our venture into trade...

230
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:48,032
- a course of which no doubt he's aware.
- My lord asks-

231
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,162
Tell my grandfather,
Wilderkin...

232
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,366
that I think he has adopted
a courageous and knightly course.

233
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,933
Ah, well spoken again,
Wilderkin.

234
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,206
Well, now let's fall to.

235
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,874
<i>Talk comes easier</i>
<i>on a full belly.</i>

236
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,110
<i>The Normans haven't</i>
<i>changed that yet.</i>

237
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,053
A pair of boots...

238
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,249
and the privilege of wearing
an iron collar for a Norman king.

239
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,554
- Ask him what else he expects.
- My lord says-

240
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:15,722
Tell my grandfather l- I had hoped
there would be some help for Gurnie in it.

241
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,766
Tell my grandson
he was a fool to think it.

242
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,462
Tell him he can help Gurnie best
by returning to his studies...

243
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,369
where he can learn to be
a better man than his father was.

244
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:29,103
Tell my grandfather that...
I'm not going to return to school.

245
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:33,876
Tell him that I think my place is here
with him at Gurnie, if there is to be a Gurnie.

246
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:37,112
Ask him by what right he thinks
at all in such a matter.

247
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:40,018
Ask him who's the best judge
of what he'll need...

248
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,454
to hold this house
against the Norman thieves.

249
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:44,958
- Ask him if he thinks l-
- Tell my grandson that-

250
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:48,052
- My lord, will you permit me?
- On whose side will you speak?

251
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,429
- On no one's side, my lord.
- I warn you, Friar...

252
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,196
that if what you say
is not on my side...

253
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,500
I shall pay but little heed
to the fact that you're my guest.

254
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:00,507
I journeyed here, my lord,
to urge the same point as you-

255
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,339
the return of
your grandson to Oxford.

256
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:07,279
<i>Few scholars have come to me with such</i>
<i>an aptitude for learning as your grandson.</i>

257
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,944
It would be a personal
and bitter failure to me if I lost him.

258
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,419
What good is it?

259
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:16,082
How can you fight the Normans
with-with books?

260
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:20,219
Walter, if I was young and had
no sure place to put my life...

261
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:24,095
I could think of nothing better than
to give it for the search for knowledge.

262
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,159
The strength in knowledge, it can
win victories that the sword cannot.

263
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:33,606
<i>There's so much we need to know</i>
<i>and so few people to seek it out.</i>

264
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,143
England will need it someday.

265
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:40,545
<i>She needs it now.</i>
<i>Just a handful of books in all our land.</i>

266
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:45,712
Painfully written,
painfully read by only too few.

267
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:50,588
There is in every land knowledge
that we need to add to our store.

268
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:55,289
I've heard of Cathay, a country they say
where no Englishman has been...

269
00:19:55,363 --> 00:20:00,858
<i>an old country,</i>
<i>fabulously rich not only with gold...</i>

270
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,734
<i>but with the knowledge</i>
<i>of many ages.</i>

271
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,932
I've heard that they know
of a substance...

272
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,498
which when it touches a spark...

273
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,569
disappears in
a blinding flash of light.

274
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:16,640
That they have instruments which help them
to travel by sea and land without becoming lost.

275
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,686
Do you believe
those old wives' tales?

276
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,721
Yes, and more.

277
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,758
Walter, what a challenge
when you're young.

278
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:26,316
What better thing can a man
ask of life than that?

279
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,598
I don't know...

280
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,363
but it's a- it's
a soft blow to strike.

281
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,735
If I'm gonna leave
him here alone, l-

282
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:40,104
I want to strike
a better blow than that.

283
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,479
Let him go.
He has been hurt.

284
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:49,415
He'll think better
after he has slept.

285
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,311
<i>[Clattering]</i>

286
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,262
You! What are you
doing down there?

287
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:30,891
- What do you want here?
- Who are you?

288
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,122
- It's the grandson of the old lord.
- Nobility then. I don't like it.

289
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,494
Tris. Tris Griffen. You're no thief.
What are you doing here?

290
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,235
- Go on. Let him up.
- But he's Saxon.

291
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:48,767
Tris, we've played
too often on these walls.

292
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:52,108
I know you and- and you, Dicken.
You're not thieves.

293
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,047
- What are you doing here?
- Well, it's bad enough.

294
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:58,142
We had no trouble with Bulaire castle
while your father was alive.

295
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:02,315
But now the Norman woman has thrown
a dozen Saxons in her dungeons as hostages.

296
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,156
- Yes, I saw them.
- Well, we're gonna get them out.

297
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,752
Out of Bulaire? How?

298
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,128
Well, don't think too little
of the strength of this.

299
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,133
She has a beautiful
long arm.

300
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,692
Oh, but not against
stone walls, Tris.

301
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,601
I told you
he'd be on their side.

302
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,106
Who said I was on
Norman side in anything?

303
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:24,168
- Who's your leader?
- Well, I am, in a manner of speaking.

304
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,645
- Well, we all are.
- Well, you-

305
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,309
You might stand a chance
if you could get inside the gate.

306
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,545
What's your plan?

307
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,179
Well, that's the hard part,
the thinking.

308
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:38,021
- Well, maybe I can get you in.
- Look, this isn't your quarrel, Walter.

309
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:40,926
Give me a few men. I may be able
to get them in the miller's gate.

310
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,792
I know the signal.

311
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,890
If we can get the drawbridge down
from the inside, you might stand a chance.

312
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:51,530
If we can't, you're still on the outside safe,
to hunt me down if I've betrayed you.

313
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:55,337
All right, you can go with us.
Come on. Get your weapons.

314
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,734
What do you want?

315
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:09,343
[Whispering]

316
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,894
Who are you?

317
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:33,541
- Our luck's too good.
- It's probably yours.

318
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,977
Who are you,
out there?

319
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,018
Stay where you are!

320
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:22,045
Any man coming out of that door
will meet a shaft coming in.

321
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,182
<i>Like this.</i>

322
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,953
The rest of you in there,
throw out your arms one at a time.

323
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:40,532
You down there,
whoever you are.

324
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,269
I must ask you
to disperse...

325
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:45,039
and if you have a grievance,
to submit it in the proper fashion.

326
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:47,172
[Tris]
We'll present it now.

327
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,614
We'll give you five minutes
to yield the prisoners.

328
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:53,176
For every minute more, we'll hang a man
of the household from the battlements.

329
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,547
Wait there.

330
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:00,957
Well, that's the end
of your problem.

331
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,726
His new Norman master
has no belly for fighting.

332
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,563
I'll go see about
my problem now.

333
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,042
The prisoners
will be set free.

334
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,601
[Cheering]

335
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,705
Who you are,
I have no means of knowing...

336
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:22,875
but I beg of you
to receive them quietly...

337
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,943
and go to your homes before
deadly harm comes of this night's work.

338
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,858
Oh, I say.
We can't go without young Gurnie.

339
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:02,953
<i>- [Banging]</i>
<i>- [Man Shouting]</i>

340
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,924
Stop where you are!

341
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,214
You'll pay for this,
Walter of Gurnie...

342
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,590
and you,
Tris Griffen!

343
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,856
[Walter]
Well, we can't stay here.

344
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,662
They'll hunt us
early in the morning.

345
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:50,135
I know this forest
better than they do.

346
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,933
They'll hold your family
to bring you out.

347
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,839
There's nobody
but Sarah.

348
00:27:54,909 --> 00:28:00,313
You're lucky.
I have my grandfather to tell, and tonight.

349
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:03,509
Why did you want the boots
so much, Walter?

350
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:09,252
Well, they were all I had on the side
of sayin' my father loved me...

351
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,291
when all the world
said he didn't.

352
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:17,392
Well, if they- if they fit,
they'll keep my feet warm.

353
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,542
It's a letter,
Tris, from my father.

354
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,405
He did care.

355
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:37,607
Listen.

356
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:43,146
"Written at Bulaire by candlelight
with the hand of Simeon Bautrie to help.

357
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:47,058
"To my son Walter:

358
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,358
"I have left a legacy
in gold for you...

359
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,695
"with Joseph at the sign
of the merry-totter in London.

360
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:57,534
<i>"I could not leave this openly because</i>
<i>to do so might do you hurt.</i>

361
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:01,905
"And in the matter of bidding you
to the service of the king...

362
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:05,412
"that was done in the hope that in
helping him to serve this torn England...

363
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,042
"you could earn for yourself
the honorable name I could not give you.

364
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,177
<i>"God bring you</i>

365
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:17,850
"and I regret to my heart
all unhappiness I have brought you.

366
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,622
Your affectionate father,
Rauf of Bulaire."

367
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:24,221
I'm glad we got the boots.

368
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:30,131
<i>Tell my grandfather if they find me here,</i>
<i>Gurnie will suffer for it!</i>

369
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:34,868
Ask my grandson when it was the part of
Gurnie men to run from Norman trouble.

370
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,400
Tell my grandfather, please,
Wilderkin, that we've no choice.

371
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,743
They've won.
The-The Normans have won.

372
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:44,080
Bulaire is theirs and-
and Gurnie soon will be.

373
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,620
It's their England now,
not ours!

374
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:50,282
And tell him that I'm not going
to stay in this Norman country.

375
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:52,417
- Master Walter says that he has-
- Ask my grandson...

376
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,620
where he hopes to find a land
where he can live with himself...

377
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,754
when he knows he's run away
from his obligations.

378
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:59,664
Tell my grandfather
that I'll find it...

379
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,479
and the farther away
from this land the better.

380
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,411
And the farther away
from this land the better.

381
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,471
That-
Cathay, perhaps.

382
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:08,985
Tell him if I can get my hands on enough gold
to buy the lands that Gurnie needs...

383
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:11,146
then maybe
I'll come back.

384
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:14,282
But until that time,
they can have their England.

385
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:17,327
I'll not set foot
on Norman soil.

386
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:22,832
Our guests, Wilderkin,
have a long road before them.

387
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,960
- See that they have what
they need for their journey.
- Yes, my lord.

388
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:44,750
Come on.
The sun will soon be up.

389
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:47,347
Yes, the Bulaire hounds
will run with the first light.

390
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:53,327
Master Walter, he said you were
to have all the things you needed.

391
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:57,731
And... he said you were
to have this standing cup.

392
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:59,895
It has some value.
It is the last.

393
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,165
Oh, tell him
to keep it.

394
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,639
Maybe I'll fill it
with gold for him someday.

395
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:09,370
Thank you, Wilderkin,
for everything.

396
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,007
Good luck,
Master Walter.

397
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:22,456
Well, that's the end
of something...

398
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:25,461
or the beginning of something,
I don't know.

399
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,260
- I hope you sleep well in your forest.
- Walter, I've been thinking.

400
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,326
- What?
- I was thinking about going with you.

401
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:37,033
- To Cathay?
- Well, where's that?

402
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,099
Well, it's a long way
from your forest.

403
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:42,270
Well, maybe Sarah would
like it there.

404
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:44,280
Now, don't talk
too lightly about it, Tris.

405
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:47,840
If we should go to such a place,
the chances are all you'll get out of it...

406
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:50,944
is that in the end you'll be hung
by a Mongol instead of a Norman.

407
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:55,117
Well, if it comes to that, I'd sooner give
the pleasure to somebody I don't know than-

408
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:58,127
than a Norman I hate.

409
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:01,756
A far land it is then.
I guess this is the beginning.

410
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:32,955
[Chattering]

411
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,890
- Well, that's the best.
- So far.

412
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:10,699
Now, what heathen-

413
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:12,292
Easy.

414
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:15,270
Crusades have given these people
reason enough not to love Christians.

415
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:17,273
Besides, we're not
looking for trouble.

416
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:20,572
We're looking for the biggest merchant with
the biggest caravan to the farthest places.

417
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:23,010
He'll likely be
the biggest pirate too.

418
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:27,745
- Good day.
- [Speaking Foreign Language]

419
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:32,346
- Are you master of this house?
- No. The master of this house...

420
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:36,951
is the amiable, gracious
and kindly Anthemus of Antioch...

421
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:39,621
who I serve
the best I can.

422
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:42,689
Will you tell him two travelers
of importance are here to see him?

423
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:46,964
My kindly master concern himself
with only the greatest matters.

424
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,971
Perhaps his servant could-

425
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,236
Look, we've come a long way
to see your master himself.

426
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:57,144
It will be difficult.
I don't want to disturb him without a reason.

427
00:33:57,214 --> 00:33:59,341
<i>The risk is too great.</i>

428
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:11,284
I suppose the risk
seems less now, hmm?

429
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:13,796
I will see my kindly master.

430
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:23,563
Good day.

431
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:27,376
You do not look important to me.

432
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:31,005
I warn you that every minute
of my day must show me a profit.

433
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:34,949
Well, all we wanted to say, sir, is that we
desire passage with a caravan to the East.

434
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:37,647
- To what part?
- It's of no matter, sir.

435
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:41,088
<i>- To Cathay perhaps.</i>
- Well, I have a caravan...

436
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:43,922
which will go near enough
to, uh, Cathay.

437
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,588
It is a caravan of gifts...

438
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,598
I'm sending to Kublai Khan.

439
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,827
We understand that
small caravans...

440
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:52,994
too often disappear
in the wild country they pass through.

441
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,630
Small?
What are you talking about?

442
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:58,766
<i>When you send presents</i>
<i>to the great Khan...</i>

443
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:01,936
<i>he demands nine times nine</i>
<i>of everything-</i>

444
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:04,981
<i>silks, jewels, women.</i>

445
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:08,507
I had to find 81 of the most
beautiful women of this land.

446
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,511
<i>And because it is</i>
<i>all for the Khan...</i>

447
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:17,959
it will travel under the protection of the army
of the great General Bayan himself.

448
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,758
<i>Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.</i>

449
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,664
<i>Does that sound</i>
<i>safe enough for you?</i>

450
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,827
A caravan of nothing but gifts.
It's strange. L-

451
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:28,565
It isn't
strange at all.

452
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,732
You see, the Khan begins
his war against China-

453
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:32,742
Cathay, as you call it.

454
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,907
<i>He will have the spoils of the oldest</i>
<i>and richest country in the world.</i>

455
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:40,177
I will be his friend.

456
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,017
I will help him to, uh,
dispose of the wealth of ages.

457
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:48,923
<i>I will be the richest</i>
<i>merchant in the world.</i>

458
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:52,451
Well, young travelers,
are you prepared to, uh, pay well...

459
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,497
to travel in such company?

460
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:58,331
Well, we thought we might put ourselves
to hire as guards for such a caravan.

461
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:01,235
Christian guards.
It would invite attack.

462
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,603
<i>Is that the best you can offer?</i>

463
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:07,701
You've wasted my time.
I warned you. Search them!

464
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:12,010
If there is nothing of value, cut off
their hair to make a pillow for my feet.

465
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,346
<i>I will have something</i>
<i>for my trouble.</i>

466
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:16,352
I have already
made such a search.

467
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,354
There was only
this of value.

468
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,356
I kept it
for just such a moment.

469
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:27,520
It's not much profit,
but it is enough to save my honor.

470
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,862
- Throw them out.
- Oh, yes, sir.

471
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,367
This way.

472
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,210
What did you do that for?
Why did you lie to him?

473
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:53,416
Sometimes they call me
"the bird who feathers his nest"...

474
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,254
because they say that
I steal from everyone.

475
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:58,317
<i>It is not true, of course.</i>

476
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:03,492
But let us say that I'm in a position to take
a smaller profit than my kindly master.

477
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:07,503
<i>I go with the caravan.</i>
<i>I'm in charge of it.</i>

478
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,903
Perhaps I will take you.

479
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:13,067
<i>It will cost me nothing</i>
<i>to provide you with equipment.</i>

480
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:17,273
It will be his.
How much gold do you have?

481
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,508
There isn't much left...

482
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,677
and you're not exactly giving us
good reason to trust you with what there is.

483
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:25,916
Who is this Bayan general,
the one with all the eyes?

484
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:30,221
Oh, he's the greatest
soldier in the world.

485
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:35,789
The great Khan borrowed him
from Persia for his war against China.

486
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:38,494
He will conquer
the world one day.

487
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,366
And, uh,
where is he camped now?

488
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,928
Three days from here
with his army.

489
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:48,807
I wouldn't consider offering
your services to Bayan.

490
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:52,280
His men are trained
to love killing.

491
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,513
They would enjoy cutting
a Christian's throat.

492
00:37:56,587 --> 00:38:02,184
I'm afraid you have no choice
but to... deal with me.

493
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,318
How much gold have you?

494
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,626
<i>What kind of a country</i>
<i>is this?</i>

495
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:21,202
- Good.
- How soon can we get started?

496
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:24,714
Two dawns from now.
You're lucky you found me.

497
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,487
[Chattering]

498
00:38:56,847 --> 00:39:01,477
These, by the reason
of the great kindness of my heart...

499
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:05,079
they're for you
for the journey.

500
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:09,251
This one they call her "the singer"
because she makes horrible noise all the time.

501
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:14,127
<i>The other will bite you</i>
<i>whenever she cannot kick you.</i>

502
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:17,031
You'll have to find a place
to sleep in your tent...

503
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,091
<i>where it doesn't leak.</i>

504
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:21,763
But I think it's
good enough for Christians.

505
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:23,738
<i>The servant is good.</i>

506
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:26,071
<i>He will steal</i>
<i>everything for you.</i>

507
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,805
- Mahmoud, sir.
- That's all.

508
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:31,074
Good day,
young sirs.

509
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:37,251
I'll toss you whether
you get sung to or bitten.

510
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:41,620
- Wet or dry?
- Wet.

511
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:44,320
It's dry.

512
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:29,494
Mahmoud, I don't know why
they didn't build me to fit a camel better...

513
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,632
or build a camel
to fit me better.

514
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:37,707
Well, I found out some of it
from our nest-feathering friend.

515
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:40,341
That mighty general is camped
right over that hill with his army.

516
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,749
We're camped here
so that wild crew of his...

517
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,151
doesn't get a look at
the women we brought with us.

518
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,782
We're not traveling today
because he's holding games...

519
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:50,156
some sort of tournament
on the plain.

520
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:53,890
And I also found out another thing-
why they call him Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.

521
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,797
- Thought maybe he had that many.
- No, they say he can see everything.

522
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,428
Tomorrow he'll know how
every man performs in the games.

523
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:03,996
- There'll be all kinds- horsemanship, archery, all-
- Archery?

524
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:07,669
- Oh, that interests you, huh?
- Yes, it's a little cold for fine work...

525
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:09,678
though the light
should be good.

526
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,078
- What are their bows like, do you think?
- Bone and steel.

527
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:14,743
- The finest in the world.
- Ah, wait till they hear Sarah talk.

528
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:17,378
But they won't,
my impulsive friend.

529
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:19,684
The last thing we want
to do is to attract attention...

530
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,690
so you leave Sarah
right where she is.

531
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:24,158
It wouldn't hurt
just to take her along.

532
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:27,685
- Well, you won't take her off your shoulder.
- She wouldn't make any trouble.

533
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:30,665
I'd feel surer about that
if her name wasn't Sarah.

534
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:38,766
<i>[Clamoring]</i>

535
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:51,816
That's an English banner.

536
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:53,856
Probably a crusader's
that he killed.

537
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,320
The infidel swine!

538
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,474
- What's that about?
- He's the camel driver...

539
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:14,601
who came too close to
the women's tent yesterday.

540
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,473
[Groans]

541
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:24,145
[Screaming]

542
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:34,060
## [Chanting]

543
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:54,573
[Cheering]

544
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:50,637
<i>[Crowd Oohs]</i>

545
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,404
Child's play.

546
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:02,373
<i>- [Arrows Shooting]</i>
- Child's play, hmm?

547
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:04,815
At that range,
I could toss an arrow in the mark.

548
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:10,885
Somebody ought to show them
what an English bow can do.

549
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:14,383
Tris!

550
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,531
[Clamoring]

551
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,103
Get over there and see if
you can find out what's happening.

552
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,589
He says that master
is to compete...

553
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:56,260
but if he does not make good,
the bow is to be broken over his head.

554
00:44:56,336 --> 00:45:00,272
He means that if master fails,
they are to beat out his brains.

555
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,367
- Who is he?
- That, master, is Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.

556
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:07,675
- Does he know what'll happen to him if he fails?
- I do not think so.

557
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:11,742
Well, I guess you're right.
Look at him.

558
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:15,049
All he knows is
that he's out with Sarah.

559
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,214
What were they
talking about?

560
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,349
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
The bow, that's all.

561
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,192
Well, go ahead,
my friend.

562
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,996
- Remember the wind, Tris.
- Walt, I was weaned on remembering the wind.

563
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:31,536
Sarah herself would remember it
if I forgot.

564
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,167
Good enough.

565
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:52,022
Well, that's enough
of children's games.

566
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:54,218
Now give us
a little room to shoot.

567
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:00,430
Tris!

568
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,992
If we're gonna show them something,
let's show them something good.

569
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,409
<i>Tris! Don't be a fool.</i>
<i>That's far enough.</i>

570
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,208
No, a little further.
I want to make him refuse to try it.

571
00:46:28,294 --> 00:46:31,525
Now, my heathen friend,
would you like to try first?

572
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,436
- [Spits]
- I thought as much.

573
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,699
Tris! Not even a miracle
can make that shot.

574
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:43,037
Well, if I miss this,
I'll have missed a hard one.

575
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:08,264
[Cheering]

576
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,863
- You did it!
- Yes, but it was luck.

577
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:13,929
I moved too far back.
I don't know why.

578
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:16,475
I think it was Sarah
trying to show off.

579
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,375
- Well, if you'd have missed,
we'd be very dead by now.
- What?

580
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:22,573
Yes. His orders,
Bayan himself.

581
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,846
Well, why didn't you tell me?
No, I'm glad you didn't.

582
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:28,182
[Laughs]
Sarah.

583
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:31,189
Bayan wishes
to see you, master.

584
00:47:31,257 --> 00:47:34,693
- Now?
- At once. Be very careful what you say.

585
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:38,094
You let me do the talking. This may be
the chance we've been waiting for.

586
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,670
- My lord-
- That shot of yours, how much luck was there?

587
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,802
- I want the truth.
- There was a certain amount of luck in it, my lord.

588
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:55,439
- How often can you make the same shot?
- Three out of five times.

589
00:47:55,515 --> 00:47:57,210
The bow can be
handled quickly?

590
00:47:57,283 --> 00:47:59,683
He's put three shafts in the air
before the first touches the ground.

591
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,481
I asked the bowman.
With accuracy?

592
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:03,988
I've seen him bring down
three ducks with four shafts.

593
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:07,458
It's light. Light and strong.
Comes from the wood or the way it's made?

594
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,495
From both, my lord.
From the yew, and from skill...

595
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:12,224
- in shaping the bow to take advantage of the grain.
- What's it called?

596
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:14,323
- It's called a longbow.
- He calls it Sarah, my lord.

597
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,335
- Sarah. That's a woman's name.
- Yes, my lord.

598
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,667
You'll have reason to love your Sarah
even more after today.

599
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:22,037
She... saved
your skull, you know.

600
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,475
- Yes, I've just been telling him about that, my lord.
- The shaft should pierce armor.

601
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:27,979
- Yes.
- You've seen it tried? You.

602
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:31,278
Steel-tipped, it will
pierce anything, my lord.

603
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,842
I think this is the finest
weapon in the world.

604
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,718
She can reach out that long arm
of hers and meet the enemy...

605
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,349
before he can get close enough
to strike a blow against her.

606
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,859
With her, an English yeoman
stands as tall as any man.

607
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:43,862
He's the greatest soldier
in the world.

608
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,694
I take it
you're English then?

609
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,064
Yes, my lord.

610
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:54,637
I've seen you English hacking away
at the Saracens in your crusades.

611
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:57,267
Each man his own fortress
in his great armor...

612
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,277
so weighed down
he can't move.

613
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:03,247
It's very stupid.
But this... is not so stupid.

614
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,284
We'll talk about it.
Do you play chess?

615
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:07,717
- Sorry, no.
- Oh, I do, my lord.

616
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:10,756
- How well?
- Well, four moves soundly.

617
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,485
Four sound moves is more
than any man in this army can do.

618
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,857
- We'll play in my tent tonight.
- With pleasure, my lord.

619
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:17,919
Oh, how do we
find your tent?

620
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,763
Scholar, if any man in my army
can't tell you where my tent is...

621
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,894
our poetic young bowman
can use him as a target.

622
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:37,509
Maybe your Sarah did us a good turn
after all. Come on. We'll take her home.

623
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,881
You can make up
a sonnet to her as we go.

624
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:42,614
- Oh, go swallow your tongue.
- Why, Tris!

625
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:50,218
Over there.

626
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:53,198
Let me see
that bow of yours.

627
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,962
You'll find
the game's ready.

628
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:59,004
I always, uh,
make the first move.

629
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,335
About this, uh-
this bow of yours.

630
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,075
- Could you make another one like it?
<i>- If I had the wood.</i>

631
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:13,607
A sound game. Thoughtful.
It lies in wait for the attack.

632
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:15,916
It won't win against
an attack, of course.

633
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:19,185
It's just the kind of game I want,
young scholar. Pawn to king's bishop four.

634
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:21,192
Play it.

635
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,093
- Can you train men in the use of such a bow?
- Yes, my lord.

636
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:26,097
Then the right wood
can be found.

637
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,099
Uh, as a scholar...

638
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:32,070
you permit no weakness
in the attack.

639
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:34,299
Good. As a scholar
you know something of your country's...

640
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:36,034
military theory
and practice.

641
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:38,099
I have a-

642
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:40,338
I have a certain knowledge
of those things, my lord.

643
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,506
War is my trade.

644
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,812
<i>At least I'm good enough to know</i>
<i>no war was ever won...</i>

645
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:47,114
<i>that was fought in the same way</i>
<i>as the war before it.</i>

646
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:50,280
Why, I've made a weapon of speed.
Speed.

647
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:53,382
<i>No man should wear armor so heavy</i>
<i>that he can't move quickly...</i>

648
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:55,927
to save himself or to pursue
his enemy and destroy him.

649
00:50:55,995 --> 00:50:59,328
That's why I like this bow of yours.
It's- It's light.

650
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:02,890
It can reach out to the enemy
and put an end to him.

651
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:05,267
That's the only way you can
ever sleep soundly, you know...

652
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,364
when your enemy's
sleep is eternal.

653
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,808
Forgive me for distracting you
from your game, but I'm curious.

654
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:14,506
Why are you young travelers
in this far place?

655
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,344
We came in search of
adventure into this new land.

656
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:20,544
We heard of the greatness of my lord Bayan
and came in search of him.

657
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,255
If that's flattery,
I don't like it.

658
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:27,156
We had to find someplace
to put our lives.

659
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:29,717
Don't you plan to return
to your own country?

660
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,093
We have no country, my lord.

661
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:34,928
That's a strange thing
for an Englishman to say.

662
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,094
Why? A woman?

663
00:51:38,671 --> 00:51:41,196
- No, more than that.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

664
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:43,708
Bowman and scholar,
both without a country.

665
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:46,244
It's just possible you two
could be of service to me.

666
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,371
I'll think about it.

667
00:51:50,616 --> 00:51:52,550
It's your move.

668
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:12,170
[Foreign Language]

669
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:14,433
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

670
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,441
It is bad, very bad.

671
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,001
- What is?
- This old tent...

672
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,946
these old blankets
and one little servant.

673
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,576
<i>Steal food, cook-</i>
<i>it's too much.</i>

674
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:28,984
- You need second boy.
- How do we get him...

675
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,920
by the great
kindness of your heart?

676
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,117
Maybe I get him for you.

677
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,286
Maybe some dislike Christians.
I do not.

678
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,796
All right, out with it.
What are you trying to say?

679
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:44,131
Never talk important matters
where you cannot see who listens.

680
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:04,579
I have a message for you,
from the Black Rose.

681
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:06,591
And who would
the Black Rose be?

682
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,786
She is the sister
of my kindly master.

683
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:11,694
- Well, that's fine.
- She wishes to escape.

684
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:13,698
She say she is
going to England...

685
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:16,200
and that all
Englishmen are gallant...

686
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:18,828
and you will be glad to help
one of your own blood.

687
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,896
- Are you trying to say that she's English?
- There is some report...

688
00:53:21,974 --> 00:53:25,432
that her father was English,
a crusader taken prisoner.

689
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:28,480
- Well, why is she called the Black Rose?
- That's the name...

690
00:53:28,547 --> 00:53:33,075
they've given the clove,
the most precious of the spices.

691
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:37,680
I don't like it, a girl of English blood
being sent to these heathen.

692
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:41,921
- Oh, we don't know she's English.
- She has relatives in Maratha.

693
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:44,394
The only thing she needs
is to reach them.

694
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:47,296
I see. And what are you
doing this for?

695
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:50,893
I'm not troubled that
the lady's in distress.

696
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,962
She has
a very large sapphire.

697
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,406
What does she expect us to do
in the middle of Bayan's army?

698
00:53:56,475 --> 00:54:00,809
The bird who feathers his nest
never leaves things to chance.

699
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,182
I have a very well-made plan in which
I will do all that's dangerous, if you're afraid.

700
00:54:06,252 --> 00:54:08,482
Afraid? We'd do more for
English blood any day...

701
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,488
than you'd do for
an overgrown sapphire.

702
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:15,323
Oh, that's good.
I'll tell that to the Black Rose.

703
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:33,539
Master, the strange one's
here again.

704
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,546
Oh?

705
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:41,811
This is
your second boy.

706
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:44,515
- His name is Mahomet.
- Well, you can take him back.

707
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,218
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Very strange.

708
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:50,990
Last night, the camels
run through the tents of the women.

709
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:54,760
They have to take a time for the search.
The Black Rose is missing.

710
00:55:04,203 --> 00:55:06,797
Go on. Get her out of here.
They'll find her when they search...

711
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:10,205
and they'll drag us over the hill like
they did that camel driver the other day.

712
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:14,769
- Go on, Mahmoud. Go on. Back to your work.
- Yes, master.

713
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:20,308
I'm no fool. Yesterday, I bought
a slave boy for the Englishman.

714
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,615
That boy disappeared...

715
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,020
and everybody thinks
this is the boy.

716
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,853
<i>And I did something else.</i>

717
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:30,486
One of the camels
that run away was saddled.

718
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:33,656
When they find that camel,
they will believe...

719
00:55:33,732 --> 00:55:36,997
the Black Rose
tried to escape on it and was hurt.

720
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:39,867
- It's very simple.
- Well, get her out of here!

721
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:43,374
Perhaps I will call out
that I've found her here now.

722
00:55:43,442 --> 00:55:46,138
<i>No one would believe</i>
<i>your story.</i>

723
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:50,841
<i>Perhaps you would like</i>
<i>being staked out for vultures.</i>

724
00:55:53,385 --> 00:55:57,412
- Well, I found the camels.
- And we have a new second boy too.

725
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,323
He's all yours, Tris.
He has beautiful, big eyes.

726
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:09,030
Very simple, young sirs.
She will do whatever you tell her to do.

727
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:11,194
You understand that?

728
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,262
You know what'll happen to all of us
unless you do exactly as you're told?

729
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,534
Oh, yes, most kind grandeur.

730
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:21,375
Oh. Oh, where did-
Never mind. Mahmoud!

731
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:24,438
- I wish to say that I am very grateful.
- Yes, I know all about that.

732
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:26,507
This new second boy
will stay here to help you...

733
00:56:26,585 --> 00:56:28,746
but you'll still be first boy,
you understand?

734
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,721
Master, we don't need second boy.
This boy no good.

735
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,985
- I can do everything.
- You'll do as you're told.

736
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:37,051
Get him out of here.
Get him some breakfast, and put him to work.

737
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:39,757
Yes, master.
Second boy will eat when I'm through.

738
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:41,560
<i>Now, go!</i>

739
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:48,899
Oh, it's not gonna work.
What are we gonna do now?

740
00:56:50,442 --> 00:56:53,206
I guess the only thing to do
is just to sit here...

741
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:55,212
and wait for
the ax to fall.

742
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,716
<i>- [Hoofbeats]</i>
<i>- [Shouting, Whooping]</i>

743
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:07,758
Well, the old pirate's right
after all.

744
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:10,590
And there's that
saddled camel.

745
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:22,605
<i>He's the offspring</i>
<i>of a sore-eyed camel driver!</i>

746
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:25,507
<i>- He wanted to beat me!</i>
- Quiet! Get her into the tent.

747
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:30,771
- Do you know who she is?
- Mahmoud has struck a great lady.

748
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,942
- Mahmoud should be whipped.
- Never mind about that!

749
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:35,612
Do you know we'll all be killed
if anybody finds out she's here?

750
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:38,019
I will tell no one.
Mahmoud would die first.

751
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,116
I want you to get into that tent and pretend
as though nothing had happened.

752
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:47,962
- Can we trust him?
- We'll either trust him or slit his throat.

753
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,967
- I am glad he knows.
- Why?

754
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,560
Because now there is
no more need of pretending...

755
00:57:52,638 --> 00:57:56,039
and I can be in the tent with you
the way that it was meant to be.

756
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:58,303
- Now, look, Mahomet-
- I suppose he told you...

757
00:57:58,377 --> 00:58:00,845
that I am English and that
I am to go to England.

758
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:04,313
- Yes, we know that.
- There is so much I must know about England...

759
00:58:04,383 --> 00:58:06,715
if I am to go
to live there.

760
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:10,915
Do you think they would like me?
What is it like there?

761
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,356
Are all the people
as beautiful as you are?

762
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,655
Ask him.
He's the beautiful one.

763
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:21,722
Oh, no! I think you are
much more beautiful than he is.

764
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,064
<i>You look just</i>
<i>as I've always known-</i>

765
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:26,934
Mahomet, there's no time for talking.
This is very serious for all of us.

766
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:29,132
Put that turban back on,
button yourself up...

767
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:31,141
and get ready to play
second boy again, understand?

768
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,143
- Yes, but l-
- I don't wanna talk about it.

769
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:35,145
<i>- Just do as I say, and quickly too.</i>
- Yes, most kind, but-

770
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:37,272
All right, then do it!

771
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:57,818
I never saw anyone look less like
young gallants going off on a great adventure.

772
00:59:57,896 --> 01:00:01,423
- How does the lady feel about it?
- The lady, my lord?

773
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,333
Hmm. What's her name?
Sarah?

774
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:08,169
Oh. I think she'll like
what lies ahead, my lord.

775
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,142
We're making some kinsmen for your Sarah
so she won't be lonely.

776
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,735
I've given orders to find
that wood of yours, bowman.

777
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:16,906
There's something to
interest you, young scholar.

778
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:19,314
With that
direction-finding chariot...

779
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,443
<i>we can strike straight through</i>
<i>any storm without getting lost.</i>

780
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,182
<i>We can leave the trade route</i>
<i>and travel across country.</i>

781
01:00:24,256 --> 01:00:26,190
- Was that made in China?
- Mmm.

782
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:28,852
- Well, how does it work?
- Inside, there's a box.

783
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:30,986
In the box there's a needle that points
always in the same direction.

784
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,462
What makes the needle
behave in such a manner?

785
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:35,762
Well, if you don't know, scholar,
I won't worry about it.

786
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,302
I need the time to make war.
Look.

787
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,534
- There's India. We'll conquer that someday.
- India?

788
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:45,041
We're done with China,
we'll have to conquer something.

789
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:49,012
<i>No doubt your scholar's mind</i>
<i>inquires into a plan for India.</i>

790
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,344
But China first!

791
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:20,104
<i>[Animal Howling]</i>

792
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,841
It looks like they believed
his trick with the camel.

793
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,942
The men they left to search
have joined us here.

794
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:32,217
There doesn't seem to be any sign
of a search of the camp. Where is she?

795
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:35,987
In there, out of sight.

796
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:43,193
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking this ugly stain off my face.

797
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:45,736
- Put it right back on again.
- No. It's very ugly.

798
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:49,706
And I mustn't be ugly
when I eat here in the tent with you.

799
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:54,040
- Mahomet-
- Maryam. There.

800
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:57,104
- Where did you get that?
- I needed it.

801
01:01:57,182 --> 01:02:00,242
And I got some clothes too
to wear when I eat here.

802
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:03,677
Mahmoud!

803
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,016
- Yes, master.
- Mahmoud, did you steal these things?

804
01:02:08,093 --> 01:02:10,027
Mahmoud see, Mahmoud take.

805
01:02:10,095 --> 01:02:12,359
Suppose they searched this camp?
There's to be no more stealing.

806
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,898
All the women steal
from each other.

807
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:17,366
- There's to be no more stealing.
- But if great lady wishes-

808
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:20,404
You'll do as I say no matter
what great lady wishes.

809
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:23,238
<i>- Maryam, I want you to put</i>
<i>that stain back on your face.</i>
- No.

810
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,272
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean no!

811
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,832
<i>There is no danger.</i>

812
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,970
If they were going to search the camp,
they would have done this by now.

813
01:02:32,046 --> 01:02:35,982
And no one will come near our tent
because we are Christians.

814
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,110
Everything is happening
the way it said in the miracle...

815
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:44,056
only I must take the stain off my face
so the rest of the miracle can happen.

816
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,355
Miracle? What miracle?

817
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:49,658
I've been very ashamed because
I almost stopped believing in it...

818
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:52,825
when I found out
I was going to be sent to the Khan.

819
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:56,200
But when I saw you, I knew
it must have been working all the time.

820
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:59,468
Uh, Maryam, I've never been
part of a miracle before...

821
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,406
so I don't know much
about it.

822
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,877
But what makes you think a miracle is
telling you to take that stain off your face?

823
01:03:04,946 --> 01:03:10,077
I've known about it ever since
I was a little girl. My father told me.

824
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:12,483
I wanted very much
to go to England...

825
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:15,250
because I thought
how wonderful it must be in a country...

826
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:18,918
where all the people were like him-
gentle and very tall and beautiful.

827
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:23,157
<i>He wanted to take me there,</i>
<i>but he couldn't because he was a prisoner.</i>

828
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:28,396
So he said that we should have
to ask God to help me.

829
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:32,269
And maybe if we believed very hard,
there would be a miracle.

830
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,332
Oh, I like the God that
would do miracles like that.

831
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,345
So I believed very hard.

832
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:42,247
My father gave me this before they
killed him to help me with the miracle.

833
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:46,348
He said that someday,
a tall, beautiful Englishman...

834
01:03:46,421 --> 01:03:48,355
would come riding
over a hill...

835
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:51,051
and would think that I was very beautiful,
so he would help me.

836
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:54,788
<i>So when I saw you, I knew</i>
<i>God sent you to be part of the miracle.</i>

837
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:58,593
Only how are you to see
that I am beautiful...

838
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:00,793
if I've got
that ugly stain on the face?

839
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:04,538
That's very nice, Maryam,
and l-

840
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:07,006
I wish it was a miracle,
because that's just what we need.

841
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:10,067
But I'm afraid we can't count on it
because miracles just don't happen like that.

842
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,305
Oh, but it has happened.

843
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,406
Tall, young Englishmen
do not ride across this country.

844
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:19,146
But you were here just when
the miracle needed you.

845
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,316
So I know the rest of it will happen
just the way my father said the miracle.

846
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,758
Well, miracle or no miracle,
I'm not gonna get us hanged.

847
01:04:26,828 --> 01:04:30,059
Now, unless you do as I say, I'm gonna
send you back to the women's tent.

848
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:33,760
No. We'll do
just as the miracle said...

849
01:04:33,835 --> 01:04:37,100
or- or I will tell them
I'm here.

850
01:04:37,171 --> 01:04:40,197
All they will do to me is send me back
with the other women.

851
01:04:40,274 --> 01:04:42,742
But they won't be so kind
with you, I think.

852
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:50,307
Now I think you will look
to see if you think I am beautiful.

853
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:56,350
All right, all right.
You're beautiful.

854
01:04:56,424 --> 01:05:00,485
Now I think you will help me
to take this ugly stain where I cannot see?

855
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:48,334
<i>Don't tell me you've never</i>
<i>seen men hanged before.</i>

856
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,640
- What did they do, my lord?
- See that pass there?

857
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,876
<i>We ride through there today. We could</i>
<i>fight our way through, but we haven't time.</i>

858
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,917
So this is a warning.
If there's trouble...

859
01:05:56,984 --> 01:05:59,578
I have twice as many
of these fellows as prisoners.

860
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:01,212
<i>- I'll hang them too.</i>
- I see.

861
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:04,053
You see,
but you don't like it, do you?

862
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,650
I forget your
English gallantry in war.

863
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:10,596
I suppose different people
believe in different things, my lord.

864
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:13,657
Well, not such foolish things,
Englishman.

865
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:17,728
No. What I can't touch
doesn't exist.

866
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,503
You conquer,
or somebody conquers you.

867
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:26,411
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

868
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:28,415
I thank you for
reminding me, my lord.

869
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:31,350
I like you, scholar.

870
01:06:31,419 --> 01:06:34,047
I like the way you speak your mind.
I must reward you.

871
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,037
You do not feel like talking,
Walter?

872
01:06:51,105 --> 01:06:53,039
No.

873
01:06:54,442 --> 01:06:57,240
That's too bad.

874
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:59,472
I hoped you would begin
telling me about England.

875
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:04,447
What is it like there?
Is it very beautiful?

876
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,580
- I don't know.
- Do you think it's beautiful, Tris?

877
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,887
Yes, I think
it's beautiful.

878
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:15,690
The most beautiful place
in the world.

879
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:18,493
It smells good.

880
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:22,263
The forest,
the English soil.

881
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:26,397
It's clean.
The rain washes it that way, I suppose.

882
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:29,932
It's so clean,
it's fragrant with it.

883
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:32,172
I think it's the most
beautiful country in the world.

884
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:37,012
Why, Tris!

885
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:40,781
Well, I wish I was there,
that's all.

886
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:43,517
Bayan was right about
that poet business.

887
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:45,957
And a homesick poet too.

888
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:49,121
Oh, it must be very beautiful
if he feels so about it.

889
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,858
He only remembers the good part.

890
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,765
I like him
for feeling like that.

891
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,962
Don't you ever feel
like that about it?

892
01:07:57,405 --> 01:08:01,398
That's the way
my father felt about it.

893
01:08:01,475 --> 01:08:05,809
Oh, I think you feel so too,
only you don't want to say so.

894
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,873
Tell her about
the Normans, Tris.

895
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:14,946
I don't like you
to feel like that, Walter.

896
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:19,721
I think to feel like that,
you must have loved it very much...

897
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:23,389
and- and been hurt...
by something.

898
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:30,831
- I don't like her.
- Who?

899
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,000
The girl in England
you loved that hurt you.

900
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:37,636
There wasn't any girl.

901
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:43,277
Oh, you'll be glad-

902
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,649
You'll be glad to go back
in England, won't you, Walter?

903
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,814
That's one thing I won't have to worry about.
I won't be going back.

904
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,983
But where will you go then?

905
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,492
You'd better ask
Bayan general about that.

906
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,826
I'll be with him, with the victor,
if our luck holds out.

907
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:03,330
- What's the matter, Mahomet?
- [Sniffling]

908
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:11,836
Mahomet, what's the matter?

909
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:17,775
It hurts to think of England
if you will not be there.

910
01:09:17,852 --> 01:09:19,786
It's not the way
the miracle said.

911
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:24,424
Oh, l-
I'm sorry, Maryam.

912
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:27,757
I forgot about that miracle.

913
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:29,796
But it'll be all right,
you know.

914
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:34,426
You'll find yourself a hill and another
Englishman to come riding over it.

915
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,437
He'll be a Norman probably,
but that won't make any difference.

916
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:41,168
We'll make as much of your miracle
come true as we can.

917
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:44,803
- It'll be all right.
- I wish you didn't feel so.

918
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,712
I will be Mahomet again
if it will make you feel not like that.

919
01:09:47,782 --> 01:09:49,716
I don't mind the stain.

920
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,718
It-

921
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,720
Well, why don't you
say something?

922
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:56,655
You're the one that started all this,
you and that poetry.

923
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:58,783
You're the one
that's in the miracle...

924
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:01,453
and you look
very beautiful there too.

925
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:35,856
We've come a long way
to see that, scholar.

926
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,660
Cathay.

927
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,997
There it lies.

928
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,201
Play the real game with me, scholar,
and the best game.

929
01:10:46,273 --> 01:10:49,538
<i>Play as you've never played.</i>
<i>Think. I have a new plan for war.</i>

930
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:53,046
Find a flaw in it if you can.
It's a plan for China.

931
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:57,710
Many men have tried to conquer China,
but she swallowed them all.

932
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,650
Strike a blow into
a great, soft pillow.

933
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,382
The pillow gives with the blow,
and the force is spent.

934
01:11:02,456 --> 01:11:05,186
You can't conquer
geography.

935
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:07,557
Occupy a country,
and what happens?

936
01:11:07,628 --> 01:11:10,722
Your soldiers become jailers, and you're
that much weaker. What do we do?

937
01:11:10,798 --> 01:11:12,789
<i>Think, scholar.</i>
<i>We don't occupy at all.</i>

938
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:16,496
We strike and strike on.
Destroy.

939
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,731
Strike at the very heart
of China- Kinsai.

940
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:21,206
Destroy the government.
Destroy the will to resist.

941
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:23,300
- But suppose they get behind you, my lord?
- Let them.

942
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:25,572
It's for that I have made
a new weapon of speed.

943
01:11:25,646 --> 01:11:27,580
- But your lines of supply-
- We won't use any.

944
01:11:27,648 --> 01:11:29,582
We'll live off the country.
Think deep, scholar.

945
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,710
There's supposed to be a weakness
in every plan. Find this one.

946
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:35,585
My lord has spoken often
about winning battles and losing wars.

947
01:11:35,656 --> 01:11:37,590
Even if you win,
each battle will weaken you.

948
01:11:37,658 --> 01:11:39,922
We'll only fight one battle here
when the Khan's army arrives.

949
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:42,724
Then we'll wait for the news
of our victory to spread.

950
01:11:42,797 --> 01:11:47,097
If we lose, well, we'll be
very little men as history is written.

951
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:50,103
But, scholar,
if we gain China...

952
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:52,105
gain its strength
and wisdom-

953
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:54,971
They have an iron tube there that shoots fire.
It's just a toy now...

954
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:59,206
but someday it may help us
to crumble the walls of Rome.

955
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,441
- Rome?
- Mmm.

956
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:04,279
- Rome is a long way, my lord.
- So is England.

957
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,013
Not too long. How would you like
to visit your island again, Englishman?

958
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:11,252
<i>This time as a conqueror to do</i>
<i>what you like with those that conquer you.</i>

959
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:15,387
Think deep, scholar.

960
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:18,523
We may win the greatest game
in the world.

961
01:12:24,918 --> 01:12:28,217
What's the matter, bowman?
Can't you sleep?

962
01:12:28,288 --> 01:12:31,189
I was thinking of-
Do you think he can do it?

963
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,028
I don't know.

964
01:12:35,095 --> 01:12:37,029
I think maybe he can.

965
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:40,225
I was thinking,
the way he talked...

966
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,430
maybe we were fighting
on the wrong side.

967
01:12:47,441 --> 01:12:50,467
- Tris?
- Yeah?

968
01:12:50,544 --> 01:12:53,206
- Do you wanna turn back?
- Well, what do you want to do?

969
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,511
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

970
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,143
I'm sick of lost causes.

971
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:02,780
If he conquers the world, at least
we'll be on the winning side for a change.

972
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:04,790
What's wrong with
going back with him?

973
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:08,726
It's the only way you'll ever see that England
of yours that smells so good to you.

974
01:13:08,796 --> 01:13:12,425
- Yes, I know.
- We'd better get some sleep, bowman.

975
01:13:29,516 --> 01:13:32,076
[Shouting, Whooping]

976
01:14:02,049 --> 01:14:05,041
Tris, you haven't got
yourself hurt, have you?

977
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:09,987
- No, I'm all right, I suppose.
- I saw you at the beginning.

978
01:14:10,057 --> 01:14:12,617
You and your bowmen
against those fire tubes.

979
01:14:12,693 --> 01:14:14,991
They sounded like
the anger of God.

980
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:17,053
I think perhaps
they were.

981
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,089
They're killing every man,
woman and child in the district.

982
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:23,329
Like harvesters going
through a field of grain.

983
01:14:23,403 --> 01:14:26,167
They'd pull their heads forward
by the hair for the ax.

984
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,677
Not one left alive,
like harvesters cutting wheat.

985
01:14:30,744 --> 01:14:33,941
<i>What's the matter, Englishman?</i>

986
01:14:35,182 --> 01:14:37,912
We won today.

987
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:39,919
But you have no joy in the victory.
Why?

988
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:42,114
<i>It's the business of battle.</i>

989
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:45,989
It's very simple.
Kill the enemy.

990
01:14:46,059 --> 01:14:48,527
A soldier must like to kill.

991
01:14:48,595 --> 01:14:52,156
No man can follow me
who hasn't the belly for that.

992
01:14:52,232 --> 01:14:55,463
Go back to your tent now
and think about it.

993
01:14:55,536 --> 01:14:58,801
Think hard.
You have a choice to make.

994
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:05,473
That's right. We'd better
go to our tents.

995
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:07,980
It was a victory,
wasn't it?

996
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:09,982
The bows did well.
The general was pleased.

997
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:13,315
Let's go to our tents
and think about it, Walter.

998
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:18,683
[Chattering, Shouting]

999
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:33,636
I was afraid for you.
I was very afraid for both of you.

1000
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:36,198
Nothing could happen
to us.

1001
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:38,710
It isn't the way it went
in the miracle, don't you remember?

1002
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:41,577
- I know, but-
- Isn't that so, Tris?

1003
01:15:41,648 --> 01:15:43,582
Yes, that's so.

1004
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,983
- I will be glad when-
- That's right, Maryam.

1005
01:15:47,054 --> 01:15:48,988
You mustn't forget
the miracle.

1006
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:51,923
A tall, young Englishman
came riding over a hill, didn't he?

1007
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:55,393
A knight.
A knight in shining armor.

1008
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:59,421
You should have seen him today, Maryam.
He looked almost like a knight.

1009
01:15:59,499 --> 01:16:02,935
<i>An English knight.</i>
<i>A sword and shining armor.</i>

1010
01:16:03,003 --> 01:16:06,939
You'd have been proud of him.
He looked more beautiful than ever.

1011
01:16:07,007 --> 01:16:10,670
Except those knightly vows. You didn't think
to say those over, did you, Walter?

1012
01:16:10,744 --> 01:16:13,611
- What's the matter with you?
- Your father would have been proud of you.

1013
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,046
Your grandfather too.
He was a credit to them.

1014
01:16:16,116 --> 01:16:19,779
The way you looked anyway.
Why don't you ever wear your father's boots?

1015
01:16:19,853 --> 01:16:22,344
You'd look well in them.
Where are they?

1016
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:24,754
I'll get them for you,
and you can put them on.

1017
01:16:24,825 --> 01:16:27,692
There was a letter too.
You'd better read it again. What did it say?

1018
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:30,855
- Something about honor.
- Tris!

1019
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:33,866
Keep your hands off-

1020
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,925
Tris!

1021
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:41,798
- Walt, I'm sorry. L-
- What's the matter with you?

1022
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,504
I don't know you anymore, quarreling,
short-tempered all the time.

1023
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:47,513
You're not the Tris
I used to know.

1024
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:49,606
- Let's get away from here, away from all-
- For what?

1025
01:16:49,683 --> 01:16:53,141
- I can't help them anymore.
- Well, if you don't like it,
you don't have to stay here.

1026
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:56,053
What do you want to do?
March with them on England?

1027
01:16:56,123 --> 01:16:58,057
I don't owe England anything.

1028
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,720
I think it's very foolish
to speak of that anymore.

1029
01:17:01,795 --> 01:17:03,592
I think you'd better
go back to England.

1030
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:07,327
<i>I don't think you have what he was</i>
<i>talking about- the belly for it.</i>

1031
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:11,132
- I think you're the one-
- No, I'm all right. I'll stay right here.

1032
01:17:11,204 --> 01:17:15,197
<i>If you don't want the same thing,</i>
<i>it's all right too. I'll help you get out of here.</i>

1033
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:19,177
And it all fits together nicely. You can take
her back with you wherever she wants to go.

1034
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:22,010
No. If you are going to stay here,
I will stay here too.

1035
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:24,812
That's very nice, Maryam,
but it just doesn't work that way.

1036
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,718
It's been all right up to here,
but it wouldn't be from now on.

1037
01:17:27,788 --> 01:17:31,519
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
- You can't just walk out of here without a plan.

1038
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:34,059
I'm gonna find out
how to get to China.

1039
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:41,958
What's the matter with him, Maryam?
What are we gonna do?

1040
01:17:42,035 --> 01:17:44,230
I don't know.

1041
01:17:44,304 --> 01:17:47,501
But he doesn't mean
everything he says.

1042
01:17:47,574 --> 01:17:51,908
I think he doesn't
really know what he wants.

1043
01:17:51,978 --> 01:17:55,209
But I don't know
what to do about it.

1044
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:57,409
<i>[Animal Howling]</i>

1045
01:18:03,724 --> 01:18:07,455
Well, you're leaving just in time.
I found out that much.

1046
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:11,861
We move again tomorrow.
Bayan's army turns south into China...

1047
01:18:11,932 --> 01:18:15,231
and the caravan of gifts
goes north to the Khan.

1048
01:18:15,302 --> 01:18:18,465
That means that from now on,
we camp right in the middle of the army...

1049
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:20,472
and you'd never have
a chance to get away.

1050
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:24,738
You'd better
try it tonight.

1051
01:18:24,811 --> 01:18:26,745
Yes, I guess
we'd better do that.

1052
01:18:26,813 --> 01:18:29,805
I'd head
straight south first.

1053
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:32,113
Then cut across
to Kinsai.

1054
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:34,244
From there,
the river runs to the sea...

1055
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:37,757
and you might stand a chance
of getting back that way.

1056
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:41,260
- Yes, we'd better do that too.
- Where's Maryam?

1057
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:44,697
In there.

1058
01:18:55,408 --> 01:18:59,504
We are going tonight, Walter.
I heard what you said to Tris.

1059
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:02,275
Yes.

1060
01:19:02,349 --> 01:19:04,874
You want to say
good-bye to me?

1061
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,454
Well, yes.

1062
01:19:08,522 --> 01:19:11,218
I'm glad it's hard
for you to say.

1063
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,363
Tris-Tris will take
good care of you, Maryam.

1064
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:20,763
You can depend on Tris.

1065
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:23,564
And l- I hope
you like England.

1066
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:30,800
He'll feel much happier
when he can smell it again.

1067
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:36,110
And, uh, tell him-
Oh, never mind.

1068
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:39,414
You know, Walter,
I can go or I can stay.

1069
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:42,319
Whatever you want.

1070
01:19:44,224 --> 01:19:48,251
No. No, you'll like
England better.

1071
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:59,837
I'll- I'll be up
with the column...

1072
01:19:59,906 --> 01:20:01,965
so they won't get suspicious
for some time.

1073
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,704
You'll need a good start.

1074
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:07,611
Well, it looks as though
it might be a nice day for a ride.

1075
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:10,844
I'll go and see
about the horses.

1076
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:50,989
So it was you, Englishman.
Was it your curiosity as a scholar?

1077
01:20:51,057 --> 01:20:55,016
<i>- Or did you know you were</i>
<i>steering us off our course?</i>
- I knew, my lord.

1078
01:20:55,095 --> 01:20:59,429
Why? You realize the penalty
for such a thing.

1079
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:03,367
Why take such a risk to do me an ill turn?
Why do me an ill turn at all?

1080
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,866
Move the column south and east
for as far as we've gone off the trail.

1081
01:21:09,943 --> 01:21:12,468
When we camp tonight,
bring him to my tent.

1082
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:23,679
Well, what's the matter?
We got away, didn't we?

1083
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:26,817
They can't track us
in the dark.

1084
01:21:26,893 --> 01:21:31,694
You've got a part of your miracle.
You're going to England.

1085
01:21:34,134 --> 01:21:37,433
I don't want
to go anymore there.

1086
01:21:37,504 --> 01:21:40,530
I know, Maryam.
I know.

1087
01:21:40,607 --> 01:21:44,634
So there was a woman in it.
I might have known.

1088
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:48,807
A woman and a bowman
who didn't like war.

1089
01:21:48,882 --> 01:21:51,749
Why take such a risk for the girl?
You must love her very much.

1090
01:21:51,818 --> 01:21:55,754
- No, my lord.
- The gallantry again.

1091
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,824
I didn't mean
to be gallant.

1092
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:01,725
If my lord Bayan hadn't been quite
so observant, I wouldn't be here now.

1093
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:04,730
Why didn't you come to me about her?
I would have given her to you.

1094
01:22:04,798 --> 01:22:07,790
- What's one woman more or less?
- It didn't occur to me, my lord.

1095
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:11,359
No, of course not.
It would have spoiled the gallantry.

1096
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:14,464
Well, it's worth something...

1097
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,874
to be willing to die
for something.

1098
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:22,677
There's a way you may have a chance for
your life. A few men have come through it.

1099
01:22:22,749 --> 01:22:27,049
I'll send you to the rope walk
in the morning. Good night, scholar.

1100
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,179
Good night, my lord.

1101
01:22:47,407 --> 01:22:50,103
Now, you understand,
Englishman.

1102
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:52,838
As long as your feet touch the rope,
no one can strike you...

1103
01:22:52,912 --> 01:22:55,039
except the two men
with the pig bladders.

1104
01:22:55,115 --> 01:22:57,811
They can hit only
below the line.

1105
01:22:57,884 --> 01:22:59,875
Now begin.

1106
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:14,526
[Chattering, Shouting]

1107
01:24:22,435 --> 01:24:26,030
Let him go!
Let him go!

1108
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:30,770
Take him to his tent.

1109
01:25:04,878 --> 01:25:09,144
You are very tough
for an Englishman.

1110
01:25:09,215 --> 01:25:11,046
<i>Come in.</i>

1111
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:23,295
Well, my lord, am I a-
a prisoner or what?

1112
01:25:23,363 --> 01:25:28,062
You paid for what you did.
Your back should tell you that.

1113
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:32,828
But... I'd like to be
doing something, my lord.

1114
01:25:32,906 --> 01:25:35,841
You miss the bowman,
don't you?

1115
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:41,677
I have a mission of some importance
for you when you're ready for it.

1116
01:25:41,748 --> 01:25:44,080
- I'll take it now, my lord.
- Hear it first, scholar.

1117
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,142
- You saw our Chinese visitors?
- They brought this tribute to avoid battle.

1118
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:51,088
It won't be so easy nearer Kinsai,
but our war has been going well.

1119
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:54,354
We only had to fight once.
Since you've been sick, we've taken four cities.

1120
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:56,418
Perhaps I should
remain in bed.

1121
01:25:56,496 --> 01:25:58,623
Mmm.
Now Kinsai.

1122
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:01,098
There are those in the government
who want peace...

1123
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:03,226
but they haven't much influence
with the old empress.

1124
01:26:03,303 --> 01:26:07,501
But, scholar, suppose I sent you
to Kinsai as a traveler of rank...

1125
01:26:07,574 --> 01:26:11,032
a student from another land, and you
told what you've seen of our strength.

1126
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,044
Yes, but will
the empress hear <i>me?</i>

1127
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:17,139
Find the heads of the peace party.
They'll see that you're heard.

1128
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:20,618
You can refuse to go if you want to.
The risk is great enough.

1129
01:26:20,687 --> 01:26:23,815
No, I'll go, my lord.

1130
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:26,552
It's settled then.

1131
01:26:26,626 --> 01:26:28,958
Scholar?

1132
01:26:29,028 --> 01:26:34,364
Maybe I'm a little sorry
I thought of this journey for you.

1133
01:26:34,434 --> 01:26:36,368
But be sure of this.
If they kill you...

1134
01:26:36,436 --> 01:26:39,963
I'll kill 10 of them
for every hair on your head.

1135
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:47,235
I have a strange feeling
I may not see you again.

1136
01:26:47,313 --> 01:26:49,338
If that's true,
I'll miss you, scholar.

1137
01:26:53,659 --> 01:26:55,524
I don't miss many men.

1138
01:26:55,595 --> 01:26:59,929
Well, for your sake,
I'll try not to get killed.

1139
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,163
You will come with me.

1140
01:27:35,234 --> 01:27:37,600
- What is it? L-
- We have been waiting for you.

1141
01:27:59,892 --> 01:28:03,794
- What is this place?
- It is the palace of her unlimited magnificence.

1142
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:08,698
Her kindly splendor,
the dowager empress of China.

1143
01:28:08,768 --> 01:28:11,396
Well, what am I doing here?

1144
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:15,668
I do not know entirely.
You will wait.

1145
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:19,735
<i>[Laughter]</i>

1146
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:29,584
Bow.
Bow profusely.

1147
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:55,246
Now are there two of them,
or are there not?

1148
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:57,714
Are their skins fair,
or have you no eyes?

1149
01:28:57,783 --> 01:28:59,717
Is there such a prophecy,
or is there not?

1150
01:28:59,785 --> 01:29:02,117
<i>Is it your duty to know</i>
<i>such things, or is it not?</i>

1151
01:29:02,188 --> 01:29:04,122
Do not argue with me
more in this matter.

1152
01:29:19,038 --> 01:29:22,906
- You will come with me.
- But what is this all about- a prophecy?

1153
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:26,240
No harm will come to you.
Far from it.

1154
01:29:26,312 --> 01:29:28,303
Please.

1155
01:29:36,689 --> 01:29:38,680
This is your house.

1156
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:42,687
It has been prepared for you.

1157
01:30:14,026 --> 01:30:16,324
Tris!

1158
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:19,922
Tris!

1159
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:24,365
What are you doing here?

1160
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:34,711
- Where's Maryam?
- Well, she must be a captive here somewhere.

1161
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,010
Now I just left her
to find out about a boat.

1162
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:40,018
- But how did you get here?
- Well, I didn't even get to the river.

1163
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:43,954
Some people laid hold of me before
I got started. Don't you know where we are?

1164
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:48,687
We're somewhere in the palace,
because I was just talking to the emp-

1165
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:51,457
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe we'll find out now.

1166
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:09,838
Good day, young sirs.
I have come to welcome you.

1167
01:31:09,915 --> 01:31:12,884
We'd be very grateful
if you'd tell us what all this means.

1168
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:15,750
It means that the prophecy
of the two birds...

1169
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:18,016
of the fairest color
has been fulfilled.

1170
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,025
It is a very old one.

1171
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:23,721
It's said that
in a time of great peril...

1172
01:31:23,796 --> 01:31:27,732
two birds of the fairest coloring
would appear...

1173
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,861
and the clouds of disaster
would roll away like the mist.

1174
01:31:31,937 --> 01:31:36,101
<i>We were urging</i>
<i>Her Royal Grandeur to think of peace.</i>

1175
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:39,372
She was about to yield...

1176
01:31:39,445 --> 01:31:42,881
when word was brought her
of a stranger...

1177
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:45,781
who was very fair of skin.

1178
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:48,979
Such a thing
has never been seen here...

1179
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:51,818
and it reminded her
of the prophecy.

1180
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:57,193
She said that there must be another,
so guards were posted.

1181
01:31:57,263 --> 01:31:59,754
<i>Now that you are both here...</i>

1182
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:03,131
she is sure the prophecy
has been fulfilled...

1183
01:32:03,202 --> 01:32:05,136
and she will talk
no more of peace.

1184
01:32:05,204 --> 01:32:08,139
Hmm. Well, what are we
supposed to do here?

1185
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:13,804
You will live here to ensure a continuance
of the good fortune you have brought.

1186
01:32:13,879 --> 01:32:15,813
For how long?

1187
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:19,749
I have told you,
this will be your home.

1188
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:22,583
You mean
we're prisoners?

1189
01:32:22,655 --> 01:32:26,557
The chains that bind you are golden ones.
But I would not try to leave.

1190
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:29,287
Now, look.
I can't just sit here.

1191
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:31,522
I came to talk
to the empress about peace.

1192
01:32:31,597 --> 01:32:35,829
- You tell her that I come
from the Bayan general himself.
<i>- It is too late.</i>

1193
01:32:35,901 --> 01:32:40,429
Her Excellent Kindness is certain
that you were sent by the gods.

1194
01:32:40,506 --> 01:32:43,998
<i>So now,</i>
<i>we have nothing to fear.</i>

1195
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:49,139
The gifts are meant to fit
your station as gods.

1196
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:52,742
<i>And I'm commanded to tell you</i>
<i>that if you have any desire...</i>

1197
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,184
you have only
to express the wish.

1198
01:32:57,022 --> 01:32:59,889
Well, if that's true,
there is something I'd like to have done.

1199
01:32:59,959 --> 01:33:02,723
There's a girl. She was with my friend
when he was taken prisoner.

1200
01:33:02,795 --> 01:33:05,992
If you know where she is,
I'd like to have her brought here at once.

1201
01:33:06,065 --> 01:33:09,831
I will send someone
to carry out your command.

1202
01:33:13,305 --> 01:33:16,001
This house is called...

1203
01:33:16,075 --> 01:33:19,169
the Abode of Everlasting Felicity.

1204
01:33:19,245 --> 01:33:23,045
I hope it does not fail
that name for the young gods...

1205
01:33:23,115 --> 01:33:27,677
and the young gods
do not fail their obligation...

1206
01:33:27,753 --> 01:33:31,985
to a people that
they have committed to war.

1207
01:33:37,463 --> 01:33:40,193
I think he'd like
that one better.

1208
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:47,561
Oh. What's this?

1209
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,609
Oh, I think
he'd like that too.

1210
01:34:00,953 --> 01:34:03,513
<i>- [Maryam] Walter! Walter!</i>
- Not now, Maryam. Go away.

1211
01:34:03,589 --> 01:34:05,557
- But I have to show you.
<i>- What?</i>

1212
01:34:05,624 --> 01:34:08,491
Oh, look. It's beautiful.
They are made of silk to go on legs.

1213
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,585
- I'll see them later.
<i>- All right, Walter.</i>

1214
01:34:10,663 --> 01:34:13,154
But it's wonderful!

1215
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,200
Well, I don't see what
you're so particular about.

1216
01:34:15,267 --> 01:34:20,102
It took me a half an hour to convince
four girls they weren't going to bathe me.

1217
01:34:22,975 --> 01:34:24,943
<i>[Chuckling]</i>

1218
01:34:34,286 --> 01:34:37,414
- Where is he, Tris?
- I don't know.

1219
01:34:37,489 --> 01:34:41,721
He said he was going to find out if the gods
could still have anything they asked for.

1220
01:34:41,794 --> 01:34:44,957
Did he talk to you, Tris?
About himself, I mean.

1221
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:47,021
No, not exactly.

1222
01:34:48,634 --> 01:34:51,194
But I think he's sorry
he was angry with you.

1223
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,034
- So he ran away from the
Bayan general to be with you.
- No.

1224
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:57,542
Oh, you shouldn't say
such things.

1225
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:00,510
He's here,
and he's not angry anymore.

1226
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:02,877
And he comes
to go with us to England.

1227
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:06,213
You really have learned
to believe hard enough, haven't you?

1228
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,718
Yes.

1229
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:12,519
No. He came on a mission
of some kind for Bayan.

1230
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:16,049
I didn't want to talk to him about it.
You know how he is.

1231
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:19,393
You can make him say things
he doesn't mean.

1232
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:22,832
There's one thing. He can't do anything
about it while we're shut in here.

1233
01:35:22,901 --> 01:35:26,359
And there's something else too.
It's about these.

1234
01:35:26,438 --> 01:35:29,965
He got very interested.
He said they weren't written by hand...

1235
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:31,976
and they're not
on sheepskin.

1236
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:36,344
It's something to do with soaking wood
and making this out of it.

1237
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:39,213
And using these.

1238
01:35:40,919 --> 01:35:43,285
[Groans]
I tried to figure it out.

1239
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:46,381
But he says he knows a man in England
who would gladly give his life...

1240
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:49,120
to know of such a wonder,
so there must be something to it.

1241
01:35:49,194 --> 01:35:51,128
Only they don't know
about it over there.

1242
01:35:51,196 --> 01:35:54,029
- And then last night-
- Well, you could look a little happier, bowman...

1243
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:56,465
sitting right in the middle
of the wealth of ages.

1244
01:35:56,535 --> 01:35:58,799
And here's some more for you.
You know, I was right.

1245
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:01,897
I thought if they have books, they must
set down matters of science in them...

1246
01:36:01,974 --> 01:36:04,169
like the direction needle
and how to make the books.

1247
01:36:04,243 --> 01:36:07,644
<i>And look what else I have.</i>
<i>What do you think this is?</i>

1248
01:36:07,713 --> 01:36:09,977
This is that powder
that disappears in a flash of light.

1249
01:36:10,049 --> 01:36:12,950
It's what they use
in the fire tubes.

1250
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:16,510
And if you-
If you close it in somewhere-

1251
01:36:20,225 --> 01:36:22,853
Now, look.

1252
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:46,377
You see that? Bayan was right.
There's the wealth of ages.

1253
01:36:46,452 --> 01:36:49,649
<i>He'd rather have that</i>
<i>than all the jewels in China.</i>

1254
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,087
Do you know what you just heard?

1255
01:36:52,157 --> 01:36:56,218
They don't know it yet, but you just heard
the walls of Rome begin to crumble.

1256
01:37:15,881 --> 01:37:19,840
The young gods already know, of course,
the news that we have just received.

1257
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,409
No. What news?

1258
01:37:22,488 --> 01:37:26,982
The armies of Bayan have taken
four cities since you came here.

1259
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:30,426
One that resisted
exists no more.

1260
01:37:30,496 --> 01:37:33,260
Soon, that army
will be before our walls.

1261
01:37:33,332 --> 01:37:35,266
But the young gods
have done nothing.

1262
01:37:35,334 --> 01:37:38,360
Well, what can we do?

1263
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:41,565
- It wasn't our idea to be gods.
- Nor was it mine.

1264
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,438
I'm in
an unfortunate position.

1265
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:48,105
If anything happens
to the young gods...

1266
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:52,708
I will die very quickly
for I am responsible for them.

1267
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:56,413
But I will also be among the first
whom Bayan will kill...

1268
01:37:56,488 --> 01:37:59,252
if the city resists.

1269
01:37:59,324 --> 01:38:02,293
So if I must die...

1270
01:38:02,361 --> 01:38:06,923
I will take the way that
will save the city from destruction.

1271
01:38:06,999 --> 01:38:11,333
You're trying to say, I imagine,
that if you have to die...

1272
01:38:11,403 --> 01:38:15,635
you prefer the choice that may convince
the empress that we're not gods.

1273
01:38:15,707 --> 01:38:18,073
Say if we were found
very mortally dead.

1274
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:21,169
That is possible.

1275
01:38:21,246 --> 01:38:26,013
If you have a better remedy,
I would find it quickly.

1276
01:39:00,752 --> 01:39:04,779
- Walter?
- Huh?

1277
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:06,847
What's the matter?

1278
01:39:06,925 --> 01:39:09,860
I couldn't sleep, Walter.
I want to talk. Please wake up.

1279
01:39:11,964 --> 01:39:14,364
Oh, can't it wait until morning?

1280
01:39:14,433 --> 01:39:17,425
No. I don't know
if I can say it now...

1281
01:39:17,502 --> 01:39:23,463
but if I think of it anymore
I won't be able to say it at all, I think.

1282
01:39:30,315 --> 01:39:33,648
All right.
What is it?

1283
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:38,782
If it's true what he said, that we shall
never leave here until- until we die...

1284
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:42,527
then- then-

1285
01:39:42,661 --> 01:39:44,458
Go on.

1286
01:39:46,264 --> 01:39:49,290
I know it's true
that you do not love me...

1287
01:39:49,367 --> 01:39:51,460
but if this other
is also true...

1288
01:39:51,536 --> 01:39:54,403
then you can never find
anyone else to love.

1289
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:57,408
- Isn't that so?
- Yes, l- I suppose so.

1290
01:39:57,476 --> 01:40:01,845
Well, then,
I was thinking.

1291
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,904
Since you cannot love
anyone else...

1292
01:40:03,982 --> 01:40:07,145
and since it may be
a very short time that we are here...

1293
01:40:07,219 --> 01:40:12,054
maybe you could pretend
for a little while that you loved me...

1294
01:40:12,123 --> 01:40:14,284
like it was in the miracle.

1295
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,051
Oh, I would like it
very much...

1296
01:40:18,129 --> 01:40:20,393
and you wouldn't have
to pretend very hard.

1297
01:40:20,465 --> 01:40:24,231
But if you did pretend for a while,
maybe it would get to be true...

1298
01:40:24,302 --> 01:40:26,668
since there is no one else.

1299
01:40:30,909 --> 01:40:32,843
You're strange.

1300
01:40:32,911 --> 01:40:38,713
But the house is called
the House of Everlasting Felicity...

1301
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:42,913
and I would rather be with you
even for a- for a little while...

1302
01:40:42,988 --> 01:40:45,183
and even if
you only pretended...

1303
01:40:45,257 --> 01:40:49,819
than to have all the rest
of my miracle or anything.

1304
01:40:53,431 --> 01:40:56,127
Maryam.

1305
01:40:59,204 --> 01:41:01,069
What's the matter?

1306
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:05,366
Wake up, Tris.
I think he loves me.

1307
01:41:05,443 --> 01:41:11,382
Oh, that. Why do you have to pick
on a time like this to find it out?

1308
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:14,412
Maryam?

1309
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:16,215
- Maryam-
- Where have you been?

1310
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:17,880
- Can you sew?
- Yes, a little.

1311
01:41:17,956 --> 01:41:20,322
Good. Now, I want you
to take these coats...

1312
01:41:20,392 --> 01:41:24,192
and sew as many of those jewels as you can
into the linings, and do it quickly as possible.

1313
01:41:24,262 --> 01:41:27,857
- Did you find a way to get away from here?
- Yes, I have.

1314
01:41:27,933 --> 01:41:30,868
<i>You know, I thought our friend last night</i>
<i>was pointing at something.</i>

1315
01:41:30,936 --> 01:41:35,373
So I took a look around. Now, there was
a door that was heavily barred before.

1316
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:39,069
Now I could open it. There was a room
behind and a passage leading to the river.

1317
01:41:39,144 --> 01:41:41,078
I followed it.
There are boats on the river.

1318
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:45,776
<i>Now, the attack must be close because</i>
<i>a lot of people are leaving down the river.</i>

1319
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,809
What-What I don't like
about it is it's all too neat.

1320
01:41:49,888 --> 01:41:52,083
Now, I tried to think
like our Chinese friend.

1321
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:54,523
Just letting us get away
isn't good enough.

1322
01:41:54,593 --> 01:41:58,529
<i>But if we were killed doing it just when danger</i>
<i>threatened, we wouldn't look very godlike...</i>

1323
01:41:58,597 --> 01:42:00,531
and he could easily
convince the empress that...

1324
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:02,863
we hadn't just returned
to our celestial paradise.

1325
01:42:02,934 --> 01:42:06,870
It would give him a chance
to save his city and his skin.

1326
01:42:06,938 --> 01:42:08,997
What do you think,
Tris?

1327
01:42:09,074 --> 01:42:11,201
Well, he didn't give us
much choice.

1328
01:42:13,144 --> 01:42:18,275
Well, we'd better wait until night.
We'll stand a better chance at the river.

1329
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,341
Come on. Get ready.

1330
01:42:28,627 --> 01:42:32,961
- Well, the light's going. It won't be long now.
- No.

1331
01:42:39,638 --> 01:42:41,970
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Yes, almost.

1332
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,338
- Well, hurry up.
- Yes, Walter.

1333
01:42:49,314 --> 01:42:54,013
I'm sorry, Maryam, that we got you
into this, having you brought here.

1334
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:56,485
<i>- It-</i>
- I'm glad you did it, Walter.

1335
01:42:58,056 --> 01:43:03,255
- Well, hurry up.
- Yes.

1336
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:11,266
That's-
That's yours, Tris.

1337
01:43:11,336 --> 01:43:14,396
If we get out of here,
you'll be a rich man with what's in there.

1338
01:43:14,472 --> 01:43:16,804
How does it feel?

1339
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:19,673
Of course, I suppose by rights
it should be Bayan's...

1340
01:43:19,744 --> 01:43:22,645
the spoils of China,
but there'll be plenty for him.

1341
01:43:22,714 --> 01:43:24,648
- Walter.
- What?

1342
01:43:24,716 --> 01:43:26,809
- Look, I've been thinking.
- Well, don't.

1343
01:43:26,885 --> 01:43:29,376
- It only leads to trouble.
- No, no. I've gotta say it.

1344
01:43:29,454 --> 01:43:33,857
What happens? I mean, when we do
make it to the other side of the river?

1345
01:43:33,925 --> 01:43:37,224
- Well, maybe we better wait till we get there.
- No. What I mean is-

1346
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:39,763
Look, I've been putting
some things together.

1347
01:43:39,831 --> 01:43:44,894
Things about making books. Things like
you said that man would give so much to know...

1348
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,996
in matters of science like
the direction-finding needle.

1349
01:43:49,074 --> 01:43:51,542
Well, l-I thought
to an island...

1350
01:43:51,609 --> 01:43:55,306
you know, it might be useful
for a trade and to defend itself.

1351
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,245
But-

1352
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:04,512
What I was really thinking, I wish
it was you that was taking her back.

1353
01:44:04,589 --> 01:44:08,355
It'd be better that way.
I wish it was you.

1354
01:44:19,404 --> 01:44:21,838
Well, Bayan was right
about one thing.

1355
01:44:21,906 --> 01:44:25,069
You're a poet, bowman,
and a good one.

1356
01:44:25,143 --> 01:44:28,271
But he was wrong
about another thing.

1357
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:30,473
"What you can't touch
doesn't exist," he said.

1358
01:44:30,548 --> 01:44:34,484
He didn't know that you could smell
those English oaks of yours from here...

1359
01:44:34,552 --> 01:44:36,918
did he, bowman?

1360
01:44:36,988 --> 01:44:40,754
Oh, no one could say it
better than you, Tris.

1361
01:44:40,825 --> 01:44:44,022
And l- I wish I felt
the same way.

1362
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:49,757
Probably I'm sorry
that I feel that Bayan...

1363
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:54,066
is the best thing that I have to follow,
but that's the way it is.

1364
01:44:54,139 --> 01:44:59,668
I'd lie to you, Tris, if I were sure
we weren't going to get through.

1365
01:44:59,744 --> 01:45:03,202
But if we do, I won't stand out there
and tell you that I'd take it back.

1366
01:45:05,517 --> 01:45:09,783
I'm glad that it didn't end
in the tent, you and I...

1367
01:45:09,854 --> 01:45:14,621
bitter and- and angry.

1368
01:45:14,692 --> 01:45:17,422
Felicity means something
after all, maybe.

1369
01:45:19,597 --> 01:45:22,259
I hope we don't make it.

1370
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:25,666
I hope you don't ever
get to the river.

1371
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:32,372
Walter!
I finished, Walter.

1372
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:37,707
Well, that's one way
we won't get out.

1373
01:46:44,449 --> 01:46:46,383
This was open.
Well, this is it.

1374
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:49,614
That door is not as high
as the walls of Rome.

1375
01:46:49,687 --> 01:46:52,485
Why don't you get your friend Bayan
to crumble it for you.

1376
01:46:53,825 --> 01:46:55,383
Here they are.

1377
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:00,430
- Can you hold them for a while?
- We'll find out.

1378
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,489
- I'm gonna try it.
- What?

1379
01:47:02,567 --> 01:47:04,865
The walls of Rome.

1380
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:13,273
<i>[Arrows Flying]</i>

1381
01:47:50,148 --> 01:47:52,981
- Give her to me a minute.
- You couldn't hit anything. Give it to me.

1382
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:55,485
And take her
back out a bit.

1383
01:48:07,265 --> 01:48:09,256
Tris!

1384
01:48:19,978 --> 01:48:22,572
Tris!
Are you all right?

1385
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:25,649
You all right?

1386
01:48:25,717 --> 01:48:28,584
Our friends will be back soon.
Now get her down to the boat.

1387
01:48:28,653 --> 01:48:32,453
- Hold onto me. You take-
- Stop being a hero.

1388
01:48:32,523 --> 01:48:36,289
How will you keep them back?
Throw a diamond at them?

1389
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:38,090
Go on.
Get her down to the boat.

1390
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:57,741
<i>[Voices Clamoring]</i>

1391
01:49:02,353 --> 01:49:04,617
Hold this clear of the bank.
We'll be right back.

1392
01:49:13,398 --> 01:49:15,389
Walter!

1393
01:49:33,618 --> 01:49:37,418
- Come on.
- I said I hoped we'd never get to the river.

1394
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,890
Well, maybe I don't have to.

1395
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,620
What are you talking about?

1396
01:49:43,694 --> 01:49:47,027
You have to get back to England,
don't you remember?

1397
01:49:47,098 --> 01:49:50,158
Come on. You can't just lie there.
Let me help you.

1398
01:49:50,234 --> 01:49:52,600
Leave them alone!
They're mine!

1399
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,332
You get onto your walls of Rome
and leave me alone.

1400
01:49:57,942 --> 01:50:00,911
Look at you.

1401
01:50:00,978 --> 01:50:03,879
You haven't got the belly
for it either, have you?

1402
01:50:03,948 --> 01:50:06,917
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

1403
01:50:08,586 --> 01:50:12,215
Books,
the walls of Rome...

1404
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:15,348
<i>and the miracles...</i>

1405
01:50:17,128 --> 01:50:19,119
<i>and-and the oaks.</i>

1406
01:50:19,197 --> 01:50:23,463
I don't know.
They're just so... green.

1407
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:34,402
What are you talking
like that for? What-

1408
01:50:37,148 --> 01:50:39,082
What are you trying to do,
die on me?

1409
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:45,617
Tris, come on.

1410
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:48,386
Come on, Tris.
Come on.

1411
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:56,366
Come on.
Come on, Tris.

1412
01:51:00,304 --> 01:51:02,238
Come on, Tris.

1413
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,268
[Knocking]

1414
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:34,837
We don't use
this door anymore.

1415
01:51:34,906 --> 01:51:38,501
- If you've come to trade, you'll have to-
- Old Will, couldn't I use it?

1416
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:42,809
You're playing tricks at me.

1417
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,507
It is.
It's Master Walter.

1418
01:51:46,584 --> 01:51:48,643
- I'm glad to see you.
- Come in. Come in.

1419
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,389
Come in, Master Walter.

1420
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:01,621
Well, it looks the same.

1421
01:52:01,699 --> 01:52:04,634
And I have the same questions to ask.
How's Grandfather?

1422
01:52:04,702 --> 01:52:08,889
He'll never say it,
but he's missed you sorely.

1423
01:52:10,591 --> 01:52:13,822
Once we hoped that
we might see you again.

1424
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:16,055
The king's men
came looking for you.

1425
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:19,930
There were very strange men with them
such as I had never seen before.

1426
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,231
- They said that they had a message to give you.
- What message?

1427
01:52:23,304 --> 01:52:27,263
I don't know, Master Walter. They said
they would only give it to you when you came.

1428
01:52:28,476 --> 01:52:30,637
I'll tell him.

1429
01:52:57,505 --> 01:53:01,942
<i>- [Grandfather] You lie, you old villain.</i>
<i>- I swear it, my lord.</i>

1430
01:53:02,009 --> 01:53:03,476
- He's here.
- Walter, my lad.

1431
01:53:03,544 --> 01:53:05,910
- Grandfather.
- Where have you come from?

1432
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:10,917
We thought-Wilderkin, tell my grandson-
I've spoken to him.

1433
01:53:10,985 --> 01:53:12,919
- My lord-
- You let me speak to him.

1434
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:16,115
- My lord, l-
- What are you standing there for?
I've broken my knightly vow.

1435
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:18,454
Wilderkin, tell my grandfather
that it was my fault-

1436
01:53:18,526 --> 01:53:21,518
Tell my grandson that-
Oh, what's the good?

1437
01:53:21,595 --> 01:53:23,893
When a vow's broken,
you can't put it together again.

1438
01:53:23,964 --> 01:53:25,898
Perhaps the good bishop
could tell my lord-

1439
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:29,197
What have I got to do with the bishop?
I can set myself my own penance.

1440
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:32,831
- I'll-Well, never mind. I'll think of one.
<i>- Yes, my lord.</i>

1441
01:53:32,907 --> 01:53:37,401
Then-Then I can talk to him
as much as I want, can't I?

1442
01:53:45,386 --> 01:53:51,086
- We've no need of you. Go on about your business.
- Yes, my lord.

1443
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:53,183
Yes, my lord.

1444
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:57,930
So the- the needle that
points in the same direction...

1445
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:02,367
and those books,
I left in London to be sent to the king.

1446
01:54:02,436 --> 01:54:04,370
And as they might need
some explanation...

1447
01:54:04,438 --> 01:54:07,874
I left word that
they could find me here.

1448
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:11,878
And then l-
I came straight here to see you.

1449
01:54:13,113 --> 01:54:17,880
But l- I wish I had
something more to tell you.

1450
01:54:17,952 --> 01:54:22,821
It- It all ought
to add up to something.

1451
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:25,916
I've seen Cathay.
But what of that?

1452
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:30,555
For all my talk,
there's been no help for Gurnie in it.

1453
01:54:30,631 --> 01:54:32,690
And maybe-

1454
01:54:32,766 --> 01:54:37,226
Maybe if I'd stayed here,
he'd still be in his forest...

1455
01:54:37,304 --> 01:54:39,363
looking down a shaft
at some king's stag.

1456
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,307
Well, l-

1457
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:46,039
I should have the answers, lad,
if you're troubled.

1458
01:54:46,113 --> 01:54:49,276
I'm old enough.
But if I were you, I'd-

1459
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,148
<i>My lord. They're here, my lord.</i>
<i>The king's men-at-arms.</i>

1460
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:56,622
- They wish to see Master Walter.
- Bring them in, man. Bring them in.

1461
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:59,181
We're ready for them.

1462
01:55:02,796 --> 01:55:06,823
There is a man at Oxford who can best
tell you about the importance of the books...

1463
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,030
and the manner in which
they are made- Friar Bacon.

1464
01:55:11,105 --> 01:55:13,369
As for the rest, l-
I thought perhaps...

1465
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,501
the direction-finding needle might
prove useful on the sea that surrounds us.

1466
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:21,708
I don't know. However,
it's all set down in the books...

1467
01:55:21,782 --> 01:55:23,841
and your men of science
can read about it there.

1468
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:27,785
I am not inclined to believe
all this about the fire tubes.

1469
01:55:27,855 --> 01:55:32,258
- I think the young man saw a dragon.
- Perhaps I did.

1470
01:55:41,368 --> 01:55:44,098
You have told us much
and well, young Saxon.

1471
01:55:44,171 --> 01:55:46,696
All but the most
important part.

1472
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:49,504
I've- I've told you
all I know, sire.

1473
01:55:49,576 --> 01:55:52,602
All but why
you have done these things.

1474
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,080
I remember you well,
young Saxon.

1475
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:59,779
You refused to enter my service.
You were very outspoken about it.

1476
01:55:59,853 --> 01:56:04,620
If you remember, I asked you a question then
about this matter of Saxon and Norman.

1477
01:56:04,692 --> 01:56:08,355
I have some feeling the answer
may lie here, if we can find it...

1478
01:56:08,429 --> 01:56:10,761
somewhere in this service
you have tried to do us.

1479
01:56:14,368 --> 01:56:16,802
- I didn't do it for you, sire.
- For whom then?

1480
01:56:18,706 --> 01:56:21,038
For him.

1481
01:56:21,108 --> 01:56:24,635
He- He wanted it that way,
l-I think.

1482
01:56:24,712 --> 01:56:29,740
- The bowman?
- Yes, sire.

1483
01:56:29,817 --> 01:56:32,183
Why did he wish it, then?

1484
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:37,015
I don't know.

1485
01:56:37,091 --> 01:56:42,256
It was something he felt that-
I don't know what it was.

1486
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:45,457
Bayan used to say that
nothing existed...

1487
01:56:45,532 --> 01:56:48,865
except what you could touch.

1488
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:52,201
But it did for him.

1489
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:54,740
What he felt
was as clear to him.

1490
01:56:54,808 --> 01:56:57,743
He'd- He'd sit there,
and it-

1491
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:01,508
Well, it was like
a fragrance to him.

1492
01:57:01,582 --> 01:57:04,278
It had to be.
He died for it, didn't he?

1493
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:09,482
Do you think it could be that he discovered
he was English first and Saxon second?

1494
01:57:12,593 --> 01:57:14,561
L- I don't know.

1495
01:57:14,628 --> 01:57:18,689
Saxons can feel like this
underneath the bitterness.

1496
01:57:18,766 --> 01:57:22,964
They can work with a king who would
like to be English first and Norman second.

1497
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,307
There are some points I would like to dispose of
in your case, and in that of the bowman.

1498
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:35,775
As I remember it, there was some question
of a name amongst other things.

1499
01:57:35,849 --> 01:57:38,750
It is our wish you remain here
until I return.

1500
01:57:52,099 --> 01:57:58,004
As you knelt Walter of Gurnie,
rise Sir Walter Fitzrauf.

1501
01:57:59,807 --> 01:58:05,768
And it is our wish that your shield
shall bear a longbow as part of your arms.

1502
01:58:07,714 --> 01:58:10,547
And as the first act
of your knighthood...

1503
01:58:10,617 --> 01:58:13,017
you shall place this bow,
the finest I could find...

1504
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:16,522
<i>above all other</i>
<i>of your arms at Gurnie...</i>

1505
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:21,050
since in its presence no man will be able
to live less well for England...

1506
01:58:21,128 --> 01:58:23,062
than did Tristram Griffen.

1507
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:31,928
You will place this upon it
as a tribute from me to a brave man.

1508
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,656
We have been sent
a long way to see you...

1509
01:58:55,729 --> 01:58:58,254
if you are the one
my lord Bayan called the scholar.

1510
01:58:58,332 --> 01:59:00,664
Bayan?

1511
01:59:02,202 --> 01:59:06,104
If you are that one, I have something
I am ordered to give you.

1512
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:16,577
"To my friend,
Walter the scholar."

1513
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:21,087
<i>[Bayan's Voice] "Bayan of the Hundred Eyes</i>
<i>sends greetings and a message.</i>

1514
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:24,590
<i>"I think that I understand why</i>
<i>you did not return to me...</i>

1515
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:26,922
<i>"and why you went back</i>
<i>to your England.</i>

1516
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:29,758
<i>"I still do not believe</i>
<i>in your foolish chivalry...</i>

1517
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:33,391
<i>"but I like men who are willing</i>
<i>to die for the thing in which they believe...</i>

1518
01:59:33,467 --> 01:59:35,492
<i>"wherever I may find them.</i>

1519
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:38,697
<i>"The tall bowman died well...</i>

1520
01:59:38,772 --> 01:59:43,300
<i>"and I think you would both have died</i>
<i>well for me if that had been necessary.</i>

1521
01:59:43,377 --> 01:59:48,246
<i>"Therefore, I send you something I believe</i>
<i>you would have taken with you if you could.</i>

1522
01:59:48,315 --> 01:59:52,775
<i>"She will be wearing a coat you will recognize.</i>
<i>It has a very fine lining.</i>

1523
01:59:52,853 --> 01:59:56,949
<i>"I send you also my chessmen</i>
<i>and the message...</i>

1524
01:59:57,024 --> 02:00:01,222
<i>- that I would be happier if you were still here. "
- Maryam!

1525
02:00:01,295 --> 02:00:05,629
She is not to see you until
you tell us that the gift is welcome.

1526
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:08,190
My lord was afraid
you might have tired of her.

1527
02:00:14,408 --> 02:00:16,342
Maryam!
