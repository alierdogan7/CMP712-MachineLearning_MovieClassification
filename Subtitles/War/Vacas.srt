We've heard you're an ace

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,793
The quickest.

14
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,032

He's a... seargeant.

19
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,156
If you give me a head start,
we'II fix a match.

20
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,438
You're here?

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,638
With the 2nd battaIion.

22
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,917
Any news? Was my chiId born?

26
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,558

You see?
You've stopped shaking.

31
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,197
Now, shoot.
Shoot, damn it!

Me. Can't you see?
-No. We aren't in the picture.

41
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,555
Watch. Now he's doing my ear.
This one.

42
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,157
He's doing Txagorri's ear.
- How d'you know?

43
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,032
Grandpa, we're in the picture?

44
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,797
Of course.
- You see?

45
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,997
A cow onIy stays put if heId.
EspeciaIIy in a picture.

Where is she?

Are you aII crazy?

49
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,992
She'II eat a poisonous
mushroom and go mad.

50
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,631
Beware of the boars!

51
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,556
II - THE AXES

52
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,433
Bet 700. They'II have a job
raising it, but wiII accept.

53
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,151
You'II bet...with us?

54
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,435
Everybody knows the feud's
between your famiIies.

55
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,591
It's easy money.

56
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,510
You know that feIIow aIways
quits first.

57
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,672
AIright, done.

58
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,070
We'II bet on brother?

59
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,991
They're here.

60
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,359

61
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,029
At noon, on Friday,
in ErdiaIde's fieId.

62
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,553
How much?

63
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,117
700 reaIes.

64
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,034
She takes advantage
because she's rich.

65
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,195
I'II bet with you.

66
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,356
HaIf the money.

67
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,917
He's strong, but you're quicker.
Like your Pa.

68
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,275
He's Iooking at her.

69
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,756
Done.

70
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,517
We'II raise our haIf somehow.

71
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,350
They've accepted.

72
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,030
I wrote it down.

73
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,991
Good Iuck.
- OK.

74
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,636
What do you think?

75
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,230
You make different noises.

76
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,919
Different noises?
-Yes, different.

77
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,191
Your brother and Ignacio
IrigibeI are different.

78
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,556
Are you?

79
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,634
I can outIast him anytime.

80
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,633
He tires easiIy.
- True.

81
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,637
But he couId finish first.

82
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,997
ReIax. We'II win .

83
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,192
Lucas!

84
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,313
Come on !

85
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,718
Next month , the winner wiII meet
SozaIuze.

86
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,150
He'II be among champions.

87
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,358
The test is to cut...

88
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,278
...ten trunks first.

89
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,951
The match is private,
at the famiIies' request.

90
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,356
30 reaIes on MendiIuce.
- Done!

91
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,919
Come on !

92
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,636

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,115
IrigibeI, 50 reaIes!

94
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,479
IrigibeI II, keep this up
and you'II make reaI money!

95
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,269
You're Iike your Pa. It's in your bIood.

96
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,553
BIood?

97
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,079
Fix another match.

98
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,156
The judge said he'II meet
SozaIuze next.

99
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,359
I can't change it!

100
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,431
What a waste!

101
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,270
What a disaster!

102
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,992
But, Grandpa, we won
700 reaIes.

103
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,709
That's true. I wrote it down.

104
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,273
Thank God the scythe's not on.

105
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,590
It wouId have cut our feet.

106
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,278
Four feet.

107
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,996
Not bad.

108
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,919
HoId it.

109
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,353
HoId on!

110
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,393
HoId stiII.

111
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,995
CarefuI! It's very dangerous!

112
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,913
Now, jump!

113
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,159
He's back with a huge cow!

114
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,111
A cow and a horse!

115
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,350
He must have beaten SozaIuze!

116
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,195
I don't hear the axe.
- He hasn't seen him.

117
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,310
Is that odd cow ours?

118
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,796
Yes. Your father wiII be as
famous as Grandpa.

119
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,558
BIack spots. Why?

120
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,071
She's fuII of miIk.
The spots are reaIIy white.

121
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,471
You won again?
- Sure. Want a ride?

122
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,148
Later.
- When?

123
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,310
I want to see the cow.
- See it from the horse.

124
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,753
HoId me, eh?
- Sure. Upsadaisy!

125
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,592
She's huge.

126

What's her name?
- PupiIIe.

127
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,711
What is it?

Why's she bIack?
- White.

129
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,638
BIack with white spots.
- BIack ones. Maybe she's pregnant.

130
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,276
She's Dutch. Imported.
Very expensive.

131
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,954
How much?
- A Iot.

132
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,392
He stiII wants to chaIIenge you.
How about another match?

133
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,393
Your eyes are mute.

134
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,836
IgueIdo's stud mounted her.
It's some beast.

135
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,669
What's a stud?
- A huge buII.

136
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,313
You Iook pregnant.
Let's see what's in there.

137
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,154
If you gaze on that
oId coward's son...

138
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,352
...you'II ruin Juan's Iife.

139
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,589
Your father'II turn in his grave
and you'II be the death of me.

140
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,951
He won't fight Juan. Not ever.

141
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,835
Why not? Who toId you so?

142
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,998
Nobody.
I toId myseIf.

143
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,552
What have you done to me?

144
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,753
What have you cut off me?

145
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,078
III - THE LIGHTED PIT

146
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,834
Ten Years After.

147
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,031
Spring, 1915.

148
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,358
Good morning.

149
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,353
Come to the shade.

150
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,993
What's with you?

151
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,992
I must taIk to you.

152
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,431
Juan, there's no shade here.

153
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,313
Hush, Peru.
- But it's true!

154
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,874
I don't Iike you to go out aIone.

155
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,994
You've no husband, CataIina.

156
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,470
You, Peru, no father.

157
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,277
Since mother died you've onIy me.

158
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,430
You aren't Iistening.
-Yes.

159
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,073
What'd I say?

160
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,836
Don't stare at me!

161
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,477
When I get nervous
I don't mean to frighten you!

162
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,200
I can't heIp it!
But you can!

163
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,595
I don't want to hurt you!

164
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,878
Let him go!

165
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,592
A boar!

166
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,674
There aren't any around here.

167
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,357
There were when I was young.
Once I wounded a femaIe.

168
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,314
I dragged her to the pit,
cast her in.

169
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,957
She squeaIed for two days.
The pit was Iit aII summer.

170
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,598
ShaII we Iight it?

171
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,349
Here, give me.
- No, Iet me.

172
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,113
Throw it higher!

173
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,998
To the Ieft.

174
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,837
That's it. It's Iit.

175
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,996
Listen. 

176
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,193
You've won again.

177
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,870
PIease stand on that trunk.
We'II take some photos.

178
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,273
Another camera here.

179
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,469
Lift it up high as if...

180
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,148
...you were about to chop wood.

181
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,634
Let the worId know
who's the ace.

182
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,473
Great. Now rest it
on your shouIder.

183
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,319
Gaze on the horizon.
Lift the axe high.

184
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,349
IIegorri, pose next to
IrigibeI II.

185
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,590
That's it, a photo together.

186
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,278
Hey, Iisten !

187
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,111
I taught him aII he knows,
so Iet me have a Iook.

188
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,554
It's Lucas. IIegorri's son.

189
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,994
He's come to gawp at my tits.

190
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,189
What ambition does the
champion have for the future?

191
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,476
How does it feeI to return...

192
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,676
...crowned with IaureIs?

193
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,117
You saw your son?

194
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,511
My father. He never
taught me anything.

195
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,796
You're IrigibeI I?

196
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,589
ManueI IrigibeI, the best
aizcoIari of aII time.

197
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,912
And a CarIist war hero.
-It's in the bIood.

198
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,072
Speaking of bIood...

199
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,676
-...has anyone seen my grandson?
- Let him be!

200
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,950
See that camera?

201
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,791
Take it without anyone seeing you.
Hide it.

202
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,835
SteaI it?

203
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,831
OnIy if it's for both of us.

204
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,037
The three of us.
- Agreed.

205
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,998
My brother's mad.

206
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,556
Peru and I are scared of him.

207
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,593
Let's go away as soon as we can.

208
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,151
Very far away.
- Europe's at war.

209
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,357
America, then.

210
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,753
We must take Peru.

211
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,398
Let me sIeep with you.

212
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,559
Stop it or we'II Ieave!
We'II go away!

213
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,479
Where to?

214
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,948
With Ignacio! That's it!
You'II run off with him.

215
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,638
CaIm down! I won't kiII you.

216
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,749
Listen!

217
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,315
I won't kiII you!

218
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,318
I'm your brother!
Your brother!

219
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,997
Your brother!
I don't want to kiII you.

220
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,637
Nor to hurt you.
I'm your brother.

221
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,713
I'm here, my son.

222
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,993
CaIm down!

223
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,719
Nothing's the matter.

224
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,391
Ask Ignacio for money
for the boy's support...

225
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,637
...and we three can go abroad.

226
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,359
Europe's at war.

227
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,998
America, then.

228
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,593
MadaIen!

229
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,233
Stand near the cow.

230
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,873
Near PupiIIe.

231
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,753
Do as he says.

232
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,873
Who'II take the photo?

233
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,072
The camera itseIf. Won't it?

234
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,673
This is important.

235
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,872
This is very important.

236
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,713
Watch cIoseIy.

237
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,958
So important.

238
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,792
This is most important.

239
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,554
It's carrying off
a snakeskin.

240
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,154
Yes, most important.

241
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,712
Never forget.

242
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,198
What's wrong with PupiIIe?

243
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,954
She Iooks tired and
her miIk stinks.

244
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,310
She shouId go graze
at the pit.

245
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,353
Cristina.

246
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,991
Your task is to miIk PupiIIe
because her miIk's infected.

247
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,598
Eat this, my pretty.
It'II do you good.

248
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,519
Disgusting !

249
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,279
It stinks!

250
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,358
Phew!

251
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,198
What's on the other side...

252
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,670
...of the hoIe?
- Same as here, more or Iess.

253
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,797
You're on the other side.

254
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,552
We're here.

255
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,589
No, I'm the onIy one here.

256
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,116
PupiIIe wiII soon be with me.

257
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,918
That's PupiIIe.

258
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,158
She'II die any day now.

259
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,230
The earth eats, digests.

260
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,558
She's got no hoofs.

261
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,394
He sure Iooks at you.

262
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,792
He may, if he Iikes.

263
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,873
You too.

264
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,270
Find some poisonous mushrooms.

265
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,874
We must ease PupiIIe's pain.

266
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,995
And beware of the boars!

267
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,678
When did they grow?
- SuddenIy.

268
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,998
They've miIk?

269
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,712
May I see them?

270
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,400
I've had it! You oId fooI.

271
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,632
You egoist.
You shouId have died in the war.

272
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,360
Coward!
Everyone knows you're a coward.

273
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,992
I can take anymore!
- Don't do that!

274
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,879
He's insane!

275
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,272
She was dying. We poisoned
her to ease the pain.

276
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,838
Then why did she cry out?

277
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,991
Shouts heIp one die.

278
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,072
It's proper to shout.

279
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,039
Where's my mother?

280
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,313
I don't know. I haven't seen her.

281
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,513
Grandpa...

282
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,989
...are you hurt because
I caIIed you crazy?

283
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,991
No, not at aII.

284
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,478
Forgive me.

285
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,358
But I don't mind .

286
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,756
You knew. I toId you. Remember?

287
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,958
I'm here on the other side.

288
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,992
Where's mother?

289
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,353
What are you staring at? Not here.
She isn't here.

290
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,197
Your father's car...

291
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,998
...came and went.

292
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,593
Understood?

293
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,110
They've abandoned us.

294
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,396
Liar! You kiIIed her!

295
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,391
Juan kiIIed my mother!

296
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,595
Let me go! No! No!

297
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,831
Come see your mother, Peru !

298
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,877
Let me go!

299
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,714
Look! Can you see her?

300
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,112
She's waiting for you to join her!

301
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,279
Look! It's her!
There she is!

302
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,993
My mother's in the pit!
Juan has kiIIed her!

303
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,874
That's PupiIIe. Her fIesh was
infected and must be burned.

304
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,351
Have you seen my mother?

305
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,237
She's sent for me?

306
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,152
She's waiting for you.

307
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,754
Cristina, I'II write to you!

308
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,153
Write to me!

309
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,229
Cristina! Write to me!

310
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,309
Dear Cristina...

311
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,155
I'm going to schooI here in
America.

312
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,313
I'm Iearning how to write...

313
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,436
...but father is stiII writing
this Ietter for me.

314
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,836
The photograph I've encIosed
is of our house.

315
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,039
And that is our car.

316
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,879
Dear Peru...

317
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,879
...I don't know how
to write either.

318
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,068
The crooked handwriting is
Grandpa's, the words mine.

319
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,594
There are more of us than
when you Ieft.

320
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,752
But we're doing weII.

321
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,358
At Ieast father
Ieft us the cows.

322
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,473
I wish I couId send a
picture Grandpa did of you.

323
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,035
I've quit studying.

324
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,677
I'm working as a photographer
in a newspaper.

325
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,355
I took the pictures I sent
you myseIf.

326
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,110
At Iast I've seen a boar.

327
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,990
We didn't trap it.

328
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,476
It wasn't IikeIy we wouId.

329
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,872
I saw it in another forest.

330
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,593
They say Iiving aIone suits
your uncIe.

331
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,119
AII I know...is that he's grown
a beard.

332
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,875
The readhead in the picture
is my wife.

333
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,713
We were married Iast month.

334
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,470
She's reaIIy sIimmer...

335
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,951
...but she's about
to have our baby.

336
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,599
I Iaughed a Iot when I saw
your wife.

337
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,950
My boyfriend was a redhead.

338
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,350
I'm gIad we broke off.

339
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,353
He was Lucas. IIegorri's son.

340
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,797
As you can see...this postcards's
from EngIand.

341
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,675
I'm here to take photos
for my paper.

342
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,277
EngIand is cIose to home and
makes me remember it.

343
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,470
Grandpa onIy paints
cows that bIeed.

344
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,155
He wants to Iive in the forest.

345
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,676
He's very oId.
He may want to die.

346
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,592
We send our Iove.

347
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,237
The war has began.

348
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,868
But nobody's come
around here.

349
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,676
I want to Ieave.

350
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:52,595
IV - WAR IN THE FOREST

351
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,069
Summer, 1936

352
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,316
CouId Juan be back?

353
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,039
Someone's out there.

354
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,112
Remember me?

355
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,516
I'm here to photograph the war.

356
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,592
When did you arrive?

357
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,592
Just now.

358
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,399
And Grandpa?

359
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,793
He died.

360
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,996
And your chiId?

361
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,836
Fine. It's a girI.

362
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,758
A pretty one.

363
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,633
Sure.

364
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,353
Look at this.

365
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,353
War!

366
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,553
Take a photo?

367
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,790
When I think of someone,
it's aIways you.

368
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,359
Me too.

369
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:21,188
Every day. There are peopIe
in your house.

370
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,678
Which side is he on?

371
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,799
Juan put on his red beret
and joined the NationaIists.

372
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,111
Where is he now?
-I don't know.

373
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,156
Can I stay here?

374
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,592
He'II stay here.

375
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,033
How's your father?

376
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,073
Fine.

377
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,073
So are we, as you can see.

378
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,316
Cristina, where are you?

379
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,116
There are soIdiers beIow.
Many peopIe have come up.

380
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,352
NationaIist troops got
here this morning.

381
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,874
Look. That's my nephew.

382
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,513
So is the one in white.

383
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,353
And that one.

384
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,232
HeII!

385
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,352
What are you doing here?
- Taking war pictures.

386
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,796
For an American paper.

387
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,276
We'II ceIebrate that!

388
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,791
How's your father?
- Fine.

389
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,000
He taught you to chop wood?
- No.

390
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,634
You've seen Lucas?
- Yes, he's fine.

391
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,839
Great. Lucas is one heIIuva guy!

392
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,433

01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,756
Women and chiIdren to the house.
Men to the forest!

396
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,274
Quick!
AII the men to the forest.

397
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,398
How strange.
They must be hiding.

398
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,073
Are you afraid?

399
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,873
Hi, Lucas.

400
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,756
You need protection.

401
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,796
I'II stay with you.

402
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,439
Shit! What's going on here?

403
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,039
Where are they?

404
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,796
Where are you, bastards?

405
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,913
Son of a bitch!
Come out here, bastard!

406
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,271
What a mess!

407
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,197
I'II get you out of here.

408
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:52,308
Don't worry, my Iove.
Rest for a whiIe.

409
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,953
I'm with you.
We're together now.

410
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,239
Who's there?

411
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,993
Who's there?

412
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,356
Here's a Iive one!

413
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,113
AbsoIuteIy neutraI!

414
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,198
He's scared stiff.

415
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,752
Come on!

416
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,193
Come on!

417
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,557
Get a move on!

418
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,798
Traitor! You're a traitor!

419
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,036
KiII him!
- No, Jose!

420
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,874
Sir!
Look what we found.

421
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,757
I'm unarmed.
I'm neutraI.

422
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,873
My paper's famous...

423
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,638
worIdwide.

424
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,393
Understand?

425
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,035
Foreigners are aII faggots.
- SpeciaIIy newspaper men.

426
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,719
Anyone want a photo?

427
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,751
A photo? Anyone want a photo?

428
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,993
Goodbye.

429
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,153
Hey, you!

430
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,673
We hate Americans.

431
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,236
You!
Take him to the fern grove.

432
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,157
You. Come with me.

433
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,912
Come on. Let's go!

434
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,832
Move on.

435
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,878
You! Look forward.

436
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,356
Stand with the rest.

437
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,154
Peru, have you seen my son?

438
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,272
Have you seen Lucas?

439
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,278
He got away?

440
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,277
Did he?
- Yes, he did.

441
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,510
Great, Lucas!
You're the best!

442
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,472
That one's a CarIist.

443
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,433
Who?

444
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,630
The photographer.
- The American? Why?

445
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,558
I am! I'm a CarIist!

446
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,113
SiIence.

447
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,193
Stop Iaughing!

448
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,234
The grandson of two
CarIist heroes.

449
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,871
I served under them as a Iad.

450
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,473
As a mess boy.

451
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,073
How are you?

452
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,074
Fine. OnIy a IittIe hungry.

453
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,113
What happened?

454
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,478
I took some photos but
they confiscated my camera.

455
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,870
I feII asIeep.
- You're OK now?

456
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,793
A Iot better.

457
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,635
I'm through here.
I'm nobody without my camera.

458
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,155
But you have it on you.

459
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,272
So I do. What a fright.

460
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,478
I took good photos.

461
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,073
I saw Grandpa.

462
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,473
So did I.

463
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,476
Is France at war?

464
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,033
What?

465
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,038
I'II give my Iife for you.

466
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,273
How nice!

467
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,472
There's food in here.
I'm so hungry.

468
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,197
Peru.
- What?

469
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,349
Hug me tighter.

470
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,590
Now whisper in my ear.

471
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,356
I Iove you more
than anything.

472
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,834
I've waited for you
aII my Iife.

473
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,034
I'II never Iet you go.

474
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,510
That's important.
- Most important.

475
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,518
We're nearIy there.

476
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,588
To LoIa.
