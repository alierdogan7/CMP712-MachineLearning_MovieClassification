1
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,000
THE OLD GUN

2
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,385
There.

3
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,485
Marcel the dog is waiting
for his master, huh?

4
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:54,005
He is happy, Marcel the dog!
The most beautiful dog in the whole world!

5
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, yes...

6
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,063
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

7
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
Just like you, darling.

8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Come in.

9
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,810
Doctor, the blinded patient
is still screaming.

10
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm on my way.

11
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,564
And no morphine left,
of course!

12
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Give him a sedative:
he must sleep.

13
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,391
Ah, gently.

14
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,110
Don't move.
It's pointless.

15
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
It seems you don't like my visits.

16
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,543
- There are only sick people here.
- I know.

17
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:29,365
But sick communists.
Sick saboteurs even!

18
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:34,414
They change bed every day, right?

19
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:45,000
Chief, we found him!

20
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,711
- He has killed 2 of my men.
- I am not a politician!

21
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,365
That's what cowards say!
In harsh times.

22
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,641
I am not a politician.

23
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,588
I treat the wounded.

24
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,628
Either you leave him here
or I go tell Major-Doctor Muller!

25
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,072
Mister Dandieu,
the war is not over yet.

26
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,362
Do you know what would happen
if you were not a surgeon?

27
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
I'd take you to the German Gestapo
to have you shot!

28
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,450
Oh yes...

29
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,465
I've had my eye on you
for quite a while...

30
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,091
You have a family...

31
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,188
A wife...

32
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,596
A daughter...

33
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,019
In their own interest,

34
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,470
...behave.

35
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,000
No! No!

36
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,934
No!

37
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,749
Them, again!.

38
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,726
Don't let his happen, Muller.

39
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,032
Mister Dandieu, I still have
125 wounded officers to evacuate.

40
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,556
I don't know where or how.
Anyway, it is a problem between French.

41
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,062
Is there any sulfamide left?
- No. Nothing left.

42
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,148
In a month or two
you'll be free.

43
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Maybe you'll have penicilline,
while me...

44
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:58,360
They'll probably come back.
- No doubt.

45
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,581
What about the lung patient?

46
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,049
Which one?

47
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,266
The one who blew up the Paris train.

48
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,155
Ah, yes. Another hero.
A pain in the ass, all these heroes.

49
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,964
Bring him to the cellar
near the boiler room.

50
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,965
He cannot be transported.
- He can be transported,

51
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,297
or else you don't know
what you want...

52
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,000
If they come back, they take him
and they kill him.

53
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,905
And they arrest us.
Make it happen, for God's sake.

54
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,501
What is it?
- Dandieu.

55
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,800
Here is the sulfamide,
and 18 ampoules of morfine.

56
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,374
- That's all I could get.
- Better than nothing, thanks.

57
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,648
Halt!

58
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,550
Papers!

59
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,372
It is forbidden to go out
during the curfew.

60
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,598
Do you have a safe-conduct?

61
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,256
Please excuse us, Doctor.

62
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:46,686
- I was worried, mister Julien.
- Everything's fine, Jeanne.

63
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,600
- I hope they didn't wait for me?
- No, but I kept a dish for you.

64
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,189
Thanks! But I'm not hungry.
Go to bed, Jeanne. Thank you.

65
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
How did it go at the hospital?

66
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Oh, Marcel the dog!
What a beautiful dog!

67
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,010
The radio announces
that in Normandie

68
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,048
the Americans cast off
the Germans to the sea.

69
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,136
And some people say that
the Das Reich division

70
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,560
is going from Montauban
to the Normandie front.

71
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,645
Listen, I'm tired, mum.

72
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,740
Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

73
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,150
- I only have white wine left.
- It'll do fine.

74
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,869
Are you mad?

75
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,000
- I didn't want to put that one.
- Which one did you want to put?

76
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,500
This one, the double six.

77
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,273
- She was right.
- Of course, you have all the sixes.

78
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,244
You would have won the game.
Check, I'm sure of it.

79
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,677
- Ah! Damn, it is the second time!
- I can't see a thing. And I bring the wine.

80
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,741
Wait, madame Dandieu.

81
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,170
Come on, Marcel, not now.
Shut up.

82
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,057
What's that?
Florence?

83
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,108
Yes, she is the laundry room,
washing herself.
- Washing herself? At this time?

84
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,710
- Yes.
- What an idea...

85
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:20,824
My towel fell in the water!
- I'm coming, dear!

86
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,209
Thank you, mum.

87
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,578
I'm coming!

88
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,500
- Wait for me, Clara.
- I'm going...

89
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,725
No, stay here,
I have something to tell you.

90
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:35,307
Clara!
- Yes?

91
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,609
I love you.

92
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,015
- So what? Are you coming?
- Yes.

93
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,990
Yes, we're coming!

94
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,244
It stings, I have soap in my eyes.
- Wait...

95
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,550
Come closer.
There...

96
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:05,500
Eh! No!
Ah, I can't see either now!

97
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,617
- It's all over my glasses.
- Didn't mean to...

98
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,045
- Where are your clothes?
- In my bedroom.

99
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,300
You came own here naked?
- Well yes.

100
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,400
She is mad.
My daughter is mad.

101
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,234
- My glasses?
- Wait. Get dry.

102
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,819
- Nobody cares about my glasses!
- I'll take care of it! There you are, sir!

103
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,916
I go back to François. You go
straight to bed. Good night.

104
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:46,000
- Do you hear them?
- Yes, glad the women are here, mum!

105
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,490
It's getting late, I have to go.

106
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,000
- Who's on call? - Berson and Thibodée.
They're overloaded. They're expecting you.

107
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,264
I had the saboteur hidden
in the boiler room.

108
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,160
- Why?
- The militia has come again.

109
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,779
They found the young Drobée.

110
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,200
They took him away.

111
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,130
I couldn't do anything.

112
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,643
I'm a little scared, François.

113
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,339
They're dangerous, you know.

114
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,790
They realise that they're down for.
So...

115
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,455
They're getting mad.

116
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,844
- Have they threatened you?
- Yes. But that's not the problem.

117
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,110
You know them...
They mentionned my family.

118
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,601
You see?
What do yo uwant me to do?

119
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,708
I was stuck,
I couldn't do anything.

120
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,176
- Goodnight François.
- Goodnight.

121
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,183
- They shouldn't stay here.
- I know.

122
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,782
And it's going to get worse
until the end, you'll see.

123
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,250
I forgot to tell you: there is a little
sulfamide and morfine at the back.

124
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,681
Very well.

125
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:46,144
Listen, I can take them
to La Barberie in the morning.

126
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,741
No one will find them there.

127
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,900
Look, I'll do that in the morning
while you're at the hospital.

128
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,478
I had thought about it but
I didn't dare asking.

129
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,850
See you tomorrow at 8.
The sooner we bring them, the better.

130
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,613
- When will you sleep?
- Oh, after the war!

131
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,850
My first is a fish,
my second is a fruit tree...

132
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,695
And my whole is a great French king.

133
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,059
- It is not possible.
- Of course it is:

134
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,951
Honourat I, François 1er. You see...

135
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,684
- That's silly.
- No, it works.

136
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:35,965
Al right everybody,
it's late.

137
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
I borrow my wife.

138
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,990
- When will I get her back?
- In the morning. I promise.

139
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:44,477
- Night Marcel.
- Sleep well, dear.

140
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,285
- I don't have any matches.
- No need of them to sleep.

141
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,843
Look, Clara, tomorrow morning
I'll send you all to La Barberie.

142
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,060
Flo, Mum, Jeanne and you.

143
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:32,785
- Why?
- It's safer.

144
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,468
François will drive you there.

145
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,429
Is that so? For Flo, your mum,
en Jeanne, it's alright. But not me.

146
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,394
- Of course it is.
- No.

147
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,064
- Yes, it is, don't be contrary.

148
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,750
In a few days,
when the town is freed,

149
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,385
I'll come and bring you back.

150
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,624
And after that, we'll go for a great voyage
just you and me.

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,550
The one we should have done
if there hadn't been a war.

152
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,750
And if you're very nice
I'll make you a baby.

153
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:07,358
Julien. The baby...
Let's make it now!

154
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,710
Right now!

155
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,369
Don't move.

156
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,477
...the dust of rubbles...

157
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,300
...to the birds Orléans
must look like a skimmer...

158
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,667
...the town is riddled with...

159
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,164
...The two towers of
the cathedral are torn...

160
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:22,285
So you're absolutely certain,
you don't want to go?

161
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,564
- No, dear.
- What if the town is bombed?

162
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,266
At our age, we don't risk anything.

163
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,200
- See you later.
- See you later.

164
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,666
My mother is so stubborn.

165
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,857
I never ask her anything.
For once, this is something important,
she doesn't want to hear about it

166
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,944
How come are we safer
at La Barberie?

167
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,524
Becaus, dear.

168
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,398
- Do you have any money?
- I've got all I need.

169
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Anyway, you know everybody
in the village.

170
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,005
No problem.
Everything will be fine.

171
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,162
Drop me a little further.

172
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,380
See you tonight, François.

173
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,669
And you, well, see you very soon.

174
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,636
- I'll go to see you as soon as I can.
- Alright.

175
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,584
- Bye.
- Bye.

176
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,477
- Be good.
- Yes sir!

177
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,694
I have no use of this scarf
and your daughter needs a jumper.

178
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,734
You're bored without Clara?

179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,744
You stayed to look after me?

180
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:04,033
Do you know how long
I adored your father?

181
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,774
30 years.

182
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:10,696
Each time I open a door,
I feel like I'm about to see him.

183
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,800
He liked to read too.

184
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:20,204
Strange... A skinny little man

185
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,035
who gave me a big boy like you.

186
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:32,096
11:30. François has to take his call.

187
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:35,143
Let him sleep a little more.
We're so well...

188
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,457
Yes...

189
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,573
We're so well.

190
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,440
But there's the hospital.

191
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:48,364
I heard that yesterday,
you've operated for 8 hours in a row.

192
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,400
When I'm too tired,
I'm afraid to make a mistake.

193
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,344
I'm not worried, with these hands
you perform miracles.

194
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,571
- Do you mind making coffee?
- Of course not.

195
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,610
Finally! It looks like the end.

196
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,087
Quick, we must go
behind the tanks!

197
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:41,082
The partisans
could be ambushed!

198
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,100
What is that?
Plum or pear brandy?

199
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:53,184
- I think there's no name, sir.
- No, it's petroleum.

200
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:55,588
- It's a possibility.
- Ah, Garigue...

201
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
The Parisian, if he hasn't peed by tonight,

202
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,435
we probe him and then
we open him, right?.

203
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,807
Have a look at this!
That is the phenomenon!

204
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,818
And yet, within a month,
he be fine this little militian.

205
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,775
Yes, he is saved.
And ready for the firing squad.

206
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,684
Tough as he is, 12 more bullets
won't get the better of him!

207
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,000
Come in! Ah, miss Langrenier,
How are you, miss Langrenier?

208
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,669
A shot?
No? A small one?

209
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,171
No, thank you.
Sir...

210
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:30,300
You've got rings under your eyes,
miss Langrenier! Went to bed late, huh?

211
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,712
The number 12,
I think it's going to be twins.

212
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:34,794
That's perfect!
Two to go, two to come!

213
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,414
Such balance...
That's nature, miss Langrenier.

214
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,824
Goodbye, miss Langrenier.

215
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,096
Nice piece of ass,
miss Langrenier.

216
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,776
Is she good in bed?
- Oh yes, sir.

217
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,000
Good for her,
because for the injections

218
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,105
I've seen better!

219
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,405
Well, everyone,
you've been great.

220
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,727
I suppose you all have
other fish to fry. See you tomorrow.

221
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,542
So, what's left to do?

222
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,695
Ah, the amputation?

223
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,315
If you want, I'll take care of it.
- Yes, it suits me.

224
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,546
You see, they've been gone for
5 days and 5 nights.

225
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,895
If at least they had a phone.
I can't stand it anymore.

226
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,431
I kind of noticed.

227
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:32,051
If you left now,
you could be there for lunch.

228
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:35,854
- You could be back for 5pm.
- Do you think so?

229
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,564
Don't you?

230
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,504
Yes, of course.
You're right. Let's go.

231
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Shouldn't I, huh?

232
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,697
Halt! Papers!

233
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,297
Let him through.

234
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,544
What are you doing here, huh?

235
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:12,463
Come here!

236
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,000
Mister Florent!

237
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,192
Mister Florent?!

238
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,367
Yvonne?

239
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,474
Is there anybody here?

240
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:55,856
Ludwig!
Yes, Obersturmfuher.

241
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,000
Try again to reach
the headquarters.

242
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,273
Ask them if they're coming or not.

243
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,200
Yes, sir!

244
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,498
One day, I'll be old and
you will have not really looked at me.

245
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,374
How dare you? You're wrong.
That's all I'm doing!

246
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,401
You're watching me, spying on me,
that's different.

247
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:42,508
You're wrong, I tell you.

248
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,714
You've got nerves.

249
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,615
I deprive myself of sleeping
to watch you sleep!

250
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,965
Liar!.

251
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,144
- What do you mean, liar??
- Not every night.

252
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,044
No, not every night.
Will you forgive me?

253
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,684
What if I don't?

254
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,793
Jeanne, have you seen Madam?

255
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,328
I just passed her.
She was on her way to the cellar.

256
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,803
What's wrong?

257
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,801
What's happening?

258
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,820
Huh?

259
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:11,103
Nothing. I don't know.

260
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,094
You don't want to tell me?

261
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,144
- Someone has upset you?
- No, no.

262
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,715
So what?

263
00:41:26,644 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't know...
I got sad, all of a sudden.

264
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,244
Why sad?

265
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,226
Don't know why...
I got scared.

266
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,853
- Scared of what?
- I don't know.

267
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,011
That hurt me.

268
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,494
It is over.

269
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,963
- Over?
- Yes, it's over.

270
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,072
Maybe it's because
I drank too much. I...

271
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm a little too happy.

272
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,151
Must be it, right?

273
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,873
- Yes, maybe.
- Do you understand?

274
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,149
Do you see, Julien
that is buckshot.

275
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,489
From headquarters
in Montauban.

276
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,475
Is there an answer?

277
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,971
No answer.

278
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,588
The Colonel has been killed.

279
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:33,252
No one from general staff
is covering up for us.

280
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,844
No one will find out.

281
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,406
We have to catch up
with our unit in Perigueux.

282
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,161
and from there,
the Normandie front.

283
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,977
About the village, we'll say that

284
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:51,886
a group of Partisans
has attacked us.

285
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,433
Until the end of the war...

286
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,835
I found a projector.

287
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,800
- I have the same in Munich.
- Give me a hand here.

288
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,500
Lights!

289
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,930
Et voilà, we have
a first class screen!

290
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,211
Don't you ever dance?

291
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:33,605
- I can't dance.
- What a pity.

292
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,327
I'm sorry.

293
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,271
- We could have flirted?
- I can't flirt.

294
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,148
I wish they'd never stop playing.

295
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,149
They are going to play all night.

296
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:04,338
So you'll hear them just as well
from your bed.

297
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,186
To bed, miss big bundle.
Give me your glasses.

298
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,407
What is it?

299
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,571
You're not well?

300
00:54:16,572 --> 00:54:17,572
Are you unhappy?

301
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,579
Why did mummy leave you?

302
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:29,428
It's quite a story.

303
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,500
Because she met another man.

304
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,257
He was very handsome so she loved him.
So she left with him.

305
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,543
That's all I can tell you.

306
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,103
But it is not sad, you know,
because she is very happy...

307
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,397
...and me too,
because I have you.

308
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
What about Clara?
You like her, don't you?

309
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:55,839
Yes. She is like my sister.
It's as if you had two daughters.

310
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,850
Good night, pumpkin.

311
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,620
Will Clara come to say good night?

312
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:06,323
- Has she ever forgotten?
- No.

313
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:10,207
Dad, when is your next leave?

314
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,859
Very soon.
I promise.

315
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:17,000
Come on, go to sleep,
miss big bundle.

316
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,398
- Is he courting you again?
- Yes.

317
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,400
How do you feel about it?

318
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,198
- It is very pleasant.
- Ah.

319
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,522
- Really?
- Yes.

320
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,645
Are you jealous?

321
00:56:38,673 --> 00:56:42,827
Bloody pipes.
Fucking country!

322
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,421
Fucking war!

323
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,062
- Get lost, drunkard!
- Yes sir.

324
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:56,605
What kind of sloppiness is this,
Wake up immediately! Attention!

325
00:56:57,682 --> 00:57:00,111
From now on, the vehicules
must be guarded around the clock!

326
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,974
There could be Partisans
in the neighbourhood!

327
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,242
- You two will take the watch immediately!
- Yes, sir!

328
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:15,300
It's about time,
you're late.

329
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,240
Prize of religious instruction,
miss Bézac.

330
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,430
Let all the pupils of 5A class
who will hear their name

331
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,474
come here with us!

332
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,511
Miss Dandieu, awarded 7 times,
nominated twice.

333
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,500
Congratulations!

334
00:58:34,774 --> 00:58:40,161
Miss Lenqueteau, awarded twice,
nominated once.

335
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,551
Too late!
It's just over!

336
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:50,400
Sorry dear, I was on time,
was I not?

337
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,000
I didn't sleep at the hospital,
but we got a flat tire.

338
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,930
Is that true?

339
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,532
Look at my hands:
full of dust and dirty grease.

340
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,866
When I wanted to find the gloves,
your mother had used them

341
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,143
- ...to clip the rosetrees...
- Hush about your hands...

342
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,479
- Look, Award for Excellence!
- And History!

343
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,834
History too?
Oh, Cyrano de Bergerac,

344
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:16,835
all my youth.

345
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:18,843
Prince, pray Heaven for your soul's weal!

346
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,800
I move a pace--lo, such! and such!
Cut over--feint!

347
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,660
What ho! You reel?
At the envoi's end, I touch!

348
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,415
- Sorry, sister.
- You look cheerful, Doctor.

349
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,830
Well yes, Sister Amlie
it's celebration day!

350
00:59:39,014 --> 00:59:41,096
Ah, our Julien...

351
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,387
Herman! Get tis dunghill to start!
Speed up the leaving!

352
01:01:11,395 --> 01:01:13,067
It's taking too long!

353
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:15,700
Hurry! Faster!

354
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:24,450
Attention! Faster!

355
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:28,069
- Fill the jerrycans with water!
- Yes, sir!

356
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,269
- Friedrich has disappeared!
- He was here!

357
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,780
Idiot!
You want to follow him?

358
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,970
Back to the tank.

359
01:02:56,113 --> 01:02:58,891
Friedrich is dead.
There must be Partisans down there.

360
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:02,592
The Obersturmfuhrer
wants us all back in the tanks.

361
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,826
It's one of our divisions.

362
01:03:18,827 --> 01:03:21,391
They're leaving.
Try to reach them.

363
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,934
Stop them and tell them

364
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,860
to wait for us.
- Very well.

365
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Ludwig!
Let's go!

366
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,018
The bridge is broken!

367
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,791
The Partisans are surrounding us!
Fall back! Shut the doors!

368
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:06,924
Beware, the window!

369
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,365
Take one alive, for interrogation!

370
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,915
This way!
He must be here!

371
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,572
I saw him!
Let's hunt him down!

372
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,614
Here!

373
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,600
We're going to get him!

374
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,549
The other side!

375
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,833
- We've been here already.
- He is in the well.

376
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,390
Let's go this way.

377
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,388
Partisan,
follow me to the castle!

378
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,486
The Hauptsturmfuhrer
wants to talk to you.

379
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,449
Come on! Hurry!

380
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,607
Turn around!
GO to the door, hurry!

381
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:29,637
Faster! Faster!

382
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,639
More Partisans...

383
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,898
Hide!

384
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,124
Complete silence.
Shoot only on my command.

385
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,585
Anybody there?

386
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,205
Search the houses.
Luc, come with me.

387
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,700
This is incredible.
They weren't signaled on any road.

388
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,131
- They are probobly still in the castle.
- Chief! Look.

389
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:06,036
It's Doctor Dandieu.

390
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,290
What are you doing here?

391
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,990
Are you alone?

392
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,091
Yes.

393
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,598
And your family?

394
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,984
They are in town.
I got here after...

395
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,811
I couldn't do anything.
I hid when I saw them.

396
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,406
When did they leave?
How many of them?

397
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,992
A dozen.

398
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,985
They took the road to...
- Chief! I found a dead one!

399
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,476
They must have fought back.

400
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,363
Do you want to come with us?

401
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,570
No, thank you.

402
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:56,900
That's not very reasonable.

403
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,593
And it can be dangerous,
they may come back.

404
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,389
Anyway, as you wish.

405
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,700
You won't be alone for long,

406
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,739
I'll tell the people
from Mauricot.

407
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,647
Two men on the tank!
Take aim at the entrance!

408
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,689
The others to the ravine!

409
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,343
Do you have everything?
Follow me.

410
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,162
- Here, tie the rope.
- Yes, Haubtsturmfuhrer.

411
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Wolfgang, you go first.

412
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,049
Julien

413
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,439
The child...

414
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,469
Wouldn't you like
to make him now?

415
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:39,526
If it's a boy,
we'll name him David.

416
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,754
There, a Partisan on the terrace!

417
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,000
Throw a grenade at him!

418
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,216
We're trapped.

419
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,000
The Partisans are surrounding us.

420
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,458
Boys, the game is over.

421
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,380
Our comrades are probably
too far away.

422
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,330
We'll never...

423
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,229
We'll never see Germany again.

424
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,000
All we have left to do...

425
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,033
...but to sell our souls
for the highest price.

426
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,830
- For the Fhrer! And for Fatherland!
- Heil Hitler!

427
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:29,495
...some attacks by
the Soviet-Jew radio...

428
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,355
...not a word about
the suffering...

429
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,531
...not a word about
the displaced populations...

430
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:36,800
...people of Normandie,
dispelled from your homes...

431
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,576
... and you, thousands of
innocent missing or deads ...

432
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,600
...and you who will soon discover
the "joys" of the Liberation...

433
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,722
What the hell is she doing?

434
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,430
She could have told us!

435
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,571
She probably didn't want to drive
at night? She'll be here in the morning.

436
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,660
It is the morning.
It is tomorrow morning!

437
01:17:15,114 --> 01:17:18,990
Don't be silly. 5:30 am.
It's not the morning yet.

438
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,000
Don't get smart.

439
01:17:22,844 --> 01:17:25,000
You're right.

440
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,142
- You know, François...
- What?

441
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,928
She is so alive,
so unpredictable.

442
01:17:40,475 --> 01:17:45,765
Everything has happened so fast,
between us...

443
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,639
I'm always scared that one day
she might leave.

444
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,260
- You can't take anything for granted!
- No. That's why you love her!.

445
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,653
Where have you been?

446
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:13,000
A big detour
and then I got lost.

447
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:15,000
- Really?
- Yes, really.

448
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

449
01:18:17,065 --> 01:18:19,142
Don't be mad at me,
I have a surprise for you.

450
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,400
- Peek-a-boo!
- What is she doing  here?

451
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,405
- Why aren't you at school?
- It's closed.

452
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,600
Requisitionings. We saw
so many refugees on the road..

453
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:28,534
- He was getting mad without you.
- Why?

454
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,900
And that's not all.

455
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,673
- What is that?
- That is Marcel.

456
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,500
- We've named him Marcel.
- Where does he come from, Marcel?

457
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,700
He was all alone along the road.
So I stopped,

458
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,250
we looked at each other
and he got in.

459
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,900
Alright?
Come, Marcel.

460
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,438
I've found an exit!

461
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:34,397
In the basement,
there is an exit to the village.

462
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,590
Haubtsturmfuhrer!
A Partisan! Aaah!

463
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,992
A Partisan!

464
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,627
There, in the bedroom.

465
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,823
Search everywhere.
And hurry up!!

466
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,351
Here is another room.

467
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,200
He can't have just
vanished into thin air!

468
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,115
He is here, they're here.
I'm sure of it.

469
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
- My friend Julien.
- Good evening.

470
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,300
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

471
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Well, er...
I have to give a phone call.

472
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,300
- I am very thirsty.
- What do you want?

473
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,219
- A glass of Champagne.
- Make it two, please.

474
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,834
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a surgeon, like François.

475
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,000
and I live in the country,
like François.

476
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:39,216
All like François. But,
I don't know him that well, you know.

477
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,800
- Which region?
- In the South, downwards.

478
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,000
Take a right as you go down.

479
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,969
It's called Le Quercy.

480
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,473
I also have a castle,
a sort of castle, anyway.

481
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,219
I am restoring it.

482
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,035
- Whenever I have the time.
- That's good.

483
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,685
And you... What do you do?

484
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,720
Me? Nothing.

485
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:09,760
- Nothing at all?
- No.

486
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,381
Anyway, I'm trying.
It's not easy.

487
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,235
Thank you.

488
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,468
Dank u.

489
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,494
- You're rich?
- No, not at all.

490
01:23:47,142 --> 01:23:49,572
I work now and then,
when I'm broke.

491
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,367
I help a friend
who owns a bookshop.

492
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,000
I used to make costume jewelry
for a fashion designer.

493
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,478
And then...

494
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,373
Why?

495
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,210
Are you interested?

496
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,615
- What?
- I don't know, me?

497
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,800
Why are you looking
at me like that?

498
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,900
- I love you.
- You're mad.

499
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,370
No.

500
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,010
And now...

501
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,500
You still love me.
Am I right?

502
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,500
Are you happier?

503
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,523
Or is it over?

504
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,297
For me it is over.

505
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,950
Not because you're not handsome.
It has nothing to do with it.

506
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,971
It was...
Very nice.

507
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
But I don't like men

508
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,285
to whom I give myself right away...
I don't like that.

509
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,788
That's not your fault.
It's mine.

510
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:46,460
It's a misunderstanding.
I'm sorry.

511
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,042
Eh!

512
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,089
You're already back
to your province?

513
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,448
Clara,

514
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,400
The news are bad, I really think
there's going to be a war.

515
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,221
I don't give a damn.

516
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,383
Do you want to marry me?

517
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,000
Where is Walter?

518
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,522
He was here a minute ago.
Hurry up!

519
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,844
Are you trying to escape
dressed as a civilian?

520
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,770
Deserter!

521
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,816
Dirty pig.

522
01:27:38,424 --> 01:27:42,111
Klaus!
Help!

523
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:48,965
Klaus!

524
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,633
Come, it's not far.

525
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,901
Here! Here!

526
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,781
Light!
Who's there?

527
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,609
Help!

528
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,301
Water! Water!

529
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,267
Help!
The water rises!

530
01:33:00,569 --> 01:33:02,412
Where is the dog?

531
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,415
Marcel.
Marcel the dog.

532
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,382
Rien.

533
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,136
Clara must have taken him
in her car.

534
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,121
Are you coming
for dinner tonight?

535
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,135
What's wrong?

536
01:33:19,155 --> 01:33:21,192
If you prefer...

537
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:23,020
...I could be replaced
at the hospital.

538
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,790
So I could stay with you
for a few days.

539
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,197
Yes, if you want.

540
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:28,506
Clara likes when you come
to visit us.

541
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,768
- Julien...
- What?

542
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,673
But...

543
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,886
What is it?

544
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,804
What have I...

545
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,652
What...
