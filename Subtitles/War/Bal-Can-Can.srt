1
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,989
Gennaro... Shhh, Gennaro!
Gennaro!

2
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,232
What's up, Carlo?
- A new guy just came in.

3
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,799
There, next to the
Norwegian.

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,871
I'm not Norwegian,
I'm Swedish!

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,830
And who's that?
- I don't know. Ask him.

6
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,234
Maybe he doesn't
understand Italian.

7
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,114
Look at his feet...
They look Spanish to me.

8
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,398
Shhh, Spanish guy...
Obrigado, hey! Obrigado...

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,876
"Obrigado" is a Portuguese
word, guys.

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,189
He's one of ours!

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,511
Hello, guys. It's a bit stuffy
in here...

12
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,279
Anybody got a cigarette?

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,552
No, smoking is not
allowed here!

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,433
He got you, he, he...

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,951
And how do you intend to
smoke, Carlo?

16
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,910
Hey, unknown... What's
your name?

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,196
Santino.

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,192
Hello, Santino.
We're Italians,

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
those guys there are
Frenchmen...

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,351
Enchante'!

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,237
The one next to you is
Knut the Dan...

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,110
I am Swedish!

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,236
Well, whatever! Then Kurt
the German...

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,588
Then sergeant John...

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,837
Thanks, guys. Where are
we, anyway?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,639
This is a fridge. This is
where they store us, the

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,348
dead people, in these
compartments.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,996
Oh, fuck! - Hey, Santino,
how come they labelled

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,549
you "unknown"? - We all
have our ending, boys:

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Some die from old
age, others from tumours,

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,755
I died because of my blood
brother!

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,199
Your blood bro' killed
you, eh?

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,475
No, I got killed because of
the son of the blood bro' of

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,631
my father... Ah, it's all
very complicated!

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,916
Use your own words,
Santino.

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,076
Ok, then! My story begins
a long time ago,

37
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,234
in Macedonia. Do you
know what Macedonia is?

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,192
Sure! It's a kind of salad.

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,318
Carlo! How can a person
be born in a salad?

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,517
"Macedonia" is the brand
of cigarettes that

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,829
Monica Bellucci smokes in
"Malena".

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,150
You don't know shit, guys.
Macedonia is a country,

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,868
down in the Balkans. Let's
start from the beginning.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,958
Some fifty years ago...

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,629
After the Second World War,
Macedonia was a part of

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,877
Tito's Yugoslavia. Very
important historical period,

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,197
ruling of the proletariat... all
ideology, you know? Quite a

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,677
limited environment for a
dynamic young man

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,996
like my father Vitomir.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,597
His blood brother Seraphim
was his best friend.

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,152
Vitomir and Seraphim were
like Little Caesars:

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,470
They dressed better than
Fred Buscaglione,

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,631
and boxed harder that
Rocky Marciano.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,071
When they showed up to
parties, they immediately

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,958
broke the girls' hearts...

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,196
and also the jaws of their
jealous boyfriends!

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,714
Those were poor times, but even
poor people like to dress up.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,231
Vitomir and Seraphim
started to make profit from

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,717
this human weakness, buying
goods in Italy and selling

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,871
them for five times their
price in Yugoslavia.

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,913
But the Yugoslav customs
showed no understanding

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,798
for their business
determination...

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,273
Anything to declare?

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,755
Well, personal luggage,
reference books...

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,070
Small stuff!
- Small stuff, yeah.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,918
Down on your knees!

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,516
The search for easy money
against the limitations

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,953
imposed by the law
led these talented young men

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,552
to embrace their destiny:
Shefket Ramadani!

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,633
Good job, money easy.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,635
Train arrive Friday.

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,390
Two.

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,638
In Dubrovnik get shipped on
boat...

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,477
Two hundred twenty
box! And in Dubrovnik:

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,559
My guards, my people, my
policeman, my engineer...

76
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,077
nobody touch you. We split
fifty-fifty!

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,999
Why fifty-fifty, eh?
Why not in thirds?

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,913
Why? Why because
fucking shit why!

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,196
Whattya got?
- Two pairs.

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,356
Me better. Straight.
That's why!

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,958
Fucking why...

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,558
Can ya see anythin', bro'?

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,956
I can see shit, bro'.
Well, fuck it.

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,995
Watch the wire, bro'!
Ouch!

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,073
They've turned on
the electricity.

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,555
Wanna play hard, eh?
Fuckin' bastards!

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,710
Gimme them pliers.

88
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,950
Don't have 'em, bro'...
- So fuck ya, bro'...

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,997
So fuck me, bro', I didn't
bring them.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,395
Never mind, bro'. I'll lift it
up and we'll go under.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,878
Ready, set, go...
Arghhh!

92
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,798
Hold on, bro'!

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,752
Don't give up, bro',
I beg ya!

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,829
Fuckin' commies!

95
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,872
Eh, we should be stealin'
in America...

96
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,718
...even the electricity is less
powerful there.

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,278
Less powerful, ya say?
Eh, that West...

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,148
Is this the carriage, bro'?

99
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,957
Got no idea, bro', guess so.
- Gimme the crowbar, bro'!

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,356
Don't have it, bro', didn't
bring it.

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,348
Sorry to say this, bro', but
you're a real piece of...

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,068
Halt! You've been caught
in the act of stealing the

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,714
property of the Yugoslav
People's Army.

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,797
Better surrender, you're
surrounded!

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,672
Beat it, bro'!
- Get lost, bro'!

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,552
Comrade soldiers, fire!

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,953
We're screwed...
- Run to the sea!

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,394
Unleash the dogs, soldiers!

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,669
Wait for me, bro'!

110
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,074
I'll wait for ya on
the shore, bro'...

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,958
Don't waste the bullets!
Catch them alive!

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,434
Please wait for me, bro'...

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,709
Show some character, bro'...
Ouch!

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,159
Argh! Ya wanna play hard,
eh?

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,032
Hold on, bro'!
Don't give up!

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,910
That evening, while the
laments of his blood brother

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,675
Seraphim echoed in the night,
my father Vitomir

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,115
swam across the entire
Adriatic Sea,

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,835
with his eyes
full with tears...

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,151
The next day he swam
into Bari

121
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,630
and applied for asylum
in Italy.

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,791
Name and surname?
- Vito.

123
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,988
Don Vito... Genovese.

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,077
In Italy Vitomir continued to
pursue intellectual goals:

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,959
He worked as a gigolo,
smuggled cigarettes, fixed

126
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,708
football games, he built
himself a solid career,

127
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,230
got married... But never, not
even in the last moments

128
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,154
of his life, did he forget his
blood brother.

129
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:20,719
Santino, my son... My life is
coming to its end...

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,557
But don't you ever forget
what Pat O'Brien says

131
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,958
in the movie "Angels
With Dirty Faces"...

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,031
"Let us pray for the boy
who couldn't run

133
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,709
as fast as I could"...

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,956
That also goes for my blood
brother Seraphim...

135
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,554
I heard he died,
a few years ago...

136
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,916
But he has a son...

137
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,239
If you ever find that your
little blood brother

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,151
is in trouble,
help him!

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,190
Yes, daddy! I give you
my word!

140
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,273
Of course, I completely
forgot about the promise

141
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,035
I made my father. I moved to
Rome, as a real Roman,

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,352
and opened a nightclub,
a fancy place.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,830
Until one day,
my phone rang...

144
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,994
Hello?
- Good afternoon.

145
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,116
May I speak to Santino
Genovese?

146
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,630
That day, for the first time in
my life, I heard the voice

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,713
of Trendafil Karanfilov.
- Who's Trendafil Karanfilov?

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,593
Trendafil is the son of the
blood brother Seraphim,

149
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,708
born out of wedlock between
Seraphim and an anonymous

150
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,314
female prisoner serving a
life sentence.

151
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,273
On the day of his birth, with a
sudden attack Israel declared

152
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,433
war to Egypt, Syria, Jordan
and Iraq.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,913
By chance or not, little
Trendafil was born on the

154
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,470
day when a war began... and
wars shall mark

155
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,989
his entire existence!

156
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,153
Trendafil grew up in an
orphanage. His guardians

157
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,834
believed that watching war
movies best hardens the

158
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,713
child's spirit. But while all
the other children had fun,

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,751
little Trendafil was scared to
death!

160
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,388
Children, today we shall learn
the letter "A".

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
"A" is the first letter of our alphabet...

162
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,679
That feeling of fear
developed in the years that

163
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,115
followed: On his first day at
school, General Augusto

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,276
Pinochet carried out a military
coup in Chile.

165
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,995
Trendafil! Don't tempt me!

166
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,152
He graduated when the civil
war in Nicaragua began...

167
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,311
Turn off the TV, you ass!

168
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,516
...He met the love of his life
on the day when

169
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,796
the conflict in Slovenia and
Croatia began...

170
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,590
...His first day at work was
the day when

171
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,671
the war in
Bosnia began...

172
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,398
...He got married when
NATO attacked Serbia...

173
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,630
As years went by, the gap
between wars

174
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,791
got smaller and smaller.

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,229
Deep down inside, he was
afraid. Deep inside

176
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,396
his heart, Trendafil was
preparing for war!

177
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,672
Until that spring, 2001...

178
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,155
During the day, the Albanian
terrorists have

179
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,475
been opening fire at the
special forces of the

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,551
Macedonian army and police,
all over the

181
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,432
front-line declared as the
so-called

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,477
"free territory of Albanians in
Macedonia".

183
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,632
Supposedly these terrorist
groups have been

184
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,196
entering Macedonia through
illegal crossings from Kosovo,

185
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,596
however the origin of
their heavy artillery remains

186
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,631
unknown. The fighting
is approaching

187
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,432
the suburbs of the
Macedonian capital...

188
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,198
Oh, dear!

189
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,792
THE CAPITAL
BESIEGED BY TERRORISTS

190
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,993
You really are driving
me crazy...

191
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,350
Why won't you open
the door?

192
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,998
If I were able to get up, I'd be
outside with a machinegun!

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,953
You're not missing much...
They've been shooting all

194
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,718
day long, but haven't shot
anything yet!

195
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,429
You've been trying
to walk again, eh?

196
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,034
He took my remote control...
- Oh, for God's sake, mother!

197
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,078
He took my remote, and he's
been watching

198
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,630
documentaries about animals
all day. While outside

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,593
patriots get killed, your
husband is watching

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,950
giraffes in Africa. Moron!

201
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,633
Did you take your pills
this morning?

202
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,070
If your father were alive, he
would have instantly died

203
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,112
of shame! Thank you Lord,
for taking him in time.

204
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,953
Mother, Trendafil is a
peaceful person...

205
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,992
You don't say? Then why did
he marry an Army Officer's

206
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,509
daughter, if he's so
afraid of wars?

207
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,312
If he had the balls...

208
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,795
he would have given you five
children by now!

209
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,713
Trendafil, give her the
remote... Trendafil!

210
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,750
Come on, give it back...
- What a moron, tsk, tsk, tsk...

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,472
Let go of it... Let go, I said...

212
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,919
If this schmuck gets you
pregnant,

213
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,992
you'll have a crocodile!
- Let go! Let go, you fucking...

214
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,396
Don't beg, hit the bastard!

215
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
Hell, mama! Do you have
any idea how expensive

216
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,315
food is in wartime?

217
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,914
Give me those eggs...
Give them!

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,230
Make him give me the
remote first!

219
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,311
Trendafil, give her the
remote, you assholes,

220
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,590
you're gonna fuck up
my bloody nerves!

221
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,192
Look, even the neighbours
are complaining...

222
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,472
You'll both pay for this!

223
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,637
Jango the Soap!
- Jango the Soap?

224
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,598
Now you're fucked,
my little son-in-law...

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,756
Come in, Jango...
Jango, come!

226
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,673
Hey, Jango!
Come in, Jango boy...

227
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,751
Keep quiet, for
heavens sake!

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,630
Oh, Jango?

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,710
Oooh, Ruza...
How are you?

230
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,352
Oh, just doing some house
work... And how about you?

231
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,274
Doing my job, Ruza.
- Really? - Yeah...

232
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,356
And when did you get out of
prison?

233
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,431
Oh, that's past, Ruza.
I'm a volunteer now.

234
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,752
Everything for the fatherland!
- Right, well done.

235
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,236
By the way... Trendafil?
Is he at home?

236
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,793
Trendafil... has gone
to a spa.

237
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,515
Really?
Is he there to cure his...?

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,469
No, he isn't.

239
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,595
- Well then?

240
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,358
He took my mother
to the spa.

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,948
Granny Zumbula is ill?
- Spondylosis.

242
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,999
Uh-huh... Anyway, Ruza, I've
got this little letter for

243
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,829
Trendafil: An invitation for
military therapy, heh, heh...

244
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,393
Reservist. He has to call in
by Monday.

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,593
It's no use, Jango, he won't be
back by Monday.

246
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,790
But he'll have to come back
sometime, Ruza...

247
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,911
He can't hide forever!

248
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,875
Ah, Ruza, Ruza...

249
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,559
Eh, Jango...

250
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,799
So, you'll see Trendafil
when he comes back,

251
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,235
and you can settle things with
him... some time.

252
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,396
I'll see him for sure, Ruza.
It's easy now...

253
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,789
It's war.

254
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,760
Well then, Jango.
- Well then, Ruza...

255
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,870
Spondilosis, eh?

256
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,350
Stop!

257
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,830
Stop, you cunt of a deserter,

258
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,678
I'm gonna kill you!

259
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,711
Trendafil, don't provoke me,
you'll make me go

260
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,713
back to prison,
I swear you will!

261
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,757
Now you're dead,
you fag!

262
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,673
Traitor!
Freemason pussy!

263
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,914
It's not safe. Jango
waits in ambush in the elevator.

264
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,953
He bribed the housekeeper
into mining the basement.

265
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,753
There's no way you can get
away from him!

266
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,309
Some policemen came
yesterday...

267
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,478
they want you for the police
reserve troops.

268
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,070
I told them to make
arrangements with

269
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,873
the army, either here
or there...

270
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,672
They tried to pull a fast one
on me: If you got killed I

271
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,509
would get two military
pensions instead of one!

272
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,235
What's up now?

273
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,311
I can't take it any more, Ruza.
If they catch me I won't even

274
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,598
make it to the front line...
I'll die on the road...

275
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,595
Come on, this war won't last
long... we just have to

276
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,718
hide for a bit. If we leave
early in the morning,

277
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,195
we'll be in Bulgaria
in an hour.

278
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,278
What do you mean Bulgaria?
- On the Black Sea.

279
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,990
The tourist season is about to
begin there, we'll get jobs

280
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,236
on the black labor market...
you as a bartender,

281
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,595
me as a waitress,
mama will help out...

282
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,555
What do you mean, mama?

283
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,989
You ruthless animal!

284
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,516
You would leave mama here
to get bombed

285
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,875
by the mujahedins,
you scoundrel!

286
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,269
She's an old woman, she'll
forget something

287
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,470
plugged in, she'll
burn down the flat,

288
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,398
you retarded vermin!
- Bulgaria!

289
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,233
Ruza, my child, where are
we going so early?

290
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,198
To the sea, mommy,
to the sea.

291
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,279
The sea, love? And what about
your good-for-nothing loser?

292
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,868
Let's send him to the
Army first,

293
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,355
maybe a grenade will
kill him, no?

294
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,557
Don't say that, mama,
it's a pity.

295
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,070
A pity, why? I say, from my
mouth into God's ears!

296
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,111
Ruza, my child...

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,910
There he is!
- Quiet, mama, quiet!

298
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Hell, quiet! Where's Jango?
Jango! Jango, come!

299
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,358
Shhh! Quit it!
- Where are you, Jango!

300
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,478
Jango, come! Jango, boy!
- Be quiet, mama, be quiet!

301
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,037
Jango, where are you,
Jango...

302
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,756
Jango, where are you,
Jango...

303
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,835
Wake up, Jango!

304
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,158
Now you're fucked,
neighbour!

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,077
Now you're fucked...

306
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,589
And so, my blood brother
began his journey East,

307
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,470
towards the rising sun... As
Alan Bourdillion Traherne

308
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,757
said in one western: "Over
the mountains of the Moon,

309
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,348
and through the valley of the
shadow, he rides,

310
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,029
boldly rides, until he finds
El Dorado".

311
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,555
And what happened next,
Santino? - Did they make it?

312
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,438
Well, it was a close call, but
then nature decided to play

313
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,752
its part. That spring was
unusually hot. Veeeery hot...

314
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,631
original traditional handicrafts

315
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,713
The engine. Looks like the
engine has overheated!

316
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,673
I'm cold. - Oh, please, you're
such a child.

317
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,115
Why didn't you say so, we
would've stopped...

318
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,515
I was hot. - Oh, is that so?
And now you're not?

319
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,677
Now I'm cold.
- Cold? In this heat?

320
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,075
Oh, come on, mother,
don't screw with me...

321
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,075
"...check diphthongs."

322
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,469
Where could those
diphthongs be?

323
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,756
I gave her two valiums.
- For her stool?

324
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,713
No, for the nerves.
- Oh, yeah...

325
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,549
Oh, it's so hot. The air
is heavy...

326
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,837
Hey, here it is: "...check the
pressure in the valves

327
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,712
of the internal combustion
engine..."

328
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,870
We'll be there by tonight.

329
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,828
Wow, I haven't seen the
sea in seven years.

330
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,599
Nowadays even the seas aren't
as safe as they used to be,

331
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,276
Russians with submarines
everywhere... clutch...

332
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,910
If we find jobs,
we can stay longer.

333
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,958
Mom's nerves might settle down...

334
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,555
Maybe you'll get better, too.

335
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,713
The sea air has healing powers.
- For my ulcer?

336
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,549
I'm not talking about your
ulcer. I'm talking about...

337
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,431
...children!
- Oh, that...

338
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,473
If I could choose, I'd have
twins. I'd do that maybe

339
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,875
five or six more times,
until I've had enough.

340
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,791
Damn you're clumsy!

341
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,558
Here, take this towel,
come on.

342
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,194
And go get mama, we
should be going!

343
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,440
Ruza sent me,
to take you to the car.

344
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,197
Granny Zumbula?

345
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,675
Look, I'll take you now,
very carefully,

346
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,268
but don't resist, okay?

347
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,519
Ruzaaaa!

348
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,158
Well... she looks dead to me!

349
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,271
She's dead, very dead.

350
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,438
What was her name?
- Zumbula (Hyacinth).

351
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,349
Zumbula... Like the flower,
hyacinth? - Yes.

352
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,434
Zum-bu-la... And the
lady is...?

353
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,471
Her daughter, my wife.

354
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,990
I'm asking for her name.
- Ah, the name... Ruza (Rose).

355
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,833
Also like the flower?
- Well, yes... Like a rose.

356
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,479
Okay, Ru-za...
And you are...

357
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,556
Trendafil (Rosebud).

358
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,676
Also... flower?
- Also!

359
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,676
And your last name?
- Karanfilov (Flowerson).

360
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,716
Okay... if you say so!

361
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,108
And the certificate?
- What?

362
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,835
The death certificate,
stating that she's dead.

363
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,794
Ah, that certificate? Eh,
Karanfilov, Karanfilov...

364
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,675
And how am I supposed to
know that she's really dead?

365
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,631
But you just said
she looked dead.

366
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,550
Well, of course she does,
how can she not look dead...

367
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,270
But what if she's in a coma
and then wakes up?

368
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,718
Well, we could wait,
but I doubt...

369
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,317
And you, how come you're
so persistent?

370
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,877
All I want is the certificate,
so that we can bury her...

371
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,117
And who's to say you didn't
cut her throat?

372
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,148
Cut her throat?
- Hypothetically speaking.

373
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,069
Excuse me, officer, but I'm an
unemployed worker...

374
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,359
Sure, I believe you, but put
yourself in my shoes.

375
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,628
There has to be a procedure:
The doctors must come,

376
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,708
examine her, confirm
that she's dead,

377
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,595
and then give you the
certificate... That's it!

378
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,154
And now? Where will I find
you those doctors now?

379
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,316
Don't go to the village
infirmary,

380
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,030
everyone is a dentist there.
Try downtown.

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,070
And have a nice time
by the sea!

382
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,678
The door!

383
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,831
Good afternoon.

384
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,951
Dupuytren contracture...

385
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
from bending of the
palmar aponeurosis.

386
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,751
Vaginal cytology...

387
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,871
Abdominal
hysterectomy...

388
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,274
Pharyngoesophageal
diverticulum!

389
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,315
Say "Pharyngoesophageal
diverticulum"!

390
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,794
Pharyngoesophageal.

391
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,914
Take your clothes off!

392
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,589
Actually, doctor, I'm here
for something else...

393
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,070
I studied medicine and
natural sciences, sacrificed

394
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,915
three decades of my life in
order to save myself from

395
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,794
primitive creatures trying to
place themselves above

396
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,559
the level of their own
competence.

397
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,038
Outside, in the little pigsty
you call your home,

398
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,557
you can make decisions,
give orders,

399
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,558
but in here: You are mine.
Take off your underpants!

400
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,592
Erection?
- I can.

401
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,550
Ejaculation?

402
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,119
Doctor, I'm not really
comfortable with this...

403
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,470
Me neither.
Got any children?

404
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,272
No.

405
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,071
Does it hurt?
- No.

406
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,237
Does it burn?
- No.

407
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,716
Does it itch?
- A little bit.

408
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,835
It's good. - Is it
really good, doctor?

409
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,236
Good. No side effects.
Enlargement is not a

410
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,195
risky surgery, but it requires
sexual abstinence

411
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,749
We'll slice it a little...
- Slice what?

412
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,589
Your penis. In order to
extend it, I have to slice it!

413
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,796
No, doctor, please,
I'm here for the granny.

414
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,354
What granny?

415
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,198
For a sex change?

416
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,112
No... Look doctor. My granny
Zumbula. She's dead.

417
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,914
Did you notify
the police?

418
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,672
Sure I did. They
referred me to you...

419
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,519
Yes, but I'm a gynaecologist.
Go to the city council.

420
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,672
I can't go there, doctor. She
was a foreign citizen.

421
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,835
Go to your embassy, then!

422
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,353
Doctor, have some
understanding for my

423
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,074
misfortune. I'm a political
refugee!

424
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,552
Aren't we all?

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,199
Tell them that doctor
Safarafov sent you.

426
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,393
Doctor Safarafov sent me...

427
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,717
Where's the document
from the cemetery?

428
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,075
What cemetery?
- For elephants!

429
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,834
Where are you going
to bury her?

430
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,678
Well... Wherever you
say, we will...

431
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,791
Then you need a receipt
for a purchased grave.

432
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,995
What purchased grave?

433
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,869
Trying to pull a fast one
on me, aren't you?

434
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,356
First I give you a
certificate, and then you

435
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,399
people bury yourselves in
gardens and basements,

436
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,437
just to save some money.
Well, that won't work!

437
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,790
It won't work!

438
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,998
No use in begging, why didn't
you make a reservation

439
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,635
in time? - It's not like we
planned it, the granny was a

440
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,478
foreigner, just passing through.

441
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,909
Oh, great! We have no
space for our own folks,

442
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,190
and now we even have
to bury foreigners!

443
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,954
We don't wish to impose,
it just happened...

444
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,435
But there's no space,
buddy! No free space!

445
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,039
This is a cemetery,
not "McDonald's"!

446
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,952
You have to make a
reservation before hand... Ouch!

447
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,116
Hey, be careful, man!

448
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,710
The other day they brought
in a guy, died in a car crash.

449
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,114
I buried him together
with another guy

450
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,158
who died from a heart attack.
The relatives complained:

451
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,352
How could I bury him with
a total stranger? I said:

452
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
Now they have all the time
in the world, they'll get

453
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,391
acquainted. What can I do
when there's no space?

454
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,838
And how about burning her?

455
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,112
The crematorium
doesn't work!

456
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,040
We called the repairmen
two weeks ago,

457
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,792
and we're still waiting
for them.

458
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,191
There must be some
solution...

459
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,719
Two, gimme two...

460
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,152
To get myself some beer.
- Is that so?

461
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,908
Now look: We're planning to
rent another two acres.

462
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,595
I'll put you on the waiting list.
If it happens,

463
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,509
you'll be first in line!
- No, not me, the granny.

464
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,309
All same to me!
Call me, okay?

465
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,675
Okay... Hey, when
should I call you?

466
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,760
Well, either June or July.
There are procedures

467
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,560
for everything. First we have
to get permission from

468
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,280
the land registration office,
then we have to go to the city

469
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,475
council, in the end we have to
notify the police...

470
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,791
This is a modern country, there
are procedures for everything!

471
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,955
She started to smell...

472
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,359
At the restaurant they told
me they won't give us

473
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,110
any more ice... They need
it for the customers.

474
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,471
Want a beer?

475
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,233
Well, gimme one.
- Here, it'll refresh you.

476
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,231
May God rest her soul!
- God rest her soul...

477
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,672
Oh, mother, mother...
- Ruza! I have an idea!

478
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,877
It's so cheap, Ruza! For
every three carpets you

479
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,150
buy, you get a free
tapestry!

480
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,271
Geez!
- Put it down.

481
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,471
I made sure it matched
the curtains...

482
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,160
Which curtains? - The ones
in our living room.

483
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,549
Which curtains? - The ones
in our living room.

484
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,033
You don't think we'll
throw it away?

485
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,276
We paid money for it...

486
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,079
Well, it's nice.
- Of course it's nice.

487
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,475
With ethnic motifs. Do
you know how much a

488
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,790
carpet like this would
cost in America?

489
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,908
God help us now!
Take her from the head.

490
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,157
She wasn't so heavy
when she was alive.

491
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,673
Maybe she soaked up
some of the water...

492
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,030
What do you think she is,
a sponge? Put her down!

493
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,231
It's a shame for the carpet.
We should have squeezed

494
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,272
out the water first...
- It's hot, she'll dry out.

495
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,632
Take that side!

496
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,109
Hey, are you sure about this?
- It's too late to turn back

497
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,958
now. C'mon, ready,
steady, go?

498
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,788
Steady, ready, go!
- Oh, c'mon, wrap!

499
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,748
Another 20 kilometres to
the border. When you

500
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,598
get home, go straight to
the hospital!

501
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,631
Get the certificate,
buy the coffin,

502
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,239
organize the funeral,
if anyone asks for a bribe

503
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,555
bribe him, of course!
When you're home,

504
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,955
everything is easier.
- And what about you?

505
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,429
I'm not coming back
until the war is over.

506
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,471
You'll have to cross the
border without me.

507
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,034
Take it easy! Don't get
nervous! Just act normal,

508
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,196
like we're acting normal
at this minute!

509
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,998
What if they
unwrap the carpet?

510
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,951
Don't worry, I have a plan
for everything!

511
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,108
Check how much money
we have left?

512
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,596
Bulgarian or German?
- Both. We'll buy

513
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,554
meat, cans, dairy products...
We'll fill the entire trailer!

514
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,675
- Geez!

515
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,233
The customs officers will
think you're

516
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,918
smuggling food. They'll all
be looking inside the

517
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,036
trailer, no one will look at
the carpet!

518
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,631
You know something?
- Huh?

519
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,393
You weren't like this before...

520
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,949
Now you're somehow...
more determined.

521
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,835
It's the war, honey. I saw this
program on TV once,

522
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,788
they said that when a man
faces death, something like

523
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,592
an instinct suddenly
woke up inside him...

524
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,154
Survival instinct, you mean.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

525
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,713
Well. Makes sense to me.

526
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,669
Bastards! Half of this stuff is
past its "best before" date...

527
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,354
So what. These
days everyone is afraid of

528
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,556
the mad cow disease.
And if you're carrying

529
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,875
bad food, no one will
even ask about...

530
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,997
...the carpet!
- Oh, mama!

531
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,069
Damn Bulgarians!
They've stolen the carpet!

532
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,149
Ruza!

533
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,196
You murderer!
Bloodsucker!

534
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,950
You'll send us all
to our graves!

535
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,709
I'll listen to you once,
and this is what happens...

536
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,552
You monster!

537
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,915
Mother was right, we should
have turned you over to

538
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,673
Jango the Soap, to be
court-martialed, you animal!

539
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,433
Go ahead, cry, just keep on
crying! You'll do whatever

540
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,755
it takes to find mom!

541
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,557
If you want to kill me,
kill me on the spot...

542
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,109
Where could I find your
mother now?

543
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,428
Where?

544
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,036
Stolen things are where
the thieves are, that's where.

545
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,120
But you're such a schmuck,
they'll steal you, too!

546
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,714
You can't just do that on
your own.

547
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,192
Your late father, Seraphim...
- Don't even mention him!

548
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,949
...he used to tell stories about
his friend in Italy,

549
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,589
some rascal that could sell
his own mother...

550
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,110
Vitomir. But he's dead.
- Yes, but he had a son...

551
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,470
What was his name?

552
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,033
Santino.
Santino Genovese.

553
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,472
That's right!

554
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,199
If we want justice, we must
go to Don Genovese!

555
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,072
Hello?
- Good afternoon.

556
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,708
May I speak to...
- May I speak to.

557
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,275
May I speak to Santino
Genovese?

558
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,558
That very moment, I heard
the terrible voice of the past!

559
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,077
"Santino... Help your little
blood brother

560
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,195
if he's ever in trouble..."

561
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,390
I am Santino Genovese, the
son of the late Vitomir.

562
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,353
I came to pay off an old debt.

563
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,152
The essence of every suspense
action, bro', is to keep cool.

564
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,840
Like Jackie Chan in "Shanghai
Noon", or Dolph Lundgren

565
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,674
in "Red Scorpion"...More
salt! Or the blond chick

566
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,314
in "The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre", get it?

567
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,311
What's he saying?
- Just a moment...

568
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,034
Ah, here it is: Chainsaw!
- What about Chainsaw?

569
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,994
Chainsaw, that's it, chainsaw,
bravo! So, no panic.

570
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,759
What are we looking for?
A granny inside a stolen

571
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,117
carpet? Okay, no problem!
Where do we look for stolen

572
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,437
carpets? In a supermarket?
Don't be ridiculous, bro'.

573
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,711
The stolen stuff is where the
stolen stuff dealers are.

574
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,593
And who works with the
stolen-stuff dealers?

575
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,274
Everybody knows: The Pope!
Just a moment...

576
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,318
Hello, Pope? Ciao, Sonny
here, Vito's boy.

577
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,638
How are you? Celebrating?
Your brother is out on parole?

578
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,229
His bro' is a paedophile.
He traded on the Internet

579
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,032
with stolen credit cards.
What a son of a bitch!

580
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,549
That's great, give him
my congratulations!

581
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,833
Listen, Pope, I need some
information: Who runs the

582
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,956
stolen furniture business
in Southeast Europe?

583
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,396
Wait a second...

584
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,430
Uh-huh... And what's
the address?

585
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,992
You sure? No, I'm not in
a mess, just helpin' out...

586
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,517
I'm just helpin'...
Papa, don't preach!

587
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,076
Thanks, Pope,
you're a dogma!

588
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,276
Dirty motherfucker...

589
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,190
Have you ever heard of
some Greek guy named...

590
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,918
...what the fuck is his name...

591
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,033
...Homer?

592
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,638
Can't have strong lights.

593
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,195
Because of eyes.

594
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,869
Live with blinds down.
Sleep during day,

595
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,595
do business night.
Like Batman, he, he...

596
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,472
So, you search carpet, eh?
And something in carpet.

597
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,478
And what in carpet?
Don't want say me, eh?

598
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,110
I have bathroom tiles.
Italian tiles. Very pretty.

599
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,470
Madam could put
tiles instead carpet.

600
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,556
Tiles, tiles, tiles...

601
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,672
So, you want carpet only?
Why, is that carpet fly?

602
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,955
Homer jokes.

603
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,834
Aha, fish tank!
Want to buy fish tank?

604
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,952
Very pretty. All glass.
Gold fish swim.

605
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,674
Ouch! Easy, bro'...
- Sorry, bro'...

606
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,751
Wait, wait, wait! I know
everything about carpet...

607
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,956
Carpet brought one
Romanian, lousy player,

608
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,672
steals cheep stuff
only...

609
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,199
And carpets no good,
don't sell...

610
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,829
Wait, wait, wait! In my
job technique is: Keep good

611
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,878
stuff, ship out bad stuff.
Carpet shipped out.

612
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,396
Where to? - To Belgrade,
the Serbia. Have business

613
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,195
partner there, powerful
man, great man,

614
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,591
holds territory from Danube
to Drina... Carpet there.

615
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,636
Enough!

616
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,114
Ruza!

617
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,272
You listen to me, Ruza,
and go back home.

618
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,595
This is a man's job. Blood
brother! - Oh, Bro'...

619
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,074
Do you know what
Chucky Chelmer says

620
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,156
in "The Last Cowboy"?
Let's ride!

621
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,438
Okay, you'll translate later!

622
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,437
Belgrade in Serbia.

623
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,270
Guys, I'm no innocent
Little Red Riding Hood,

624
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,512
but that city is stranger
that the strangest forest.

625
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,355
The misery and
glory of a former empire!

626
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,031
While two gorillas
were touching my balls,

627
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,232
I'd the feeling that perhaps
old Homer had set us up...

628
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,628
...but I was wrong!

629
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,754
Told you, man, I'm not lying
I don't carry guns,

630
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,440
it's not my style...
Where's your boss?

631
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,199
Mr. Veselin will
receive you later.

632
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,278
At the moment he's busy
with his afternoon jogging.

633
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,356
Tell them that they've
come to the wrong place...

634
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,631
Mr. Veselin says you've
come to the wrong place...

635
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,638
Tell them that this
is not a tavern,

636
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,353
but the honest home
of an honest man.

637
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,676
He says that this
isn't a tavern,

638
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,633
but the honest home
of an honest man...

639
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,718
It's true that I am
Veselin Kabadajich,

640
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,633
but it's not true that
I'm a carpet dealer.

641
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,435
It's true that his name
is Veselin Kabadajich,

642
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,677
but it's not true that
he deals with carepets!

643
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,752
Carpets.
- Carpets...

644
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,718
I'm a serious Serbian
businessman, I publish

645
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,552
one... No, two daily
newspapers and two

646
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,836
magazines, I own a
TV and a radio station,

647
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,712
I have two factories,
one for packaging,

648
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,069
the other for meat products...

649
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,590
He's a serious Serbian
businessman, he publishes

650
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,154
three daily newspapers
and two magazines,

651
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,559
he owns a TV and a
radio station, he has two...

652
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,832
C'mon, faster, faster!
- He has two factories, one

653
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
for packaging and the
other for meat products!

654
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,115
And what's this fucking carpet?

655
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,389
What would I want a
carpet for, I could have

656
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,953
millions of carpets, fuck you
and your fucking carpets!

657
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,560
Am I right?
- Right, right.

658
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,198
And you know what? Tell
him not to fuck with me,

659
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,309
'cause I could kill
him on the spot,

660
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,433
or I'll call the police! - And
he's warning you not to

661
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,393
fuck with him, he's an
emotional person and he'll

662
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,552
kill you on the spot,
or he'll call the police!

663
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,119
You can choose!

664
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,390
Well... better police, then.
- Get the fuck out of here!

665
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,873
Calm down.

666
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,672
Let's talk about it, eh?

667
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,875
Tell your boss that Santino
Genovese is not a dickhead.

668
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,600
I have friends who keep me
informed, so it's no use

669
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,840
trying to fool me. Tell him,
I know that he's hiding

670
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,035
from the new government
because of his involvement

671
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,628
in organized crime, I know
that he fucked up in the

672
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,756
Balkan Wars, and I know
that an international

673
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,592
warrant for war crimes
has been issued on him.

674
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,312
Translate.

675
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,035
He says that he has friends
who keep him informed...

676
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,070
And he knows, errr... that
you were in Srebrenica...

677
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,634
Shut your trap!

678
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,875
That's what the times were
like. Hungry bums on one

679
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,195
side, and piles of
money on the other.

680
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,948
And then what? Leave
the money to the bums?

681
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,314
Do you think I'm crazy?

682
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,672
As for the war thing...
First of all, it's not true!

683
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,878
And second - if it were
true, they provoked us!

684
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,951
Am I right or not?
- Right, always right!

685
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,548
Right, of course! And if I've
killed somebody, I've done

686
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,320
it by accident, and
always for my people!

687
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,513
And when the bastards
come to take me to Hague,

688
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,518
my people will defend me.
I've had this printed in

689
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,438
10.000 copies. I'm going
to organize spontaneous

690
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,080
demonstrations. I'll make a
minefield in front of this

691
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,880
house! I'm going to
mine myself if I have to!

692
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,236
I didn't make this fortune
to spend it in jail, clear?

693
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,757
I have nothing to do with
your carpet. You think I

694
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,829
made my millions by
stealing carpets? Look!

695
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,600
Stolen cars - one million.
Saving houses with

696
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,720
pyramid interest rates -
two million. Smuggled

697
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,200
cigarettes - three million.
Forged foreign currencies,

698
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,316
false Schengen visas,
secret transportation of

699
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,953
Arabs into the EU countries...

700
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,593
Homer said that he had
sent our carpet to you.

701
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,756
Homer is full of shit!

702
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,920
Know what? I'll kill
him when I see him!

703
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,832
I'm a merchant: Buy here,
sell there. I didn't even

704
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,357
open Homer's truck,
just shipped it further...

705
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,198
Further, where?
- To Montenegro!

706
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,837
But you never heard
this from me, get it?

707
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,639
But why to Montenegro,
shit? - Because Italy is on

708
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,320
the other side, and they
ship the merchandise via

709
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,351
sea to your Rome,
because all shit leads

710
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,755
to Rome. That's why!
- Right, right!

711
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,475
And who the fuck are you?

712
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,993
Karanfilov Trendafil.

713
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,320
Krfl... Listen, you Karanfil,
why is that carpet

714
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,949
so damn important?
- There's a granny inside it.

715
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,036
You have a granny
wrapped in the carpet?

716
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,475
Well, it kind of happened...

717
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,388
He, he, you mother fuckers...

718
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,716
And then they call me
a war criminal, he, he...

719
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,068
Eh, ya see?

720
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,432
C'mon, get out of
here... or your granny will

721
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,630
take a tour around the
Colosseum, he, he...

722
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,830
It's OK, they're free to go.

723
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,908
Oh, fuck!

724
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,831
Hello? Hello, Ruza...
We're going to the sea.

725
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,788
What do you want me
to bring you? Hello?

726
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,592
Okay, the carpet,
but besides that carpet,

727
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,914
is there anything
else you want?

728
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,872
She really likes seashells.
- Ruza, eh?

729
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,989
Hello?
- Romance.

730
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,271
What?
- Not Milano-mance.

731
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,117
Not Napoli-mance.

732
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,434
Roma-nce!

733
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,592
Hallo? Listen, I'll call
you from the beach, okay?

734
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,150
Great! Like the beaches
of Haliakaloa.

735
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,039
Fog. I've been afraid of the
fog ever since I was a little

736
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,280
boy. I used to believe that
ghosts lived in the fog...

737
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,996
They said that the King
of the ghosts was called

738
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,078
Karaconjool, and his wife
was Kurawella... Childish stuff!

739
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,553
Shhh! - Don't shhh me,
it's all true!

740
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,796
Be quiet!

741
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,916
Ghosts...

742
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,593
With this kiss I swear
there'll be no evil blood

743
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,918
between us. On my
honor, good name, and

744
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,509
faith inside me. Amen.

745
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,875
So, honor, name, faith
inside me, amen...

746
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,715
Your turn, man!

747
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,392
Hell! They don't
know the password!

748
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,193
Please, don't! Don't, for
God's sake... - God's sake!

749
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,635
God is for friends,
a bullet is for enemies.

750
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,199
What are you?
- Macedonians!

751
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,192
Macedonians, eh? I had
this chick over there...

752
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,193
This... Samantha.
Do you know her?

753
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,958
Samantha?
- Samantha, Samantha!

754
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,754
Kill him, he doesn't know!
- Answer clearly and precisely:

755
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,680
Do you work for Teddy
Bear? Yes or no?

756
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,669
Yes!
- No!

757
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:05,591
Look, we're here for the
carpet... To bargain for...

758
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,153
Oh, you want a bargain?

759
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,154
Why didn't you say so,
you almost got killed...

760
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,638
Lower your guns, reveal
the merchandise...

761
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,153
These are customers!

762
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:27,919
Here it is: Pure heroin,
first class cocaine, LSD, ecstasy,

763
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,554
...if you want something
lighter, I have some

764
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,719
smooth hashish, a dead
mouth could smoke it!

765
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,394
Here, see for yourself!
- Thanks, I don't smoke.

766
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,318
C'mon, it's never
too late to start.

767
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,198
Okay, then...

768
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,118
It's good, isn't it?
- It's a bit strong.

769
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,432
But we're here for
something else...

770
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,113
We're looking for a carpet.
- A carpet?

771
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,558
A carpet! From Belgrade,
for the floor...

772
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,320
To be honest, this one
is wrapped up,

773
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,515
but it's still a carpet...
Go ahead, you tell him...

774
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,438
Carpet. Granny.
- That's it, bravo!

775
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,352
There's a granny in it.
- A granny?

776
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,751
A dead granny. - Gra-nny.
Gimme a smoke...

777
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,274
Totally wrapped up granny!

778
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,276
What's the
word for "wrapped"?

779
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,833
How the fuck should
I know, gimme the weed...

780
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,474
Rolled! Rolled in the
middle of the carpet.

781
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,113
Oh, fuck! Have you been
putting mushrooms

782
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,754
in our hashish again?

783
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,551
Hello? Teddy Bear,
is that you?

784
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,989
Fuck your daddy, Teddy!
Where the fuck are those

785
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,991
fuckin' boats? Never mind
that I'm waiting, fuck me,

786
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,350
but the clients in
Rotterdam are waiting!

787
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,114
The carpet! - Hey, Bear,
wait! Do you happen to have

788
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,710
some kind of carpets?
Don't have any?

789
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,560
There aren't any, fuck it!
Hey you, hurry up, a police

790
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,630
patrol could show up...
- Thanks, bro'!

791
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,268
I don't care if they
confiscate it, but the

792
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,591
bastards will resell
it for a lower price, get it?

793
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,275
Savo?

794
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,596
Punisha, get your ass
down to the sea, and wait

795
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,552
for Teddy Bear.
- Savo? Savo! - Eh?

796
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,035
I know where the carpet is.
- Where?

797
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,677
When we were trading with the
Tsutsi clan, during the raid...

798
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,474
...there was a Bosnian there,
buying carpets for

799
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,752
his dusk... I mean,
his mosque.

800
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,958
Wow, Blindy is right!
The one from Chaprljane!

801
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,588
Yeah! - The carpet you're
looking for could be there.

802
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,920
Chepprljaneh?
- Chaprljane!

803
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,716
Japprljane, yeah...

804
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,149
It's up there, in Bosnia,
South of Sarajevo.

805
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,836
Cool, it's Punisha!

806
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,156
It's a patrol!

807
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,515
Chepprljaneh, Chaprljane,
Japprljane...

808
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,836
Run away, brave men!

809
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,157
What the fuck did
you smoke? Napalm?

810
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,433
Slow down, bro'...
- Get in the car! Step on it!

811
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,437
Savo, save yourself!

812
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,319
No way! I'm not leaving it
to the enemy!

813
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,432
Hey, it's the police! - What
police, they're murderers!

814
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,397
Step on it! Step on it!

815
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,839
My goods!

816
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,318
I'm ruined...

817
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,950
Wait, brother! Wait!

818
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,080
Oh my, oh my,
I'm a black cuckoo,

819
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,560
Oh my, oh my,
I'm a black cuckoo,

820
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,074
Oh my, oh my,
I'm a black cuckoo,

821
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,795
Black heart, black eye,
where are you my Luka,

822
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,439
rise from the grave,
stand up alive,

823
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:42,115
kill our foes,
make them die!

824
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,552
Ah, Luka, my brother...

825
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,078
Killed by those damned
Rizvanbegovichs!

826
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,353
You are the ninth from our
house that they've killed...

827
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,118
But their end is nigh:
The head of Osman

828
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,356
Rizvanbegovich will hang
from our tower,

829
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,391
or my name is not
Mate Prkachin!

830
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,869
Hey, Prkachins!

831
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,878
Give us back our mosque,
before we kill you all!

832
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,198
Jozo, wait! Wait!
- Hey, Prkachins...

833
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,794
Wait until he shows himself.

834
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,958
As soon as you see
his fat head, fire!

835
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,832
Osman! If you don't turn
on the pipe...

836
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,110
...I'll shit in the middle
of your mosque!

837
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,152
You'll die of thirst,
you filthy bastards!

838
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,478
Mate... - Eh?
- Look at that!

839
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,195
Who the fuck are they?

840
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,718
They have some foreign
plates, like UN forces.

841
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,751
Maybe they are members
of some foreign mission?

842
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,552
If they are... we're fucked!

843
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:02,513
Hello, Ruza, we're in
Bosnia. Ruz... No signal!

844
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,399
It's deserted just like in
"The Law Of The Colt",

845
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,158
when Chaba Hogan
comes to Mexico

846
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,311
to avenge his father Enrique.

847
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,835
Osman, the whore is back!

848
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,797
Faik, take aim!
Don't let her come!

849
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,399
There's a girl.
- Eh?

850
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,516
A girl, I said. It's some girl.
- Oh, a girl?

851
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,712
Eh?
- I said, it's a girl.

852
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,271
Hey, girl! Girl!
- Girl! Hey, girl!

853
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,879
Look at the slut, fuckin'
bitch of a whore... Shoot!

854
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,679
Fire her ass, Faik!

855
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,512
Oh, fuck it! Give me my
eye drops...

856
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,116
Fuck you, blind fucks! You
shot my Luka full of holes,

857
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,840
and didn't even
scratch the whore!

858
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,479
Scratch her yourself,
she's yours, not ours.

859
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,789
Looks like it's over...

860
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,593
Ours? I'll fuck both of you,
that's how ours she is!

861
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,280
Watch your tongue, Mate,
or a bomb could blow you off!

862
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,158
Or I could blow your head off
with my bare hands, eh?

863
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,430
Or those hands of yours could
jerk my cock, eh?

864
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,631
Or I could bite off that cock
of yours with my teeth, eh?

865
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,877
Osman! The UNPROFOR
guys are alive!

866
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,638
Alive? How the fuck...?

867
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,711
Good afternoon. Keep
doing what you're doing,

868
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,199
we'll be out of here
in a second... Ciao!

869
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,910
Italians!
- You don't say?

870
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,119
Move your ass! Hurry up!
- No afraid, we friends.

871
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,030
We Croatians, they Muslims.
- That's true!

872
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,236
One face, one race!

873
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,635
Long live the
European Union!

874
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,516
Don't ask for it, you bitch!

875
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,800
How do you like the lamb?
A dead mouth would eat it!

876
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,360
Here's some brandy,
ten years old!

877
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,510
Ask them about the carpet...

878
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,955
It's a modest feast,
but what the fuck,

879
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,599
we weren't expecting you!

880
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,275
I hope, what see here,
no report in Brussels?

881
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,159
If necessary, we
prepared to pay!

882
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,356
Eh, it is necessary, it is...

883
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,516
If they find out about
this in Brussels... Wow!

884
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,918
Carpet...
- Taste the lamb, will you?

885
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,512
Look: Here, during the war,
everything was okay.

886
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,678
By the book: We bombed
them with grenades, they

887
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,079
burned our houses down.
But then your people

888
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,273
came, declared peace,
and ruined our relations!

889
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,358
Our people ruined
your relations?

890
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,710
What is he saying? - Wait
a second, can't ya see

891
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,279
I'm talking with this
gentleman... - Oh, pardon me!

892
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,720
According to the peace
plan, the territory of

893
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,395
Chaprljane divided in:
Muslim part,

894
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,479
and Croatian part.
But not were divided...

895
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,673
...er, the resources.
- The resources?

896
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,239
The commercial resources!

897
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,152
Hey, tell him about
the resources!

898
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,149
Don't be rude, let me finish,
damn it! - Oh, pardon!

899
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,915
Before, we had a deal:
We sell artillery...

900
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,593
Ya know, artillery,
boom-boom!

901
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,712
...they sell handguns! And
we exported to Iran, Iraq,

902
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,593
Afghanistan, Kurdistan,
Chechnya, Russia,

903
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,830
Belarus... - Ireland,
Scotland, Sweden,

904
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,115
Denmark, Finland,
Slovenia!

905
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,390
But Osman took over
our business:

906
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,030
Began selling depleted
uranium bombs!

907
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,152
No, no uranium...
cluster bombs!

908
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,073
And so - we got conflict!
They shut down the water

909
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,794
supply, 'cause the water
pipe is on their side...

910
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,958
...and we took over their
mosque...

911
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,628
'cause the mosque's on
our side of the village!

912
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,474
Pardon me! They're using a
mediaeval mosque,

913
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,918
historical monument, as a
military warehouse! Phew!

914
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,510
Our common interest is this
conflict remains secret.

915
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,076
Your predecessor, before you,
cooperated very well.

916
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,840
We paid him money...

917
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,354
...and he minded his own
fucking business.

918
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,709
And the girl?

919
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,435
The girl.

920
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,916
What, is he asking
for a Coca-Cola?

921
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,555
Sorry, no Coc...

922
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,271
Oh, he's asking about
the whore, eh?

923
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,596
Mhm-yeah!
- Now we're fucked!

924
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,990
Did they say something
about the carpet?

925
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,192
She was a woman of my
late brother, Gojko.

926
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,553
When the war started, Bakir,

927
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,474
Osmars brother-in-law,
killed Gojko...

928
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,711
My relative, Bakir!
- We killed Bakir, so his

929
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,515
son Shukro raped
her for revenge.

930
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,312
Then we killed Shukro...
- Poor little Shukro!

931
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,279
...but, fuck, she got
pregnant! - And?

932
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,950
And what? What? She's
a whore. - A whore!

933
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,351
We kicked her out at once.
No Muslim bastard is

934
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,154
going to live in a catholic
home. - A whore!

935
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,868
She went to them,
but they're honourable

936
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,514
people, so they kicked her
out immediately! - Whore!

937
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,829
And the child?

938
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,871
We had nothing to do
with that.

939
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,838
She drowned it
in the river!

940
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,712
What's the matter
with him?

941
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,075
How should I know?
You know these UN guys

942
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,429
all of them a bunch of pussies...

943
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,512
Let's sing a song, to
cheer him up a bit, eh?

944
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:19,794
"The youngster was playing
his mandolin..."

945
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:28,351
"...his mandolin,
made of pure gold..."

946
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,630
"...ooh, its thin strings,
made of virgirs hair..."

947
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:41,509
"he pulled them so gently,
with a falcon feather..."

948
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,792
Hey, Osman! If these guys
report that we're still in

949
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,554
war, we're fucked
together with our business!

950
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,918
But why don't we just
cut up the two of them, bro'?

951
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,710
Fuck my mama if this
isn't the smartest of ideas!

952
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,035
Scusi, signori.

953
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,913
What the fuck is wrong now?

954
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,957
Bro'... They'll send us to
join granny Zumbula, bro'.

955
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,111
I've had enough of
this granny Zumbula!

956
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,918
If it wasn't for bloody
granny Zumbula

957
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,440
and her bloody carpet,
I wouldn't be here

958
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,555
with these hyenas!

959
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,549
"Little baby, get it,
take it, oh..."

960
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,315
"...climb on my cock,
look at Sarajevooo!"

961
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,473
Our woman! Fuck!

962
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,039
What the hell have you done,
you fuckin' baldy?

963
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,559
Sorry, the kid didn't mean
to do it, I swear to mama...

964
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,193
Whatta ya mean he didn't
mean to, he killed my wife!

965
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,880
Fuck the wife, ya've killed
nine of ours, so what?

966
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,592
Well, you've also killed
nine of ours! - What nine?

967
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,790
But Elvis doesn't count!
An agreement, remember?

968
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,194
Kids and old men
do not count!

969
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,476
Oh, they don't count, eh?
Pardon me then!

970
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,028
Granddad is done for!

971
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,592
Fine. Now we're fifty-fifty!

972
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,314
Fucking circumsized assholes!
Pardon me!

973
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,556
Oh, is that so?

974
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,913
Meho! Faik! Fire!

975
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,470
Oh, fuck!

976
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,075
It's over...
- The carpet!

977
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,832
Breathe, breathe...
Don't die on me now, breathe!

978
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,069
You're not... Italian...
you speak our language...

979
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,192
The carpet... Was
there a carpet here?

980
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,350
How... how do you
know about the carpet?

981
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,952
What do you mean how?
It's my carpet, my granny!

982
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,519
Osman bought twenty
carpets, to put them in the

983
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,509
mosque... but the
late Luka stole them...

984
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,397
that's why they killed him,
Rizvanbegovich shit!

985
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,150
And the carpet?
- Luka lost them at poker,

986
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,312
down there, in Kosovo...
He had two pairs...

987
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,832
but that shit Ramadani
had a straight!

988
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,793
Who is Ramadani?

989
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,311
Shefket Ramadani...
The bloody mother fucker!

990
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,671
Shefket Ramadani...

991
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,352
Hello?

992
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,718
Kosovo 2001... Terrible!

993
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,034
It sounds like the title
of some sci-fi movie.

994
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,951
Want some?

995
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,398
As you like it!

996
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,599
You're right,
it's disgusting!

997
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,354
And this entire place
is disgusting...

998
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,879
You tear down each
other's temples, burn

999
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,952
down each other's houses,
rape each other's wives...

1000
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,158
Countries so small,
and yet so evil!

1001
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,239
And your history keeps
repeating itself, going

1002
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,478
round, again and again...
Shefket Ramadani!

1003
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,038
Because of that man my
father left yours in a mess.

1004
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,633
Because of him Seraphim
died in prison, and

1005
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,110
Vitomir fled the country!
And now the same Shefket

1006
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,350
Ramadani stole your carpet!

1007
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,112
That man is dangerous!
He must be a hundred years

1008
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,358
old below the belt, with a
100 murders in his career!

1009
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,800
I'm no Robin Hood.
I've been involved in a fight

1010
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,560
only once in my entire life,
and it was against

1011
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,269
someone weaker than me.
I mind my own

1012
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,556
business and try to snatch
things from others

1013
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,756
if I can, and that's all.

1014
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,838
I'm not a hero! I'm not
going into the liors den

1015
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,878
to look for your crazy granny!

1016
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,278
You don't understand a
word I'm saying, do you?

1017
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,796
Let's sleep.

1018
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,276
Good night, bro'.

1019
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,918
Granny Zumbula...

1020
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,840
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1021
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,590
You can stand... you don't
need the wheelchair.

1022
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,317
Everything is easier
when you're dead.

1023
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,636
And why are you so sweaty?

1024
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:23,119
I had a dream... All the
people I know were in it.

1025
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,071
And we were all sick of
some strange illness, but

1026
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,831
no one wanted to admit it.
We were dying slowly,

1027
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,399
our flesh was rotting...
And we pretended to be

1028
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,356
alive and healthy.
- It's a sign of change.

1029
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,556
Mars is entering the fifth
house, and Jupiter is

1030
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,510
dominating over Saturn...
Or Saturn over Jupiter, it's

1031
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,395
not important. What's
important is that you

1032
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,675
will take a long trip...
a trip that will not leave

1033
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,629
you unchanged!
- But will I stay alive?

1034
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:12,153
Death is also a change...
Trendafil!

1035
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,915
Oh, go to hell!

1036
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,759
They're unloading something...

1037
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,474
Must be the carpet!
- And now what?

1038
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,471
We'll go and say: Good
afternoon, do you have

1039
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,710
a granny in a carpet?
You do? Fantastic!

1040
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,398
Can I have 200 grams, please?

1041
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,116
They stock everything
in the warehouse.

1042
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,233
If we could just go in...
- We have to be quick like

1043
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,470
Kurt Russell in "Escape
from New York".

1044
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,033
Or we have to shoot like
Rambo in "Rambo 3".

1045
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,189
Or mine the factory...

1046
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,278
...Like Franco Nero in
"The Battle On Neretva"!

1047
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,197
A war spectacle!
- Never heard of it.

1048
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,038
Children!
- Bambini!

1049
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,316
Yes, bambini!
- What is Shefket

1050
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,516
Ramadani doing with
all these children?

1051
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,272
Andiamo! Let's go!

1052
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,632
Wait, blood brother!
Wait... Bro'!

1053
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,918
Oh, daddy... The next time
you die, please leave

1054
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,998
me debts that I can pay
off with money, eh?

1055
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,596
Does it hurt?

1056
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,712
It hurts...
- It will pass.

1057
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,514
Are you going to kill me?
- Of course I will.

1058
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,716
Allah will punish
you for my pain...

1059
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,792
No Allah, nor Devil here.
Only me. Carlito!

1060
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,390
They've seen you talking
to the US intelligence

1061
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,108
officer. What did you tell
him, you little swine?

1062
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,198
I fought under your
command. I trusted you...

1063
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,556
My family was killed
defending you from the

1064
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,508
Serbian army!
Damn you to hell...

1065
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,916
...Shefket Ramadani!

1066
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,712
My name is a legend.
Do not utter it!

1067
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,793
You are a disgrace to our
cause... We didn't fight the

1068
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,832
war for the likes of you...
- You're wrong, Kreshnik!

1069
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,992
Wars are fought for
the likes of me...

1070
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,794
...and against the
fools like you!

1071
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,320
Throw his body
into the sewer.

1072
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,516
What's going on?

1073
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,756
What's going on, Ismet?
Americans?

1074
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,353
We caught these two
trying to break into the

1075
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,198
warehouse...
- Who sent you?

1076
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,117
They don't understand
Albanian, Shefket.

1077
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,559
One is Italian, the other
is pagan.

1078
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,468
Shefket Ramadani! How
can you be so young?

1079
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,278
How do you know my name?

1080
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,358
You framed our fathers...
fifty years ago...

1081
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,473
Shefket Ramadani, king
of the underground!

1082
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,635
Shefket, I think he's talking
about your father.

1083
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,274
How the fuck could
he know my father?

1084
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,152
Who sent you here?
- My wife Ruza, sir!

1085
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,278
She told me: Do whatever
it takes to find Zumbula!

1086
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,876
Zumbula? - Zumbula, sir,
Zumbula! In the carpet.

1087
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,916
Give us the carpet and
we'll leave. Please, sir...

1088
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,275
It's too late now, neighbour!

1089
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,837
You should have
listened to my advice...

1090
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,949
Jango the Soap!

1091
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,560
If you had joined the army,
you might have

1092
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,278
stood a chance of surviving.

1093
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,392
But now... I don't think so!

1094
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,758
What are you doing here?
- Business, neighbour.

1095
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,275
Anything for the
fatherland!

1096
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,515
The question is, what
are you doing here?

1097
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,598
Arert you at the spa?
- Carlito!

1098
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,750
C'mon tell us now,
who sent you: Americans,

1099
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,077
KFOR, or Interpol?
Talk, you yellow deserter!

1100
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,670
I don't know who you are,
don't know how come you

1101
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,516
know my father, but I give
you one hour to remember

1102
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,191
why you're here and
who do you work for!

1103
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,112
Lock them up in
the basement!

1104
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,868
How are you doing, bro'?

1105
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,474
It hurts, eh? Bastards!

1106
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,915
Don't move him.
Something might be

1107
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,355
broken.
- And who are you?

1108
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,518
He shouldn't be moved, in
case he has broken bones!

1109
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,830
If I'd only known that I
was going to meet a

1110
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,269
charming lady like you, I
would have made an effort

1111
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,879
to look nicer...
- Lara.

1112
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,719
Pleased to meet you.
Santino Genovese.

1113
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,069
The girl is... with you?
- Nadya. My daughter.

1114
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,792
Take it easy, bro', ya might
have something broken...

1115
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,720
Are you from Milan?
- What Milan? I'm from

1116
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,870
Rome. Don't joke about
such sensitive things, okay?

1117
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,029
And what about you?

1118
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,158
I'm from a small town
in Romania. When I was

1119
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,238
younger, I wanted to go
to Milan and be a model.

1120
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,476
That's why I've
learned to speak Italian.

1121
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,472
And? Did you go?
- I made it to Germany...

1122
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,830
and there I met
Shefket Ramadani!

1123
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,037
Shefket brought you here?

1124
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,390
We've been traveling
for years

1125
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,630
...and now he doesn't
need me anymore.

1126
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,318
Ha! Did he promise
to marry you?

1127
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,760
I'm not his girlfriend,
but his property. I'm a whore.

1128
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,078
I misunderstood. I
thought, that the child...

1129
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,713
Maybe she isn't his child.

1130
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,757
I'm not even sure
who her father is.

1131
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,152
I'm no better myself.
A crook, a liar, small time

1132
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,950
smuggler... I'm not helping
him out of the goodness of

1133
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,038
my heart, but out of
superstition. I think I'm

1134
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,032
being punished by God,
being locked up here in...

1135
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,833
What is this place?
- Factory.

1136
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,952
Meat factory.

1137
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,708
So, Shefket Ramadani
makes cat food?

1138
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,631
Heh, that's where granny
Zumbula ended up!

1139
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,718
You have no idea
where you are, do you?

1140
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,353
What did I say now?

1141
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,159
This is a factory for
producing human

1142
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,319
flesh. Shefket brings in
children from all over

1143
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,677
Europe, stolen children,
he keeps them and feeds

1144
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,759
them, like in a farm...
- What for? Prostitution?

1145
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,918
For organs! When rich
mens' kidneys, hearts,

1146
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,077
livers or spleens
malfunction - they call

1147
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,198
Shefket to supply them
with spare parts.

1148
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,669
...like a car service...
- Oh, my God!

1149
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,633
...but those parts come
from childrens bodies!

1150
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,711
But what are
you doing here?

1151
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,112
You, Italian! Get out!

1152
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:44,390
So, one hour has passed!
Time to tell me your story.

1153
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,595
Better begin... Sandokan!

1154
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,478
My name is Santino
Genovese. I came to the

1155
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,797
Balkans to pay off an
old debt. Together with my

1156
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,270
blood brother Trendafil,
we have been looking for

1157
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,517
an old woman,
wrapped inside a carpet.

1158
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,598
We've traveled a
long journey, filled with

1159
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,240
laughter and tears.
A strange adventure...

1160
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,278
Carlito!
...that is about to end!

1161
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,799
If I had known that they
were going to bring me

1162
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,150
back to you, I
would have shaved...

1163
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,398
Shefket Ramadani won't
make a big profit

1164
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,311
from this body.

1165
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,078
"It doesn't become me to
be a hero. But it's obvious

1166
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,158
that the problems of two
little people like us mean

1167
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,198
nothing to this crazy world"...

1168
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,238
Humphrey Bogart...
"Casablanca".

1169
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,598
All my life I dreamt about
saying this to a beautiful

1170
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,672
woman. And now
that I found her...

1171
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,678
...Santino must die!

1172
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,152
Good bye, bro'! Remember
what Ralph Meeker says...

1173
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,238
...in "The Naked Spur"...

1174
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,718
Animals!

1175
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,390
Animals!

1176
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,676
Mama!

1177
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,074
Listen...
Do you understand Russian?

1178
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,670
You go first... I'll unlock
the cells. You understand?

1179
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,915
Drop gun or I'll kill her.

1180
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,351
Drop gun!

1181
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,750
I'll spill her brains out,
drop fucking gun!

1182
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,192
My daughter...
- What did you say?

1183
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,032
Promise to save
my daughter!

1184
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,718
What did you tell him?

1185
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:32,991
Oh, neighbour... Okay,
neighbour, you win, alright?

1186
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,192
Look, Trendafil... let's
leave the past behind...

1187
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,793
Get me an ambulance!

1188
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,918
Neighbour, I'm bleeding
to death, neighbour...

1189
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,590
The carpet...

1190
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,037
The carpet! Granny
Zumbula's carpet!

1191
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,831
Don't be a shit, neighbour...

1192
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,190
Call the ambulance...

1193
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,873
Well done!

1194
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,517
You are Nadya, right?

1195
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,635
Listen, Nadya... We
both had a tough day...

1196
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,070
you lost your mother,
I lost a friend...

1197
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,870
It's okay to cry.

1198
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,710
We're going to have a
good cry, and then we'll

1199
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,350
go home... I don't have
any children, Nadya,

1200
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,720
but I have a wife that
makes really good

1201
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,589
pancakes. If you like,
she can be your

1202
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,313
mommy, and I can
be your daddy. Deal?

1203
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,438
And if anyone asks
if you have a granny...

1204
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,672
pretend you don't
understand anything, okay?

1205
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,994
And so, my blood brother
headed south, towards his

1206
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,034
home. Some things, like his
fear of war and mean granny

1207
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,232
Zumbula, he lost forever...
But, on the other hand,

1208
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,709
he found the things he was
looking for: A carpet,

1209
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,115
and many, many children!

1210
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,998
And what about you, Santino?

1211
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,078
Well, guys, I don't want to
sound immodest, but I hope

1212
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,158
that after all I've done, I finally
deserve my place in heaven.

1213
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,638
That one is the Little Dipper,
the other one is the

1214
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,833
Big Dipper, the one over
there is the morning star...

1215
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:16,150
Oh, that one? That's where
all the angels from our

1216
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,511
galaxy live. It's called
"The Milky Way"

1217
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,598
...or as people here call it
"Blood Brother's Straw"!

1218
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,593
Sweet dreams, brother!

1219
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:30,000
