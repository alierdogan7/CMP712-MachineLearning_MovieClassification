00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:09,244
Here's the list of POWs
we're sending back.

13
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:22,902
Like this line, the military demarkation line
has to be drawn.

14
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:27,168
One centimeter above,
0.5 km

15
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,074
South took over K hill
three days ago.

16
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:39,444
We have that hill now.

17
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,954
The line is wrong.

18
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,538
lf you want to keep arguing about it

19
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,268
Why don't we just go out into the field
and check it out for ourselves?

20
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,209
General

21
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:16,145
Yesterday, K hill was taken
by the north.

22
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,758
Here we go again.

23
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,660
Your discharge is
upon a truce, right?

24
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,866
lt's been dragging
for a year and half.

25
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,067
l know.

26
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:41,970
You'll be transferred
to the investigation unit.

27
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,182
What?

28
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,385
No way.

29
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:49,651
They're shorthanded there.

30
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,396
Busy purging commies
and traitors in the South.

31
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,500
A lot of them are
falsely accused.

32
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,765
KANG, watch your mouth.

33
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,607
They fed the NK soldiers

34
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,110
cause they were threatened
with guns.

35
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,273
And you call them
commies?

36
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,384
We can't help it.

37
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,046
They're collateral damage.

38
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,090
Purge pro-Japanese
pawns first.

39
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,352
Shut up!

40
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,063
Goddamn it!

41
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,066
This is serious shit.

42
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,972
You're a ClC officer.

43
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,180
What were you thinking?

44
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,549
Am l going to jail?

45
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,048
Why couldn't you
hold your tongue?

46
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,452
A breakdown of discipline
isn't tolerated at ClC.

47
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,659
You're not going to jail.

48
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,060
Go to the eastern front.

49
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,662
The eastern front?

50
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,165
lnvestigate this.

51
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,913
''Dear my beloved mom.''

52
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:26,044
''l don't see the truce
happening anytime soon.''

53
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:31,552
''We're losing comrades
in combats everyday.''

54
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,794
This was written
by a NK soldier.

55
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,852
Right.

56
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,660
lt was delivered
to this lady a week ago.

57
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,069
Through our MPS.

58
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,508
How's that possible?

59
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,772
There's a mole.

60
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,813
lt was sent from
Alligator Company.

61
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:58,384
Didn't they lose the hill
the other day?

62
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,544
Right.

63
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,246
l would recall those bastards
and put the screws on them.

64
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:10,361
But that hill is very important
for the talks.

65
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,759
The company captain
got killed recently.

66
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,007
He was reported as a KlA.

67
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,565
But you know what?

68
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:29,570
What killed him is a gun
we officers use.

69
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,346
Doesn't it smell?

70
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,652
A new captain is leaving soon.
Go with him.

71
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,655
Thanks.

72
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,858
You won't be thankful
once you get there.

73
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,460
Wait.

74
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,167
Do you know
KlM Su-hyeok?

75
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,408
He was in your platoon.

76
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,876
Yes, we were friends
from college.

77
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,113
He went missing in action.

78
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,478
No.

79
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,044
He's in Alligator Company.

80
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,449
He's alive?

81
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,163
Jun 27, 1950
Uijeongbu

82
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,765
- Su-hyeok!
- Eun-pyo?

83
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,365
Su-hyeok!

84
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,115
Su-hyeok, are you okay?
Look at me.

85
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,844
Don't let me die.

86
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,848
Get up if you wanna live.

87
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,457
Come on, get up.

88
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,666
Sit!

89
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,870
Sir?

90
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,445
Get up.

91
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,049
Get up!

92
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,753
Get up!

93
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,162
Turn around.

94
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,658
Now!

95
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,759
Move it!

96
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,575
Look, dumbasses.

97
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,443
Do you know
why you're losing?

98
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,656
Do you know
why you keep running?

99
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,657
Let me tell you.

100
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,269
That's because you don't know
why you're fighting.

101
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,012
This war will end
in a week.

102
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,039
When it does,
we'll need you.

103
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:23,945
Go home and help us later
rebuild the nation.

104
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,593
We'll treat the wounded.

105
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,753
You can go.

106
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,966
See you again
when we're reunified.

107
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,670
- Eun-pyo?
- Su-hyeok!

108
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,072
- Let go!
- No!

109
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,409
Just leave.

110
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,877
Eun-pyo?

111
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,979
Su-hyeok!

112
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,209
- Hey, Cruit.
- Private NAM Sung-sik!

113
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,512
That's good.
Keep it loud.

114
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,173
Sir!
Yes, sir!

115
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,281
Do you know
where we're going?

116
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
Yes, sir.

117
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:31,891
To the eastern front, sir.
10th Division...

118
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,553
1st Company of 1st Battalion,
moron.

119
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,362
How old are you?

120
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,259
1 7, sir.

121
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,266
1 7...

122
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,369
1 7 is an adult.

123
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,872
KANG Eun-pyo, right?

124
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:50,910
Yes, sir.

125
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,177
Why'd you put in a transfer
for the eastern front?

126
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,952
A man of ambition,
aren't you?

127
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,850
This war will be over soon.

128
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:12,555
And those who fought
at the front line will rule.

129
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,461
The front line is
where soldiers should be.

130
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,160
Right, Private?

131
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,671
Yes, sir! l'm ready to die
for our country!

132
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,243
The Eastern Front
Camp Cayman

133
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,673
No greetings?

134
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,875
You!
Get over here.

135
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,879
- Why?
- Why?

136
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,348
- What the...
- Who stole my cigarettes?

137
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,045
You bitch!

138
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,789
- What the hell!
- Enemy!

139
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,256
Hey!

140
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,960
A POW is on the loose!

141
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,896
Get him!

142
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,864
Yes, sir!

143
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,271
Put it away, bitch.

144
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,965
l'm not a POW.

145
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,872
Why are you wearing
an enemy uniform?

146
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,574
Cause l'm cold.

147
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,571
Are you shitting me?

148
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,747
You call yourself a soldier?

149
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,153
Take it off.

150
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,351
Take it off now!

151
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,350
Stop yelling.
You're hurting my ears.

152
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,295
What are you doing?

153
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,753
l have it on inside.

154
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,160
l can't believe this.

155
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,863
Who are you?

156
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,364
Who am l?

157
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,068
What's this?

158
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,075
This is ridiculous.
Alligator my ass.

159
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,485
Sorry l'm late.

160
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,045
What's up with your accent?

161
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,156
Oh, l'm from the North.

162
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,995
l left home
20 years ago.

163
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,463
So l'm not red at all.

164
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,261
An acting commander?

165
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,459
No, sir.
MSG. YANG Hyo-sam.

166
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,967
The acting commander
will be here soon.

167
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,110
What are you doing here?

168
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,311
Hi.

169
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,475
Who are these kids?
This isn't a playground.

170
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,748
Send them away.

171
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,252
They're war orphans.

172
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:26,492
We've been looking
after them.

173
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,653
Damn, it's a mess here.

174
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,667
Let's go.

175
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,768
What a life.

176
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,572
An alligator?

177
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,369
How old are you?

178
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:24,039
State your rank
and name.

179
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,267
Alkaloid?

180
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,370
Where'd you get this?

181
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,474
What are you?

182
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,751
SHlN ll-young.

183
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,149
A captain?

184
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,060
You're the acting commander?

185
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,163
Respect your superior.

186
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,370
First Lieutenant
KANG Eun-pyo.

187
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,566
Aero-K.

188
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,710
We call it Aerok Hill.

189
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,474
2.5 kilometers in radius.

190
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,985
lt's a strategic point,
covering these two points.

191
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:37,389
The enemy had it
7 hours ago.

192
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,254
But we took it back
on our 6th attack.

193
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,495
Many guys got wounded
and tired.

194
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,762
So the regimental commander
put us on a break.

195
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,868
Well done.

196
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,063
Listen.

197
00:17:55,507 --> 00:18:00,112
l'm determined to end
this battle of attrition.

198
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,843
lt won't be as easy
as you think.

199
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,953
What?

200
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,655
Sorry, sir.

201
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,793
We'll set up AA guns
on the foot of the hill.

202
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,797
Anti-aircraft guns?
But they have no air power.

203
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,357
You use them
only for fighters?

204
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,205
With AA guns,
our defense line here...

205
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,709
What if we lose them
to the enemy?

206
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,074
Then we're fucked.

207
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,478
He's right.

208
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,785
We're still here,
thanks to USAF air strike.

209
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,689
lf they take our AA guns,
we can forget the air support.

210
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,553
Look.

211
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,258
We won't lose them.

212
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,054
Set up AA guns right now.

213
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,259
That's not good.

214
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,158
Who are you?

215
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,270
First LT. KlM Su-hyeok.
Sorry l'm late.

216
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,074
First Lieutenant?

217
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,487
Not only are you alive,
you made First LT from Private.

218
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,388
ln 2 years?

219
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:22,054
Officers die in battle fields,
and you get promoted fast.

220
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,066
Hey, you had this?

221
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,475
What, you've lost
your faith?

222
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,169
No, l just pray
for different things.

223
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:46,046
l used to ask God to save,
but now to kill.

224
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,252
Kill whom?

225
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,546
Anybody.

226
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,253
This won't be over
unless one side is gone.

227
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,358
Eun-pyo?

228
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,269
What's a ClC officer
doing here?

229
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,872
We have intel
about a mole here.

230
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:09,974
What?

231
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,576
That's bullshit.

232
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,380
l know.

233
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:27,292
Let's toast
to our new captain.

234
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,852
Fill your cups.

235
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,664
Here you go.

236
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,605
What's this?
lt's water.

237
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:45,410
lt can be either
water or booze.

238
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,174
lt's all in your head.

239
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,044
Listen up.

240
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,853
Wake him up.

241
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,249
To the regimental commander
who put on this party for us.

242
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,061
Let's toast.

243
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,254
Before that...

244
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,662
We lost a lot of men
in the last combat.

245
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,566
Let's toast to them first.

246
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,763
Go ahead.

247
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,877
Comrades, good bye.

248
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,271
Good bye!

249
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,071
Sorry about earlier.

250
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,446
You're here
to catch a mole?

251
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,757
Pour me a shot.

252
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,061
You look old.

253
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,663
l fought
in the Liberation Army.

254
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,356
- Against Japan?
- Yes, in Manchuria.

255
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:22,763
Mt. Hwabaek Battle
in 1941 .

256
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,512
l got this badge
from an interim government.

257
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,173
lt was dark at night.

258
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:34,249
Japs were coming,
and we were out of ammo.

259
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,789
We were ready to die.

260
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,493
Where are you going?
lt is getting exciting.

261
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:46,798
''The eastern sky lit up
with artillery support.''

262
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,701
l've heard it so many times
l know it by heart.

263
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,362
l'm sick of it.

264
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,662
What the...

265
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,568
Smarter than you look.

266
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,709
With artillery support...

267
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,472
No, he's not smart.

268
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,315
He'd be stupid
not to know it by now.

269
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,943
Enough of that.

270
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,247
Cruit?
Let us hear you sing.

271
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,247
NAM?

272
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,959
Private NAM Sung-sik!

273
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,452
Where's my platoon?

274
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,556
Why didn't you invite us?

275
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,867
ll-young?

276
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,167
Shit.

277
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,869
Eat this.

278
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,567
Eat it.

279
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,279
What's wrong?

280
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,987
lt's okay.
We're retreating now

281
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,047
but we will strike back.

282
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,495
Where are you going?

283
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:54,800
Wake up, man.
We're not in Pohang.

284
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,961
Knock it off!

285
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,164
Why bring that shit up?

286
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,771
What?

287
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,677
Did food make you sick?

288
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,039
Why is it so cold?

289
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,044
What is it?

290
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,450
He thinks
we're in Pohang.

291
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,858
- Pohang?
- Forget it, guys.

292
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,295
lt's behind us.

293
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,956
Where's my platoon?

294
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,762
Damn it!

295
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:37,209
Cheer up, guys.
Let's have some fun.

296
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,473
Come on, show us
some moves!

297
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,749
Fuck!

298
00:24:56,294 --> 00:25:01,561
NAM, sing us something
that's big in Seoul.

299
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,564
- Sing!
- Come on.

300
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,583
Look at me, dear

301
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,041
Not that old shit.
Something new!

302
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,852
You're stabbing
the dead here.

303
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,063
What are you doing?

304
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,261
Hi.

305
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,061
Let's eat.

306
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,862
When will the war end?

307
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,307
What?

308
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,572
l bet you've talked
to high-ranking officers.

309
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,973
When?

310
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:53,285
Truce talks began
two fucking years ago.

311
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,688
lt can be any day now.

312
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,156
And it's been 2 years.

313
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,459
Any idea how many
have died here?

314
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,558
lt gets confusing.

315
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,964
Did he die?
Or was it someone else?

316
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,272
lt's sick.

317
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,071
Did l see him
in the barracks?

318
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,941
Shit.

319
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,260
That Cruit?

320
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,866
What a song.

321
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:50,872
Heard from a distance...

322
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,674
a Ioud gunshot,

323
00:26:55,513 --> 00:27:01,941
Iike a IuIIaby,

324
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:10,055
takes me home
in my dream.

325
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,563
My home,

326
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,561
my sweet home...

327
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:29,314
Before a bowI of water...
mom prays for my safety.

328
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:38,552
Her shining gray hair
brings tears to my eyes.

329
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,677
Get up!
Up!

330
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,580
Turn the lights on!

331
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,443
Get the hell up!

332
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,547
Get up!

333
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,285
Come on!

334
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,343
Listen.

335
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,547
They took Aerok Hill back.

336
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,491
Get your gear
and standby.

337
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,460
AA guns?
AA guns!

338
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,864
Can't even last a day.

339
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,949
He shits,
and we clean it up?

340
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,548
This is bullshit.

341
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:53,553
lf he doesn't know shit,
he should listen.

342
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,168
This was unthinkable
back in 1941 .

343
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,206
We had 2 principles.

344
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,175
Minimum activities
and maximum focus.

345
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,867
A chatterbox
got killed first, right?

346
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,843
Shut up, funny boy.

347
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:18,048
We're wide open.
lf Two Seconds sees us...

348
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,791
At least one will die.

349
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,193
What's Two Seconds?

350
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:27,799
lf you know too much,
you'd be too scared.

351
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,501
You'll find out soon.

352
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:35,006
Look! After the combat,
write me the lyrics to that song.

353
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,974
Okay.

354
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,167
lf you don't get killed today.

355
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,287
Machine guns.

356
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,551
AA guns.

357
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,057
That bitch is still alive.

358
00:29:56,194 --> 00:30:00,961
They're digging foxholes,
expanding the defense line.

359
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,364
This is a piece of cake.
They're reserves.

360
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,504
l can't see past the hill.

361
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,006
Let's shoot and see.

362
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,975
lf they have more men
over that hill?

363
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,168
We'll be trapped like rats.

364
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,379
We have their uniform, right?

365
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,477
Yes.

366
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,598
Comrade!
Comrade!

367
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,400
Why didn't you
answer the radio?

368
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,101
l've been calling you
from there.

369
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,966
What?
A radio?

370
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,406
Nobody radioed, right?

371
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,107
No, sir.

372
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,076
Are you sure
it's not broken?

373
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,280
Where'd you get
those boots?

374
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,943
What's your unit?

375
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,149
Get this asshole!

376
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,853
1 and 2, 1 1 o'clock.

377
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,659
3 and 4, 12 o'clock.
Man-seok?

378
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,811
Got them.

379
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,869
Move it!

380
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,582
One the ground, fuckers!

381
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,885
We heard the gunfire.
What's going on?

382
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,852
Answer it.

383
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,351
Do you copy?

384
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,391
Tell him
it was an accident.

385
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,053
lt was an accident, sir.

386
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,003
A volley fire always works!

387
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,061
Radio HQ.

388
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,871
Dragonfly 2,
you're good to go.

389
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,570
We've been hit!

390
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,979
Fuck!

391
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,247
We're moving to 0-2-4.
Blow it.

392
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,452
What are you doing?

393
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,397
lf we let them live now,
they'll kill us later.

394
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,865
Move to 0-2-4!

395
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,061
Hurry, sir.

396
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,344
Damn it!

397
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,940
They're back!

398
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,604
After the air strike,
move to the trench

399
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,072
before they come out
of the foxhole.

400
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:34,777
What the fuck!
Cry and l'll kill you!

401
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,672
To the trench!

402
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,071
Move it!

403
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,649
Medic!

404
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,162
To the trench!

405
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,768
To the trench!

406
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,952
We need to take out
that gun.

407
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,059
Let's just fucking charge!

408
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,958
He's too far.

409
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,806
Grenades will fall
30 meters before the pillbox.

410
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,467
- What?
- Get your grenades.

411
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,210
What are you doing?

412
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,268
l can't let you.

413
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,648
lf they fall short,
l die.

414
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,648
Shit!

415
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,744
On my mark!

416
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,949
Now!

417
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,857
l can't see him.

418
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,573
He made it!

419
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,442
Charge!

420
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,568
Fucking commies!

421
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,473
Too late to turn back.

422
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,683
We gotta get up there.

423
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,241
l will lead.

424
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,887
2nd platoon in flank!

425
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,149
Go!

426
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,548
Keep going!

427
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,974
Fuck.

428
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,680
Motherfuckers!

429
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,383
Eating corn power
and hiding out like rats!

430
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,851
- Put your hands up.
- Don't kill me.

431
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,158
It's a white flag!
Ceasefire!

432
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,656
Cruit.

433
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,358
You okay?

434
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,109
lt's okay.

435
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,240
He looked younger
than me.

436
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:21,843
lt's kill or get killed.
Right?

437
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,848
Let's go.

438
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,255
Damn, l almost peed
my pants.

439
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,262
Damn Yankees,
they destroyed everything.

440
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,661
lt'll take forever
to restore this.

441
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,706
We have to restore it?

442
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,766
Or what?
You'll ask the enemy?

443
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:51,044
Wow, you hung like a horse.

444
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,149
You damn kid...

445
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,660
Aerok Hill stands
on those bodies.

446
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,602
Remember that asshole who said
this war would be over in a week?

447
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,467
How could l forget?

448
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,207
He's here.

449
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,008
What?

450
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,169
Yep, it's him.

451
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,243
He put on airs and said...

452
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,843
This war would be over
in a week.

453
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,549
You don't know
why you're fighting.

454
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,457
l wanna ask him
why we're fighting.

455
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,859
Lieutenant!

456
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,359
What are you doing?
lt's almost gone.

457
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,070
Come on.

458
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,744
What's wrong?

459
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,855
Are you drunk?

460
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,452
We have booze?

461
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,159
MSG. YANG said...

462
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,967
it'd help me
forget what happened.

463
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,475
Come on, drink it down.

464
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,269
Hey, that cup is mine.

465
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,239
Give it back.

466
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,646
- Give me some.
- Get your own cup.

467
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,352
This is mine.

468
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,358
Eun-pyo, come sit.
Drink with us.

469
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,763
Where'd you get the booze?

470
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,310
What's this?

471
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:38,882
Oh, we didn't draw that.
Some commie did.

472
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,349
Fucking idiot!

473
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,646
What's that in your hand?

474
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,856
lt's nothing.

475
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:59,163
''Thanks for sending my regards
to my family in the South.''

476
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,266
KlM Su-hyeok.

477
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,774
What's this?

478
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,312
Please, let it go.

479
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,472
Put it down.

480
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,756
What's wrong?

481
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,651
lt's nothing.

482
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,855
YANG, put it down.

483
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,999
He's a ClC officer.
lf he talks, we're dead.

484
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,457
You think
this is nothing?

485
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,565
You've been talking
to commies?

486
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,174
ls this
what you're here for?

487
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,681
lt's really nothing.

488
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,149
Explain it then.

489
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,354
Do you know how many times
this hill changed hands?

490
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:04,260
Nobody knows.
l counted up to 30, though.

491
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:08,062
We didn't wanna
carry all this shit back

492
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,109
when we pulled off this hill.

493
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,167
So?

494
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,577
We buried things
in this bunker.

495
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,983
Socks, clothes,
chocolate from Yankees.

496
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,042
Ammo, cigarettes,
boots

497
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,553
Because we'd be back.

498
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:37,757
When we took this hill back,
guess what we found here.

499
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:39,203
What?

500
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,465
Damn flies.

501
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,376
Crap.

502
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,139
What's this?

503
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,146
Let me.

504
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,252
Son of a bitch!

505
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,452
- lt stinks.
- Stay away from me.

506
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,260
What the...

507
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:08,856
''Thanks for the chocolate,
cigarettes, and socks.''

508
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,901
Fucking commies!

509
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,870
This is why
Communism's gotta go!

510
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,464
l'll kill them all!

511
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,710
Where are you going?

512
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,870
Let go!

513
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,471
Calm down.

514
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:26,049
So pissed off
we weren't ourselves.

515
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,889
So we buried a letter
cursing them.

516
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,690
You buried a letter?

517
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,659
Yes, we were not
thinking right.

518
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:41,957
Otherwise, we would've buried
grenades or a time bomb.

519
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,266
And then?

520
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:50,064
As always, we lost the hill
and took it back.

521
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,641
What's this?

522
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,483
l know.

523
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,541
Don't.

524
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,544
Okay.

525
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,351
What the...

526
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,793
lsn't this booze?

527
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:10,994
Booze?

528
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,896
This is rice wine
from the North.

529
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,799
Dump it.
lt might be poisoned.

530
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,061
Are you sure?

531
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,802
This is booze.

532
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,769
Dump it.

533
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:25,809
l'm not hallucinating.
lt really is booze.

534
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,073
- Damn.
- Ki-young.

535
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,055
Just to make sure...

536
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,848
Smell it.

537
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,755
Fine.

538
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,155
Wait.

539
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,860
Hold on.

540
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:55,706
lf they wanted to kill us,
they wouldn't have left wine.

541
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,764
That's right.

542
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,010
They would've buried
a grenade instead.

543
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,211
You're right.

544
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,076
Why give us booze?

545
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,840
Fuck it.
l don't care if l die.

546
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,047
What's wrong?

547
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,759
Let me have another sip.

548
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,963
- Smart ass!
- This is the real thing!

549
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,261
- Give me some!
- Wait for the go!

550
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,967
That booze...

551
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,875
lt was bribery.

552
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,748
Buried with it was
a thick envelope.

553
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,787
ln it was a few letters.

554
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:44,988
Letters?

555
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,692
Some NK solders were
drafted from SK.

556
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,355
And some defected to NK
and enlisted.

557
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:58,101
They left letters
for their families back home.

558
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,202
So?

559
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:03,307
So l mailed them all.

560
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,408
You did?

561
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,172
Yes, l did.

562
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:12,182
Since then, we've buried
cigarettes for them.

563
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,548
And they did booze,
matches...

564
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,347
We're always low
on matches.

565
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,755
lsn't this nice?

566
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,655
That's it?

567
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:32,059
What else did you expect?

568
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,473
You think we leaked
military secrets?

569
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,170
Putting our lives at risk?

570
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,751
YANG, put it down.

571
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,452
l wanna hear
what he has to say.

572
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,452
Do you have anything to do
with the death of a former captain?

573
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,792
He was shot in the head
at point blank.

574
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:33,855
The pistol used to kill him is
what we officers use.

575
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,759
Of course.
lt was his pistol.

576
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,604
What?

577
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,370
He shot himself
while running from a battle.

578
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,875
He was a piece of shit.

579
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,942
But l reported him as a KlA
out of courtesy.

580
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,550
You saw it?

581
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,148
One of the boys did.

582
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,156
Where's he now?

583
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,858
He died today.
One you buried earlier.

584
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,757
Where did you find
his body?

585
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:13,268
ln the creek
north of the hill.

586
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,271
Listen, Eun-pyo.

587
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,945
There's nothing
you can dig out here.

588
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,747
Even if you do...

589
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,952
Nothing you can do about it.

590
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,760
What makes you so sure?

591
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:47,268
Just leave
before you get killed.

592
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,566
l will.

593
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,173
But...

594
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,249
Now is not the time.

595
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,663
KIM Su-hyeok...

596
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,168
What are you doing here?

597
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,345
Yours?

598
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,252
You live nearby?

599
00:53:54,297 --> 00:54:00,463
Have you seen anything
suspicious around here?

600
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,645
Go home.
You're not safe here.

601
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,245
Hold on.

602
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,764
lt's chocolate.

603
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,447
Don't come back.

604
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,755
Guys, get up there!

605
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:47,868
Medic!

606
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:02,349
June, 1953

607
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:06,259
3rd platoon lost 8 men.

608
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:10,965
And 23 got wounded
and need to be evacuated.

609
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,002
Most of them are
severely...

610
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,061
We don't have men
to evac them.

611
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:19,066
Request the regiment
for an evac team.

612
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,641
Get out of here.

613
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,985
What's this?
Disobeying my order?

614
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,350
No.

615
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:35,291
We need at least 30 men
to evac 23.

616
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,758
There's no way.

617
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,095
That's not it.

618
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:43,964
When will the war end?

619
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,959
What?

620
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,972
Give me the letters.

621
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,413
So many things to say!

622
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,041
- l'm here.
- Come on.

623
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:03,946
''Thanks for the lyrics to
Night at the Front Line.''

624
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,992
''Do me a favor.
Send my family this picture.''

625
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,960
Wait.
Give it here.

626
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:19,759
''l don't think l will see them
ever again.''

627
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:29,672
This CHA Tae-kyung kid
has a pretty sister.

628
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,538
Come on.

629
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,748
Stop drooling.
She's pretty, so what?

630
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,188
lf her brother is red,
she is too.

631
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,450
Give it here.

632
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,157
His sister is a fox.

633
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,061
Who's this?

634
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,359
CHA Tae-kyung.

635
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,265
She's cute.

636
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,111
l'll keep it.
Mail this.

637
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,780
You can't do that.

638
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,747
Forget it.

639
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,644
Yeah, forget it.

640
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,442
What do you think
of my future wife?

641
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,458
l have the address.
l can visit her after the war.

642
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,060
This girl...

643
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:31,067
What's going on
with damn truce talks?

644
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,378
This is bullshit.

645
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:40,383
The war has been in a deadlock
for 2 years now.

646
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,045
And half a million
have died so far.

647
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,388
lt's crazy, isn't it?

648
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,253
Damn.

649
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,755
Look, NAM.

650
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:53,759
Why can't we stop fighting
during truce talks?

651
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:59,662
You should be a CO
for the UN forces.

652
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,168
Yeah, that's right.

653
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,164
You don't mind?

654
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,111
You're funny.

655
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,169
Move.

656
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,543
What's this?

657
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,383
lt's a pair of goggles.

658
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,543
Here.

659
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,650
- lf l put them on...
- Give them here.

660
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,962
Made in Germany.

661
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,475
Wow, Lieutenant.
They look horrible on you.

662
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,047
Here, Cruit.

663
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,849
That's not fair.

664
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,789
He didn't do anything
to deserve these.

665
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,091
They're for him.

666
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,694
lt's for the lyrics
to that song.

667
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,753
You don't know that.

668
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:01,554
Come on.

669
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:02,865
Take them.

670
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,658
Move.

671
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,266
Why don't you sing it for us?

672
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,069
Sure.

673
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,780
One, two, three, four

674
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:26,848
Leaves are faIIing...

675
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:33,251
into the night
at the front Iine.

676
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:40,964
FaIIing down siIentIy...

677
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:47,765
dews are so coId...

678
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,044
We have intel

679
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,889
Chinese army will set up
a strategic base here.

680
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,356
Any word from Recon?

681
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,592
Nothing?

682
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:08,053
We lost contact with them
on the north ridge.

683
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,458
lt's been 8 hours.

684
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,302
They might've been sniped.

685
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:17,407
lf that's the case,
it must be Two Seconds.

686
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:21,571
That piece of shit
turned up again.

687
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,212
Two Seconds?

688
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:28,084
lt's our nickname
for this enemy sniper.

689
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,385
Why Two Seconds?

690
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,353
The body goes down first.

691
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:35,648
And 2 seconds later,
a gunshot is heard.

692
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,193
That's why.

693
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,096
From 680 meters away?

694
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:40,997
Yes.

695
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,455
He must've modified
his rifle.

696
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,204
He's killed about 30
of our men.

697
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,706
How are we gonna
get him?

698
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,367
l'll get him.

699
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,870
Can you do it?

700
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,241
Give me 10 men.

701
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,355
Where the fuck is he?

702
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,055
He's not here.

703
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,453
Let's go back.

704
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,363
Not yet.

705
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:20,203
We searched everywhere.
He's not here.

706
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,671
You've been holding it, huh?

707
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,486
Let me see your dick.

708
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,351
Are you nuts?

709
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,451
Come here.

710
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,992
Get your ass over here.

711
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,193
No way!

712
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,496
Come on.
We're leaving soon.

713
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,963
Come here.

714
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,166
So you can beat me?
No way.

715
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,463
- lt's Two Seconds!
- Get down!

716
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,580
No!
Don't go.

717
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,883
l can't move my leg.

718
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:10,546
Don't fall for a trap!
Stay put!

719
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,755
Where'd he shoot from?

720
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,756
Sergeant YANG...

721
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,456
Sergeant YANG!

722
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,055
Don't move.

723
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,927
Stay there!

724
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:24,363
Sung-sik!

725
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:47,146
Help me.
l don't wanna die.

726
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,858
Sung-sik!

727
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,660
Don't!

728
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,367
- l want him to shoot again.
- What?

729
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,509
One more shot.

730
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,910
We have to get him.

731
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,213
He's waiting for us
to take the bait.

732
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,737
Are you crazy?

733
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,048
Fuck.

734
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,355
Sung-sik, grab it.

735
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,556
Hang in there!

736
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:29,765
Grab it.

737
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,761
Reach for it.

738
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,962
That's good.

739
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,808
We got him.

740
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,673
Commo!

741
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,211
Stop.

742
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,645
Stop shooting me!

743
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,267
Sung-sik.

744
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,164
Give me your hand.

745
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,671
Requesting
an artillery attack.

746
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:13,910
The coordinates are...

747
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,468
Give me your
goddamn hand!

748
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,642
Lieutenant...

749
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,846
Come on!

750
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:24,150
Lieutenant...

751
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,450
Sung-sik...

752
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,053
Die, Two Seconds.

753
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,963
Sung-sik!

754
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,661
Where the fuck is he?

755
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,967
He couldn't have made it.

756
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,606
His body must've been
torn into pieces.

757
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,370
No, he's alive.

758
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,970
What?

759
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,443
He walked.

760
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,550
Fuck!

761
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,345
Poor Sung-sik.

762
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,689
He was so young.

763
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:34,849
So what?

764
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,994
This is a battlefield,
and anybody can die.

765
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,297
ls there an order
who dies first?

766
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,061
Age means nothing
in war.

767
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:49,959
Chocolate?

768
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:58,166
Was it that boy who sang?

769
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,944
Lieutenant KANG!

770
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,251
Where are you?

771
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,548
This way, guys.

772
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,668
Fuck.

773
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:02,865
An artillery attack
for a single sniper?

774
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:07,369
l should've taken out
the commo first.

775
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:36,505
The 2nd Corps of
Chinese Army is

776
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,872
setting up a new point
in the northwest of Aerok Hill.

777
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,275
First LT. KANG?

778
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,239
Are you listening?

779
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,641
Put your head together!

780
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:55,551
To hold the defense line...

781
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,263
Got something to say?

782
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,870
Sung-sik died
because of you.

783
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,445
Many have died.

784
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,742
This is war.

785
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,254
ls this how?

786
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:33,360
How you made First LT
from Private in 2 years?

787
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,599
l guess it is.

788
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,602
l did what l had to do.

789
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:44,106
l bet you did.
Each and every time.

790
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,267
Now you're going
for captain?

791
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,611
Should l salute you?

792
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,080
The war killed Sung-sik.

793
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,182
That's bullshit, asshole!

794
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,047
Excuse me?

795
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:02,992
My arm will grow back
when l grow up, right?

796
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,695
l said no.
lt won't, will it?

797
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:11,655
lt will grow back,
and l'll be normal again, right?

798
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,242
Look.

799
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,343
Are you a lizard?

800
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,450
Arms don't grow.

801
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,391
You'll be armless
until you die, freak!

802
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,551
Motherfucker!

803
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,797
lt'll grow back!

804
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,399
You call yourself human?

805
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,165
Tell me it will!

806
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:55,511
No, l'm not human anymore.
l died long ago!

807
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,138
3 years of hell!

808
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,281
What do you expect?

809
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,942
Shut the fuck up.

810
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:07,690
What do you know
about war?

811
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,353
Things are worse
in the rear.

812
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,096
You're not the only one
fighting a war.

813
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,257
Everybody is in hell!

814
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,970
You don't know a thing
about hell.

815
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,068
NAM Sung-sik.

816
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,568
Kids like him die
everyday.

817
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,038
Hundreds of thousands
have died.

818
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:41,045
And why the fuck isn't
this war ending?

819
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,058
What do you know
about hell?

820
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,766
What is hell?

821
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,070
ls it Pohang?

822
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,946
Tell me!
Where's my platoon?

823
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,443
Where's everybody?

824
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,486
Move.

825
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:11,646
Don't get closer!

826
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,645
He's completely crazy.

827
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,992
Thank God
he doesn't have a grenade.

828
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,459
He's not crazy.

829
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:20,761
He's on and off.

830
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,000
Can't you see him?
Have him transferred.

831
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,468
He will receive
a dishonorable discharge.

832
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,305
lt's not fair
for a man of bravery.

833
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,508
What?
You sons of...

834
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,375
Where's my platoon?

835
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,136
lt got wiped out!

836
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,182
Can't you remember?

837
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:43,385
SONG Hyung-jong!
AHN Hyun-su!

838
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,751
KANG Hyuk-pill!
JUNG Man-su!

839
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,850
JUNG Kyu-won!
Who else?

840
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:53,059
NAM Guk-bae, SHlN Chang-su
They all died.

841
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:57,459
When we fled Pohang,
2nd platoon got wiped out.

842
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,368
Why?

843
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,264
Why?

844
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,266
lf so...

845
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,767
Why am l alive?

846
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,642
Tell me, PFC. SHlN!

847
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,088
Captain, no.

848
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,146
Don't.

849
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,856
Stay back!
Why am l the only one alive?

850
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,553
Tell me!

851
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,269
Sang-uk.

852
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,272
Look at me.

853
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,338
Don't you remember?

854
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,543
What happened
in Pohang?

855
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:57,392
Why'd everybody die
except you?

856
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,450
Enough!

857
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,156
That's enough.

858
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,660
Look at me.

859
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,368
lt's me, ll-young.

860
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,459
No!

861
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,605
Get him!

862
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,572
Doc!

863
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,542
You were lucky.
lt missed the bone.

864
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,450
You don't feel pain,
do you?

865
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,358
He's hooked on morphine.

866
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,263
What is it?

867
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,067
What happened
in Pohang?

868
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,340
Fuck Pohang...

869
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,843
August 17, 1950
Pohang

870
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,559
What are we gonna do?

871
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,562
Retreat!

872
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,480
Take us with you!

873
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,182
- There's no time!
- Are you crazy?

874
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,484
Let's go!

875
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:05,187
Get the fuck back!

876
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,489
We can't take no more!

877
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,391
You're leaving us to die?

878
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,192
There's no room!

879
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,059
Get back, assholes!

880
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,353
Let's go!

881
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,608
Climb on!

882
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,269
Get us out of here!

883
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,781
Hit it!

884
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:33,839
Fuck!

885
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,044
Captain!

886
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,057
Bro.

887
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,160
Bro!

888
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:40,345
You killed our own men!

889
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,359
You crazy bastard.

890
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:33,764
Why are you trying
to kill yourself?

891
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,942
Who's to blame him?

892
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:50,040
He saved us all.

893
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,351
Didn't he?

894
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,954
Who could deny that?

895
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,854
Tell me.

896
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:03,759
Tell me!

897
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,560
Tell me,
you fucking cowards!

898
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:12,767
He's right.
You saved us.

899
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,946
Why can't you admit that?

900
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:27,046
2nd platoon got wiped out
in combat.

901
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,152
ll-young.

902
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,759
lt's not your fault.

903
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,266
Heard that, Private?

904
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:46,667
You killed our men to survive.
Don't waste your life now.

905
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,239
Su-hyeok...

906
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:14,765
- Sang-uk!
- Sang-uk!

907
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,664
lt's okay.

908
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,268
Send them away with him.

909
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:24,344
No more kids here.

910
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:44,099
We've had so many battles.

911
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:49,059
But this one will be the last one
over Aerok Hill.

912
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:54,073
We've heard that
more than enough.

913
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,611
l'm sick of hearing that.

914
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,340
How dare you!

915
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,050
Keep quiet.

916
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,354
Carry on.

917
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:15,654
The Chinese Army
will lead the attack.

918
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:20,566
When the ROK asses
pull out

919
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:24,105
we'll wipe them out
on their retreat.

920
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,367
Got it?

921
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:31,035
Take sure
they don't get away.

922
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,340
What's the point?

923
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,984
One minute, it's ours.
And next minute, it's theirs.

924
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:39,750
What if they take it,
and an armistice is signed?

925
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,693
That's a suicide!

926
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,957
lf they take away our men

927
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,497
Aerok will be stranded.

928
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:53,365
We can't defend
against those Chinks.

929
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,763
So?

930
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,707
We desert Aerok
and set up a new defense line.

931
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,508
We cut off
their line of supply.

932
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:03,068
Then focus our fire
on them.

933
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,644
What the fuck!

934
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,543
Who do you think you are?

935
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,385
A commander-in-chief?

936
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:11,987
Know your fucking place.

937
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,955
Have you fought
against those chinks?

938
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:18,353
Do you even know
who Peng Dehuai is?

939
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:22,354
They have more men
than our ammo.

940
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,156
Did you know that?

941
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:27,863
Son of a bitch.

942
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,267
Contumacy in times of war
results in what?

943
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,370
Say it.

944
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,574
Contumacy results in what?

945
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,741
Punishment on the spot.

946
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,542
Standby to attack
along Hakang ridge.

947
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,351
Answer me.

948
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,390
Sir.

949
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,357
Repeat it!

950
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,751
Along Hakang ridge.

951
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:54,996
Standby to attack.

952
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:56,156
KANG?

953
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:59,066
Standby on the north ridge.
Repeat it.

954
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:04,265
Standby on the north ridge.

955
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:24,257
Captain SHlN was
right about this.

956
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:29,452
He's saved our ass
quite a few times.

957
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:33,859
Soldiers live and die
by orders.

958
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:38,265
But this is like dying
for nothing.

959
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:55,756
The visibility is bad.
l can't see shit.

960
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,053
And we can't hear shit
because of the rain.

961
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:10,371
Contact!

962
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,271
They're here!

963
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,594
lt's chinks.
They're too many!

964
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:07,996
No word from HQ?

965
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,799
We have to pull out.
Aerok is completely surrounded.

966
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:13,301
Give us your order.

967
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,859
Not so fast.

968
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,471
We gotta wait.

969
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,244
l can't get Capt. SHlN
on the radio.

970
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,583
That means...
He and his men are dead.

971
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,744
- Get HQ on the radio!
- Yes, sir!

972
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:35,251
Sir, it's Chinese army.
We're outnumbered.

973
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,551
l know, but...

974
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,957
What'd he say?

975
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,363
We're defending the hill.

976
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,667
We'll fight to the end.

977
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,367
He doesn't know
the situation here.

978
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,378
We have to retreat now.

979
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,039
Fuck!

980
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:03,542
ll-young is dead.
We're all gonna die!

981
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:06,247
Motherfucker!

982
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:12,858
Should l send you
where ll-young is?

983
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:16,655
You should've listened
to ll-young!

984
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:23,004
Soldiers die
when they're told to!

985
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,266
No!

986
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,575
Captain, don't do it.

987
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:45,347
Our captain is dead.
By the military law

988
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:47,952
l'm in charge now.

989
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,898
We're pulling out.

990
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:51,956
Yes, sir!

991
01:27:58,706 --> 01:27:59,866
By the military law?

992
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,744
lf you kill me,
you're in charge.

993
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,444
Can you get our boys
out of here?

994
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,944
lf you can, shoot me.

995
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,750
We don't have time.

996
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:28,202
Get all the survivors
to Ridge 315.

997
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:29,203
- Move!
- Yes, sir!

998
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:30,670
lf we make it...

999
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,675
l'll have you
court-marshaled.

1000
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,450
Keep going!
Leave him!

1001
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,394
We're fucked.

1002
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,861
Put up a white flag!

1003
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:56,855
We gotta go.

1004
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:00,668
Go!
Save your ass!

1005
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,266
Get out of here!

1006
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:05,907
l'm not leaving behind
anybody anymore.

1007
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:06,965
Get up.

1008
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:12,539
Fuck!

1009
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,047
Sergeant YANG!

1010
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,946
Sergeant Yang!

1011
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,389
Why didn't you just
leave me?!

1012
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,254
Funny boy.

1013
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:26,159
Wait for your turn.

1014
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:32,057
Mt. Hwabaek Battle
in 1941 .

1015
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:36,568
l got this badge
from an interim...

1016
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:39,164
YANG!

1017
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,941
Fuck the badge!

1018
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,258
We're out of ammo.

1019
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,862
l guess this is it.

1020
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,640
lt's Capt. SHlN!

1021
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,142
He's alive!

1022
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:24,546
How are you holding up?

1023
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,190
When that flare goes out

1024
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,954
fire all the trench mortar
and get out of here.

1025
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,756
lf they fall for it,
they'll be shooting at each other.

1026
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,899
Take your men and go.

1027
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,700
l'll be right after you.

1028
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,760
No matter what,
we're sticking together.

1029
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,868
You're in charge now.

1030
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:49,470
Save your men.

1031
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,738
Focus!

1032
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:56,641
Trench mortar!

1033
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:58,042
Fire!

1034
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:20,573
Damn chinks.

1035
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:26,237
The US recon aircraft is up,
and they're gone.

1036
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:30,844
Let me ask you something.

1037
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,554
Was it you?

1038
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,656
Did you kill
the former captain?

1039
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,701
What makes you
think l did?

1040
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:52,006
Because Capt. YOO will be
reported as a KlA.

1041
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:57,342
You've seen enough.
lsn't yourjob over now?

1042
01:31:57,778 --> 01:32:00,838
What?
lt's not enough?

1043
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:04,342
Murders, treachery,
disobeying orders.

1044
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:11,253
Those are my charges?

1045
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,151
That's right.

1046
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,456
l report you
and my job is over.

1047
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:21,002
So is yours, asshole.

1048
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:24,665
l'd rather die out here.

1049
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,292
Two fucking Seconds.

1050
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:45,554
lt didn't echo.

1051
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:47,859
He's nearby.

1052
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:51,860
Listen up.

1053
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:56,559
l count to 3, and we all run
in different directions.

1054
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:59,568
He's fast,
but he can't kill us all.

1055
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:01,468
Some of us will live.

1056
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:03,076
One!

1057
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:04,545
Two!

1058
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:05,938
Three!

1059
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,356
l see you, asshole.

1060
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,066
l got him.

1061
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:11,244
You...

1062
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:15,944
CHA Tae-kyung?

1063
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,452
Fuck.

1064
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:23,247
Su-hyeok!

1065
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,050
No.

1066
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:27,495
Don't come!

1067
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:28,655
Su-hyeok!

1068
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:31,958
Eun-pyo, don't come.

1069
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:36,069
Su-hyeok...

1070
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:37,167
Go!

1071
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,144
Su-hyeok!

1072
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:05,965
Eun-pyo...

1073
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:12,161
Don't come,
or you'll get killed.

1074
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:30,854
You know what?

1075
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:35,255
l think l died long ago.

1076
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:47,872
You, me.

1077
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:51,239
Everybody
in Alligator Company.

1078
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,947
Even Two Seconds.

1079
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:59,546
She also died long ago.

1080
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:03,449
Like Sung-sick...

1081
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:09,359
We've killed too many.

1082
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,067
We should be in hell.

1083
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,662
Stop talking.

1084
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:26,538
But hell can't be
worse than here.

1085
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:33,042
Killing each other...

1086
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,251
l die today, and...

1087
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:41,156
Stop it!

1088
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:44,464
You're not dying, asshole!

1089
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,860
Eun-pyo.

1090
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:52,873
My mom...

1091
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:56,410
Yes, Su-hyeok.

1092
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:57,934
My mom...

1093
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,151
l can't remember her face.

1094
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:11,656
Su-hyeok?

1095
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:16,058
Su-hyeok!

1096
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:17,664
No.

1097
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:21,061
No!

1098
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,442
Sorry...

1099
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,771
We got booze, too.

1100
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:54,895
''Goggles are handy
in summer. Thanks.''

1101
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:56,760
lt must be that boy.

1102
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:02,662
He's dead.

1103
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,967
l killed him.

1104
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:11,234
They killed many
of our comrades, too.

1105
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:18,351
What does it say?

1106
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:22,252
''Hey, CHA Tae-kyung''

1107
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:23,624
The photo is mine!
And don't worry about your sister.

1108
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:24,792
I'II take good care of her.
Let's stop fighting, asshoIes.

1109
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,352
What is it?

1110
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:29,253
What does it say?

1111
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:33,157
''Let's stop fighting, assholes.''

1112
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:35,803
That's all?

1113
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,405
Pretty much.

1114
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:42,710
l bet they're sick
of this war.

1115
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,838
So are we.
Why are we fighting then?

1116
01:39:55,990 --> 01:40:00,859
Leaves are...

1117
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:05,757
FaIIing...

1118
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:06,900
KIM Su-hyeok

1119
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,563
Into the night...

1120
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,507
at the front Iine...

1121
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,474
Sir!

1122
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:20,538
Comrade Captain!

1123
01:40:21,382 --> 01:40:22,940
The war is over.

1124
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:27,547
Listen to this.

1125
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:29,656
The armistice has been
signed by...

1126
01:40:29,723 --> 01:40:32,993
The war is over!

1127
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:34,460
lt's over!

1128
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,041
Thank you!

1129
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,244
We made it alive!

1130
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:00,152
Thank you, sir!

1131
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:10,156
Lieutenant KANG!

1132
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:30,843
How could this happen?

1133
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,758
Why couldn't you survive
another day?

1134
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:51,471
The war is fucking over.

1135
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:58,644
Sir...

1136
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,157
lt's okay to be hurt.

1137
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:17,254
You can cry.

1138
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:32,436
Bro...

1139
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:51,857
Fire!

1140
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,269
Rest in peace.

1141
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:06,343
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1142
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:36,067
KIM II-sung.

1143
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:30,354
Enemy!

1144
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:10,561
Goodbye!

1145
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,368
Goodbye!

1146
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:16,473
You fought well!

1147
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:21,038
l guess it's really over.

1148
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:24,550
Let's go.

1149
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:31,357
Lieutenant!

1150
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:37,063
What?

1151
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:03,954
KIM Su-hyeok.

1152
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:16,469
Let's go.

1153
01:46:31,084 --> 01:46:32,051
Sir!

1154
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:33,252
Attention!

1155
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:45,899
We, hereby, sign
an armistice agreement

1156
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:48,402
to stop the bloodshed

1157
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:51,605
and suspend any open
hostile activities

1158
01:46:51,605 --> 01:46:57,942
until a complete peace is
achieved on the peninsula.

1159
01:46:58,678 --> 01:47:02,182
Conditions of an armistice
under this agreement

1160
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:09,054
are to be strictly forced
by all the parties involved.

1161
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:13,455
lt was signed at 10 a.m.
on July 27.

1162
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:27,766
However...

1163
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:32,638
The supplementary provision
states clearly

1164
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,044
that the armistice agreement
takes effect as of 22:00

1165
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:44,351
on July 27, 1953.
12 hours after it was signed.

1166
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:49,162
We still have
12 hours left.

1167
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:55,261
We'll launch a full attack
on all the fronts.

1168
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:59,463
12 hours from now,
it's gonna be our land.

1169
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:03,435
Captain SHlN.

1170
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:06,345
Sir?

1171
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,148
Take the north ridge
of Aerok Hill.

1172
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,647
Didn't you hear me?

1173
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:21,049
My company isn't
in good shape, sir.

1174
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:26,154
lt's the last combat.
Deal with it.

1175
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,768
Show us what you got.

1176
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:38,478
12 hours of all-out war?

1177
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,537
That's crazy!

1178
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,748
Tell me!

1179
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:50,149
Why are you laughing?

1180
01:48:53,593 --> 01:48:57,051
Did you expect
to survive this war?

1181
01:48:57,297 --> 01:48:58,798
Comrade...

1182
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:03,667
l was stupid to be hopeful.

1183
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:08,469
Get all the squad leaders.

1184
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:14,135
We're ending this war.

1185
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:23,754
No matter what it takes,
l'll save my men.

1186
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:31,755
He said that
winning the war is to survive.

1187
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:34,357
To stay alive.

1188
01:49:35,602 --> 01:49:37,570
Su-hyeok said that?

1189
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:39,372
Yes.

1190
01:49:41,508 --> 01:49:46,241
He said our enemy wasn't commies,
but the war itself.

1191
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:05,959
We'll take Aerok back
from the north ridge.

1192
01:50:17,677 --> 01:50:21,636
We were nicknamed
Alligator Company

1193
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:27,151
by American troops.

1194
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:31,048
Do you know why?

1195
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,956
Alligators lay about 50 eggs.

1196
01:50:37,897 --> 01:50:41,856
More than half are eaten
by other animals.

1197
01:50:42,002 --> 01:50:48,464
And most of those hatched
fall prey to other animals.

1198
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:52,644
Only one or two survives.

1199
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,850
But you know what?

1200
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:04,152
One or two alligators

1201
01:51:05,692 --> 01:51:11,756
that survived out of 50
grow up

1202
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:14,758
to rule the swamp.

1203
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:16,668
That's alligators.

1204
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:20,564
We're facing the last combat.

1205
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:26,643
ln the past 2 and half years,
500 thousand have died.

1206
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:31,244
But we've survived!

1207
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:34,647
We're alligators!

1208
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:37,352
We rule the combat field!

1209
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:38,892
Got that?

1210
01:51:38,892 --> 01:51:40,293
Yes, sir!

1211
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:41,695
Who's the strongest?

1212
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,796
Alligators!

1213
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:44,497
Who's the fittest?

1214
01:51:44,497 --> 01:51:45,464
Alligators!

1215
01:51:45,799 --> 01:51:47,960
Survive for 12 hours!

1216
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:50,662
Stay alive!

1217
01:51:53,807 --> 01:51:55,172
So we can go home.

1218
01:52:06,186 --> 01:52:08,154
We can't see them.

1219
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:11,048
But they're very close.

1220
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,349
Less than 100 meters away.

1221
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:17,162
What are you doing here?

1222
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:19,358
You can't leave me out.

1223
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,468
We're in this together.

1224
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:24,770
lt's just another 12 hours.

1225
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:29,272
Damn, it's foggy.

1226
01:52:30,977 --> 01:52:34,242
The whole world is
telling us to fight.

1227
01:52:35,682 --> 01:52:38,242
And this fog is telling us
not to.

1228
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:41,545
That's right.

1229
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,054
lf it stays this foggy

1230
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:50,356
the USAF can't strike.

1231
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:53,661
And they might call off
this operation.

1232
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:56,364
Right?

1233
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:04,333
Once the fog clears,
they'll bomb this hill.

1234
01:53:05,178 --> 01:53:08,341
Once they do,
we'll charge.

1235
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:12,050
lf we survive this...

1236
01:53:16,589 --> 01:53:17,954
l'll call you Bro.

1237
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:22,254
So stay alive.

1238
01:53:23,897 --> 01:53:25,956
Make sure you do.

1239
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,170
Son of a bitch!

1240
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:37,177
Stop crying, asshole!

1241
01:53:37,177 --> 01:53:39,839
l don't wanna fight.

1242
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,647
Stop crying, bitch!

1243
01:53:43,883 --> 01:53:47,148
Stop it!
Stop it, asshole!

1244
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:54,958
Fuck me.

1245
01:53:56,596 --> 01:53:59,399
Who the fuck is singing?

1246
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:00,559
No.

1247
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:03,362
lt's them.

1248
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:15,341
FaIIing down siIentIy...

1249
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:24,749
dew is so coId.

1250
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:34,801
Not abIe to sIeep...
tossing and turning...

1251
01:54:34,801 --> 01:54:43,175
I heard my mom's voice
teIIing me ways of a man.

1252
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:55,588
Don't I miss her voice.

1253
01:54:55,588 --> 01:54:57,249
Fuck.

1254
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:05,553
Heard from a distance...

1255
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:10,165
a Ioud gunshot,

1256
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:17,034
Iike a IuIIaby,

1257
01:55:17,977 --> 01:55:25,247
takes me home in my dream.

1258
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:29,346
My home,

1259
01:55:29,789 --> 01:55:32,952
my sweet home...

1260
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:43,303
Before a bowI of water...
mom prays for my safety.

1261
01:55:43,303 --> 01:55:51,438
Her shining gray hair
brings tears to my eyes.

1262
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:07,250
We're fucked.

1263
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:17,642
Motherfuckers!

1264
02:00:08,301 --> 02:00:12,067
Die, asshole!

1265
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:18,741
What's this?

1266
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:21,241
Asshole.

1267
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:43,464
Do you copy?
Stop bombing!

1268
02:00:43,803 --> 02:00:46,465
We're behind the enemy line!
Stop bombing!

1269
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,909
You're killing us all!

1270
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:52,639
We gotta pull out now!

1271
02:04:52,885 --> 02:04:56,252
You remember me,
don't you?

1272
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:02,658
You said
it would end in a week.

1273
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:06,355
You're still alive.

1274
02:05:09,101 --> 02:05:10,466
Dumbass.

1275
02:05:11,704 --> 02:05:13,467
Let me ask you this.

1276
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:19,840
Here's what you said
3 years ago.

1277
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:24,340
Do you know
why you're losing?

1278
02:05:25,484 --> 02:05:28,146
That's because you don't know
why you're fighting.

1279
02:05:35,294 --> 02:05:40,254
Why are we fighting?

1280
02:05:43,502 --> 02:05:44,867
l knew it.

1281
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:49,867
l knew what it was.

1282
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:54,844
But...

1283
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:02,351
lt's been too long.

1284
02:06:07,293 --> 02:06:08,954
l forgot.

1285
02:06:11,096 --> 02:06:12,859
