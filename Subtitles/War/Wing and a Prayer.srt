1
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,961
<i>Where is our navy?</i>

2
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,464
<i>Three months have passed</i>

3
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,966
<i>since the tragedy</i>
<i>at Pearl Harbor...</i>

4
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,471
<i>1 2 die as Jap submarines</i>
<i>strike near San Francisco.</i>

5
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:50,669
<i>Committee demands probe</i>
<i>of navy failure to fight.</i>

6
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:55,874
<i>Where is our navy?</i>
<i>Why doesn't it fight?</i>

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,883
We cannot
answer that question.

8
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,318
We must force ourselves
not to listen to it.

9
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,322
We do not intend
to tell theJapanese

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,826
how badly our navy
was damaged at Pearl Harbor.

11
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,327
Since December the 7 th,

12
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,660
our prewar strategy
is useless.

13
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,256
The defense
of the Aleutians

14
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,768
and our Pacific Coast
with the Hawaiis

15
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,929
at the apex
of the Triangle

16
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,165
is almost impossible

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,674
with what remains
of our navy.

18
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,677
But we are not considering
a defensive campaign.

19
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,178
You all realize

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,681
I'm indulging in
no false heroics

21
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,182
when I say

22
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,685
our only hope
of evading destruction

23
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,687
is to destroy
the enemy.

24
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,188
TheJapanese have won

25
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,192
a quick and staggering
succession of victories.

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,195
They're aiming now
at the final knockout--

27
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,197
the capture
of Pearl Harbor.

28
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,698
To accomplish this,

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,031
they must first
take Midway.

30
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,536
If they are permitted

31
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,539
to choose the time
and conditions of attack,

32
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,041
we haven't
much of a chance,

33
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,477
but if we can trick them
into meeting us

34
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,981
when they think
we are weak,

35
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,983
we then have a chance

36
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,986
of cutting their navy
down to our size

37
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,490
and proceeding with the rest
of the Pacific strategy.

38
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,991
We have learned

39
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,994
there are heavy concentrations
of enemy carriers

40
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,498
and other fleet units
in the Marshall Islands

41
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,727
and a numerous
transport force

42
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,995
making up at Truk.

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,197
So our strategy is this.

44
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,345
We shall concentrate
our strength near Midway

45
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,354
in our effort
to spring a trap.

46
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,255
One of our carriers
is already at sea

47
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,759
waiting to carry out
the initial phases

48
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,919
of this strategy.

49
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,927
On April the 28th,

50
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,759
this carrier
and its escort

51
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,265
will be off
the Marshall Islands,

52
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,268
close enough
to be detected.

53
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,325
On May the 3rd,

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,201
it is to be seen
near the Gilbert Islands

55
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,205
by theJapanese.

56
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,241
On May the 8th,

57
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,708
it will be detected
near Ocean Island,

58
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,211
as if heading
for theJap fleet at Truk,

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,214
but it will not attack.

60
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,715
It will turn south,

61
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,752
be seen on May the 1 5th
at Guadalcanal.

62
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,063
Every time one of our pilots
encounters a Jap plane,

63
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,565
he will return
to the carrier,

64
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,569
as if he did
not stomach a fight.

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,073
By sending this one carrier
on such a mission,

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,574
we hope
to convince the enemy

67
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,577
that our fleet
is scattered,

68
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,911
our fighting morale...
shattered.

69
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,418
Actually, we shall be
waiting for them in force

70
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,418
near Midway.

71
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,921
If they fall
for this bait

72
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,422
and attempt an invasion,

73
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,427
we shall then be able
to answer the question--

74
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,793
''Where is our navy?

75
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,456
Why doesn't it fight?''

76
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,656
Pilot to crew.

77
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,192
There's mama.

78
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,726
I see her, Commander.

79
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,172
Pilot to crew.

80
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,874
If you need
a toothpick,

81
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,044
I know where
you can find one.

82
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,524
We'd only need
half that space, Mr. Scott.

83
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,684
Just lower your wheels
and drop your hook,

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,694
like putting
a baby to bed.

85
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,387
<i>Set condition one</i>
<i>in the air department.</i>

86
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,689
<i>Stand by</i>
<i>to land planes.</i>

87
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,855
<i>Stand by</i>
<i>to land planes.</i>

88
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,796
Torpedo planes sighted
broad on the port quarter.

89
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,297
Altitude 2-5-0-0.

90
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,799
Range 8,000 yards.

91
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,892
Stand by
for practice run.

92
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,735
If those were only meatballs
instead ofTBFs.

93
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,454
O.K. Hook.

94
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,319
Stand clear.

95
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,391
I'm O'Donnell, commanding Bomber Six.
Welcome aboard.

96
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,764
Molton, commanding
Torpedo Five.

97
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,769
What's the scuttlebutt?
What gives?

98
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,204
I thought we'd find out
when we got aboard.

99
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,673
Not from us.

100
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,176
I thought with
you guys aboard,

101
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,677
we'd have some action.

102
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,678
Name's Shubert.

103
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,681
I'm Manning.
We're on a cook's tour.

104
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,774
Your guess is
as good as mine.

105
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,011
See you around.

106
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,035
Sir.

107
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,536
Lieutenant Commander
Edward Molton

108
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,539
reporting for
Torpedo Squadron Five.

109
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,541
Glad to have you aboard.

110
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,043
Molton, Commander Harper,
our air officer.

111
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,043
How do you do?

112
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,044
Good to see you.

113
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,104
I've a message for you.

114
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,797
Hey, what's eating Oscar?

115
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,458
Sure making
a long approach.

116
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,503
He's building up
an entrance.

117
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,461
Just feel your way
in, sir. Lightly.

118
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,696
And politely.

119
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,698
Do we have
to shoot him down?

120
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,576
What does he want,
a spotlight?

121
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,077
He's coming in too fast.

122
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,185
Can't he see
that wave-off?

123
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,922
[Siren Sounds]

124
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,821
Assemble your squadron
in the ready room.

125
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,322
Aye, aye, sir.

126
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,664
Boy, I thought
for a while there...

127
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,597
until 1 900...

128
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,828
I thought I'd have
to turn back.

129
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,564
Maybe you should have.

130
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,572
Didn't you see
the wave-off?

131
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,698
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,505
Did you think the flagman
was waving bye-bye?

133
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,444
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't think.

134
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,449
I had my hands
too full of airplane

135
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,109
at the time.

136
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,948
Oh.

137
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,180
But--

138
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,992
Oh, men, this is our air officer
Commander Harper.

139
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,992
Commander Harper,
this is Mr. Brainard,

140
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,707
Mr. Chisholm.

141
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,364
Mr. Markham.

142
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:20,373
How do you do?

143
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:21,374
Mr.Jacobson.

144
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:22,375
How do you do?

145
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,376
Mr. White.

146
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,377
Sir.

147
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:25,378
Mr. Holloway.

148
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,379
Mr. Scott.

149
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,972
How do you do?

150
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,891
I'm glad to know you

151
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,153
and welcome you aboard.

152
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,388
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

153
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,396
You've been assigned
to quarters

154
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,399
which I hope you find
to your liking.

155
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,731
We have some pretty
good men on board.

156
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,738
I've been very proud of
all of our squadrons--

157
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:52,239
torpedoes,
bombers, and fighters.

158
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:55,003
I hope
you equal their record.

159
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,913
Read that, please,
Mr. Molton.

160
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:01,609

Spangler couldn't
get out of the way.

00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,802
I don't
like explanations.

183
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,477
Secure.

184
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,854
Sorry, sir.

185
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,866
The way you and the
others had to take it

186
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:26,923
on account of me.

187
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,527
Just don't ignore
any more wave-offs.

188
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,095
Aye, aye, sir.

189
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,576
Mr. Scott.

190
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,237
Here's some
mail for you.

191
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,406
Oh, thanks.

192
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:45,010
I see the movie fans
haven't forgotten you, sir.

193
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,153
Cunningham?

194
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,250
Yes, sir.

195
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,386
I've received this letter
from the admiral.

196
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,897
I thought you'd
like to read it.

197
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,103
Congratulations.

198
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,777
Gentlemen!

199
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,778
Gentlemen!

200
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,577
I give you
Cookie Cunningham!

201
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,448
The man who studied
Japanese mathematics

202
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,454
and found you always
get the right answer

203
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,285
by subtracting zero.

204
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:29,230
Who says we don't know
where we're going?

205
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:32,233
I tell you what
I'm going to do.

206
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,565
I'll fly my TBF
clear to Tokyo.

207
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,070
I'll drag that
little monkey to 1 5,000

208
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,573
and drop him
like a bomb,

209
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,665
right smack on Fujiyama.

210
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,176
I can't stand the
canned vegetables

211
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,678
you get
on shipboard.

212
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,179
But our squadron's
different.

213
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:47,510
We'll have
fresh vegetables.

214
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,515
How come?

215
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,608
How?

216
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,788
You going to plow up
the flight deck?

217
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:54,914
No, I'm not kidding.

218
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,924
We'll have
some fresh celery,

219
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,789
real juicy tomatoes,
green onions--

220
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:01,728
What are you going
to use for dirt?

221
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,230
Water and chemicals.

222
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,356
That's the agriculture
of the future.

223
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,095
Ya-hoo!

224
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,101
Hey, fellows!

225
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,102
Look!

226
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,038
Get a load of this!

227
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,631
Wait a minute!

228
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,641
Hey, wait!

229
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,200
Now don't do that.

230
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:17,643
You did it!

231
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:19,647
It shows it right there.

232
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,148
You kissed Betty Grable.

233
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:24,208
If I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

234
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,719
Did you
ever kiss Garbo?

235
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:26,719
I've never seen her.

236
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,222
When you're in a picture

237
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,055
and you have
to kiss Betty Grable--

238
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,061
Listen to me--
<i>have to</i>--

239
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:37,064
When you kiss her,
what's it feel like?

240
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,565
Ah, let it lay.

241
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:39,726
I'm serious
about this, Oscar.

242
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,825
I really mean it.

243
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,838
I mean, do you feel
anything at all,

244
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,637
or is it all just
part of the day's work?

245
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,801
Does she breathe deep?

246
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,141
Does she kiss you
or you her?

247
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,145
Does she kiss back?

248
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:54,239
What I want to know is,

249
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,750
how does it make
you feel?

250
00:17:56,818 --> 00:18:00,754
The rest of us can only dream
about those girls,

251
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,188
but you've
actually kissed them.

252
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,691
What's it like?

253
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,694
Well, it's, uh...

254
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,822
it's like nothing
else in this world.

255
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,661
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

256
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,167
I'll never forget
that first girl

257
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,931
I kissed in a picture.

258
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,028
Who was it?

259
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,037
Yeah. Who?

260
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,199
You think
I'd kiss and tell?

261
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,708
In a wardroom?

262
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,210
Come on, Oscar.

263
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:25,143
Well, it's, um...

264
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,216
The night before
the scene was to be shot,

265
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,717
I didn't sleep.

266
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:32,720
I lay awake all night,

267
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,779
just daydreaming
about that kiss.

268
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,585
How do you
daydream at night?

269
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,590
Quiet.

270
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,820
Well, how do you?

271
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,328
The next morning

272
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,296
I got to the studio
an hour earlier,

273
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:44,798
got into my wardrobe,

274
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,561
dashed over to the set.

275
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,570
I waited all day
for that one moment

276
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,072
when I'd get
to kiss her.

277
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,576
Finally, it was time
for the scene to be shot.

278
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,236
We took our places.

279
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,406
She was wearing the most beautiful
black negligee.

280
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:01,949
Lovely...

281
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,882
revealing.

282
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,512
Her hair was swept back
from her forehead.

283
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,522
Her eyes
were partly closed.

284
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,024
I took her
into my arms...

285
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,823
Go on.
Kiss her, you dope!

286
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:15,021
The hairdresser yelled,

287
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,190
''You're mussing up
her hairdo.''

288
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:20,701
The director screamed, '' Move your arm.
You're tilting her collar.''

289
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,203
The cameraman said,
''I can't see her nose.''

290
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:26,297
So I kissed her off-center
and smacked the air.

291
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,536
If you want
to kiss a girl right,

292
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,669
you got
to join the navy.

293
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,681
Hey! You can't
get away with that!

294
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,883
Hey! Hey! Gather 'round.

295
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:39,386
I want
to tell you something.

296
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:41,319
Your worries are over.

297
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,553
Listen to the voice
of Superman.

298
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:49,129
<i>I'll tell you what</i>
<i>I'm going to do.</i>

299
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:52,132
<i>I'll fly my TBF</i>
<i>clear to Tokyo.</i>

300
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,634
<i>Throw a rope</i>
<i>around Tojo's neck,</i>

301
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,638
<i>like I roped coyotes</i>
<i>back in Texas.</i>

302
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:00,641
<i>I'll drag that</i>
<i>monkey to 1 5,000 feet</i>

303
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,734
<i>and drop him</i>
<i>like a bomb...</i>

304
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:03,869
Very funny.

305
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:07,244
I wouldn't want
to bore you guys

306
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,749
with what I'm
really going to do.

307
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,252
It sure takes
a load off our minds.

308
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,584
That guy there
might possibly give you

309
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:15,782
a few pointers.

310
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:18,223
He's only shot down
three Zeros.

311
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,496
I'm just a bag of wind
from Texas.

312
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,997
I must sound funny

313
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,933
to a guy who's done
the things you've done.

314
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,094
How do you feel

315
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,604
when those meatballs
come at you?

316
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:32,105
I didn't see them

317
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,266
until they were
pretty close.

318
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:34,706
Did they attack
from above?

319
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,708
From below.

320
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,039
They missed
with their first pass.

321
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,774
They say they can attack,
pull out,

322
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,282
and dive again
before you see them.

323
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,749
Slow but with
maneuverability?

324
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,252
I don't know, really--

325
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,255
They machine-gun you
on the way down?

326
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:49,756
I'm writing my memoirs

327
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,759
for <i>the Saturday Evening Post.</i>

328
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,727
You can read them
after the war.

329
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,729
All right.
Break it up.

330
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,230
Let's cut a record.

331
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,733
Hey, you want me
to make another one?

332
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,248
I could knock that moon
out of the sky.

333
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,749
Leave it alone.

334
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,377
I'll need that moon
when I get home.

335
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,428
Right on the beam, kid.

336
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,793
What's your name?

337
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,919
Benjamin K. O'Neal,
sir.

338
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:02,361
Aviation radioman,
first class.

339
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,625
Did you come in
with Torpedo Five?

340
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,893
That's right, sir.

341
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,730
Haven't you served
under me before?

342
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:10,737
I was in and out
of Pensacola, sir.

343
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,739
I thought I'd
seen you before.

344
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,240
As you were.

345
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:17,905
Bring back

346
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:21,039
Bring back
my Bonny to me

347
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,606
To me...

348
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,454
What's wrong, Benny?

349
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:30,252
I've been ducking him
since I came on board.

350
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,260
If he figures how long
ago he saw me,

351
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,761
he'll ground me sure.

352
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:35,761
How come?

353
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,263
Too old
for air combat duty.

354
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:38,765
Are you kidding?

355
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,857
There's no law--

356
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:41,869
That man's
the whole navy

357
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:43,768
in one pair of pants.

358
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:46,773
Do you know what
kind of guy he is?

359
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:50,777
He's the only officer whose men
wouldn't give him a nickname.

360
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:52,472

You've gotten off to a bad start

There was very little

561
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,768
Hitting that sled
wasn't just carelessness.

No, sir. I wanted to see

You will.

I couldn't escape them,
so I fired on them.

what they've run into,

896
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:19,895
they're going
to come after you

897
01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:21,399
with everything they've got,

898
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:24,869
but this is the battle
we've been praying for.

899
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:29,241
We've got it--
on our own grounds,

900
01:12:29,309 --> 01:12:31,038
on our own terms.

901
01:12:32,412 --> 01:12:33,379
Good luck.

902
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:12,680
<i>Pilots...</i>

903
01:13:12,753 --> 01:13:14,812
<i>stand by</i>
<i>to start engines.</i>

904
01:13:14,888 --> 01:13:16,549
<i>Stand clear propellers.</i>

905
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:19,550
<i>Start engines.</i>

906
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:49,019
B.G., all set?

907
01:13:50,657 --> 01:13:51,681
Ready, sir.

908
01:13:51,758 --> 01:13:54,852
O'Neal, got your
recognition code straight?

909
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:57,089
Yes, sir.
One for this morning

910
01:13:57,164 --> 01:13:58,597
and one
for this afternoon.

911
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:04,100
We'll celebrate tonight

912
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:06,196
with a nice,
fresh vegetable salad.

913
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:08,332
The first
from my seagoing farm.

914
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:29,054
Sir, last enemy position,

915
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:33,058
bearing 2-1 -5 true,
1 50 miles.

916
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,330
Molton to Squadron,
there's our target.

917
01:16:31,117 --> 01:16:32,550
Molton to Squadron,

918
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:35,554
remember, when you think
you're in close,

919
01:16:35,622 --> 01:16:38,420
go in closer
before you drop that fish.

920
01:19:07,073 --> 01:19:10,008
Molton to Squadron,
join up.

921
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:11,509
<i>Come on,join up.</i>

922
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:13,011
<i>Jacobson, rendezvous,</i>
<i>join up.</i>

923
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:15,206
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>There's a Zero on your tail.</i>

924
01:19:15,281 --> 01:19:17,715
<i>There's one on yours, too.</i>
<i>Join up.</i>

925
01:19:17,784 --> 01:19:18,716
<i>You all right, Hale?</i>

926
01:19:18,785 --> 01:19:19,717
<i>Yeah, Mr. Molton.</i>

927
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:22,220
Relay this
throughout the ship.

928
01:19:22,288 --> 01:19:23,277
Radio Room?

929
01:19:23,356 --> 01:19:26,018
Relay these messages
throughout the ship.

930
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:27,719
<i>Wassum's out</i>
<i>like a flower.</i>

931

<i>Stand by for anything.</i>

932
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:31,789
<i>There ought to be fighters.</i>

933
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:33,230
<i>Watch that Zero</i>
<i>up there.</i>

934
01:19:33,299 --> 01:19:35,824
<i>He won't budge.</i>
<i>He's an old-timer.</i>

935
01:19:35,902 --> 01:19:37,733
<i>What's that Zero</i>
<i>doing, Hank?</i>

936
01:19:37,804 --> 01:19:39,738
<i>He ain't saying.</i>
<i>Just hanging there.</i>

937
01:19:39,806 --> 01:19:41,239
<i>They'll</i>
<i>make a pass soon.</i>

938
01:19:41,307 --> 01:19:42,740
<i>They tagging</i>
<i>our outfit?</i>

939
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:44,140
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

940
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,236
<i>Shut up. Never mind</i>
<i>the crystal ball gazing.</i>

941
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:50,314
<i>Come on,you</i>--

942
01:19:50,383 --> 01:19:51,315
<i>Shut up!</i>

<i>1 2 o'clock! Something coming</i>
<i>through the formation.</i>

944
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:57,255
<i>Wait till they come in.</i>

945
01:19:57,323 --> 01:19:58,756
<i>Where's our fighters?</i>

946
01:19:58,825 --> 01:20:00,258
<i>Watch the ponies</i>

<i>All right,</i>
<i>I've got him!</i>

01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,494
<i>You take him,Joe!</i>

952
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:10,763
<i>Two more at 2 o'clock</i>

01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:44,802
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>

01:20:44,871 --> 01:20:46,463
<i>Ed, is that you?</i>

977
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:47,471
<i>Yeah.</i>

978
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,303
<i>They got Hank.</i>

01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,309
<i>Gosh, there they go.</i>

980
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:53,811
<i>There's one chute.</i>
<i>Two to go.</i>

01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,313
<i>He's rolling over.</i>

982
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:57,611
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
<i>Get out of there.</i>

983
01:20:57,684 --> 01:20:59,117
<i>Bail out of there.</i>

<i>2 o'clock!</i>
<i>They're coming in!</i>

989
01:21:08,828 --> 01:21:10,762
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>under you, Ben.</i>

990
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,764
<i>Hold your hats.</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>

991
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:14,766
<i>Take 'em, Bill,</i>
<i>take 'em!</i>

<i>Look out!</i>

<i>Nice work.</i>

<i>[Gunfire]</i>

1007
01:21:39,425 --> 01:21:42,360

01:21:42,428 --> 01:21:43,861
<i>Mike, are you</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1009
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:46,864
<i>I think that burst got him,</i>
<i>Mr.Jacobson.</i>

1010
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:48,194
<i>Better bail out,</i>
<i>Tommy.</i>

1011
01:21:48,267 --> 01:21:49,256
<i>We haven't much time.</i>

1012
01:21:49,335 --> 01:21:50,859
<i>Were you hit, Mike?</i>

1013
01:21:50,936 --> 01:21:52,369
<i>Shut off your intercom,</i>
<i>Jacobson.</i>

1014
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:54,872
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>My equipment's shot up.</i>

1015
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,373
<i>Mike, are you O.K.?</i>

1016
01:21:56,442 --> 01:21:57,875
<i>It's my leg, sir.</i>

1017
01:21:57,943 --> 01:21:59,376
<i>Can you move them?</i>

1018
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,879
<i>Mike, can you</i>
<i>move your legs?</i>

1019
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,382
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

1020
01:22:05,451 --> 01:22:06,816
<i>We're burning</i>
<i>back here.</i>

1021
01:22:06,886 --> 01:22:08,820
<i>You'd better</i>
<i>bail out, sir.</i>

1022
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:11,322
<i>I haven't got</i>
<i>the altitude, Mike.</i>

1023
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,823
<i>We'll take this ride</i>
<i>together.</i>

1024

<i>Jacobson,join up.</i>
<i>Do you hear me, Hans?</i>

1025
01:22:15,895 --> 01:22:17,829
<i>Join up, I tell you.</i>

1026
01:22:27,907 --> 01:22:29,340
<i>Enemy planes approaching.</i>

<i>All hands stand by.</i>

1028
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,571
<i>Enemy planes approaching.</i>

1029
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:39,080
Hard left!
Hard left!

1030
01:23:17,156 --> 01:23:18,817
Hard right rudder!

1031
01:23:18,891 --> 01:23:22,349
[Bomb Whistling]

1032
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:32,827
The bomb that hit aft

1033
01:23:32,905 --> 01:23:34,338
damaged
the hydraulic lines

1034
01:23:34,406 --> 01:23:36,340
that control
the landing gear.

1035
01:23:44,717 --> 01:23:46,048
How long to repair?

1036
01:23:46,118 --> 01:23:47,085
Hard to say, sir.

1037
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:49,519
The returning planes
will be low on gas.

1038
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:52,785
I want that gear operating
by the time they're in sight.

1039
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:54,849
I want a report
on damage

1040
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:56,360
and our maximum
possible speed.

1041
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:17,646
The engine room reports
we can only make 20 knots.

1042
01:24:17,716 --> 01:24:20,583
We'll need 25 knots
to land our planes.

1043
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:21,813
Report that
below.

1044
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:22,911
Aye, aye, sir.

1045
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,835
Call out the after-damage
control party.

1046
01:24:37,903 --> 01:24:40,337
20 men from the V-3 division.

1047
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:41,839
Clear that damage.

1048
01:24:46,912 --> 01:24:48,072
Hurry it up!

1049
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:28,813
The flight deck officer reports

1050
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:31,823
it's impossible to repair
the after-flight deck

1051
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:33,688
in less than 45 minutes.

1052
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:39,331
You got just 20 minutes
to repair that flight deck.

1053
01:25:39,398 --> 01:25:40,330
When the planes return,

1054
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:42,424
they'll have a deck
to land on.

1055
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:45,561
Sir, escort has picked up
enemy submarine

1056
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,071
on the sound
detector.

1057
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,335
We got a plane left
to launch?

1058
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:51,341
One, sir.
Just repaired.

1059
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,342
Launch her.

1060
01:25:53,846 --> 01:25:55,837
Launch catapult bomber.

1061
01:25:55,915 --> 01:25:57,473
Launch catapult bomber.

1062
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:58,845
<i>Launch catapult bomber.</i>

1063
01:25:58,918 --> 01:26:00,852
<i>Launch catapult bomber.</i>

1064
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:04,353
Rapid gunners,
hold your fire.

1065
01:26:04,423 --> 01:26:05,913
Catapult plane
being launched.

1066
01:26:27,379 --> 01:26:29,313
We're going
to be hit.

1067
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:56,840
Who was flying
that plane?

1068
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:58,843
Ensign Cunningham, sir.

1069
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:01,846
That the one
they call Cookie?

1070
01:27:01,914 --> 01:27:03,848
Yes, sir.

1071
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:07,079
Sir, Torpedo Five
and fighter escort returning.

1072
01:27:19,365 --> 01:27:21,299
Prepare to land planes.

1073
01:27:21,367 --> 01:27:23,858
Prepare to land planes.

1074
01:27:24,937 --> 01:27:26,802
Code this
to the other carriers--

1075
01:27:26,872 --> 01:27:29,306
As soon as
planes have landed,

1076
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,309
changing course
60 degrees southeast

1077
01:27:31,377 --> 01:27:32,810
for cover of rain squall

1078
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,311
till repairs are completed.

1079
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:35,813
Aye, aye, sir.

1080
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:02,602
[Playing Reveille]

1081
01:28:02,674 --> 01:28:05,666
Red, this is Molton.
What now?

1082
01:28:05,744 --> 01:28:08,611
Radar picked up disturbances
at 85 miles,

1083
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,113
altitude 5,000 feet,

1084
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:12,616
but they've settled down
to a single object.

1085
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:15,812
We can hear it now.
Sounds like a TBF.

1086
01:28:15,888 --> 01:28:17,116
You hear that, Molton?

1087
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:18,281
Could be a TBF.

1088
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:19,790
Any of yours
straggling?

1089
01:28:19,858 --> 01:28:21,189
Wait a minute.

1090
01:28:24,696 --> 01:28:27,631
Oscar was just passing
over the cargo

1091
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:29,132
when she blew up.

1092
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,135
Maybe...

1093
01:28:32,237 --> 01:28:35,138
Scott is the only one
not accounted for.

1094
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:36,139
Thanks, Red.

1095
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:11,473
Mr. Scott?

1096
01:29:12,744 --> 01:29:15,713
You figure the carrier
ducked under that soup?

1097
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:21,618
Maybe.

1098
01:29:21,687 --> 01:29:23,621
They weren't
at the rendezvous.

1099
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:25,554
Keep your chin up.

1100
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:29,116
I'm not afraid of anything anymore,
Mr. Scott.

1101
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:31,059
Today's my birthday.

1102
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:34,122
How old are you
today, B.G.?

1103
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:35,962
1 7, sir.

1104
01:29:46,345 --> 01:29:47,607
You hear that Benny?

1105
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,146
Hey, Benny.

1106
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:16,173
I'll get him down.

1107
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:07,156
Mr. Scott,
couldn't we break radio silence

1108
01:31:07,226 --> 01:31:08,955
long enough
to get a fix?

1109
01:31:14,733 --> 01:31:18,169
Nobody would like that
better than I would, B.G.

1110
01:31:18,237 --> 01:31:19,363
No dice.

1111
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,175
Brother, how I could use
a spotlight now.

1112
01:31:40,259 --> 01:31:41,886
That's Ensign Scott, sir.

1113
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:48,028
He doesn't know
our new course.

1114
01:31:53,272 --> 01:31:55,206
Couldn't we break
radio silence?

1115
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:59,370
You don't have to give him
a position theJaps can check.

1116
01:31:59,444 --> 01:32:01,878
Just say,
''We're right under you.

1117
01:32:01,947 --> 01:32:04,711
Ceiling, 50 feet.
Come on down.''

1118
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:09,152
If you think theJaps
have a radar fix on him,

1119
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:11,746
let me go up.
I can lead him down.

1120
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:15,657
That's as useful to the enemy
as breaking radio silence.

1121
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:17,524
We can't risk
this carrier.

1122
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:19,154
What about that kid--

1123
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:20,198
That's enough, Molton.

1124
01:32:20,265 --> 01:32:21,664
Check
your casualty list

1125
01:32:21,733 --> 01:32:23,667
and reform
your squadron.

1126
01:32:23,735 --> 01:32:25,168
Yes, sir.

1127
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:30,167
[Engine Faltering]

1128
01:32:37,249 --> 01:32:42,186
[Plane Diving]

1129
01:32:42,254 --> 01:32:43,687
[Crash]

1130
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:07,136
First it was Gus,

1131
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:09,146
then Brainard,

1132
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:11,011
then Chuck,

1133
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:13,142
and then Hans.

1134
01:33:13,218 --> 01:33:16,153
But at least he had
a fighting chance.

1135
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:19,156
But not Oscar.
He didn't have a chance.

1136
01:33:19,224 --> 01:33:21,658
Up there,
going back and forth,

1137
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:24,127
and nobody made an effort
to help him down.

1138
01:33:43,749 --> 01:33:46,684
Do you know
what these are?

1139
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:49,948
They're casualty lists.

1140
01:33:51,757 --> 01:33:55,454
They're obituaries of
a long list of friends of mine.

1141
01:33:55,527 --> 01:33:58,690
Yes, friends.

1142
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:02,700
If I seemed too tough
on the boys,

1143
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:05,202
it was because I was
responsible for them.

1144
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,135
I didn't want to lose them

1145
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:10,641
any more than I wanted to
lose those boys up there.

1146
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:13,143
You think I wanted
to let Scott fly

1147
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:15,145
until he dove
into the sea?

1148
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:18,649
You think I want to dream
about them on a raft

1149
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:20,150
until their bodies rot?

1150
01:34:20,218 --> 01:34:22,152
I'm an air officer.

1151
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:26,657
There are things I can do
and things I can't do.

1152
01:34:26,725 --> 01:34:28,659
I can check casualty lists,

1153
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:31,662
and I can order more men
into the air

1154
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,163
to become new casualties.

1155
01:34:33,231 --> 01:34:36,667
I can refuse to endanger
the lives of 3,000 men

1156
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:39,670
in order to save the lives
of three men.

1157
01:34:39,738 --> 01:34:42,172
I do those things
because they're my job,

1158
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,174
and I've got to do them.

1159
01:34:44,242 --> 01:34:45,675
But to be accused

1160
01:34:45,744 --> 01:34:47,678
of refusing
to save those men

1161
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:49,714
because I didn't
want to save them--

1162
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:52,181
[Ringing]

1163
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:57,688

Molton speaking.

1164
01:34:58,757 --> 01:35:00,190
It's for you, sir.

1165
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:05,194
Yes.

1166
01:35:12,204 --> 01:35:13,136
Very good.

1167
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,543
A destroyer picked up
Scott and his crew.

1168
01:35:21,613 --> 01:35:24,377
His radioman was lost,

1169
01:35:24,449 --> 01:35:28,146
but he and his gunner
are O.K.

1170
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,654
They got him!
He's back in!

1171
01:35:30,722 --> 01:35:34,158
How about that?
He's back in the ballgame.

1172
01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:51,300
Thanks, Ed.

1173
01:35:54,145 --> 01:35:55,077
Period.

1174
01:35:56,648 --> 01:35:57,580
Secure.

1175
01:36:01,753 --> 01:36:03,277
How about that?

1176
01:36:42,227 --> 01:36:44,161
Commander Harper.

1 9 SB2Cs...
