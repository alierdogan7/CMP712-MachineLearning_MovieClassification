- Not Kalf.

Continue.

25
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,125
I was visiting a monastery in Frankia,
outside of Paris.

26
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:08,129
And one day,
the monks took me to see it.

27
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:10,950
It was amazing.

28
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:15,603
It just appears
as if it rises out of the water.

29
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,641
I've never in my whole life
seen anything like it.

30
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,259
It was like a dream.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,679
It has these huge walls,
and inside the walls

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,515
are these buildings
made of marble and stone

33
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,933
and churches, such churches.

34
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,353
I remember the clamor of their bells,

35
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:32,787
calling the faithful to prayer.

38
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,761
is the beautiful women.

39
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,832
You never told me that part before!

40
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,033
I almost

41
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,704
questioned my vows of celibacy.

44
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:03,551
Ragnar and that priest.

45
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,521
Look at them,

46
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,823
huddled together.

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,226

You are lucky.

49
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,337
Why?

50
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,887
Because you have never been married.

51
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,908

52

53

56
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:47,779
Are you thirsty?

No.

58
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,768
I am not thirsty,

Torstein is in Valhalla.

- Where is, Siggy? I can't find her.
- Rollo! Rollo...

75
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,238
Siggy is dead.

76

How?

Ubbe and Hvitserk fell through

That day it just happened to be Siggy.

92
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:00,471
- On another day, it could have been me...
- I wasn't asking you, Helga.

when we were away.

185
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,049
Something happened
that led to the death of Siggy.

186
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,092
A wanderer came here.

187
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:20,132
We had all dreamed of him.
Aslaug, Siggy and me.

188
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,037
He said his name was Harbard.
And he possessed some gifts.

189
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,521
He told stories,
and he could cure people.

190
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,641
He cured Ivar of his pains.

191
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,579
- His name was Harbard?
- Yes.

192
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:35,881
That is what he said.

193
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,786
And what else did he do?
This, Harbard?

194
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:48,727
He seduced Aslaug.
She slept with him.

195
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,298
It was because of him that
she was not looking after the children.

196
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,068
And this...
He said his name was Harbard?

197
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,921
- Are you sure he said that?
- Yes, he said that.

198
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,406
But what does it matter?

199
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,643
He took Aslaug away from the children.

200
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:07,813
- It's his fault that Siggy died.
- No. Not his fault.

201

You frighten me.

204
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:16,356
Harbard is not a human being.

205
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:17,940
Harbard is a god.

206
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,760
He came to visit.

207
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,730
And such a visit
must always be celebrated.

it also leads to life.

But I don't want to tell Ragnar.

00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,444
- It is not my business to tell Ragnar.
- No, no, no.

Together we can overthrow this usurper.

235

of your own volition.

Secondly, if there is a civil war,

237

- Why?

Come! Come!

362
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:11,836
Athelstan has been to Paris.

363
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,789
And the wanderer
who first told me about England,

364
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,291
he too told me about this city.

365
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,978
We must find him.

366
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,096
- (ALL SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT)
- Yes!

367
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:27,384
For it is good to travel
with hope and with courage.

368
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:34,476
But it is still better
to travel with knowledge!

369
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:36,327
(ALL CHEERING)

370
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,753
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

371
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,089
MAN:
We will take this place!

372
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,532
What about your promise?

373
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:00,000
What promise?

374
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:02,871
To visit my Earldom.
To go to Hedeby.

375
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,555
To speak to the usurper.

376
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:09,511
Kalf!

377
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,248
You know why we've come.

378
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:18,620
You have usurped my rights and my lands,

379
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:21,722
to whom you were sworn
in fealty and trust.

380
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:25,592
I expect you to hand
both land and title back.

381
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,031
(CHUCKLES)

382
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,232
Hello, Kalf.

383
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,521
Perhaps we might discuss
these matters privately.

384
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,693
As you wish, King Ragnar.

385
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:01,628
Please, sit.

386
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:09,958
I would prefer to avoid
the unnecessary loss of lives

387
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:12,612
fighting a civil war with you.

388
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,947
Do you mind if I call you Earl, Kalf?

389
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,583
Uh-huh.

390
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,052
Come the spring,

391
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:26,870
I will be invading
a country called Frankia.

392
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:32,861
And I would like to invite you,

393
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:36,396
your men and your ships,
to join me on this expedition.

394
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,833
And if I refuse?

395
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,653
- You will lose everything.
- Even my Earldom?

396
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,872
You mean my Earldom.

397
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,243
LOTHBROK:
That is between you and my ex-wife.

398
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:51,512
And good luck with that.

399
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,052
Won't you sit down, Lagertha?

400
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,055
I know you must hate me.

401
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,493
Just let me say that I
was born here in Hedeby.

402
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:08,262
I belong here and have
a fierce pride in being its earl.

403
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,166
I have a better claim than you do

404
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:16,687
even though I share
the world's admiration for you.

405
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,409
I'm not sure I believe
so much in titles.

406
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,496
A title is only an opportunity
to do good things for the folk here.

407
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:28,298
I want to do that.

408
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,969
You betrayed me.

409
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,422
And the fact is,
you planned to betray me.

410
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:37,007
And you must have planned it
for a long time.

411
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:41,311
I did, yes...

412
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:45,682
Despite the fact that I desired you.

413
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:48,486
You desired me?

414
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:49,938
Yes.

415
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:54,525
All the time that I was planning
on overthrowing you, I desired you.

416
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,244
I never stopped desiring you.

417
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:03,000
What am I supposed
to do with that knowledge?

418
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:04,918
(CHUCKLES)

419
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,124
What do you want to do?

420
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:19,494
ROLLO:
Ragnar was always chosen over me.

421
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:22,596
By my father. And my mother.

422
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,332
Then by Lagertha.

423
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:29,187
Why would I not want to betray him?

424
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,972
Why would I not want to scream at him,

425
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:33,774
"You see, I am alive too!"

426
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:40,547
Being alive is nothing.
It doesn't matter what I do.

427
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:43,017
Ragnar is my father, he is my mother,

428
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:45,252
he is Lagertha, he is Siggy.

429
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:49,957
He is everything I cannot do,

430
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,658
everything I cannot be.

431
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:54,828
I love him.

432
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:57,064
He is my brother.

433
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:00,067
He has taken me back.

434
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,753
But I am so angry!

435
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:07,458
Why am I still so angry?

436
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,376
You tell me, wise one!

437
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:12,145
- Hmm.
- Or I will tell you!

438
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:16,451
It is because I am useless, feckless,

439
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,854
hollowed-out by failed ambitions,

440
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,588
by failed loves.

441
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:28,595
Nothing good can ever
come of my life now.

442
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:31,131
(SEER LAUGHING)

443
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:36,920
What is there to laugh about?

444
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,774
Oh Rollo,

445
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:42,577
if you truly knew what
the gods have in store for you,

446
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:45,530
you would go down now
and dance naked on the beach.

447
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,331
(LAUGHING)

448
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:49,150
I don't understand.

449
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:50,885
I tell you, as I told Ragnar,

450
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,720
the bear will marry a princess.

451
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:56,057
And I can tell you,
that you will be present at the ceremony.

452
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:58,392
Now go and leave me.

453
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,425

Come!

00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:57,103
Friends, it was all for this!

464
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,575
It was all for our Lord!

465
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,250
"Our Father,

466
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:13,871
who art in heaven,

467
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,956
hallowed be thy name..."

468
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:20,567
- Where are you going?
- I have no idea.

469
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:25,072
But your father won't fight
for my honor or my property.

470
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,339
I cannot stay here.

471
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,610
It seems we have been here before.

472
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:30,994
Don't try to stop me.

473
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,230
You can leave if you like.
You are a free woman.

474
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,784
But don't pretend to me
that you don't want to go to Paris.

475
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,135
I know you want to go to Paris.

476
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:40,737
I've dreamed of the three
of us going together.

477
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:42,722
Do you understand?

478
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,558
Do you understand you're not leaving?

479
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:49,930
You're a man now, Bjorn.

480
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:51,164
Act like one!

481
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,785
There are things you do not know
about this Harbard.

482
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:15,955
About this Harbard and your wife!

483
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,193
Helga told me everything.

484
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,199
She told me Harbard
would take Aslaug away

485
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,435
from her children,
away from your sons.

486
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,307
They would go off together.

487
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:36,092
Then they would sneak
into the fish huts and...

488
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,180
Many times.

489
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,718
Helga said she smelled like fish!

490
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:48,871
That's how it was.

491
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,559
That's what happened when you were away.

492
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,562
Wait! There's more, Ragnar.

493
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:56,829
There's much more.

494
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:00,968
Do you not know who Harbard is?

495
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,404
Harbard is another name for Odin.

496
00:39:03,405 --> 00:39:05,572
- It was Odin who slept with your wife.
- (SIGHS)

497
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,740
The god, Odin, who came to Kattegat.

498
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:23,056
I am ashamed

499
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:30,551
that my word as king
meant nothing to some of you!

500
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,336
That you organized this...

501
00:39:35,337 --> 00:39:38,906
this catastrophe among yourselves!

502
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:45,112
That you took it upon yourselves
to violate a treaty

503
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:48,298
that I had signed in good faith!

504
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:56,990
God knows what the Northmen
will make of these terrible events.

505
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,329
My name and my word as King of Wessex

506
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,765
will mean nothing to them!

507
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,121
But it cannot be, it cannot be!

508
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,173
It cannot be!

509
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,710
I cannot allow
and I cannot tolerate treason.

510
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:17,744
Guards!

511
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,464
Arrest this man! This man! And this!

512
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:24,283
And him! All for treason!

513
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:29,273
And my Lord Radolf. Arrest him also.

514
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:33,210
- Wait, Sire...
- For I showed him nothing,

515
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,329
nothing but love,

516
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,948
and this, this treachery is my reward?

517
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,603
- Out of my sight!
- (GRUNTS)

518
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:48,558
And Aethelwulf,
you think you will escape so lightly?

519
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:55,149
All of you! Leave!

520
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,784
I need to speak alone with my son!

521
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,079
(LAUGHS)

522
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,982
Thank you.

523
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:33,019
Thank you, my son.

524
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,524
You did the business so well.

525
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:42,863
How could we ever have
allowed these Northmen

526
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:47,033
to establish themselves here?
It's... It's unthinkable!

527
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,756
And I played my part well, did I not?

528
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,841
Yes, Father. Very well.

529
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,678
And by this ruse,

530
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,932
we have now caught out
all those nobles who question my rule

531
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:06,269
and we have reason now
to rid ourselves of them, permanently.

532
00:42:07,388 --> 00:42:09,355
- Mmm.
- It worked out well.

533
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:12,892
No...

534
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:18,231
It worked out beautifully, my son.

535
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:22,985
Even Charlemagne would have approved.

536
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:25,538
Don't you think so?
