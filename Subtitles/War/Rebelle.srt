00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,190
Never lose, never

We are rebels.

17
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,492

Look.

28
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,381
This is a bullet wound.

29
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:24,554
It was said to smoke at night
but I still smoked.

30
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,753
The bullet hit me.

31
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,619
Lifted the rifle. Tire.

32
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,850

45
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:56,393
We need to celebrate!

46
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,012
Ask better than that!

47
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,756
This is a book about
the history of the Grand Tiger.

53
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:00,375
You know why

56
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,134
What are you doing?

61
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,281

Then he invited the girls.

73
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:46,533
They are disguised ...

74
00:32:57,522 --> 00:33:00,457

After all I've done
for you ...

81
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,034
I have protected the forest,
on the river ...

82
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,944

94
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,830
Give me a white cock!

95
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,036

My father wanted to marry
the most beautiful girl in the country.

105
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,853
He has requested,

106
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,056
when he married my mother
for 10 cows!

107
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,226
Well okay, where

108
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,394
There is a loose-down barn.

109
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:23,038
- But there's no white cock ...
- Forget it.

110
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:03,375
Bastards! You will
slaughtered die!

111
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,263

112
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,303
We need a white cock
to be together ...

113
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,238
The white cocks
do not exist.

114
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:40,299
Your father lied.

115
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:44,309
All those whom I asked â
told me.

116
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:46,976
The white cocks exist
in your village.

117
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:52,853
And you refuse my hugs
for a white cock that does not exist.

118
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:58,086
So I'm going.

119

01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:56,056
I'll teach you
â raise goats.

193
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,148
Where is my gun?

194
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,345
Give me my weapon
or I'll kill you.

195
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:58,784
My weapon is my child,
This is my father.

You want to force me
â confess.

200
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:15,331
You eat people at night.

â God and ask for forgiveness ...

215
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:17,762
so that the spirit of Komona
returned to you.
