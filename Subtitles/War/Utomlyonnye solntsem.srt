you needed a scapegoat.

159

Really...

161
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,657

Really?

165
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,747
Yes, the political police
is here, the NKVD.

166
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,290
And he's shouting.

167
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,376
He's crying.

168
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,711
Ah, he's crying...

169
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,170
Only you can help.

170
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,798

Ah, well. Where are they?

171
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,258

172
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,593

173
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,679
After you.

174
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,973

178
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,066

179
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,984
Boy.

180
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,821

181
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,323

182
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,202

183
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,662

184
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,960
I never get any peace.

185
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,130

What are you doing?

188
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,187
That's the people's wheat!
I'll drag you into the courts!

189
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,730
What are you doing?

190
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,858
They sowed this wheat! Hey!

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,445
- Turn back!
- It's not me!

192
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,197
- What?
- I've got orders.

193
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,114
What orders?

194
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,283
From my commander.

195
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,828
I've got you, pretty boy!

196
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,042
Don't tell me
a nag scares you shitless!

197
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,840
You've lost your mind, moron!

198
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,009
Get lost, or I'll slaughter you!

199
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,179
I'll wipe my ass with you,
Comrade Lieutenant!

200
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,222
What?

201
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,431
Attention!

202
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,017
- I'll show you!
- Show me what?

203
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
Don't you know me?

204
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,313
Don't you recognize me?

205
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,234
Like this?
Well?

206
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,111
You remember now?

207
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,822
Comrade Kotov!

208
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,740
Pull yourself together!

209
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,075
Who's in charge?

210
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,284
- Me...
- Who?

211
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,619
Brigadier Commander Lapine.

212
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,747
Lapine, that swine!
Right. Where's the radio?

213
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,040
What radio?

214
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,917
The field radio!

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,505
The planes! Colonel!

216
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,006
Wsitch on the radio!

217
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,968
The planes! Comrade Kotov!

218
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,054
They're up there.
They don't ruin the fields.

219
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,478
They're so beautiful!

220
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:28,826
Comrade Kotov!

221
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,209
<i>Why aren't you advancing?</i>

222
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,795
I'll tell you
why we're not advancing.

223
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,171
<i>What? Who is this?</i>

224
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,756
This is who!

225
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,591
<i>What?</i>

226
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,468
Sergei Kotov.
Hi, Misha.

227
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,344
<i>Kotov?</i>

228
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,262
Exactly.

229
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,638
<i>It's you, Sir?</i>

230
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,514
Exactly.

231
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,143
I'm picking strawberries,
pretty boy.

232
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,519
<i>What?</i>

233
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,981
Misha, maybe you want to
take prisoners?

234
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,317
Or drop some bombs?

235
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,277
The lieutenant agrees with me.

236
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>Sir!</i>

237
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,700
You know what, Misha?

238
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,327
Do you remember, me?

239
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>Very well, Sir.</i>

240
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,080
Really?

241
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>Really, Sir.</i>

242
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,960
Listen, tell your tanks
to turn back...

243
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,713
...and find something else.
Is that clear?

244
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,256
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

245
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,382
Repeat it.

246
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,676
<i>At your orders, Sir.</i>

247
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,472
Good.

248
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,433
What's your name?

249
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,146
Your name. What is it?

250
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,357
Misha.

251
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,816
No. Sorry. Kolya.

252
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,901
Kolya.

253
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,696
I was a little harsh on you.

254
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
Will you forgive me?

255
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,162
Why the stupid smile, Kolya?

256
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,001
Grow your ears a little,
if you want to see the road.

257
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,339
Understand?

258
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,549
I knew him right away.

259
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,802
About face!

260
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,144
Why didn't you
go back to the house?

261
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,021
You were so coarse!

262
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,189
Who was?

263
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,899
My God!

264
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,442
Me?

265
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,571
What are you saying?
When?

266
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,282
Nadya, was I coarse?

267
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,618
I didn't hear anything.

268
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,914
What are you saying?
Come here.

269
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,733
One day,
just one day a week...

270
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,111
...to be with my family.
Who told you to disturb me?

271
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,071
Who gave you permission?

272
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,364
What have I done?

273
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,285
He was all wound up, shouting:
''The wheat! The fields!''

274
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,953
''The kolkhoz!''

275
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,291
Why me, Olga Nikolayevna?

276
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,585
I'm not a miller.

277
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,128
It's amazing.

278
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,547
Orders have to be carried out,
my dear.

279
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,216
I'll look for fleas on them.

280
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,552
In fact...

281
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,346
...they can look for them on me.

282
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,057
They'd be right to.

283
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,143
Sergei, we've never had fleas
in this house.

284
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,395
What?

285
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,779
What a family!

286
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,031
Your uncle has
a screw loose, too.

287
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't know why they have to
wash in that wooden hut...

288
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,291
...when we have
a beautiful barthroom.

289
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,460
I know, I know, I know.

290
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,506
Kutuzov and Pushkin
used to wash in one, too.

291
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,424
I know all that.

292
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,009
But that child...

293
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,261
...that little child...

294
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,181
...has no reason
to be in there.

295
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,974
Vsevolod!

296
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
Why don't you
ever say anything?

297
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,355
You're like Switzerland!

298
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,316
Well-fed and apathetic.

299
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,111
I, on the contrary,
am starving and impassioned.

300
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,445
Like a gypsy.

301
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,199
Vsevolod Konstantinovich,
your legs are in my way.

302
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,580
Our colonel is right.

303
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,125
This place is a madhouse.

304
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,378
You've had your finger
in the jam again.

305
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,047
It'll ferment, and
the guests won't have...

306
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,424
All right, all right.

307
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,058
''Burnt by the sun''

308
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,812
''As the crimson sea did run''

309
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,316
''I heard you say, my dove''

310
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,069
''That there would be no love.''

311
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,445
Masha, Gosha, hello!

312
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,990
Hell! Hands off!

313
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,160
Grannies...

314
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,620
...what are you doing?

315
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,751
Good Lord, why are you...?

316
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,003
But why?

317
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,921
You know why.

318
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,133
Boris brought this medicine
back from abroad before 1917.

319
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,467
Why throw it away?

320
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,429
Because it can't continue.

321
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,346
Look!

322
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,433
And all these herbs, too!

323
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,813
You know she's obsessed
with medicine.

324
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,441
When the doctor prescribed
iron for her...

325
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,277
...she boiled some nails
and drank the water.

326
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,114
She could have
poisoned herself.

327
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,299
Miss.

328
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,385
Miss!

329
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,888
Is this Zagorianka?

330
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,309
Where?
What's Zagorianka?

331
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,644
Or, maybe...

332
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,229
...Zagorienka?

333
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,813
Oh, my God!

334
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,068
Young man!

335
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,988
Excuse me,
is this the SHAM?

336
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,241
You bet! A real sham!

337
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,161
What sham?

338
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,415
The State Home
for Artists and Musicians.

339
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,668
SHAM, for short.

340
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,925
Elena!

341
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,678
Will you be much longer?

342
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,054
Yes.

343
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,933
Nadya, get out of my armchair.

344
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,184
She's coming...

345
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,520
It's because of my eye.

346
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,691
''Confession is
the source of justice.''

347
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,025
Who brought this?

348
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,110
The pioneers.

349
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,070
- For whom?
- For Comrade Kotov.

350
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,530
For breakfast.

351
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,867
Listen... ''Confession
is the source of justice.''

352
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,536
That took some finding!

353
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,706
Vsevolod! Your comments
will be the end of you!

354
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:42,634
Even a tiger is afraid
of a furious virgin.

355
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,594
She sucks nails.

356
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,222
One day we'll find her
poisoned to death.

357
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,057
Hello, everyone!

358
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,769
Happy holiday, gentlemen...
sorry... comrades!

359
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,604
Where's Mokhova?

360
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,480
Leave her.

361
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,108
Here are some biscuits.
My pleasure.

362
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,738
We're celebrating the construction
of balloons for... ?

363
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,822
Stalin!

364
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,073
Exactly.

365
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,783
What's wrong, Kirik?

366
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,287
It's the dance of the bird
arriving by balloon, my love.

367
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,166
My love from above, my dove.

368
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,753
Our language is so rich.
Isn't it, Sergei Petrovich?

369
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,129
Sorry.

370
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,089
Happy holiday.

371
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:22,646
Oh!...

372
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,925
''Oh,'' what?

373
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,677
Mother, he's teasing me!

374
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,639
You're wrong,
Sergei Petrovich.

375
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,601
Kirik never touches
a drop of alcohol.

376
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,436
Not one drop...

377
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,774
In any case,
today's a celebration.

378
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,776
And it's hot.

379
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,872
I remember...

380
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,335
...Prince Dimitri Pavlovich
giving him a drink...

381
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,712
...when he was little.

382
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,297
Oh, yes!

383
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,676
''Drink for drink's sake
means trouble.''

384
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,470
Early each morning...

385
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,971
Vsevolod Konstantinovich...

386
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,641
...you remind me of
Petya Trofimov in Checkhov...

387
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:13,975
Petya...

388
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,310
''The Cherry Orchard''!

389
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,478
...the eternal student.

390
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,856
You're at the university and
your friends are at the Academy!

391
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,317
No. They're not my friends.

392
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,863
My friends, as Pushkin said,
''are no more, or are far away.''

393
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,991
Did you return the money?

394
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,159
What money?

395
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,245
To the soda water, saleswoman.

396
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,500
- Why the coat?
- I'm trying it on.

397
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,419
A coat in this heat!

398
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,170
Interesting...

399
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll pay her tomorrow.
I promise.

400
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,263
''Burnt by the sun''

401
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,390
''As the crimson sea did run...''

402
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,351
Kirik, after
your morning port...

403
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,437
...do you still drink tea?

404
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,689
You know, Sergei Petrovich...

405
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,525
...you shouldn't
consider drinking a vice...

406
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,862
- How would you say? -

407
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,699
...a vice of the will,
but rather the elan...

408
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,033
...of a tormented soul.

409
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,868
Exactly.

410
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,369
My love...

411
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,050
''GLORY TO THE BUILDERS
OF STALIN'S BALLOONS!''

412
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,726
My name is Lyuba Grucheva.

413
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,812
You should have told us
you were coming here.

414
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,774
I'd have driven you
on my ''cycle''.

415
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,610
It's romantic.

416
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,906
Especially a lady's ''cycle''.

417
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,282
Without a bar.

418
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,408
Well?

419
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,746
I don't know. I've never tried
without a bar.

420
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,582
Here he is.

421
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,627
How about a swim?

422
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,420
Exactly.

423
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,422
Coming for a swim?

424
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,633
Of course.

425
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,469
Kirik, you can be so untidy!

426
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,766
Such severity!

427
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,269
That's Comrade Kotov!

428
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,480
We've got his portrait
at the university.

429
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,691
On horseback?

430
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,526
No.

431
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,110
On foot.

432
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,780
Have you got my portrait?

433
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,949
Who are you?

434
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,784
Me?

435
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,123
I am who I am.

436
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,840
You're a tease.

437
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,801
I'll explain it to you.

438
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,055
Oh, God! Oh, God!

439
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,141
What have they done?

440
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,311
Yes, Mokhova.

441
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,313
No more medicine.

442
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,650
Boris Konstantinovich used to
bring them back from France.

443
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,152
Don't cry, Mokhova.

444
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,862
I'll tell Daddy...

445
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,533
...to bring you some more.

446
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,328
Oh, a pioneer regiment!

447
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,414
Pioneers don't cry.

448
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,207
They're soaked.

449
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,084
Nadya...

450
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,588
The pioneers are here.

451
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,218
Is there a celebration today?
You don't know what for?

452
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,764
You know, I don't understand
their celebrations.

453
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,017
All I know...

454
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,437
...is that it's an important
Soviet celebration.

455
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,608
I'll lie down for a while.

456
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,610
My head...

457
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,237
...is spinning.

458
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,531
I'll lie down.

459
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,075
It's Nadya.

460
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,246
She's the one who knows all
the celebrations.

461
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,583
Good.

462
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,818
Oh, God!

463
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,655
What's that I smell?

464
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,536
Could it be little Nadya
who's going to be a pioneer...

465
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,788
...and the head of the class?

466
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,623
How do you know?

467
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,958
Well...

468
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,503
...why wouldn't I know
the most brilliant...

469
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,630
...of them all?

470
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,966
Are you the summer Santa?

471
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,510
Yes, Nadya.

472
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,556
I'm the wizard from Maghreb.

473
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,057
What's the Maghreb?

474
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,977
The Maghreb...

475
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,647
...is the land
where summer Santas live.

476
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,732
In the USSR?

477
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,318
Of course.

478
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,740
All the summer Santas
live in the USSR.

479
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,992
- And the winter ones?
- They, too.

480
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,369
Are you a doctor?

481
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,163
Probably.

482
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,332
We need one for Mokhova.

483
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,667
She's still alive?

484
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,418
Yes.

485
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,337
My great-grandmother
and Elena...

486
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,214
...drowned her medicine.

487
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,841
They're still alive, too?

488
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,551
And how!

489
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,850
Mokhova!

490
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,228
This is Mokhova.

491
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,939
Away, white virgin!

492
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,733
Who invited you in?

493
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,447
''Lather makes
Marussya's skin soft.''

494
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,035
As if we didn't have
enough lunatics here!

495
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,745
What do you want?

496
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,122
Silence, you polygamist!

497
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,208
What do you mean by that?

498
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,923
Happy holiday,
noble ancestors!

499
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,091
But I'm not even
a grandmother!

500
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,092
Nadya!

501
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,887
Someone!
Who invited him in?

502
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,225
Stop stamping your feet!

503
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,062
You're here too,
you lover of sweet wines...

504
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,898
...and immodest young women!

505
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,115
Splash!

506
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,331
34-15, extension 19.

507
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,916
What's that?

508
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,127
That's my old office number.

509
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
Hello!

510
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,702
Mitya!

511
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,621
I just recognized you!

512
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,123
Mitya!

513
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,624
My God!

514
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,628
When Marussya was a baby,
Boris used to say to me...

515
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,506
...''Lather makes
Marussya's skin soft.''

516
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,717
What a joker!

517
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,222
Dimitri, I must say...

518
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,390
Vsevolod Konstantinovich!

519
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,686
Hello.

520
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,063
Mitya! You're back at last!

521
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,738
This is...

522
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,698
...Sergei, my husband.

523
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,367
This is the famous Mitya...

524
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,745
...of whom my father
was so fond.

525
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
And his best student.

526
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,372
Kotov.

527
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,332
Delighted.

528
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,833
Same here.

529
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,376
In fact, we've already met.

530
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,587
Of course, I remember.

531
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,172
You've met?

532
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,342
It was a long time ago,
for a short while.

533
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,676
And this?

534
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,054
This is our doughter, Nadya.

535
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,348
Nadya, call me Uncle Mitya.

536
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,016
Uncle Mitya.

537
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,894
Close your mouth.

538
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,437
Mokhova...

539
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,356
Dimitri Andreyevich!

540
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,859
My immaculate...
Immaculate, right?

541
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,403
Mokhova...

542
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,198
...why don't you dust
properly?

543
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,867
I don't dust properly?

544
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,371
Wait...

545
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,207
Wait a minute...
On New Year's Eve in 1928...

546
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,044
...just before I left,
we had hidden all the gifts.

547
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,421
I hid a candy here.

548
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,219
It's not there now!

549
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,142
Look, it's here...

550
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,150
It's a celebration
for everyone except me.

551
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,580
Give me a glass of water.
I'm dying of thirst.

552
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,582
Is Philippe with you?

553
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,127
Yes. I'll clean up
and tell you everything.

554
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,795
This damn beard...

555
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,463
He must have aged?

556
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,758
In fact,
I never knew him young.

557
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,010
Mitya!

558
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,512
Are you married?

559
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,805
Yes.

560
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,849
Have you got children?

561
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,600
- Yes.
- How many?

562
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,310
Three.

563
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,937
Bravo!

564
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,773
Do you still play the piano?

565
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,691
No.

566
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,817
Do you still play?

567
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,986
Dimitri...

568
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,530
...I must ask you...

569
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,199
...over all these years,
you...

570
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,994
Yes?

571
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,455
Nothing. Later.

572
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,714
Uncle Mitya!

573
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,510
Do you want tea with jam
of coffee with milk?

574
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,220
Coffee with jam.

575
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,805
Fancy that!

576
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,806
Grandmother!

577
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,974
Yes, dear?

578
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,353
Uncle Mitya wants
coffee with jam.

579
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,480
No!

580
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,692
How old are you?

581
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:30,860
Six.

582
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,488
Olga Nikolayevna!

583
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,532
One day, when Marussya was six
and I was sixteen...

584
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,409
...the Bolshoi
was performing ''Lakmé''.

585
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,870
Boris Konstantinovich
was conducting.

586
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,206
Mitya, I'm a bit short now...

587
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,374
...but tonight for sure...

588
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,667
Here we go.

589
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,710
Tonight...

590
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,673
I was giving him a towel.

591
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,175
During the overture...

592
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,594
...she said to me,
''I want to pee.''

593
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,054
Thank you, Mitya.

594
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,266
I said, ''It's only just
started.'' She said, ''A pee.''

595
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,894
I told her,
''Wait, I didn't bring a pot.''

596
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,604
She said, ''I want to pee!''

597
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,774
People started shushing us.

598
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,859
So we went out.

599
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,903
She said,
''I don't want to go alone.''

600
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,533
The men's room made no sense,
and I couldn't go to the ladies' room.

601
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,452
I ended up taking her
to the men's room.

602
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,539
Rachmaninoff
was just coming out.

603
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,251
He asked me, ''Who's the father
of this lovely child?''

604
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,045
I replied...

605
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,550
''Boris Konstantinovich.''
He said, ''What a lovely boy!''

606
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,304
''Tell his father
to buy him some trousers!''

607
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,183
Coffee or tea?

608
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,061
I wanted water.
No, nothing, thank you.

609
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,479
Mitya, coffee or tea?

610
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,607
No, really, thank you.
Enjoy your meal.

611
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,651
That's Daddy's chair.

612
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,112
Nadya! Shame on you!
He's a guest.

613
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,573
You never let Kirik sit there.

614
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,658
Kirik should...

615
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,993
Because Kirik...

616
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,498
Dimitri...

617
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,332
Yes?

618
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,711
No, Olga. Don't worry.

619
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,046
In yesterday's ''Pravda''...

620
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,548
Vsevolod...

621
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,457
Marussya,
do you want something?

622
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,209
Me? No.

623
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,628
What's that, then?

624
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,546
This?

625
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,381
It's a glass.

626
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,229
Well?

627
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,398
Shall we go for a swim?

628
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,566
Mitya!

629
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,568
I'd love to.

630
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,528
- Where's your bathing suit?
- Over there.

631
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,489
Kirik, we're going for a swim!

632
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,998
Everything is
as it used to be.

633
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,835
You haven't changed at all...

634
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,172
...except for your hair.

635
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,802
None of you
have changed, either.

636
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,514
We're too old
to change now.

637
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>Today at five P.M....</i>

638
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,716
<i>...in the Storming-of-the-Bastille Park...</i>

639
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,635
<i>...there will be a</i>
<i>performance...</i>

640
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,639
<i>...of Communist composer,</i>
<i>Minayev's works...</i>

641
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:33,394
<i>...in honor of the sixth</i>
<i>anniversary of the celebrations...</i>

642
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:38,816
<i>...of the construction of Stalin's</i>
<i>balloons and airships.</i>

643
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,152
<i>Admission is free.</i>

644
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,488
<i>Happy holiday, dear comrades!</i>

645
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,538
Hurry up, or the pioneers
will get our spot.

646
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,018
Stand up! Attention!

647
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,229
At ease, fellows.
Happy holiday to you all!

648
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,524
Here, Nadya.

649
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,486
Mokhova, put that doll away!

650
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm not that little any more.

651
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,199
What else can I give you?

652
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,327
You're still young enough
for it. Stop acting up.

653
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,204
''Not that little''... Hah!

654
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,553
I really want to join
the pioneers!

655
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,971
Why?

656
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,809
To get up
at the bugle's call...

657
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,228
...swim at the whistle's blast...

658
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,606
...and get buried to music.
Who said that?

659
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,108
Why?

660
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,736
What?

661
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,115
To get up
at the bugle's call...

662
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,450
...swim...

663
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,745
...at the whistle's blast...

664
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,791
To march...

665
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,252
...to the drum's beat...

666
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,337
...eat in time...

667
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,090
And if you do all that,
you'll get buried...

668
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,760
...to music.

669
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,262
Why?

670
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,041
Marussya,
I'm going to the jetty.

671
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,919
Uncle Mitya...

672
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,881
...why do you say that?

673
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:07,673
What?

674
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,799
Don't pester him.

675
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,885
I'm pestering him?

676
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,553
Yes.

677
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,972
That's a good one!

678
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,476
Then, stay here.
I'm leaving.

679
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,313
Here, have fun.

680
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,694
Nadya!

681
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,279
What?

682
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,990
Nothing... nothing.

683
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,998
<i>Please return the poodle</i>
<i>named Philimon...</i>

684
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,376
<i>...to the janitor</i>
<i>of dacha number 17...</i>

685
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,421
<i>...the home of</i>
<i>Professor Kaluta.</i>

686
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,840
<i>Happy Holiday, dear comrades!</i>

687
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,384
Why are you sulking?

688
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,013
What's wrong?

689
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,224
Mother told me off.

690
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,434
Mother told you off?

691
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,104
Mother told us off.

692
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,566
What a wicked mother.

693
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
You were pestering them...

694
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,613
...with questions.

695
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,664
They want to talk.
They're old friends.

696
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,167
They lost touch
for a long time.

697
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,212
And little poppet
starts pestering them.

698
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,425
Come on, let's take the boat
along the river.

699
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,390
Sergei!

700
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,977
I don't like that!
She can swim right here!

701
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,895
Marussya!

702
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,400
Just let us go. O.K.?

703
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,235
Leave us alone.

704
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,572
Lie there and sun yourself.

705
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,124
Wide, muscular shoulders.

706
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,085
Really, I understand.

707
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,675
A dazzling smile, his portrait
hanging everywhere.

708
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,345
And all that will collapse.

709
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,432
With one small flick.

710
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,756
''You ran off
to travel the world''

711
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,719
''And I followed,
true to my word...''

712
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,641
''Chuki-chuki-chuki...''

713
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,153
Marussya!

714
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,494
Why aren't you asking me
any questions?

715
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,748
Why don't you say anything?

716
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,083
I'm reading.

717
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,003
But why?

718
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,923
I don't want to know any more.

719
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,510
What do you mean,
''any more''?

720
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,637
Any more than I already know.

721
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,348
Well, well...

722
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,059
And what do you know?

723
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,691
What's that?

724
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,860
When did you do that?

725
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,572
- Back then.
- And?

726
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,411
They saved me. I didn't know
you had to do it in water.

727
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,747
To keep the blood
from coagulating.

728
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,293
Marussya!

729
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,587
Marussya! Mitya!

730
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,756
The CIDER!

731
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,383
The CIDER!

732
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,217
Hush!

733
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,471
The Civilian Defense Regiment!

734
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,058
They'll try to train us...

735
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
...for gas attacks.

736
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,896
Leave, quickly!

737
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,149
Or they'll take you away!

738
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,406
- They're far away.
- They're starting again!

739
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,661
They'll put those pipes on us!

740
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,289
Olga Nikolayevna. I'm scared!

741
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,876
Then the masks,
and they'll pinch our breasts.

742
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:54,835
I'm going.

743
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,295
We've still got time.

744
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,006
The raskers will find us!

745
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,592
Not raskers... <i>rescuers!</i>

746
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,763
They pinch my breasts
and knees.

747
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,891
Any other woman
would be delighted!

748
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,521
What pretty feet!

749
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,983
So round, so soft,
so beautiful.

750
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,154
As for mine, look.

751
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,448
See? Like shoe leather.

752
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,452
As hard and rough as rocks.

753
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,954
Is it because
you've run a lot?

754
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,082
Yes. Run and walked.

755
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,251
Where were you running to?

756
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,587
Sometimes away from them...

757
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,464
...sometimes toward them.

758
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,800
Your feet will always
be like that.

759
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,510
Why?

760
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,140
They'll always be
this round...

761
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,687
...because there will be
many airplanes, cars...

762
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,733
...trolley cars, buses
and underground trains.

763
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,821
And roads will be
nice and flat...

764
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,907
...shoes will be
comfortable...

765
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,909
...and socks will be soft...

766
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,160
Why?

767
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,329
''Why?''

768
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,919
Because we're building up
Soviet power for that...

769
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,840
...so that, all their lives,
people will have feet...

770
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,675
...like yours.

771
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,595
To run
without having to flee.

772
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,015
Follow your path.
Follow it well...

773
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,685
...and, above all,
work hard.

774
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,521
Respect your parents...

775
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,444
...and cherish
your Soviet Motherland.

776
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,252
You're so hot!

777
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,298
Tell me...

778
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,384
You're not ill, are you?

779
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,927
You're sure?

780
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:09,720
Yes.

781
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,144
You've no idea
how good I feel with you.

782
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,813
Is that true?

783
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:22,011
Me, too.

784
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,153
With you, everything is
calm...

785
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,449
...everything is easy.

786
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,914
I adore you.

787
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,836
Can we drift like this
for all our lives?

788
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,341
Yes, but with Mother.

789
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:51,136
Of course.
We won't leave without her.

790
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,293
I'm going for a swim.

791
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,806
Comrade... comrade!

792
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,641
What time is it?

793
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,352
What's wrong?

794
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,650
Help a poor invalid stand up.

795
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,527
Of course.

796
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,153
Half past one.

797
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,321
Thank you.

798
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,135
He dove in fully dressed!

799
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,014
A man dove in fully dressed!

800
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,685
The idiot!

801
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,731
All right.

802
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:45,876
Mitya!

803
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,012
Mitya!

804
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,073
Mitya!!!

805
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,769
- Were you scared?
- You fool!

806
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,940
- Were you scared?
- You fool!

807
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:50,774
Let go of me!

808
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,235
Your wife should be
scared for you.

809
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,744
Do you remember this place?

810
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,334
One month after
Boris Konstantinovich died...

811
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,254
...you caught your mother
with Kirik.

812
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,673
A terrible business!

813
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,176
Deeply affected,
you fled the house...

814
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,638
...and I found you here.

815
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,851
Right here.

816
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,021
It was cold...

817
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,983
...it was raining.

818
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,945
I told you to go back...

819
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,864
...but you didn't want to.

820
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,159
So I stayed, too.

821
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,704
Don't you remember?

822
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:51,585
''Ere yet the salt
of most unrighteous tears''

823
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,045
''Had left the flushing...''

824
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,340
Not even that?

825
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,054
And we spent the night
in the boatman's barn.

826
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,433
Our first night.

827
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,356
And afterward?

828
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,944
I had a volume of Shakespeare
with me, ''Hamlet''.

829
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,238
I read.

830
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,116
She cried.

831
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,368
You cried.

832
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,539
''Ere yet the salt
of most unrighteous tears''

833
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,710
''Had left the flushing
eyes...''

834
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,131
Do you know
what I remember most?

835
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,718
The mark of the elastic...

836
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,596
...on your belly.

837
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,393
It was as pink
as a baby's.

838
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,896
Why are you
telling me all this?

839
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,653
I don't know.

840
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,906
Marussya...

841
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,409
...I simply believed...

842
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,246
...that if that life
no longer existed for me...

843
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,916
...it no longer existed
for anyone else.

844
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,420
And that
everyone had vanished.

845
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,299
But here you all are.

846
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,011
And nothing has changed
for you.

847
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,349
It's just that I'm not here.
You've obliterated me...

848
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,269
...with an eraser.

849
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,688
Deleted.

850
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,333
<i>Gas warning!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

851
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,711
<i>We're under attack!</i>

852
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,091
<i>The DEF. AVIA. CHIM</i>
<i>and the SHAM CIDER...</i>

853
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,843
<i>...against the</i>
<i>imperialist foe...</i>

854
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,519
<i>Happy holiday, dear comrades!</i>

855
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,442
Civilian defense...

856
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,153
...is a vital cause
for the State.

857
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,155
- Put this on.
- What time is it?

858
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,656
Put on the gas mask.

859
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,492
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
miss my train.

860
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,378
It's the duty
of every Soviet citizen...

861
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,005
...to help Civilian Defense...

862
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,383
...in fighting the hydra
of world imperialism.

863
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,890
I've got your parasol.

864
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,520
Don't let a patriot down!

865
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,704
Comrade!

866
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,500
Don't you need some
casualties?

867
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,250
Yes.

868
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,252
I'm seriously wounded.

869
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,254
Seriously?
The stretcher!

870
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,130
Gas mask!

871
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,256
Yes, Sir!

872
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,051
Lie down.

873
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,052
Yes, Sir!

874
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,512
Forward march!

875
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,767
Just a second!

876
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:40,063
You, the comrade
with the trunk!

877
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,940
What about me?

878
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:42,774
What?

879
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:43,858
I'm dead.

880
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,902
- We leave the dead.
- What?

881
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,031
A stretcher! A mask!

882
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,574
I'm wounded now.

883
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,578
I hurt all over.

884
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,581
Forward march!

885
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,711
Let go of me!
What are you doing?

886
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,758
What's your name?

887
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,107
How about that...

888
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,776
Where are they?

889
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,947
I've no idea.

890
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,955
Look at that!
They left their shoes...

891
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,959
...and the ball,
and the book, too.

892
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,670
And they left without us.

893
00:57:48,438 --> 00:57:49,727
Yes...

894
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,894
- Daddy?
- What, dear?

895
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,229
Where are you
running like that?

896
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,064
Nadya!

897
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,360
I'm not running.
I'm walking calmly.

898
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,487
But, Daddy...

899
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,989
I'll carry you.

900
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,532
Come on.

901
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,201
There, like that.

902
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,702
Let's go.

903
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,831
We'll try to see
where they could be.

904
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,666
If I was the one who...

905
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,002
...left books at the beach...

906
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,129
...think how Mother
would react!

907
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,714
Daddy, you're hurting me.

908
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:33,801
Where, huh? Where?
You have such a temper, Nadya!

909
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,513
Your mother's right.
You have a real temper!

910
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,684
Daddy, you're
squashing my tummy!

911
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,187
Daddy, look!

912
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,024
Uncle Mitya's pants and shirt
are hanging there.

913
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,778
Yes, you see,
he put them there to dry.

914
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,613
Here, hang it up.

915
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:54,531
How?

916
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,032
Throw it.

917
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,867
Aim well,
you can do it.

918
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,869
How do you expect me
to do it?

919
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,400
That's good...

920
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,735
...that will do.

921
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,826
That will do. Stop.

922
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,287
Stop... I'm scared...

923
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
Stop...

924
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,605
I remember
that Boris had decided..

925
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,983
...to give work to Mitya,
who was then a poor student.

926
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,486
He was supposed to make
Marussya work on her music.

927
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:19,282
When I was in the room with
them, they were serious.

928
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,952
legato... syncopated pedal...

929
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,455
Appoggiatura...

930
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,417
But one day,
I'd only just left the room...

931
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,670
... when I suddenly heard...
- what was it, Mitya? -

932
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,716
A can-can!

933
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:41,220
Mother come into the room.
I was Nadya's age...

934
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,764
I thought I was going to
faint!

935
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,474
...and I was doing this!

936
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,644
And with great style, too!

937
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,816
They're dancing!

938
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,070
When you've got to go...

939
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,497
Sergei Petrovich!

940
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,668
Why are you eating alone?
Why not wait for the others?

941
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,256
I wanted to call them...

942
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,468
...but I don't speak French.

943
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,011
Not yet.

944
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,766
Hand me a napkin.

945
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,776
And you, Mokhova...

946
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,070
...do you speak French?

947
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,865
So, you, too...

948
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,450
...you can go...

949
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,960
Do you need help?

950
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,019
Lunch?

951
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,855
Let's all have lunch!

952
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,607
Where's Sergei Petrovich?

953
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,526
Sergei Petrovich...

954
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:42,985
...is already seated.

955
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,487
Come on, let's eat.

956
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,668
They must be dry by now.
I'll bring in your things.

957
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,627
My clothes are cold
and it's drafty here.

958
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,755
I'll be damned!

959
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,474
Hey, guys!

960
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,310
I have an adress here
that has faded.

961
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,941
Help me. What is it?
Zagorianka or Zagorienka?

962
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,610
I've been going around
in circles all day.

963
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,612
Where are you from?
There's no such place.

964
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,614
My wife washed my shirt...

965
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,283
Get out of here,
and hurry up!

966
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,996
Get out of here!

967
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,356
But...

968
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,458
The address has faded...

969
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,730
Thank you.

970
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,399
That's wonderful.

971
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,861
It's like in Boris' day.

972
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,739
Lord...

973
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:19,368
...I can still see Elena
singing that on stage.

974
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,538
Ah, what a time that was!

975
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,916
Things aren't so bad
nowadays, either...

976
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,712
...but it's the aroma...

977
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,052
...the taste of life
that has vanished.

978
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,971
For good.

979
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,649
Why are you arguing...

980
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,151
...dear comrades?

981
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:57,907
Nadya!

982
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,496
Do you know what you'd be
called in France?

983
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,705
No.

984
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,748
''Nadine.''

985
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,708
No. ''Nadya.''

986
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,337
Well, ''Nadya''...

987
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,923
...come over here.

988
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,011
I'm going to tell you a story.

989
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,061
There...

990
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:33,275
Once upon a time,
in the land of Sursia...

991
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,071
...there was a boy...

992
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,032
...called Yatim.

993
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:46,872
He sang beautifully...

994
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:51,085
...played different
instruments and loved poetry.

995
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,881
His parents were friends
with a kind magician...

996
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,591
...whose name...

997
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,386
...was Sirob.

998
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,638
Did he wear a turban?

999
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,347
No.

1000
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,435
And kind Sirob
liked little Yatim very much.

1001
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:11,272
He took him into his house
to raise him.

1002
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,567
He started to teach him
magical music.

1003
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,487
They loved each other
like a father loves his son...

1004
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,573
...and a son loves his father.

1005
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,075
There, Nadine,
the whole story.

1006
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,329
Sirob had a daughter.

1007
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,914
Yes!

1008
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,293
He called her...

1009
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,171
Yassuram.

1010
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,631
Funny name!

1011
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,261
Sirob had a big house,
a very bright place...

1012
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,473
...a very merry and, of
course, very happy home.

1013
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,268
Like ours.

1014
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,478
Like yours.

1015
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:55,316
But one day,
it all came to an end.

1016
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,946
No more coffee
drunk from cups like these.

1017
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:05,492
No more charades
and afternoon croquet...

1018
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,787
...no more reading,
disturbed only by a cricket...

1019
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,957
No more arguments,
laughter and all the rest.

1020
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,961
It all ended because...

1021
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,339
...war came to the land.

1022
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:21,050
War against whom?
The nobbles?

1023
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,678
That doesn't matter, Nadine.

1024
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,348
What does matter...

1025
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,976
...is that Yatim
left for the front...

1026
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:36,565
...and that all the time,
in the frenches, in the hospital...

1027
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,525
...in the lands he crossed...

1028
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,653
...every day...

1029
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,697
...and I mean every day,
Nadine...

1030
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:48,702
...he would think of the big
house, the garden...

1031
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,498
...those faces,
and even the old cricket...

1032
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:56,418
...that everyone moaned about.

1033
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,880
We've got a cricket, too.
He's over there.

1034
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,924
That's not the same one.

1035
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,885
This one sings happy songs...

1036
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,013
...the other one
sang sad songs.

1037
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:11,600
You want some vodka, Nadya?

1038
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:12,768
You're crazy!

1039
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:13,936
Come on!

1040
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,524
Yes! And so,
for ten years he roamed...

1041
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,567
Good health!

1042
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,279
...he roamed far and wide.

1043
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,782
He tried all trades...
taxi driver...

1044
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,119
...bar pianist...

1045
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,413
...street singer...

1046
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,957
...cabaret dancer...

1047
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,043
He even sewed slippers.

1048
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,256
Thank you.

1049
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,133
And all the time...

1050
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,927
...he was fretting...

1051
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,888
...as he thought
of that house...

1052
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,725
I mean the house
where he had lived.

1053
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,895
Then he came back
ten years later.

1054
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,985
His parents had died
during the war...

1055
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,487
...against the nobbles.

1056
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,449
He had nowhere to go...

1057
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:12,328
...and, from the station, he went
straight to his master's home.

1058
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,582
It was winter...

1059
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,960
...and, apart from the snow,
he recognized nothing...

1060
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,629
...of his land.
It had changed so much.

1061
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,301
Only the house was there,
like before.

1062
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:32,348
He trembled...

1063
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,641
...as he rang...

1064
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,144
...the doorbell.

1065
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,942
A young girl came to the door.

1066
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,112
Yatim had never seen anyone...

1067
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,950
...so beautiful.

1068
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,120
Even though
he had traveled a lot.

1069
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,040
''Who are you?''
Yatim asked in surprise.

1070
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:00,834
''Yassuram'',
answered the beauty.

1071
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:05,172
''Good Lord, are you
the same Yassuram who peed...''

1072
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,674
''...in her panties
and fell asleep...''

1073
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:11,720
''...on her father's knees when
he was teaching me music?''

1074
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,348
''Yes, I am she. Come in.''

1075
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,809
''We've been waiting for you
for a long time...''

1076
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,479
''...even though our father
is very ill.''

1077
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,651
Yatim stood there,
astounded...

1078
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,237
...looking at the beautiful
Yassuram...

1079
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,740
...and unable to say a word.

1080
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,909
I know how it ends!

1081
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,411
Tell us.

1082
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,580
They got married... and...

1083
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,166
Well... no.

1084
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,002
They didn't get married.

1085
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,170
Why not?

1086
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:48,048
Because they didn't have time.

1087
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:52,761
One day, a very important and
distinguished man sent for Yatim.

1088
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,263
Who was it?

1089
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,432
Mr. Bogeyman?

1090
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,726
No. He wasn't
quite that important.

1091
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:00,853
An ogre?

1092
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:04,022
Not him either. I've forgotten
his name, Nadya.

1093
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,694
He summoned him
to the Big House and said...

1094
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,780
''Comrade, my gentle Yatim!''

1095
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,534
''Go to some place,
I don't know where...''

1096
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,203
''...and do this there...''

1097
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,039
I don't know what!

1098
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,750
Exactly.
And Yatim said...

1099
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,712
''Why,
most distinguished Sir...''

1100
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,923
''...I mean, comrade. I've
already traveled so much...''

1101
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,468
''...fought so hard...''

1102
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,597
''...that I want to live in
peace with my folks.''

1103
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,390
And he said...

1104
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,893
''Those ideas, my dear
Yatim,...''

1105
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,103
''...are middle-class...''

1106
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:44,897
''What does that mean?''

1107
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,901
''It means bad,
bad ideas, Yatim.''

1108
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,279
''You weren't allowed
to return to your home...''

1109
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,283
''...to turn it
into a middle-class nest.''

1110
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,454
''Pack your bags...''

1111
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:03,499
''...and write it down for me.''

1112
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,919
''I'll give you a week
to think about it, or else...''

1113
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,921
Beheaded!

1114
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,131
Exactly.

1115
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,804
So Yatim went home...

1116
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,599
...very saddened.

1117
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,686
He walked in circles.
He was down in the dumps.

1118
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,522
He thought a lot...

1119
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,275
...packed up his bags
and left.

1120
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,694
Without a word to anyone.

1121
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,029
Why?

1122
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:38,283
Because he had
nothing to say, Nadine.

1123
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,287
He had seen too much blood
and misfortune...

1124
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,123
...and he didn't want...

1125
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,627
...to bring them
to the house he loved so much.

1126
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,339
And also, Nadine...

1127
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,635
...because he was only 27...

1128
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,222
- the age your mother is now -

1129
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,187
...he really wanted to live.

1130
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,231
What about the princess?

1131
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:12,317
The princess?

1132
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,029
The princess cried
a great, great deal...

1133
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,699
...a great, great deal...

1134
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,909
...and then got married.

1135
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,369
To whom?

1136
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:24,997
To the ogre?

1137
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,041
To the other one...

1138
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,502
...whose name I can't
remember.

1139
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:43,098
''As the crimson sea did run''

1140
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:49,062
''I heard you say, my dove''

1141
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,903
''That there would be no love.''

1142
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,044
''As the crimson sea did run''

1143
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:17,758
''I heard you say, my dove''

1144
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,220
''That there would be no love.''

1145
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,728
''Let's leave one another now''

1146
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,482
''I won't hold it against
you...''

1147
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,262
Marussya, wait!

1148
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:06,932
Wait!

1149
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,103
Wait, Marussya!

1150
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,648
Stay there,
or I'll jump out the window!

1151
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,859
Marussya, be reasonable!

1152
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,486
There are people downstairs.

1153
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,613
Marussya! There are people.

1154
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,324
It would look bad...

1155
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,034
Come on.

1156
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,121
I'll say it again. Stay there!

1157
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,039
Marussya!

1158
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,376
Come here.
Come here, my love.

1159
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,670
Come here.

1160
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,905
Come here, my love.

1161
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:59,211
After the siesta
we'll play soccer.

1162
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:01,379
Where?

1163
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,131
On the croquet lawn.

1164
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,427
Soccer, you say...

1165
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,263
And why not croquet,
like before?

1166
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,057
Because Daddy says...

1167
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:15,644
...that croquet and tennis
are bourgeois games.

1168
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,313
Whereas soccer isn't.

1169
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:21,983
He's nice.

1170
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,735
Who is?

1171
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,279
Your daddy.

1172
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:28,573
Very, very nice.

1173
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,952
Yes, he's always very nice.

1174
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,997
You know,
tomorrow Daddy's taking us...

1175
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,916
...to the zoo.
But you know...

1176
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,169
...in winter I've already been
there lots of times.

1177
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,505
But in summer...

1178
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:47,008
...never, because we spend it
at the dacha.

1179
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:48,635
MITYA, 1916

1180
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,762
MARUSSYA, AGE 14

1181
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,264
One day, in Moscow...

1182
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,641
...the grandmothers were
brought home on stretchers.

1183
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,101
They had fainted.

1184
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,602
Just like that.

1185
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,607
Because it smelled so bad...

1186
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,609
...that no one could breathe.

1187
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,862
It's the wild animals.

1188
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,615
I can't stand
the polar bears and the seals.

1189
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,868
''...Far off on Lake Chad...''

1190
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,495
''...roams a majestic giraffe.''

1191
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:32,846
YATIM 36

1192
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,681
I'm there, too.

1193
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:35,849
Where?

1194
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,521
There.

1195
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,526
Look.

1196
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,320
What's ''Yadan''?

1197
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:51,406
Yadan is... Think carefully.

1198
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,867
You're the one
who smells of wine!

1199
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,535
- I do not.
- You do.

1200
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,163
Nadya!
Isn't Grandmother sleeping?

1201
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:02,042
He's the one
who smells of wine.

1202
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,211
You're eating
because you've been drinking.

1203
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,423
You do the same.
You'd better obey.

1204
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:11,176
Go and play with the children.

1205
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,597
Do you want a spanking?

1206
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,100
Mitya, you understand?
Do you want some?

1207
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:20,894
No.

1208
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,605
Is it true that you're
married?

1209
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,609
No.

1210
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:31,571
So, you lied.

1211
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:33,949
Well, yes.

1212
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,869
Well, yes.

1213
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:41,122
They're all asleep.

1214
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,418
It's the realm of dreams.

1215
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,796
Do you want a candy?

1216
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:49,714
Do you remember?

1217
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,811
You smoke now.

1218
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,147
You vanished...
never a word...

1219
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,149
Where do you work?

1220
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,781
For the political police.

1221
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:23,915
Stop teasing.

1222
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,834
I'm serious.

1223
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,794
Where do I work?

1224
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:30,463
I performed in a restaurant
near Paris.

1225
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,924
Now, here, near Moscow.

1226
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:34,843
You could have said so.

1227
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,931
That, I remember.

1228
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:45,854
And you?

1229
01:23:47,073 --> 01:23:48,134
Me...

1230
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:53,028
I'm a projectionist
in the nearby holiday camp.

1231
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,113
- Go outside.
- No.

1232
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,366
...you smoke,
but you have nice hair.

1233
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,160
Not like me.

1234
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,537
When did you get back?

1235
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,956
Six months ago.

1236
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,460
Why didn't you come sooner?

1237
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,671
I had no reason sooner.

1238
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,551
Are you joking, or what?

1239
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,970
Do you know what she did?

1240
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:21,890
Have you seen her wrists?
She slit her veins.

1241
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:25,351
She waited for you a whole
year. No... more.

1242
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:27,312
It wasn't until later...

1243
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,522
...that the colonel turned up.

1244
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,733
With flowers,
concerts, restaurants...

1245
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:34,194
What do you expect? A hero!

1246
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,363
Are you back for good?

1247
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,741
Yes.

1248
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:41,659
So? And she?

1249
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:47,999
Then again, my colonel
would look good with horns.

1250
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,381
You're crazy. That hurts.

1251
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,717
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

1252
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:03,223
Mitya... Mitya!

1253
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:05,683
Stop.
Tonight I'm going to work!

1254
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,712
Wait, wait...

1255
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,718
Wait...

1256
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,619
Come on. Come on...

1257
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:33,771
My love!

1258
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,858
My love!

1259
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,225
- Try.
- All right.

1260
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:11,643
Go on.

1261
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,429
Was it you
who sent him there?

1262
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,223
Yes. It was me.

1263
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,102
Marussya!

1264
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,231
He left alone,
of his own free will.

1265
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,235
He had a choice.
Many of them had a choice.

1266
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,447
It was that or prison.

1267
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:12,245
We all have an alternative,
Marussya.

1268
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,540
We can talk,
we can keep silent.

1269
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,419
We can leave, we can stay.
We always have a choice.

1270
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,462
But why him?

1271
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:24,632
I was in the NKVD
only briefly, years ago.

1272
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:27,427
Remember, we sent a lot of
them abroad...

1273
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:29,721
...to embassies, consulates...

1274
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:32,432
...as correspondents...
And besides...

1275
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,769
...he already knew things.
He spoke their languages.

1276
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:44,610
Tell me...

1277
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,821
What if it had been you...

1278
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,491
...if they had said that to
you, would you have gone?

1279
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,077
Would you have left us?

1280
01:28:53,202 --> 01:28:54,120
Of course.

1281
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:57,457
I'm a soldier.

1282
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:01,252
Besides, Marussya...

1283
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:05,631
...I would have left
because...

1284
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,594
...I love my Motherland!

1285
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:15,099
Whereas he left because
he was scared. To stay alive.

1286
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,268
You understand the difference?

1287
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,521
My darling!

1288
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:25,485
There's duty,
and there's fear.

1289
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:33,785
You understand the difference?

1290
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:45,797
Well done!

1291
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,009
Tell me, Nadine, my friend...

1292
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,552
...can you tap dance?

1293
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:52,887
Can I what?

1294
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:55,807
No?

1295
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,142
I'll teach you.

1296
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:59,977
Let's go.

1297
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,918
Marussya! Do it!

1298
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:26,045
Go on.

1299
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:28,923
Please...

1300
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,843
Marussya, please...

1301
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:37,849
I beg you...

1302
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:39,892
Three, four...

1303
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,348
No. Start again.

1304
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:11,671
One more time.

1305
01:31:16,913 --> 01:31:18,222
Go on.

1306
01:31:23,795 --> 01:31:24,562
Mitya!

1307
01:31:31,223 --> 01:31:32,707
Splash!

1308
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:40,395
Mitya...

1309
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:47,920
...I wanted...

1310
01:31:47,948 --> 01:31:50,579
Marussya, I understand,
I know...

1311
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:52,485
I'll be leaving soon.

1312
01:31:52,497 --> 01:31:56,135
Ask Sergei to come down.
I'd like to talk to him.

1313
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:03,935
You're leaving?

1314
01:32:07,346 --> 01:32:09,757
To be frank, Nadine...
No.

1315
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,999
I can't lie to you.

1316
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:14,168
Tonight, a car
is going to come.

1317
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:16,047
Hurrah! A car!

1318
01:32:16,842 --> 01:32:18,991
It's our secret, all right?

1319
01:32:19,218 --> 01:32:21,536
Mum's the word.
It's a military secret.

1320
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,291
Well, Nadya?

1321
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:31,629
- Go outside.
- No.

1322
01:32:33,099 --> 01:32:35,299
Well, do you know this game?

1323
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:37,468
You have to hold the note.

1324
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:39,470
You breathe in...

1325
01:32:39,536 --> 01:32:41,789
...then breathe out,
and I count.

1326
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,307
I count.

1327
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:46,394
Take a good, deep breath...

1328
01:32:47,296 --> 01:32:48,896
...and breathe out softly.

1329
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,648
One, two...

1330
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:52,066
...three...

1331
01:32:54,886 --> 01:32:56,112
You sent for me?

1332
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:02,994
Well, what?

1333
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:19,719
Well...

1334
01:33:21,898 --> 01:33:23,556
Not a word to anyone.

1335
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:28,269
You're our guest.
Continue playing the game.

1336
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:31,856
When the car comes,
we'll leave.

1337
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,693
Today we're playing soccer.
Do you play?

1338
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:36,902
I used to.

1339
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:40,223
On Sundays
we always play soccer!

1340
01:33:40,264 --> 01:33:42,533
Sergei Petrovich,
have you understood me?

1341
01:33:42,564 --> 01:33:44,035
Absolutely.

1342
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,081
The car arrives in two hours.
Let's not waste time. Soccer!

1343
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,960
Soccer! Where's the bird
who's leaving by balloon?

1344
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:54,629
Daddy, Daddy! Look!

1345
01:33:54,688 --> 01:33:55,546
What, Nadya?

1346
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:04,295
Well done.

1347
01:34:04,308 --> 01:34:05,723
That's very good, Nadya!

1348
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:07,224
Daddy, Daddy!

1349
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,917
Look what Uncle Mitya can do!

1350
01:34:11,087 --> 01:34:12,938
- Nothing at all.
- You can.

1351
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:13,913
Stop it...

1352
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,483
Daddy, tell him!

1353
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,068
All right. Go on.

1354
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:18,944
Show us.

1355
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:20,821
Don't be shy.

1356
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,433
All right.

1357
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:32,752
Stop!

1358
01:34:33,089 --> 01:34:35,586
Watch, Nadya.
Watch carefully.

1359
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:39,090
Can your Uncle Mitya do this?

1360
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:56,149
What's wrong?

1361
01:34:56,152 --> 01:35:00,611
It's the dance of the bird
who's leaving by balloon.

1362
01:35:00,698 --> 01:35:01,536
Soccer!

1363
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:08,828
Hey, fellow!

1364
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,664
Is Zagorienka in this
direction?

1365
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:12,707
What?

1366
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:16,210
I'm asking if Zagorienka
or Zagorianka is this way?

1367
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,337
It's not around here.

1368
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:19,171
What?

1369
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:21,173
I was told that...

1370
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:24,677
Who told you? That's Gribnevo.
My brother-in-law's there.

1371
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,554
But I was told that...

1372
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:28,305
There's no Zagorianka here.

1373
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:30,850
I was told this way!

1374
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:34,228
Fuck! Those fellows back
there...

1375
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,731
Look, baldie...

1376
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:38,649
...come over here.

1377
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:43,070
Listen carefully.
I'm not speaking Chinese!

1378
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,740
If you go that way,
you'll end up in Petriayevo...

1379
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:48,576
...then Kuzem, then Petrovo...

1380
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,537
...and then Goriayevo.
There's no Zagorianka.

1381
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,665
Get the fuck out of here!

1382
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,334
Zagorianka, my ass!

1383
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,171
Stupid bastard!

1384
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:03,424
I'll make you eat your cap,
I will!

1385
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:06,093
Asshole!

1386
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:07,595
You'll see...

1387
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:10,514
Asshole!

1388
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:18,439
You know fucking everything!

1389
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,692
Asshole!

1390
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,861
You know nothing!

1391
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:26,739
You sleep here, asshole...

1392
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,699
...and you know nothing!

1393
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,093
Hand!

1394
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:30,678
- Penalty!
- What hand?

1395
01:37:56,328 --> 01:37:57,121
Off-side!

1396
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,623
Sergei Petrovich!

1397
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,975
Have you got it?

1398
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:19,643
The ball.

1399
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,020
I'll get it.

1400
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,902
Sergei Petrovich, perhaps...

1401
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,865
...you haven't understood me.
You have only one hour left.

1402
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,534
How will you spend it?

1403
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:38,871
What did you think?
That I'd be burning papers?

1404
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,707
Or that I'd commit suicide?

1405
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,335
I'd like to know whether...

1406
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:48,005
...or not you were forced to
come. Hans Christian Andersen.

1407
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,174
What?

1408
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,843
You tell shitty fairy tales.

1409
01:38:54,678 --> 01:38:55,930
And why...

1410
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,600
...why, in your stories,
didn't you say...

1411
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:02,436
...that since 1923...

1412
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:05,856
...you've worked
in counter-espionage...

1413
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:11,028
...and that, as a so-called
''pianist'' or ''musician''...

1414
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:17,034
...you fingered eight generals
from the White Army?

1415
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:20,704
That, thanks to you, they were
brought here by force...

1416
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:22,373
...and shot without a trial...

1417
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:24,583
...as enemies of the people?

1418
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,044
Because they weren't, perhaps?

1419
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,088
They were...

1420
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:32,633
...but I fought against them
for four years.

1421
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:36,053
Whereas you were
on their side...

1422
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,723
...and you fingered them.

1423
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:41,767
All eight generals...
Kornev...

1424
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,979
...Weiner, Machkov...
all of them!

1425
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,315
Sergei Petrovich,
you know that I was forced.

1426
01:39:48,857 --> 01:39:50,067
By whom?

1427
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,987
Who forced you, my angel?

1428
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:56,281
In '23, I had never...

1429
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:58,575
...heard of you.

1430
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:00,452
We bought you...

1431
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,080
...like a whore.

1432
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,084
Don't speak to me like that!

1433
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:12,172
I only wanted one thing...
to come back to this house.

1434
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,843
They promised that to me,
and I believed it.

1435
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:18,095
Your pals promised it to me.
''Do it...''

1436
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,266
''...and we'll let you go
back.'' They lied to me.

1437
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,476
And they took
everything I had.

1438
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:28,355
Everything!
My life, my profession...

1439
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:30,816
...my love, Marussya,
my Motherland, my faith!

1440
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,818
You took it all from me!

1441
01:40:34,653 --> 01:40:37,614
So that's why you came back!

1442
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,661
To revel in it...

1443
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:46,290
...to delight in your
suffering.

1444
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:49,626
To savor it, drop by drop...

1445
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:51,879
...sip by sip.

1446
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,214
And then...

1447
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:56,383
...wham!

1448
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,719
''Citizen Kotov, I arrest you!''

1449
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:03,724
In fact, I've committed a
crime of prevarication.

1450
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:06,018
- I warned you.
- You're lying!

1451
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,979
You're still lying!

1452
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:12,483
You act like
the cheapest of all whores!

1453
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,485
You lie to everyone.

1454
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:17,321
So that afterward,
I'll take that into account.

1455
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,991
You know how it will end?
Who'll dare touch me?

1456
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:23,911
Huh? Who?

1457
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:27,164
Me, a hero of the Revolution,
a colonel!

1458
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,333
Who would dare touch Kotov?

1459
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,213
I'll repeat that to you.

1460
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:38,008
And I'll watch you closely
when...

1461
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:40,844
...in five or six days...

1462
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:44,515
...you'll crawl in your shit...

1463
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,518
...and admit, in writting...

1464
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:51,188
...that since 1920 you've been
spying for the Germans...

1465
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:54,108
...and since 1923,
for the Japanese...

1466
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,193
...that you're a terrorist...

1467
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:58,237
...and that you wanted
to murder Stalin!

1468
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:01,615
And if you don't sign,
you scum, we'll remind you...

1469
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,409
...that you have
a wife and daughter!

1470
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:09,039
Daddy! Daddy!

1471
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,376
The pioneers
are coming to see you.

1472
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,419
Your pioneers!

1473
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,213
What pioneers?

1474
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:19,758
Where's Uncle Mitya?

1475
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:24,638
Uncle Mitya found the ball.

1476
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,808
Nadya, why is everyone
so cruel to me...

1477
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,309
...in this house?

1478
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:32,980
Daddy, hurry. They're here!

1479
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,399
- Let's go.
- Yes, Nadya.

1480
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,067
Let's all go.

1481
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:39,486
Let's go.

1482
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:43,157
The pioneer detachment
that proudly bears...

1483
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:44,783
...Comrade Kotov's name...

1484
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,785
...the glorious hero
of the Revolution...

1485
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,413
...renowned Bolshevik
and legendary colonel...

1486
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:50,539
...has come...

1487
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:53,417
...to take an oath before the
one who honors them.

1488
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:55,210
One, two...

1489
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,547
''We young Leninist
pioneers...''

1490
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:01,175
''...of the detachment
bearing the name...''

1491
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:03,010
''...of the legendary
colonel Kotov...''

1492
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:06,180
''...hero of the Civil War,
faithful disciple...''

1493
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,308
''...and brother-in-arms
of Comrade Stalin...''

1494
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:12,311
''...renowned Bolshevik...''

1495
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,313
''...decorated numerous
times...''

1496
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,649
''...before all our comrades...''

1497
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:20,986
''...and in the presence
of Comrade Kotov...''

1498
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:23,030
''...solemnly swear...''

1499
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,575
''...to be the faithful
upholders...''

1500
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:29,369
''...of the Great Cause of
Lenin, Stalin...''

1501
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:31,914
''...and the heroes...''

1502
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:34,166
''...of the Great Revolution...''

1503
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:36,585
''...to never betray...''

1504
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:38,378
''...secrets...''

1505
01:44:27,886 --> 01:44:29,638
Is this dacha number nine?

1506
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,599
Yes. Yes, you can see it is.

1507
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:35,519
I've been expecting you.

1508
01:44:36,019 --> 01:44:38,313
Are you looking for
Uncle Mitya?

1509
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,274
I'll tell him.

1510
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:41,984
Uncle Mitya!

1511
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:43,735
They're here!

1512
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:45,737
This is it.

1513
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:47,656
Uncle Mitya!

1514
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,075
Uncle Mitya, where are you?

1515
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:53,412
Uncle Mitya, the car's here.

1516
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:56,081
It's time to go, then.
Where's your father?

1517
01:44:57,582 --> 01:44:58,792
Go and fetch him.

1518
01:44:58,917 --> 01:45:00,252
Uncle Mitya...

1519
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:03,463
...can I get in the car?

1520
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:04,423
Yes, you can.

1521
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:07,634
Thank you.

1522
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,179
I'm going to drive! Hurrah!

1523
01:45:11,346 --> 01:45:12,597
Grandmother...

1524
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,141
I'm going to drive!

1525
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:15,684
Mitya.

1526
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:20,355
Why did you
make up that story?

1527
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,034
You know, one day I was at
your father's bedside.

1528
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,954
He was already very ill.

1529
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:38,707
He was raving...

1530
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:43,337
...when he suddenly opened his
eyes, took my hand...

1531
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,380
...and said...

1532
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:47,716
...''It's annoying.''

1533
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:53,221
''I've had such a long
interesting and beautiful life.''

1534
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,309
''And, God, what do I see
before dying?''

1535
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:02,147
''Trains with geese.''

1536
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:06,151
''It's annoying.''

1537
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:11,490
''Annoying and foolish.''

1538
01:46:14,117 --> 01:46:17,162
I found out later that
those were his last words.

1539
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:24,836
Why didn't you ever tell me?

1540
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:30,342
There are so many things
I never told you.

1541
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,793
Me, too.

1542
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,786
Is she his daughter?

1543
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:43,081
Who knows? Perhaps.

1544
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:46,418
She looks as if she is.

1545
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:13,195
Hello.

1546
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:14,613
Hello.

1547
01:48:15,113 --> 01:48:16,448
Enjoy your meal.

1548
01:48:20,785 --> 01:48:22,829
I'll ride to the bend
with you.

1549
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:26,791
We'll drive
through the fields.

1550
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:29,794
I'll do the driving.

1551
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:37,844
What are you chewing?

1552
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,847
We're eating.

1553
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:43,642
Do you want some
of Grandmother's cake?

1554
01:48:44,142 --> 01:48:45,644
No, thank you.

1555
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:48,355
Nadya!

1556
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:51,566
Don't tell anyone
that I came out.

1557
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:54,027
I'm coming, Grandmother.
I'm coming.

1558
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:56,571
She's a bold little girl.

1559
01:48:57,572 --> 01:48:59,533
I told you
she was his daughter.

1560
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:03,995
- Grandmother, you called me?
- No, Daddy did.

1561
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:07,165
Where is he?

1562
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,167
Where is he?

1563
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:11,002
You scared me!

1564
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,212
A real tomboy!

1565
01:49:12,251 --> 01:49:13,106
So?

1566
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,715
Probably in his office.

1567
01:49:18,009 --> 01:49:18,635
Elena?

1568
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:19,511
Yes.

1569
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:22,013
Will I have to
wait long like this?

1570
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:24,891
- I'm sorry.
- Why bother? It's already cold.

1571
01:49:26,142 --> 01:49:27,227
Daddy!

1572
01:49:29,187 --> 01:49:30,230
Daddy!

1573
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:34,234
There you are!

1574
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,613
Why is your cup here?

1575
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,578
Have you been drinking?

1576
01:49:45,036 --> 01:49:45,704
Me?

1577
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:47,205
Yes.

1578
01:49:48,206 --> 01:49:49,207
Yes.

1579
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,293
And you've eaten nothing?

1580
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,336
No.

1581
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:03,638
Where are you off to?

1582
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:05,640
Are you leaving?

1583
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:07,684
The car's here...

1584
01:50:08,059 --> 01:50:10,520
I'm going to Moscow.
I'm getting ready.

1585
01:50:10,812 --> 01:50:13,064
- And your car?
- It'll come tomorrow.

1586
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:16,526
At nine o'clock.

1587
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:18,403
I have an appointment at...

1588
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:22,616
Eight!

1589
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:25,785
Come on, hurry up!

1590
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:29,247
Uncle Mitya said
that I could drive a little.

1591
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,042
As far as the bend.

1592
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:34,002
Daddy, hurry. Come on!

1593
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:39,924
Daddy, do you remember...

1594
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:42,969
...Uncle Mitya's story?

1595
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:46,431
They all had funny names.

1596
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,266
Well, do you know...

1597
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:53,104
...if I'd been in the story,
what my name would have been?

1598
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:54,272
- What?
- Yadan.

1599
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:56,775
Yadan...
What does that mean?

1600
01:50:56,941 --> 01:50:59,319
It's Nadya spelled backwards.

1601
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:00,945
Hurry up.

1602
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:07,661
You know, tomorrow...

1603
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:12,082
We can't go to the zoo.
I have to work...

1604
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:14,918
Don't be angry with me.

1605
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,961
We'll go another time.

1606
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,634
Do the platypus for me.

1607
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:27,639
Oh, he's so pretty!

1608
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:30,141
Can you play this game?

1609
01:51:30,308 --> 01:51:31,476
What game?

1610
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:32,560
Look.

1611
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:36,314
You plug up your ears
and you go ''oooh''.

1612
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:38,650
What?

1613
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:40,026
Like this, look.

1614
01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:43,530
What?

1615
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:46,991
Yes, you plug up your ears
and you go ''oooh''.

1616
01:51:47,742 --> 01:51:50,495
- What's the game?
- To see who can do it the longest.

1617
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:51,913
- Really?
- Yes.

1618
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:53,748
Three, four...

1619
01:52:04,467 --> 01:52:06,344
I'm little, I get two chances.

1620
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:18,398
Three times.
I get to go three times...

1621
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,859
...because I'm little.

1622
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:21,943
Three, four...

1623
01:52:54,976 --> 01:52:56,770
How about that!

1624
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:04,778
Go on, say...

1625
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:06,780
...''Grucheva Lyuba.''

1626
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,073
Grucheva Lyuba!

1627
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:12,619
Very good.
Again, ''Grucheva Lyuba.''

1628
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:17,248
Very good.
Say, ''The colonel.''

1629
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:18,792
Colonel moron!

1630
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:19,959
Shut up!

1631
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:22,545
Hell!

1632
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,423
You damn womanizer!

1633
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:29,719
Nadya...

1634
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:33,765
...you're going to...
Whose car is that? Yours?

1635
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:34,557
Yes.

1636
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:35,892
It's beautiful!

1637
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:38,520
- Who are they?
- My comrades.

1638
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:40,980
Delighted.
Hello.

1639
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:44,234
Come and have some tea
on the verandah.

1640
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,819
We've got cake.

1641
01:53:46,569 --> 01:53:48,238
A very good cake.

1642
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:49,656
Excuse us.

1643
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,866
Elena, stop it.

1644
01:53:52,116 --> 01:53:54,160
You know very well
that the tea is cold.

1645
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:47,297
I'll catch you again...

1646
01:54:51,175 --> 01:54:53,344
Someone has to sit
by the driver.

1647
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:56,931
Daddy, sit by me.
You can watch me drive.

1648
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:58,099
No, Nadya. No.

1649
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:00,435
Daddy's going to
sit in the back.

1650
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:03,104
He'll see you better.

1651
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:04,188
All right.

1652
01:55:18,202 --> 01:55:19,203
Very good, Nadine!

1653
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:31,215
Thank you for driving us so
well. Stop here, Alexei.

1654
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:36,638
Hurry home.

1655
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,139
Mother's waiting.

1656
01:55:41,851 --> 01:55:43,227
All right.
'Bye, Daddy!

1657
01:55:43,728 --> 01:55:44,646
'Bye!

1658
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,316
Excuse me.

1659
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,320
Were you ever at the zoo?

1660
01:55:52,695 --> 01:55:53,446
What?

1661
01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:55,573
- The zoo?
- Of course.

1662
01:55:55,698 --> 01:55:58,576
Did you leave because
they didn't feed you well?

1663
01:56:01,287 --> 01:56:01,955
Nadya!

1664
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,917
Is that any way
to speak to a grown-up?

1665
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:07,752
- That's naughty.
- Sorry.

1666
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:10,296
Nadya, let's go.
Run. Mother's waiting.

1667
01:56:10,546 --> 01:56:11,464
I have to go.

1668
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:55,299
''Burnt by the sun...''

1669
01:56:57,593 --> 01:57:01,180
Mitya...
I have what you need.

1670
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:04,642
Here.

1671
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,769
- Calm down!
- Give me that.

1672
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:09,480
You think I'll poison myself?
Not at all.

1673
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:13,860
Want some?

1674
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:16,279
No.

1675
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,073
As you wish.

1676
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:20,366
Mitya!

1677
01:57:20,533 --> 01:57:21,826
No, thank you.

1678
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,997
A drop of cognac, old man?

1679
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:29,000
I don't drink
and I don't smoke.

1680
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:33,796
Of course, I won't offer any
to the driver.

1681
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:37,300
Well, you youngsters, enjoy
the holiday for the construction...

1682
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:39,802
...of Stalin's airships
and balloons!

1683
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,519
Are you armed?

1684
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:51,647
What?

1685
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:54,067
Do you carry a weapon?

1686
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:57,695
Have you lost your mind?
I'm a colonel...

1687
01:57:57,904 --> 01:57:59,405
Of course I carry a weapon.

1688
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,032
Give it to me.

1689
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:04,744
Of course.

1690
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:09,749
Careful. It's loaded.
Do you know how to use it?

1691
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:19,967
Sanya!

1692
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:32,021
Where are we going?

1693
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:38,194
Perhaps we could...

1694
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:39,946
...go to a restaurant?

1695
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:44,659
It's my treat.

1696
01:58:45,076 --> 01:58:46,202
No?

1697
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:54,877
Mitya, do you know
the phone number 24-37?

1698
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,169
No.

1699
01:58:59,513 --> 01:59:00,572
No...

1700
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:03,094
...you don't know it.

1701
01:59:03,261 --> 01:59:04,804
You couldn't know it...

1702
01:59:05,805 --> 01:59:08,474
...because it's
Comrade Stalin's direct line.

1703
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:11,644
And tomorrow...

1704
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:13,563
...no, today...

1705
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:17,233
...I'm going to dial
that number...

1706
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,237
...and, believe me, your
department will get hell...

1707
01:59:27,451 --> 01:59:28,619
Yes.

1708
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,831
Trains with geese.

1709
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:38,171
The geese will be well-fed,
all right. We'll make...

1710
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:41,507
...a special effort for you.

1711
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:47,180
Who's that shit
across the road?

1712
01:59:47,346 --> 01:59:48,556
Stop.

1713
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:49,974
Yes, Sir.

1714
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:52,768
Don't try anything stupid,
Sergei Petrovich.

1715
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:56,772
Like what? I did the stupid
things ages ago.

1716
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:04,405
I used up all my gasoline
driving around all day.

1717
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:06,574
Hello.

1718
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:09,785
My wife washed my shirt
with the adress in it.

1719
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:12,246
It was Zagorianka
or Zagorienka.

1720
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:14,332
That's not around here.

1721
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:18,252
No one knows anything!
They're all mongoloids!

1722
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:22,465
They send you one way,
and then another!

1723
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:25,301
I've been driving in circles
all day for nothing!

1724
02:00:25,468 --> 02:00:26,552
Hold on, son I...

1725
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:29,805
I need a little gasoline.
I crossed the forest...

1726
02:00:29,972 --> 02:00:31,307
Where are you going?

1727
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:36,979
Are you Comrade Kotov?

1728
02:00:37,688 --> 02:00:39,106
Hold on...

1729
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:41,609
Are you going to Nagorié?

1730
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,444
- Perhaps...
- Hold on...

1731
02:00:43,569 --> 02:00:45,863
It's the other way.
I'll show you.

1732
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:47,823
- Don't move!
- Are you crazy?

1733
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,492
Sit down, damn it!

1734
02:01:29,657 --> 02:01:30,491
Halt!

1735
02:01:32,702 --> 02:01:33,953
About face!

1736
02:01:35,871 --> 02:01:37,665
Comrade... comrade...

1737
02:01:37,999 --> 02:01:39,583
I've got nothing... Comrade...

1738
02:01:39,792 --> 02:01:41,961
I've... The adress
faded away...

1739
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:44,922
I don't make much money...

1740
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:47,967
My papers are in order.
I'm going to...

1741
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:49,385
Halt!

1742
02:01:49,969 --> 02:01:51,429
Hands behind your head!

1743
02:01:52,888 --> 02:01:54,765
Hands behind your head,
I said!

1744
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:13,451
It's just that
the address faded, and...

1745
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,329
Comrade, comrade...

1746
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,581
I've got all my papers here...

1747
02:02:18,706 --> 02:02:20,583
Here, in the truck.

1748
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,419
I've only...

1749
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:27,423
The customer... the boss
is waiting for me...

1750
02:02:27,923 --> 02:02:30,968
He... he's been waiting
all day...

1751
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,679
All my papers are in order...

1752
02:02:34,096 --> 02:02:36,182
Comrade, comrade, I...

1753
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:58,013
Comrade Stalin...

1754
02:04:11,068 --> 02:04:12,111
Comrade!

1755
02:04:20,035 --> 02:04:23,664
Comrade! Is that really
Colonel Kotov in the car?

1756
02:04:27,334 --> 02:04:30,546
Is that really
Colonel Kotov in the car?

1757
02:04:31,922 --> 02:04:34,925
No, he just looks like him.

1758
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:53,944
Your papers!

1759
02:04:54,153 --> 02:04:54,778
What?

1760
02:04:54,987 --> 02:04:55,905
Your papers!

1761
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:58,532
They're in order!

1762
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:02,036
It's my wife who...

1763
02:05:05,414 --> 02:05:07,750
Why take my license?

1764
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:10,461
Comrades!

1765
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:12,630
Comrades... you...

1766
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:14,298
Hurry, we're leaving!

1767
02:05:22,848 --> 02:05:23,933
O.K.

1768
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:26,393
Hurry... the tarpaulin...

1769
02:05:29,355 --> 02:05:30,606
Let's go.

1770
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:35,986
Stand it up.

1771
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:45,162
You're useless!

1772
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:21,699
My nose is fragile...

1773
02:06:22,491 --> 02:06:23,909
Ever since I was little...

1774
02:06:24,076 --> 02:06:26,537
In any case, well done,
Dimitri Andreyevich!

1775
02:06:26,996 --> 02:06:28,872
I would never have guessed!

1776
02:06:29,498 --> 02:06:32,251
So much for studies!

1777
02:06:33,252 --> 02:06:35,212
A future enemy of the people!

1778
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:38,507
Otherwise, we'd be
in his shoes!

1779
02:06:39,758 --> 02:06:41,385
To think of my jacket!

1780
02:06:48,183 --> 02:06:50,561
I don't like writing
these reports.
