00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,880
Only when they are threadbare...

39
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,440
will the people
be able to understand...

40
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,240

the greatness of our time...

No revolution
that seems to be permanent...

58
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,240
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.

59
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
So the World will not live at war.

60
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,760
So also the people
do not live on revolution.

61
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,120
Nothing on this earth that has lasted
for thousands ofyears...

62
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,920
was assembled in mere decades.

63
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,160

the longest period of growth.

68
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,080
that is our hope for the youth...

69
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,920
to carry on the work which has been put
before them in the stormyyears...

70
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,200
of the revolt of 1 91 8 in Munich...

71
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,480
and which is already part
of the entire German nation's history.

Dr. Otto Dietrich, Reichsleiter

Truth is the foundation...

74
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,160
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.

75
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,160
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...

76
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,960
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.

77

has begun at 51 locations.

79
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,520
Although this work
is in its early stage...

80
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,680
today there are already
52,000 men on thejob...

81

86

90
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,080

91
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,600

Dr. Robert Ley, Reichsleiter
andHeadofthe German LaborFront
(DAF- Deutsche Arbeitsfront)

95
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,840
All our work must be dictated
by a single thought--

96
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,720
that the German worker...

97
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,880
be made an upright, proud
and equally entitled national comrade.

As the Leader
of the German legal service...

100
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,560
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...

101
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,440
is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.

102
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,920
And forus ourhighestleader
isalso the highestjudge.!

103
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:46,480
We know how sacred the principles
of these laws are to our Führer.

104
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,960
These Reich laws can assure you,
National Comrades...

May the bright flame of our enthusiasm
never be extinguished.

109
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,880
It alone gives light and warmth...

110
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,080
to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.

111
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,360
This comes
from the depths of the People...

112
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,520
and from these depths of the people...

113
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,440
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.

114
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,000
It may be good to possess power
based on strength...

115
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:49,200
but it is better to win
and hold the heart of a People.

in the swamp.

154
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,440
We work in the swamp.

155
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,560

We plant trees.

158
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,120
We build roads...

159
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,920
from town to town,
and city to city.

160
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,880
We provide the farmer

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,640
in Flanders...

176
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,520
in the West...

177
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
in the East...

178
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,600
in the South...

179
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,000
on land, on water,
and in the clouds.

180
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,720
Comrades, who were shot
by the Red Front and Reactionaries...

181
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
You are not dead.!

182
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,560
You live in Germany.!

183
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,240
My Labor Service Men.

184
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,040
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...

185
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,480
before me
and before the German people.

186
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,880
You represent a great idea...

187
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,200
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...

188
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,200
physical labor will not longer
be a divisive concept.

189
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,720
But it will instead bind us together
and, furthermore...

190
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,120
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...

191
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,240
that physical labor will be seen
as anything less...

192
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,120
than any other work.

193
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,880
The whole nation passes
through your school.

194
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,920
The time will come
when no German...

195
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,360
can be admitted
into the community of the people...

196
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,440
until he has first become a member
ofyour group.

197
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,320
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...

198
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,960
by the thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...

199
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,640
which also sees you here
for the first time today.

200
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,040
And I know thatjust as you serve
this Germany proudly...

201
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,960
all of Germany today will see its sons
marching in you with proud joy!

Hail Victory!
Hail Victory! Hail Victory!

204
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Comrades.

205
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Many ofyou here tonight knew me...

206
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,320
as an SA man...

207
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,160
marching in the rank and file...

208
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,960
in the first years of the Movement.

209
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,720
And Party Comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...

210
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,320
so I am still an SA man today!

211
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,600
We SA workers will always be true
only to the Führer...

212
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,880
and fight for the Führer.

(Reich Youth Leader)

221
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,320
My Leader!

222
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,640
My Comrades!

223
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:44,040
We live again for this hour
which makes us proud and happy.

224
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:50,960
According to your command, my Leader,
a youth stands here...

225
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,800
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.

226
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:03,400
The young generation of our people
follows afteryou.

227
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,880
Just as you demonstrate the highest
self-sacrifice in this Nation...

228
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,000
so does this youth wish to be selfless.

229
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,280
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...

230
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,880
therefore we wish to be faithful.

231
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,040
Adolf Hitler,
the Leader of German Youth, attention!

232
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,960
My German youth.

233
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,280
After one year
I can greet you again here.

234
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,400
You standing here today
represent something...

235
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,440
that is happening all over Germany.

236
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,400
And we want that you,
German boys and girls...

237
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,920
will absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.

238
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,160
We want to be one people...

239
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,560
and through you,
to become this people.

240
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,400
We want a society with
neither castes nor ranks.

241
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,840
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.

242
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,880
We want to see one Reich.!

243
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,040
And you must educate yourselves
for this.

244
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,200
We want this people to be obedient...

245
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,480
and you must practice obedience
in yourselves.

246
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,680
We want this people
to be peace-loving...

247
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,880
but at the same time to be courageous.

248
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,840
And you must, for that reason,
be both peace-loving...

249
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,960
You must be both peace-loving
and strong.

250
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,080
We want this people
not to become soft...

251
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,440
but to become hard and, therefore...

252
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,800
you must steel yourselves for this
in youryouth.

253
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,160
You must learn sacrifice...

254
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,320
and also never to collapse.

255
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,680
Whatever we create today...

256
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,840
whatever we do...

257
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,240
will all pass away...

258
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,360
but in you Germany will live on.

259
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
And when we can no longer hold...

260
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,240
the flag that we tore from nothing...

261
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,440
you must hold it firmly in your fists!

262
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,240
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...

263
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,800
as we bind ourselves together.

264
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,320
Foryou are flesh ofourflesh
andbloodfrom ourblood.!

265
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,560
The same spirit that governs us...

266
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
burns in youryoung minds.

267
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,440
And when the great columns
of the movement...

268
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,600
sweep through Germany today...

269
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,840
then I know that you will close ranks...

270
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,240
and we know that Germany
lies in front ofus...

271
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,680
Germanymarches within us...

272
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,920

279
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,440
Ayear ago...

280
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,200
we met for the first time
on this field;

281
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:17,320
the first general review
of political leaders...

282
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,160
of the National Socialist Party.

283
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,320
200,000 men have assembled here.

284
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:32,520
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...

285
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,880
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.

286
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:54,240
It was the great calamity of our people
that drove us to the struggle...

287
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:01,320
brought us together...

288
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,520
and left us greater.

289
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,040
Those who do not understand...

290
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,720
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.

291
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,840
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...

292
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,960
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...

293
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,880
amidst calamity and passion.

294
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,280
Others cannot understand...

295
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,640
that this is not
an order of the State.!

296
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,760
Theyare deceiving themselves.!

297
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,800
The State doesnot orderus.!

298
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,200
We orderthe State.!

299
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,240
The State didnot create us.!

300
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,720
Rather we createdourown State.!

301
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,400
No, the movement lives...

302
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,040
and it is grounded hard and fast.

303
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:29,360
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...

304
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,240
he will give his strengths
to the movement...

305
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,960
just as it was in yesteryear.

306
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,400
Then drum will join drum...

307
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,480
flag will join flag...

308
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,480
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...

309
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,080
and after that,
this earlier divided people...

310
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,240
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.

311
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,720
It would be an outrage
ifwe were to lose...

312
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,360
what we have fought for...

313
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,720
with so much labor,
so much worry...

314
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,320
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.

315
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,200
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...

316
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,480
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.

317
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,280
That would not be so...

318
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,680
if it were not a cardinal command.

319
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,640
And no earthly power
gave us that command.

320
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,160
Forthe God, ourGod, who created
ourpeople, gave us that command.!

321
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,760
So it is our vow this evening...

322
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,960
that each hour, on everyday...

323
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,960
to think onlyofGermany
ofthe People andReich...

324
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,080
andofourGerman nation.!

325
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,360
To the Germanpeople.!
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

My Führer (My Leader):

332
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:58,360
Just as we have always done our duty
to you in the past...

333
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,560
so too in the future,
we await your orders alone.

334
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,200
And we, Comrades, know only to obey...

335
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:15,040
the orders of our Führer...

336
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:20,280
and to prove that we have remained
true to the Führer.

337
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,440

338
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,520
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

SA and SS men:

340
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,000
A few months ago...

341
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,360
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.

342
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,600
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...

343
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:01,840
had nothing whatsoever to do
with this shadow.

344
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:11,040
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...

345
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,680
deceive themselves.

346
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,280
Itstands fastas thisblockhere...

347
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:28,840
and nothing in Germany
will break it.

348
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,400
And when anyone does harm
to the spirit of my SA...

349
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,240
then the SA will not be harmed...

350
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,000
but those who do this harm...

351
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,280
will injure only themselves!

352
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:01,760
And only a fool
or a known liar...

353
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,720
could think...

354
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,000
that I would ever
disband an organization...

355
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,000
that took us so manyyears to build.

356
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,880
My Comrades...

357
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,280
we stand fast together
for our Germany...

358
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:29,480
and we must stand fast together
for this Germany.

359
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,240
And I hand to each ofyou
the new insignia...

360
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,560
placing them with confidence...

361
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,840
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.

362
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:50,960
For in the past you have proven
your loyalty to me a thousand times.

363
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,920
In the time to come, it cannot
and willnot be any different.

364
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:15,640

420

The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to and end.

421
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:56,280
What appeared
like a show of political strength...

422
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:03,160
for millions of Germans
outside of our ranks.

423
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,400
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...

424
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,600
it was ultimately more.

425
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,280
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...

426
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,600
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.

427
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,040
And, perhaps, a cross section ofyou...

428
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:25,080
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...

429
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,160
will return with courageous hearts

430
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:35,360
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.

431
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:48,400
When our Party consisted
of only seven members...

432
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,520
it already had two principles.

433
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,600
First, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.

434
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,520
And second, it would be,
uncompromisingly...

435
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,680
the one andonlypowerin Germany.

436
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,800
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilized...

437
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:25,520
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...

438
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:30,680
which have always been not in the
majority, but rather in the minority.

439
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:45,960
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...

440
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,560
they can in the proudest self-esteem...

441
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,040
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.

442
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,560
The German people...

443
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,560
and subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers!

444
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,000
The German people is happy...

445
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,160
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...

446
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,720
has been replaced by a fixedpole.!

447
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,080
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...

448
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,880
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...

449
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,360
will never relinquish it!

450
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,160
Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof
(Reich Bishop ofthe United
German Evangelist Church)

451
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:11,400
There is always a part of the people who
stand out as really active fighters...

452
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:18,760
and more is expected from them
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.

453
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,960
For them it is not simply enough
to make the pledge: ''Ibelieve.!''

454
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,680
Rather, the affirmation: ''Ifight.!''

455
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:53,160
For all time to come the Party will be
the source of political leadership
for the German people.

456
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,160
It will in its teaching...

457
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,560
and was ultimately in its organization
hard as steel...

458
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,880
malleable in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety;

459
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,080
yet it will be a training school
like a holyorder for political leaders.

460
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:24,720
It must be shown, however,
that all upstanding Germans
become NationalistSocialists.

461
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:30,000
Only the best NationalistSocialists,
however, are Party Comrades.!

462
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:58,800
Once, our enemies worried us and
persecuted us and, from time to time...

463
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:04,640
removed the lesser elements
from the Movement for us.

464
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:12,400
Today we must examine ourselves
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad.

465
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,600
Andtherefore, do notbelong with us.!

466
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,840
It is our wish and will...

467
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:37,400
that this State and this Reich
last for thousand years.

468
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:45,200
We can be happy to know
that this future belongs entirely to us.!

469
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,920
When the olderonesamong us falter...

470
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,880
theyouth willstiffen
andremain until theirbodies decay.

471
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:33,760
Only then, ifwe in the Party
with our most obedient dedication...

472
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:41,400
become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being...

473
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,960
then the Party will materialize...

474
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,840
into an eternalandindestructible
pillar of the German people and Reich.

475
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:56,760
Then our glorious
and laudable Army...

476
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,040
the old, proud,
standard bearers of our people...

477
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,040
who are equally tradition minded...

478
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,720
will champion the Political Leadership
and the Party.

479
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:11,600
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...

480
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,160
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...

481
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,160
the German State, the German Reich.!

482
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:38,040
At this hour, tens of thousands
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.

483
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:42,640
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...

484
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:47,400
still others are already planning
the next review.

485
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:55,520
And again the people come and go and
they will be engrossed anew and happy...

486
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,360
and inspired, for the idea and
the Movement live on in our people...

487
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,600
and with the Movement
are symbol of eternity!
