First thing I'd like to know is
what subject this is.

that English is a fantastic language.

01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:01,055
No, I don't think that Cronauer
is going to be back in the air, sir.

- You want him back?

1293
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,979
We've gotten duffel bags filled with information

1294

asking for Cronauer's reinstatement.

1295

The men all hate Hauk.
They want Cronauer back.

1296
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:17,029
He's an exhilarating personality,
and polkas are just no substitute.

1297
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,198
I think that I see a pattern forming here.

1298
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,866
Sir, these letters are unequivocal.

1299
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:23,786
E.g., "Hey, Hauk, eat a bag of shit.
You suck."

1300
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,956
That's pretty much to the point, sir.
Not much grey area in this one.

GARLICK: We got one call
from some guy in Wichita

1302
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,460
who thought Hauk was visionary and interesting.

1303
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,965
The other 1, 100 calls said that
the man can't do comedy to save his dick.

1304
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,675
That's a direct quote, sir.

1305
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,595
I've taken 90 calls this morning.
They just don't like Hauk.

From a Marine in Da Nang:

1307

"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat
off a dead man's balls."

1308
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:50,146
I have no idea what that means, sir,
but it seems very negative to me.

to tell us something, fellas.

choices, I can change.

I've been broadcasting the polkas

1312
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,698

1313
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:04,076
weren't represented
by Cronauer's broadcasts of rock 'n' roll.

1314
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:07,204
But I can easily play
an occasional Gary Lewis record.

you play polkas or don't play polkas.

The men like him better than they do you.

1318
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:23,179
No, no, no. He made a mistake.
We all make mistakes.

Now, this thing is a delicate balance over here,

1320

but what about the silent masses who do?

1324
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,821
And as far as polkas,
they are a much maligned musical taste.
