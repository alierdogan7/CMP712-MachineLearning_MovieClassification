- Henri, please!

And one slip.

Why, I'd be glad to explain to them.
The very idea of any connection is revolting.

- Oh, no, you don't. Never mind. Just...
- I'd be delighted.

I think you're repulsive.

You're not going with me.
- Thank heavens.

- My interpreter and aide is
a Lieutenant Eloise Billings...

- whom I'm reliably informed is intelligent...
- Yes.

- Yes.

60
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,085
And, as you Americans say, stacked.

You haven't met her?

No. But that happy event's going to take

- Major Prendergast's office.

- There's nothing for you to do.
- Isn't there?

- Wait. If you...
- I'm in a hurry.

- Hello, Eloise.
- Hi, honey.

69
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,003
May I present Captain Rochard,
Lieutenant Billings.
You two are going to work together.

70
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,636
- Enchanted, Lieutenant Billings.
- How do you do, Captain? I was just...

71
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,646
I believe we have
a mutual friend, Alex Brissac.

72
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,410
- How nice.
- Why, sure. I remember him.

73
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,884
Lieutenant, due to the fact that I was on
previous missions with Captain Rochard...

74
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,320
he just returned some of my things...
perhaps I can be of some help to you.

75
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,326
Thank you. I can explain things to Lieutenant
Billings. Don't you have somewhere to go?

76
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,022
- Oh, no. I'm free until 2:30.
- Well, about this here mission...

77
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088
It's a simple matter.
It's an overnight job.

78
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,760
We have to go to Bad Nauheim,
a pleasant little village, and...

79
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,803
- Or it will be till you get there.
- Oh.

80
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,464
Well, I can explain the whole thing
better to you when we're alone.

81
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,499
Better wear side arms, Lieutenant.
He uses maps instead of etchings.

82
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,740
Captain Rochard, I've so looked forward
to going to Bad Nauheim.

83
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,682
Billings, the French army shoe is
built on slightly different lines. It...

84
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,049
- Ooh.
- Hold the foot, would you, Junior?

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,819
- Yes, yes, yes.
- As you can see by Captain Rochard's
foot and my thigh.

86
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,553
- For goodness sakes!
- That was purely accidental.

87
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,256
- The mark on my chin... May I have my foot?
- Mmm.

88
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,630
Thank you. The mark
under my chin was an accident.

89
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,068
- My fault entirely. I tripped
while he was chasing me.
- Chasing you?

90
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,299
- Will you shut up?
- There. You see?

91
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,240
Something I would never have mentioned
if he hadn't shown it. His temper.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,575
But the poor man's probably not to blame.
More like a form of epilepsy.

93
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,910
- Will you shut up!
- I tell you this...

94
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,916
Will you shh... shh...

95
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,145
Henri, I'm talking.

96
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,154
Yes, you are.

97
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,749
I tell you this because we're members
of the same army and the same sex.

98
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,386
I think it only fair to warn you Jack the Ripper's
up that alley before you head into it.

99
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,431
In case anything happens, would you like to
give me your mother's name and address?

100
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,865
- But, honey, that's what I've
been tryin' to tell you.
- Oh?

101
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,868
- I'm not goin' on this here mission.
- Tell me...

102
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,235
- You're not?
- I'm goin' to Frankfurt with
Colonel Bliven on that D.P. Job.

103
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,240
- But who...
- And you're goin' with him.

104
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,776

- Oh.

I was just going to send for you, Gates.
Come in, please. You too, Captain.

110
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,761
This shouldn't take long, Captain. Gates,
Billings is needed on another assignment.

111
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,960
- You'll have to take her place
along with Captain Rochard.
- Thank you, no.

112
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,698
But, Major, if I may suggest, Lieutenant Perry
is almost finished with her assignment.

113
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,673
No. No experience. And Captain Rochard
wants our best, don't you, Captain?

114
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,303
Well, uh, Major. You see,
this is not an important mission.

115
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,507
My government's request for an officer
is only a technicality, so that...

116
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,313
Your orders call for our full cooperation.
It's my job to see you get it.

117
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,186
Now, here's your identity card, security pass
and temporary ration card.

118

- Thank you.
- Your orders are being cut, Gates.

119
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,122
- Captain Rochard will brief you
on the mission.
- Yes, Major.

120
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:26,255
Well, Major, this Lieutenant
What's-her-name... Perry, she ought to do.

121
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,631
Oh, you're very kind, Captain,
but we're used to being shorthanded.

122
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,730
Besides, if I remember, you've had several
assignments with Lieutenant Gates before...

123
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,173
and very successfully, apparently.

124
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:42,545
It says here, "Recovered art treasures stolen
by the Nazis from the Lille Museum.

125
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,881
"Also located hidden documents
relating to rocket research.

127
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,916
- Ah, she's your man, all right.
- Wish she were.

128
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,289
- What was that you said, Captain?
- Oh, nothing, Major.

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,954
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you, Major.

130
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,589
- You've done more than you realize.
- Good luck then.

131
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,759
- Good-bye, Major.
- Good-bye.

132
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,201
- Captain, Jack the Ripper was a famous...
- Thank you.

133
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,437
Oh.

134
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,445
Thank you, Captain.

135
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,279
I wonder what the army would do
if I deserted.

136
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,287
They'd shoot you.
The thought makes my mouth water.

137
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,756
- I'd almost prefer it myself.
- Which way do we go?

138
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,196
Well, let's get the briefing over.
What's the job?

139
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,960
- You don't need to know.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

140
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,968
What's the job?

141
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,437
- To keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you.
- [Groans]

142
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,373
I would like to know the details
of my assignment in order to know...

143
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,774
what equipment to draw
from the quartermaster.

144
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,838
- See if they have a spare head.
- And I may as well warn you, bubble mouth...

145
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,281
I'm going to carry a revolver
and a trench knife...

146
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,546
and if you so much as lay
a finger on me this trip...

147
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,589
you're going back to France
minus a lot of parts you probably value.

148
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,286
There you go again, you blistering idiot.
I didn't touch you!

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,488
Oh, I'm sorry, Henri, but we're stuck.
We've got to be together for a while...

150
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,497
so why not make the best of it?

151
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,932
- There is no best.
- Well, I'll go crazy if you...

152
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,701
We turn here. I'll go crazy if you keep losing
that maniac temper every ten minutes.

153
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,471
Aw, Henri, let's grow up. I'm sorry
about what happened in the wine cellar.

154
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,275
I have no temper. No one ever
accused me of having a temper!

155
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,282
- They didn't, eh?
- No!

156
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,545
Do you remember what you were
doing the last time I saw you?

157
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,144
You were chasing me down the Hermann

A lovely, robin's egg blue...

- On account of having been pushed
into a vat of dye by you!

- I didn't know it was dye.
I thought it was water.

- It certainly is.

You see, you chase after anything in skirts.
Anything. They're all the same to you.

But lots of men can tell them apart.

- Twenty minutes.

I run after everything in skirts?

Is it worn off, or is he still blue?

Oh, now let me tell you something,
Lieutenant Gates...

313
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,109
I'm going straight down this river.

314
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,951
You sure are. But you're going
over a waterfall first.

315
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,389
Oh, well, that's different. I'm...

316
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,018
- Oh!
- [Screams]

317
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,705
Ooh!

318
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:25,799
Oh, Henri, stop playing ostrich.
Come, help hold this!

319
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,810
Hold on.

320
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:33,013
- Now let's try to pull ourselves free.
- All right.

321
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,519
- Come on, Henri. Pull. Pull hard.
- I'm pulling.

322
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:40,318
Now we're getting it.
[Speaks German]

323
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:45,457
- Now row.
- I'm rowing.

324
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,463
Come on, Henri, pull!

325
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,667
- Come on. Row hard, Henri.
- I am!

326
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:56,768
- Now turn it around.
- I'll turn it.

327
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:02,306
- Oh, boy!
- Oh! You're so clumsy.

328
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,751
Have you got it?

329
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,025
[Grunting]
A little bit more.

330
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,769
Henri, that's awfully wet ground
you're sitting on.

331
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,806
Well, at the moment
I can't feel anything anyway.

332
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,603
But when I do, I think
I'm going to kick you bowlegged.

333
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:34,439
For what?
For saving your life?

334
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,002
Oh, yes, that's right.
You did catch that rope, didn't you?

335
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,877
Yes. I did.

336
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:41,645
- Convenient, wasn't it?
- Oh, they always are.

337
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:44,653
Well, I suppose I owe you
something for that.

338
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,849
Okay. I'll call it square if you'll tell me
what we're going to do in Bad Nauheim.

339
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:49,858
- Oh.
- Come on, Henri.

340
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:53,555
Well, there's a man in Bad Nauheim
who grinds lenses. Good ones too.

341
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,726
- His name is... What's the matter?
- Charley horse.

342
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,826
Well, roll over.
I can fix that. I'm...

343
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:03,134
- Oh, no. Never mind. Go ahead with the story.
- His name is Schindler.

344
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,697
- Schindler, a lens grinder.
- That's right. My job is to persuade him...

345
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:10,110
that we're willing to pay more
for his lenses than he can get
in the German black market.

346
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,307
- Ooh, that's sore.
- Well, do as I tell you. Roll over.

347
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:14,680
- Come on. I'm good at that. Come on.
- Oh, all right.

348
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,914
I'll fix it. I can help you.

349
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:19,979
- What's our problem?
- No problem at all.

350
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:24,187
A few well-chosen words, a contract,
a passport in his hand. Then we can go home.

351
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,195
That's the whole plot.
Simple, isn't it?

352
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,561
In that case, I don't see why
they assigned me to this mission.

353
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:31,260
They probably didn't want
to make it too easy.

354
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:33,269
- How is it?
- What?

355
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:37,637
- My leg.
- Not bad. Better than I remembered.

356
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,541
- Perhaps the other one needs...
- Oh, no. Never mind. That'll do it.

357
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,908
Thank you.
Help me up.

358
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,649
I was just trying to be friendly.

359
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:49,686
But you never try to be friendly
from a distance.

360
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:54,087
Henri. Henri, one move, and this time
it won't be a vat of dye. It'll be the river.

361
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:56,352
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

362
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,361
I think you would.

363
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,097
Catherine, your lack
of cooperation is amazing.

364
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,969
I'll cooperate by getting the map
and finding out where we are.

365
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,974
<i>Who put us on the river</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

366
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:15,136
I knew you were going to say that.
You're tiresome.

367
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:18,648
You're subnormal. I don't propose
to argue with you any further.

368
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:22,617
Oh, dear. That darn road doesn't
come within ten kilometers of here.

369
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:25,086
What? Across open country
in that thing?

370
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,487
Oh, it'll just be a little bumpy.
Only for a couple of hours.

371
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:32,324
- We'll make it by 3:00.
- Ha. We won't get there before dark,
if we get there at all.

372
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:35,729
This motorcycle will go anywhere.
If you'll get your pants off that grass...

373
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,597
and help me get it out of the boat,
we'll be on the road in no time.

374
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,602
Pitch dark.

375
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:08,390
Henri, we're lost. Absolutely lost.

376
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:12,265
- Is there a difference?
- Oh, haven't you got a bump of direction?

377
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:14,269
That's the only kind I haven't got.

378
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,897
Well, come on. You drive this thing.
My back hurts. Oh!

379
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:20,909
You're the one who checked out on the
motorcycle. You know what the sergeant said.

380
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:24,140
- Oh, stop being so cute.
I hate you when you're...
- <i>[Traffic Passing Nearby]</i>

381
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:26,205
What's that? Listen.

382
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:39,427
Oh! We must have been driving alongside
that road for the last hour!

383
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,522
- Perhaps they just moved it there.
- Oh, shut up.

384
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,810
Henri, there's a sign back there.
See what it says.

385
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:01,415
- I don't suppose you have a flashlight.
- No, I haven't.

- What does it say?
- I can't see.

00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:15,731
Well, climb up, silly.

389
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,659
You'd better hurry up.
It's starting to rain.

390
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,439
[Groans]

391
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,006
- <i>What does it say?</i>
- Well, I can't tell. It's in German.

392
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,980
Well, move your arm.

393
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,279
Oh. You can
come down now, Henri.

394
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:42,448
- What did it say?
- Never mind. Get in.

395
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,460
- But what did it say?
- "Wet paint."

396
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:46,462
Well, how many miles?

397
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,465
Oh, no, Henri.
No, you don't.

398
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,967
You'll get awful wet if you stay out here.
Come on. Get in the sidecar.

00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:55,471
- I know it. I know it.
- Hurry up.

00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:21,089
All right, Henri.
We're in Bad Nauheim.

- <i>You can come out now.</i>
- You sure?

403
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,597
Yes. I'm sure. And bring my bag.

- What are you talking about?

407
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,576
He wanted to know
if we wanted one room or two.

408
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:44,984
- You told him?
- I told him.

409
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:52,056
- [Groans]
- What's the matter?

410
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:54,562
My back. I think it's broken,
and it's all your fault.

411
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,929
- My fault?
- Yes. If you'd pushed that cow out of the way...

412
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,434
we wouldn't have had to take
the detour that landed us in the brook.

413
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,367
- It was a bull!
- Cow.

414
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:04,373
You told me yourself you couldn't tell
the difference at 20 yards away.

415
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:07,706
I know. But if you can't tell the difference
at 20 yards, it couldn't be a bull.

416
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:10,837
- He would have had horns.
- Oh. Yeah.

417
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:21,784
- Who is it?
- <i>Cinderella.</i>

418

- What do you want?
- <i>My slipper.</i>

419

Well, open the door.

420
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,661
- Well, what do you want?
- You just said that. How's your back?

421
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,763
Oh, it's awful. It hurts.

422
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,774
Get into bed.

423
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:41,436
I will not get into bed.
What do you think you're doing?

424
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:44,105
- And what's all that stuff you've got there?
- I've brought you a drink.

425
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,081
Oh, I thought so. I knew
you'd get up to your old tricks.

426
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,948
And also some liniment
to rub your back. Get into bed.

427
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,791
Oh.

428
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,793
We'll need some water.

429
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,698
Take your shirt off too.

430
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,235
I am not going to
take my shirt off.

431
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:08,566
Well, how am I going to
rub your back through your shirt?

432
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:12,369
You're not going to rub my back through
anything, including my own foolishness.

433
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:14,376
Here. Drink this.

434
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:20,248
- Want some water?
- No. It's good.

Hmm.

Is that stuff any good?

440
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:35,697
Turn over.

Wait a minute!

Ow! Oh. Ooh!

444
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:49,570
Stop bawling. I don't want them
to think we've smuggled a cow in here.

00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:52,740
- Well, it stings.
- That's what it's supposed to do.

446
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:55,307
- Oh.
- Let it soak in for a while.

447
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,487
Now, relax.

448
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,924
Oh! You're dislocating everything!

449
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:07,360
- Oh, relax.
- I hurt further up.

450
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,762
Well, how can I get you
to relax if you won't cooperate?

451
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,291
- You heard what I said. I hurt further up.
- Oh.

452
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:22,173
Mmm. That's better.
Makes me feel sleepy.

453
00:31:22,245 --> 00:31:23,906
Good.

454
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:30,811
Oh, that's nice, Henri.

455
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:36,325
You know, I'm sorry. I thought
when you came in here you were
behaving like a stinker.

456
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:38,451
But you've been a stinker
for so long I just...

457
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,962
I know. I know.
Go to sleep.

458
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,091
- What? With you in the room?
- Well, I can't rub you from the hallway.

459
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,731
If I go to sleep, will you promise
to get right out of here?

460
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,904
- I'll go now.
- Oh, no. It feels good.

461
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,072
Now go to sleep,
and I'll be gone in a minute.

462
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:04,147
Henri, about this mission.

463
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,350
- Never mind.
- <i>Well, I just want to ask a question.</i>

464
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:12,884
- All right. What?
- Is this mission we're on so important?

465
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:18,100
No. Not particularly. But it is to me,
because it's my last assignment for the army.

466
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,962
I'm getting out next week.

467
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:21,969
Oh. I didn't know that.

468
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:27,036
- <i>Then it is important, isn't it?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:32,546
Henri, you know l...

470
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:35,916

00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:58,777
he hasn't much time
before his train leaves.

627
00:46:58,845 --> 00:47:04,112
Yeah. All I wanted to say is that I'm so glad...
so grateful, so full of happiness. Thank you.

628
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,118
- Well...
- Good-bye.

629
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:08,120
- Wait! I want to talk to you.
- He'll miss his train.

630
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:10,918
Yes. I go to Paris.
French Economic Bureau.

631
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,084
I've got my passport and documents
and contract here in my pocket.

632
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,594
- I took them out of your briefcase.
- This wonderful young lady...

633
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,927
- is giving and telling me everything.
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:22,559
So I leave Germany now.

635
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:25,160
I never wanted to be
in the black market.

636
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:31,074
I'm a scientist, and now I will work
for science and for France...

637
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:34,636
and no more like
a thief in the night.

638
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,842
Thank you.
Thank you.

639
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:39,851
Good-bye.

640
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:44,155
Thank you again. Good-bye.

641
00:47:45,225 --> 00:47:48,092
Nice little guy.

642
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:50,095
Mmm.

643
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:02,207
- So you found him.
- I ran smack into him.

644
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:06,439
Someone I knew knew him.
He was very anxious to go, as you heard.

645
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:10,108
- It was easy.
- Yeah. Easy.

646
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:11,844
Yeah. Easy.

647
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:38,373
All right. Go ahead.
Start hollering. Call me names.

648
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:42,108
- [German]
- [German]

649
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:45,583
- [German]
- Just a minute. Do you speak English?

650
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:50,954
- Sure!
- Good. You know, there's nothing
I've ever really wanted in life.

651
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:53,652
Fame, money, position... nothing.

652
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:56,854
Nothing until now.
There's just one thing.

653
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,797
And that is never to see you
again as long as I live.

654
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,801
That was a mean, rotten thing
to say, and l...

655
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,269
Will you get the coffee, please?

656
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:10,037
- That was mean rotten.
- Maybe it was mean rotten,
but it wasn't accidental.

657
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:12,236
Fortunately, I'm getting
out of the army soon.

658
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:16,612
I'm going to be a civilian, so never again
can they order me to associate with you.

659
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,447
What's more, I'm going back
to Heidelberg by train.

660
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,421
You can get some other chump to torture
in that lunatic sidecar of yours.

661
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,620
Aw, Henri, I know why you're mad,
and I don't blame you. I would be too.

662
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,822
I knew it was your last job
in the army, and I just didn't think.

663
00:49:30,897 --> 00:49:34,833
I spoiled it for you. I'd give anything
if I hadn't. I'd cut off my arm, almost.

664
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:38,029
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I like you, Henri. I can't help it. I do.

665
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:41,005
You're stubborn, and you don't know
anything, and you're a fathead.

666
00:49:41,074 --> 00:49:44,976
But I don't want you to go away and
just disappear without saying you'll write...

667
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:47,808
or kick me or use my toothbrush...

668
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,076
- Oh, for heaven's...
- Well, I wouldn't put it past you!

669
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:53,277
- And after all we've been to each other.
- And all we haven't been.

670
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:55,344
- And all we've done together.
- And all...

671
00:49:55,421 --> 00:49:59,016
All we haven't done together.
I know that's not your fault.

672
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,526
It's all mine, and I feel like a...

673
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:06,657
Oh, I'm making a fool of myself. Now,
get outta here, or say something nice!

674
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,634
Oh. Well, I don't know, Catherine. L...

675
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:13,297
Oh, that was nice, Henri.
That was nice. Please say more.

676
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:18,371
Well, if we're gonna get back to Heidelberg
before dark, we'd better be going.

677
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:21,072
- Oh, Henri!
- But, Catherine...

678
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:23,081
- Yes, Henri?
- Just one thing.

679
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:25,481
- What?
- Pay for the coffee.

680
00:50:25,552 --> 00:50:27,486
Yes, Henri.

681
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:51,810
What happened?
What happened?

682
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:56,247
Well, you went to sleep,
so I pulled off the side of the road.

683
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:58,682
- I thought this would be better.
- Thank you.

684
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:02,152
You know, Henri, I've been thinking.
Why do we fight all the time?

685
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:05,782
- You tell me.
- Oh, just sex antagonism, I guess.

686
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:08,019
- What does that mean?
- I don't know exactly...

687
00:51:08,094 --> 00:51:10,961
but I think it means just the opposite
of what it sounds like.

688
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,760
- I can't even think what it sounds like.
- Oh, Henri.

689
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,825
I think it means that we really
like each other but won't admit it.

690
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:20,600
- Listen. I'd like it distinctly understood that l...
- [Motor Revving]

691
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:24,006
- If I weren't so sleepy...
- Don't do it. Go to sleep.

692
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:26,011
I will.

693
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,855
- You all right?
- Sure. Go on back to sleep.

694
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:49,561
- Why are we stopping?
- I want to see a man about a road.
I'll be back in a minute.

695
00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:51,570
Take your time.

696
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:01,580
- [German]
- <i>[Motor Idling]</i>

697
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:06,977
[Motor Revs]

698
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:13,992
[German]

699
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:18,262
Henri! Henri!

700
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:20,993
You know something, Catherine?

701
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,695
I don't mind being
the first one to say it.

702
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,364
I like you very much.

703
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:29,203
As a matter of fact,
I'd miss you if you weren't here.

704
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:31,743
Henri, stop!

705
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:34,473
Come back! Henri!

706
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,248
Oh, no.

707
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:54,596
- Henri!
- Catherine, now that I've
told you how I feel, l...

708
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,760
Oh! My, this is terribly bumpy.

709
00:52:58,037 --> 00:52:59,971
Look out!

710
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:06,207
<i>Catherine.! Catherine.!</i>

711
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:08,440
<i>Catherine, darling.!</i>
<i>Are you all right? Where are you?</i>

712
00:53:08,514 --> 00:53:10,448
Yes. I'm here. I'm coming!

713
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:18,485
<i>I can hear you,</i>
<i>but I can't find you.!</i>

714
00:53:18,558 --> 00:53:20,492
Darling, are you all right?
Where are you?

715
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,687
Here I am, over here.

716
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,993
Oh, there you are.

717
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:31,025
Oh, darling. Thank goodness you're safe.
How did you get out there?

718
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:35,668
Well... Wait a minute. Ooh.

719
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:38,370
I'm all out of breath
from chasing you.

720
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:40,639
- From chasing me?
- Uh-huh.

721
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:43,910
- You mean you weren't on the motorcycle?
- Uh-uh. You were by yourself.

722
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:47,077
- Oh. You got off and left me.
- Henri.

723
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:49,087
- Huh?
- What's all this "darling" business...

724
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:51,282
you were mumbling about
a moment ago?

725
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:54,258
- Darling? Did I say that?
- I heard you.

726
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,386
It's probably fright.
It's only natural that...

727
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:58,521
Did you mean me, Henri?

728
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:01,431
Uh, I think I was
stunned momentarily.

729
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:05,494
Well, maybe you were, but you looked like
you were going to kiss me when you saw me.

730
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:09,632
- I what?
- I wish you had. I've never
been kissed by a Frenchman.

731
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:12,906
Well, there's not...
What's so strange about that?

732
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:15,038
Oh, you know what people say.

733
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:18,277
- Oh, that's nonsense.
- Well, you just hear people talk.

734
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:20,410
We're no different
than anybody else.

735
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:23,717
- Well, I don't know. I've just heard talk.
- That's silly.

736
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,850
Why don't you try it just once,
and let me see?

737
00:54:26,926 --> 00:54:29,861
- Oh, Catherine!
- That's the only way to find out, isn't it?

738
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:33,888
- But I tell you, it's so silly.
- Well, there's no harm in trying, is there?

739
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:37,299
- No. I suppose not.
- Well, all right. Go ahead.

740
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:41,038
- Hmm. Well, are you ready?
- Sure.

741
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,776
- There. You see?
- That was no good. That wasn't
the least bit different.

742
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:52,215
I told you it wasn't going
to be any different.

743
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:55,482
But I thought it'd be better than that.

744
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:58,023
Well, after all, you didn't
give me much of a chance.

745
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,991
- Oh, that wasn't fair, was it?
- What do you expect? Of course it wasn't.

746
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,460
- I really should give you another chance.
- Yes, you ought.

747
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,759
Well, all right.
Go ahead. Try again.

748
00:55:05,832 --> 00:55:08,323
All right.

749
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,335
Here. Come here.

750
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:17,809
Well! That was a little better.

751
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:21,506
Certainly. You see? It could have been
even better if I'd had some cooperation.

752
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:24,015
If I'd had a French girl,
it would have been fine.

753
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,210
Wait. What did you mean
by that remark?

754
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,482
Well, you haven't been
giving me much help.

755
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:32,149
- Oh. And you think a French
girl could do better?
- Yes. I do.

756
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:34,284
- Do you want to try it again?
- Do you want to try it again?

757
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,262
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.

758
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:41,960
Wait a minute. Lean back.
Are you comfortable?

759
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:43,968
- Yes.
- Good.

760
00:55:45,438 --> 00:55:48,134
Major, we... we want to get married.

761
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,767
Well! When did you reach
that decision?

762
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:53,641
- This afternoon, about 2:30.
- In a haystack.

763
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:55,943
You see, Henri was
on the motorcycle, and l...

764
00:55:56,015 --> 00:55:58,483
Catherine, I don't think the major
would be interested in all the details.

765
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,111
And you two didn't want
to go away together.

766
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:03,747
It would seem your mission
was very successful.

767
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:05,882
- Thank you, Major.
- My congratulations.

768
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,654
- You're the very first to know.
- I guessed as much.

769
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:10,923
Now, as to getting married,
there's one hitch.

770
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,227
- Itch?
- It's probably the haystack. Henri and l...

771
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:15,494
- I don't... I don't...
- I said "hitch."

772
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:18,935
All marriages between American
military personnel and aliens...

773
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:20,996
- and you come under that heading, Captain...
- Ah.

774
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:23,200
Must be approved
by the commanding general.

775
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,471
- Now, there's a set procedure
for that kind of thing.
- Yes, but...

776
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:28,172
- It's only red tape, Henri.
- Well, do you itch, Catherine?

777
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,842
The major said "hitch," Henri. She means
we've got to get a lot of things approved.

778
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:34,250
- Oh.
- Here are the forms
requesting permission to marry.

779
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,254
Fill them out in quadruplicate...

780
00:56:36,322 --> 00:56:38,620
and when you've completed them,
send them to Colonel Bliven's office.

781
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:41,023
- Yes, Major.
- And good luck.

782
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:46,024
- Good-bye, Captain.
- Yes.

783
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:53,063
- Is she always so confusing?
- No. But this is going to be.

784
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,437
- What's the matter?
- Look at all this stuff we've got to fill out.

785
00:56:55,508 --> 00:56:59,877
- She said there was four of them.
- You weren't hearing so good.
She said four of each.

786
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:01,811
- Let's go and get to work.
- Fine.

787
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,008
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

788
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:10,517
- Souvenir.
- You'll end up with a pocketful.

789
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:17,924
Well, this is impossible.

790
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,124
Don't give up now.
We're halfway through.

791
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:23,225
My uncle's politics, aunt's religion,
any warts, any...

792
00:57:23,302 --> 00:57:27,068
By the way, my aunt's name is Fanny.
Would you put that down, please?

793
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:30,734
Any identifying scars
on my second cousin's clavicle?

794
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,509
We'll never get this done. And look at this
silly thing. "Name your father's gender."

795
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:38,482
- No.
- Yeah. It says so. Look.

796
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:42,385
No. "Father's birthplace."
Gender belongs to this question over here.

797
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:45,288
- I thought there was something wrong.
- What an idiot.

798
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,623
- Were you ever captured by Peruvian Indians?
- No. Why?

799
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:51,663
I understand they do a very good job
of shrinking heads.

800
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:54,393
Mmm. Come on.

801
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,901
Come on. Let's take time out.

802
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:03,472
Oh, there are a lot of things
I'd rather do than answer questions.

803
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:06,943
- This, for instance?
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:11,410
Maybe I'd better go back
and see another double feature.

805
00:58:11,484 --> 00:58:13,551
<i>[Catherine]</i>
<i>Oh, no. Come on in.</i>

806
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:15,777
We're still filling out forms.

807
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:18,788
If you find anyone who wants
to fill out forms with me, let me know.

808
00:58:18,856 --> 00:58:20,790
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- Good night.

809
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:22,792
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.

810
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,226
- We gotta get busy.
- Oh.

811
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,594
Why do we have
to go through all this?

812
00:58:27,665 --> 00:58:30,828
It's the army's way of finding out
if you really want to get married.

813
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:33,335
- Well, I know a much better way.
- Henri.

814
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:33,119
[Ringing]

815
00:59:34,531 --> 00:59:37,364
Major Prendergast. Yes.

816
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:41,370
At ease, Gates.
That'll be all right. Well, Gates?

817
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:45,875
I'm sorry to bother you, Major, but we haven't
heard a word about our application.

818
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:49,401
- It's been over a week.
- Your papers must've
bogged down somewhere.

819
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,505
Isn't there something you can do
to hurry them up?

820
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:53,948
He's getting awfully nervous,
and so am I.

821
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:57,977
- I'll see what I can do. I'll let you know.
- Thank you, Major.

822
00:59:58,055 --> 00:59:59,989
- Oh, Gates.
- Yes, Major?

823
01:00:00,057 --> 01:00:03,458
- He <i>is</i> worth waiting for, isn't he?
- Well, he is now.

824
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:06,860
I don't know what he'll be like
by the time I get him.

825
01:00:18,475 --> 01:00:22,002
I can't understand an American
marrying a foreigner she hardly knows.

826
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,013
It's ridiculous and disgraceful.

827
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:28,245
- I just can't see why she wants to.
- You all better get glasses.

828
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,810
Why are you women such pushovers for
this <i>parlez vous</i> hand kissing stuff?

829
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:34,517
Hand kissing?
Why, he does more than that.

830
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:36,821
Why, Catherine told me
he was plumb crazy.

831
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:39,362
Always chasing her
and trying to beat her up.

832
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,024
Why, he left marks
all over her. I saw 'em.

833
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:46,001
- Leave marks on me any time.
I'll bring the stick.
- Oh, it wasn't a stick.

834
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,470
- He kicked her right in the...
- What?

835
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:50,564
- Well, he did.
- Hi, Catherine.

836
01:00:50,641 --> 01:00:52,871
- We were just talking about you, honey.
- I'll bet you were.

837
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:58,838
Oh.

838
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:03,114
Well, say something.
Did you see her?

839
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:06,850
- Don't lose your temper.
The papers are stuck somewhere.
- Stuck, how?

840
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:09,415
Well, bogged down in channels,
lying on someone's desk.

841
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:12,360
- What for?
- Henri, please. I don't know.

842
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:15,364
Well, they let other people get married.
What have they got against you?

843
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:17,992
Against me? It's probably you
they're investigating.

844
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:20,093
- Nonsense. Why should they?
- Henri, please.

845
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,798
- There are other people in the room.
- Why should they investigate me?

846
01:01:22,873 --> 01:01:25,637
Because the American army
is very careful. That's why.

847
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:28,974
American army had better be careful,
or they're not gonna have any
American children soon.

848
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:31,810
- Will you kindly lower your voice?
- I'll do better than that.

849
01:01:31,882 --> 01:01:33,816
I'll take it somewhere else
if it annoys you.

850
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:36,250
Do that, and while you're about it,
go bag your oars.

851
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,016
- "Bag your oars"?
What's that, more army talk?
- Navy.

852
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:41,250
Oh, naval talk.
It sounds like it. Charming.

853
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:43,520
- You make me sick.
- Good.

854
01:01:43,594 --> 01:01:45,585
Henri.

855
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:50,857
Excuse me.

856
01:01:53,337 --> 01:01:56,397
Catherine, let me ask you something
like a brother.

857
01:01:56,473 --> 01:01:59,203
- Do you really wanna marry that phony joker?
- Certainly not.

858
01:01:59,276 --> 01:02:02,268
- You're kidding.
- I hope he chokes. Slowly, very slowly.

859
01:02:02,346 --> 01:02:06,612
That's what I said all along. A girl like you...
you couldn't make a mistake like that.

860
01:02:06,683 --> 01:02:10,517
- Thank heavens for army red tape.
- Oh, don't thank the army.

861
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,680
- You can thank me personally.
- You? Why?

862
01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:15,691
I hid the papers. I knew it was
a cinch you'd change your mind.

863
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:18,751
- You hid the papers?
- That's right. I knew I was doing you a favor.

864
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:21,297
- You hid the papers.
- I put them in the advance file.

865
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:25,461
Don't mind going out on a limb
for a friend. It was taking a chance, sure...

866
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:44,413
Now as to your marriage, you, Catherine,
want me to marry you in my church.

867
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:46,956
- That's right.
- And you, Henri, always promised...

868
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:49,151
the pastor of your parish
that he'd do the job.

869
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:51,558
- Yes.
- I think you'd better have both marriages.

870
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:53,926
- I think he's right.
- Oh, yes, yes.

871
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:56,124
Just a moment.
There's more to it than that.

872
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,863
Under the German law, which is
recognized by the occupying army...

873
01:02:59,937 --> 01:03:03,065
you have to go through a civil ceremony
before the church ceremony.

874
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,472
- Oh?
- So you have to be married first...

875
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:08,170
- by the <i>bürgermeister</i> here in Heidelberg...
- Ah.

876
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:10,736
And then come to me,
and then go to Henri's pastor.

877
01:03:10,814 --> 01:03:13,510
- That makes three times.
- Three?

878
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:17,111
Chaplain, did you know that in China,
the bride and groom just drink tea...

879
01:03:17,187 --> 01:03:20,350
- out of the same bowl, and that's it?
- Are you Chinese, Henri?

880
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:23,188
- Of course I'm not Chinese.
- I didn't think you were. I'm not.

881
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,785
- What brought that up?
- You just said something about drinking tea.

882
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:29,162
- I was telling the chaplain...
- I'll drink tea with you if you want me to.

883
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:32,396
- You do?
- Stop it. Stop it.

884
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:35,802
- Chaplain, perhaps I shouldn't
go through with this.
- You can still say no, Henri.

885
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:39,400
- We'll go to the <i>bürgermeister,</i>
and then come back to you.
- I'll be ready for you any time.

886
01:03:39,476 --> 01:03:42,001
- Thank you.
- Don't pay any attention to her, Chaplain.

887
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,104
- All right.
- Good-bye.

888
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:47,150
- Good-bye.
- <i>Good-bye.</i>

keep thee only unto him
so long as ye both shall live?

01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:17,680
- I will.
- Will you please join right hands?

895
01:04:20,384 --> 01:04:23,319
Henri, will you repeat after me?

896
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:25,753
- I, Henri...
- I, Henri...

897
01:04:25,822 --> 01:04:28,290
- take thee, Catherine...
- take thee, Catherine...

898
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:30,485

Well, you like it?

904
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,655
I like it.

905
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,858
It's been quite a day, hasn't it?

906
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:47,665
We're a lot married,
Henri, three times.

907
01:05:47,738 --> 01:05:49,865
It was worth it.

908
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:54,073
I don't see how we could
ever get a divorce.

909
01:05:54,144 --> 01:05:57,841
It would be something like unwinding
the inside of a golf ball.

910
01:05:57,914 --> 01:06:01,406
- Want some more coffee?
- I just had four cups.

911
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:04,545
- Besides, it keeps me awake.
- Oh.

912
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:10,459
What's the matter?

913
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:13,121
I was just thinking about a friend
of mine on his wedding night.

914
01:06:13,196 --> 01:06:15,130
Oh? What happened?

915
01:06:15,198 --> 01:06:19,294
- Well, you see, he was a...

No, no. Not tonight. No, no. No, no.
[Speaks French]

918
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:50,725
- Tell me about him.
- About what?

919
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:52,735
About your friend
on his wedding night.

920
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:54,930
Oh. I'm not so sure
I can tell you that.

921
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:58,406
- Oh, of course you can, Henri.
- That's right. I can now, can't I?

922
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:00,739
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, here's what happened...

923
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:03,245
<i>[Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

924
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:07,709
This is just like my friend's story.

925
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,493
- Now what?
- Hi. Can I come in?

926
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,257
- Well, you're in.
- I didn't wanna come, but I have to...

927
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,321
- <i>[Henri] Then go away.</i>
- <i>But</i>...

928
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:25,266
Kitty, what on earth are you doing here?
I thought you'd gone back.

929
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:27,803
Of all the times to...
Well, what do you want, anyway?

930
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,305
- Well, I certainly didn't wanna come here.
- Then go away.

931
01:07:30,373 --> 01:07:32,705
I've got something to tell you first,
and you're not going to like it.

932
01:07:32,776 --> 01:07:34,835
- What is it?
- I've just been on the phone.

933
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:37,607
The colonel gave orders you're
to leave for Heidelberg in 20 minutes.

934
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:41,310
- You're kidding.
- The whole outfit's been alerted
to go back to America.

935
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:44,251
- To America? Well, they're
not going right away.
- Well, I don't know.

936
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:46,255
Then we don't have
to leave tonight.

937
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:48,518
Maybe you don't, but Catherine does.
Those are orders.

938
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:50,890
- When do I have to report?
- Not until morning.

939
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:53,555
Then we stay here tonight, and fly back
and report in the morning.

940
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,463
- Orders.
- You could tell the colonel
you couldn't find us.

941
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:59,661
He beat you to it. He said if I tried
to pull that one, we'd both be sorry.

942
01:07:59,736 --> 01:08:01,601
- Oh!
- Cathy, I'm in a spot. So are you.

943
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:05,630
You've got to get working on Henri's passport,
or he won't be able to sail with you.

944
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:07,836
Henri, we're dead.

945
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:10,106
Well, this is a fine wedding night!

946
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,206
You can find a place to stay
in Heidelberg. It's better than nothing.

947
01:08:13,283 --> 01:08:17,185
- What do you mean, nothing?
- You better start packing.
You've only got 20 minutes.

948
01:08:17,254 --> 01:08:21,156
- How do we get back from here?
- Plane to Frankfurt. There'll be a jeep there.

949
01:08:21,224 --> 01:08:25,354
- See you later.
- Orders are I'm to stick with you
until you get to Heidelberg.

950
01:08:25,428 --> 01:08:28,192
- Orders.
- Orders? Uh...

951
01:08:29,766 --> 01:08:32,735
Orders.

952
01:08:32,802 --> 01:08:35,771
They wouldn't do this
in the French army.

953
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:37,830
Poor Henri.

954
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:56,921
- Uh-oh. Want me to wait for you?
- What do you mean, wait?

955
01:08:56,993 --> 01:08:59,962
- What, all night?
- I don't think it's going to be that long.

956
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:03,966
Uh... What kind of trouble
are you dreaming up now?

957
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:06,798
I just noticed where you're going.
It says "B.O. Q"

958
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:09,430
- Oh, no.
- That means bachelor
officers' quarters, Henri.

959
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:13,772
I don't care what it means.
That is where I live, and that's
where I'm going to take my wife.

960
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:15,777
But it's against regulations.

961
01:09:15,845 --> 01:09:18,609
Who cares anything about regulations
at a time like this?

962
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:22,675
Besides, I know the sergeant
on the desk, and he always looks the...

963
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:26,782
He's a very nice fellow.
Comes from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

964
01:09:26,856 --> 01:09:29,723
Driver, please take Lieutenant
Lawrence home. Good night, Kitty.

965
01:09:29,793 --> 01:09:31,727
- Good night, Henri.
- Come along, Catherine.

966
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:33,490
- But, Henri, l...
- Now, please.

967
01:09:33,563 --> 01:09:35,554
- Good night, Kitty.
- Good night, Catherine.

968
01:09:35,632 --> 01:09:38,829
- Hope it works.
- Leave it to me.

01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:41,530

01:09:42,973 --> 01:09:45,168
<i>[Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

971
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:52,680
- It's just us, Kitty.
- Shh!

972
01:09:52,748 --> 01:09:56,149
- B.O. Q means bachelor officers' quarters.
- I told you it did...

973
01:09:56,218 --> 01:09:58,914
And after that, we went to six hotels.
They're all against...

974
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:01,786
No military personnel...
What's the matter with you?

975
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:04,826
Billings is on the couch, and Thompson
and Kay are in the bedroom.

976
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:06,758
- What are they doing here?
- Sleeping.

977
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:08,888
- Oh, no.
- Come on, Catherine.

978
01:10:08,964 --> 01:10:11,933
- Where, Henri?
- I don't know, but since
the beginning of the world...

979
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:15,596
man has always found a place
for his mate, even if it was a cave.

980
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:17,935
Well, tonight mankind's a flop.

981
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:21,135
You haven't got a cave.
You haven't even got a bed.

982
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,543
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and it's my wedding night...

983
01:10:24,613 --> 01:10:28,105
and my feet hurt,
and I couldn't walk another step.

984
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:31,050
Yes, darling, yes.
Well, do you want to sleep here?

985
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,580
No. I mean, yes, but I want you
to sleep here too.

986
01:10:35,658 --> 01:10:39,458
Well, you can bunk up with me,
and he can sleep in the bathroom.

987
01:10:39,528 --> 01:10:41,621
- Sitting up?
- It's not so bad.

988
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:44,825
- I slept in a bathtub once.
- On your wedding night?

989
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,961
No. I'll get you some blankets
and a pillow.

990
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:52,235
Come along.

991
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:54,867
Oh, Henri, how could it
turn out like this?

992
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:57,173
I'd always planned us
to have a wonderful...

993
01:10:57,246 --> 01:10:59,237
I know. I know, darling.
Come on.

994
01:11:11,493 --> 01:11:14,485
There's the bathroom there.

995
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:16,588
Good night, Henri.

996
01:11:16,665 --> 01:11:20,499
- Here's your pillow and blankets.
- Good night, dear. Good night.

997
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:25,071
Oh, everything's wrong.

998
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:29,201
Now I can't wear my new nightgown.
There isn't even any rice...

999
01:11:29,278 --> 01:11:32,475
- Maybe Kitty has some mothballs.
- Good night, Henri.

1000
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:34,448
I don't think it's funny,
not a bit...

1001
01:11:34,516 --> 01:11:36,916
with me in one room
and you in a bathtub.

1002
01:11:36,986 --> 01:11:40,717
Yes, dear.
Well, never mind.

1003
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:42,723
- Good night, darling.
- Yeah, good night.

1004
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:44,725
And don't cry.
I'll be all right.

1005
01:11:44,793 --> 01:11:47,057
I'll be quite comfortable.

1006
01:11:47,129 --> 01:11:49,791
I'll just turn on the cold water.

1007
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,707
[Sniffles]

1008
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,979

[Sighs]

1011
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:30,503
Hmm.

1012
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:39,443
Oh, come on, Henri. Hurry up.
We've got a lot of things to do.

1013
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:42,540
<i>I am hurrying,</i>
<i>just as fast as I can go.</i>

1014
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:44,847
Well, straighten up.
You look like a question mark.

1015
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:47,387
- Oh! Thank you.
- There. That's better.

1016
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:50,322
[Sighs]
What a place to put a faucet.

1017
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:52,325
- Where?
- In the middle of my back.

1018
01:12:52,393 --> 01:12:54,554
It is unusual.
Well, cheer up, dear.

1019
01:12:54,629 --> 01:12:56,620
At least tonight
you'll have a bed to sleep on.

1020
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:00,327
Well, that's just it.
Catherine, I don't mean to sound cranky...

1021
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:03,393
but this situation is so unnatural.

1022
01:13:03,471 --> 01:13:05,803
I'll be at B.O.Q. And you'll be
sleeping miles away...

1023
01:13:05,873 --> 01:13:07,807
all because
the United States Army...

1024
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,809
We haven't got time
to look for another place today.

1025
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:12,277
We've got to see
the American consul. Come on, silly.

1026
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:17,182
- What are you doing in the gutter?
- Where else would I be?

1027
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,516
Now, I know it's very important
and you're in a hurry...

1028
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:22,613
but it's not gonna be easy.

1029
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:26,456
Take the matter of support. Captain, have
you any money in the United States?

1030
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,927
- No.
- And the laws of your country...

1031
01:13:28,997 --> 01:13:31,761
forbid you taking anything
but a nominal amount with you.

1032
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,767
Yes, I'm afraid that's right.

1033
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:36,326
Then a visitor's visa
would do you no good.

1034
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:39,771
You couldn't take a job.
And unless your wife can prove...

1035
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:43,368
that she's able to support you,
you couldn't get a permanent visa.

1036
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:47,210
Catherine isn't going to support me,
so is there any other kind of visa?

1037
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:49,215
What about the French quota?

1038
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:51,774
The French quota's completely
filled up for this year and next.

1039
01:13:51,853 --> 01:13:54,151
- Well, what'll we do?
- I was wondering...

1040
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,658
if public law 271 would apply.

1041
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:00,592
That's the one regulating
the immigration of war brides.

1042
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,630
Catherine doesn't have to immigrate.
She's an American citizen.

1043
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:06,064
I was thinking of you as the bride.

1044
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:10,002
[Chuckles] That's a pretty good
imagination you have there.

1045
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,835
It says spouses.
Doesn't mention sex.

1046
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,603
I'm convinced the American army
doesn't believe in it.

1047
01:14:15,676 --> 01:14:19,168
This is gonna work.
Yes, I think this is gonna work.

1048
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,114
- Well, sure, it will. Say, this is wonderful.
- What's so wonderful?

1049
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:25,414
It says spouses means mates.
Doesn't say anything about male or female.

1050
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:28,478
- We're mates, aren't we?
- [Chuckles] I really wouldn't know.

1051
01:14:28,556 --> 01:14:31,821
You're a spouse of a member
of the American expedition forces.

1052
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:33,861
Therefore, you're eligible to travel...

1053
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:38,831
- under section 271 as her bride.
- As her bride?

1054
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,834
- No, Henri, please.
- As your bride?

1055
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,836
- Oh, Henri, it'll be fun.
- But isn't it ridic...

1056
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:46,032
Of course it is, darling, but it'll work.
You'll see. It's the only way.

1057
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,234
Here's the application right here.

1058
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:52,609
I am not going to travel as her bride.
And besides, her name's Rochard.

1059
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,673
Excuse me, Captain Rochard,
but officially, it's still Gates.

1060
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:59,379
Not at all.
Officially, it is Rochard.

1061
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,218
- I have three wedding certificates to prove it.
- Henri.

1062
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,281
I don't care.
Rochard. Rochard.

1063
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:07,486
Pay no attention to him, Mr. Jones.
What do we have to do?

1064
01:15:07,562 --> 01:15:11,464
Here you fill out your name, rank,
organization, your wife's maiden name.

1065
01:15:11,532 --> 01:15:14,433
- She hasn't got a wife.
- Just for the time being.

1066
01:15:14,502 --> 01:15:17,630
- Have you got a wife?
- No, dear. But it's only a piece of paper.

1067
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:20,071
- Well, then you...
- Well, obviously these applications...

1068
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,405
are intended for
the husband to fill in.

1069
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:24,240
Oh, well, I can write.
I can write.

1070
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:28,009
- Yes, we know, dear. You can write.
- No, this doesn't apply to you.

1071
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:30,243
You'll just have to make
the proper adjustments.

1072
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,548
- What?
- On these papers.

1073
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,611
- You want to go, don't you?
- What?

1074
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:36,657
I tell you, Henri,
it's the only way.

1075
01:15:36,724 --> 01:15:39,454
Just hand those over to the immigration
officer when you've filled them out.

1076
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,461
- Thank you, Mr. Jones.
- But, Catherine...

1077
01:15:41,529 --> 01:15:43,463
It'll be simple. You'll see.

1078
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:46,500
On the contrary, the process
of turning a man into a woman...

1079
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:49,559
is <i>enormously</i> complicated.

1080
01:15:49,637 --> 01:15:53,403
- But I'll do my best. Thank you. Good day.
- Good day.

1081
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:55,066
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1082
01:15:55,143 --> 01:15:57,202
Just a moment.
Brides first, please.

1083
01:15:57,278 --> 01:16:00,042
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.

1084
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:09,522
Hello, Henri.

1085
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,650
- Well, nothing happened.
- Hasn't it come yet?

1086
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:14,661
I wonder if the application
even arrived.

1087
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:18,358
I handed it to the immigration officer
myself first thing this morning.

1088
01:16:18,432 --> 01:16:21,094
Henri, brace yourself. I'm leaving.

1089
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:24,832
- Our whole outfit leaves tonight.
- Tonight?

1090
01:16:24,906 --> 01:16:26,840
Oh, well, that does it.
We're cooked.

1091
01:16:26,908 --> 01:16:30,969
- The application will come
this afternoon. It's got to.
- It won't. Oh, you'll see.

1092
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,946
You'll go, and I'll sit here
wondering which sex I am.

1093
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:36,882
What a marriage. Solitary confinement.
Separate rooms.

1094
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:38,885
I've never been
so lonely in my life.

1095
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:41,922
- If I have to leave you, I'll shoot myself.
- Shoot me too. I'm...

1096
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:45,288
- I think this is it. It came to the office.
- Thank you, Kitty.

1097
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,385
[Muttering]

1098
01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:51,397
At last.

1099
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:54,662
"Dear madame"?
Oh, yes, that's me.

1100
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,533
"Following application
of your husband..." that's you...

1101
01:16:57,605 --> 01:17:00,005
"you are informed that permission
to enter the United States...

1102
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,304
as a war bride has been granted."

1103
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:04,310
- I gotta get back. I'll see you later.
- Thanks, Kitty.

1104
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:07,779
- I'm so happy. Kiss me.
- We've got time now. That can wait.

1105
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:11,841
- Or maybe it can't.
- Oh, no, darling. No, no, Henri.
Please, the letter.

1106
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:15,355
"Please fill in attached form
and bring to this..."

1107
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,756
Another form.
Will they ever run out of forms?

1108
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:21,260
- Hmm. Hmm.
- [Chuckles]

1109
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,360
I won't. I won't answer
those questions.

1110
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:29,335
- Oh. Well, Henri, this isn't so bad.
- I won't answer those questions.

1111
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:31,337
- You've got to.
- I won't!

1112
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:33,339
- You don't wanna stay, do you?
- No.

1113
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:35,341
- Then you've got to answer them.
- How can I?

1114
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:38,207
You can, Henri, and perhaps the man
at the office will help you.

1115
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:40,941
- It wouldn't be possible.
- Now, please, control yourself
for once and be nice.

1116
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:43,279
- How can you answer a single...
- Everything will be all right.

1117
01:17:43,351 --> 01:17:46,548
Be sure and read them over on the
way down. Good-bye, Henri. Good luck.

1118
01:17:46,921 --> 01:17:50,322
- I tell you, there isn't another form.
- <i>I told you first.</i>

1119
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:53,326
- This form isn't for a man. It's for a woman.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1120
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,955
On the other hand, if you don't get this form
filled out and approved, you can't go.

1121
01:17:57,031 --> 01:18:00,694
- That's right.
- You mean I've got to use this form?

1122
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,599
Sergeant,
I felt the same way you do...

1123
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:06,606
but if that's the only form,
come on, let's fill it out.

1124
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:10,667
Well, let's see. Age and birthplace.
We've got all that.

1125
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:13,145
Well, here's the first one.

1126
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:15,182
Are you an expectant mother?

1127
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,979
Uh-huh.

1128
01:18:18,052 --> 01:18:21,351
Yes. How many months?

1129
01:18:21,422 --> 01:18:23,652
Twenty.

1130
01:18:23,724 --> 01:18:27,626
Twenty. Twenty months.

1131
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:31,187
Any... Any female trouble?

1132
01:18:31,265 --> 01:18:34,701
Nothing but, Sergeant.
[Groans]

1133
01:18:36,037 --> 01:18:40,098
And... have you ever had
any children before?

1134
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,905
Oh, my aching back. You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?

1135
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:46,378
- No, Captain, I don't.
- Oh, Sergeant, you're lucky.

1136
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:48,347
Captain, this doesn't make any sense.

1137
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:51,385
I know, but come on. We gotta
fill it out. Ask me another.

1138
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:53,750
There's some good ones coming up.

1139
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:00,258
<i>[Woman Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention, please. Attention, please.</i>

1140
01:19:00,328 --> 01:19:03,627
<i>Will Mrs. Milton</i>
<i>come to the desk, please.</i>

1141
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,833
You take seat 18
in bus number three.

1142
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,406
All right, Mrs. Rochard...

1143
01:19:15,476 --> 01:19:19,708
- you take seat 19 in bus number three.
- Thank you.

1144
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,978
- Wait a minute! You're not Mrs. Rochard.
- I'm Mr. Rochard.

1145
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:27,043
It's your wife who must report here
for transportation to Bremerhaven.

1146
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:30,989
- According to the war department,
I <i>am</i> my wife.
- You can't be your wife!

1147
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:34,858
If the American army says that I can
be my wife, who am I to dispute them?

1148
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:39,662
- This is all wrong.
- Major, for your information, I am a war bride.

1149
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:42,225
- A war bride?
- Yeah.

1150
01:19:42,303 --> 01:19:44,464
- Well, I'm slightly confused.
- I don't blame you...

1151
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:47,974
but the official wording says
I am "an alien spouse...

1152
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:51,011
"of female military personnel
en route to the United States...

of the congress."

1154
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,847
This is a strange situation,
but I suppose it's perfectly legal.

1155
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:01,649
- Yes, it is.
- Well, um, Mrs. Roch... I mean, Mr. Rochard...

1156
01:20:01,722 --> 01:20:05,658
it won't be necessary
for you to stop at the, uh, nurse's desk.

1157
01:20:05,726 --> 01:20:07,489
- No?
- No.

1158
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:09,529
Oh.

[Baby Crying]

1166
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,430
He's crying, the baby.

1167
01:20:43,497 --> 01:20:47,228
- Is that what he's doing?
- He wants water, yes?

1168
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,067
I wouldn't know, madame. When I want water,
I have a different way of asking for it.

1169
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:55,666
- He is a baby. You are a man.
- Thanks.

1170
01:20:55,743 --> 01:20:58,644
I'll get him some water.
You hold the baby, please.

01:20:58,712 --> 01:21:01,306
- Well, l... No, no, l...
- I'll only be a minute.

- Oh.

- Henri, what a thing to do.
- Where's the mother?

1201
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:52,048
- She went to get more water.
- She ought to get a plumber.

- Henri, you've got to get out of here.
- How can we when we still...

- There's the mother.

talk with another one again as long as I live.

to be a soldier's wife.

I feel the same way.

01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:16,967
three cats, two canaries,
one parrot...

1244
01:25:17,037 --> 01:25:19,130
- Oh, yes, here you are.
- Then me.

1245
01:25:19,206 --> 01:25:23,233
You must have been added later.
One war bride, male.

1246
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:26,211
- Is that you?
- That's me.

1247
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,578
- Well, now, there's a problem.
- Why?

1248
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:31,243
- Because you can't stay here.
- I have to stay here.

1249
01:25:31,318 --> 01:25:33,980
- I am billeted here.
- Well, if you insist.

1250
01:25:34,054 --> 01:25:36,614
But we already have from three
to ten women in every room.

1251
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:40,353
To say nothing of the dogs and cats.
I mean, you can't stay here.

1252
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:44,693
I can't stay here, huh?

1253
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,325
I think the place for you is the officers' billet
in the staging area.

1254
01:25:47,401 --> 01:25:50,529
- It won't be half as interesting.
- It's just down the street...

1255
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,538
the third building on the left.

1256
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:56,770
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1257
01:25:56,844 --> 01:25:58,778
I'm sorry.

1258
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:16,356
- Hello.
- Hello.

1259
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,024
I suppose you wonder
what I want here.

1260
01:26:19,099 --> 01:26:21,226
Well, I will if you want me to.

1261
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:25,864
I'm an alien spouse
of female military personnel...

1262
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:30,467
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.

1263
01:26:30,544 --> 01:26:32,637
- Huh?
- I am a war bride.

1264
01:26:32,713 --> 01:26:36,410
No kiddin'.
That's interesting.

1265
01:26:38,118 --> 01:26:40,916
Would it interest you enough
to give me a bed?

1266
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:43,158
- Oh, you can't sleep here, Mac.
- Why not?

1267
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:45,282
- Are you an American officer?
- No.

1268
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,386
That's why you can't sleep here.
You go to the dependents' hotel.

1269
01:26:48,463 --> 01:26:52,263
I have just come from
the dependents' hotel.

1270
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,267
- You mean the one here in Bremerhaven?
- Mm-hmm.

1271
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,530
I mean the one down
at the staging area.

1272
01:26:56,604 --> 01:26:59,402
I'm afraid I'm much too tired
to walk all that distance.

1273
01:26:59,474 --> 01:27:02,170
Well, suit yourself, Mac,
but you can't sleep here.

1274
01:27:02,243 --> 01:27:05,474
Uh, yeah. Well, there must be a bed
that isn't being used.

1275
01:27:05,547 --> 01:27:08,482
- You must have a bed. Where is it?
- Right across the street.

1276
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:11,519
- Well, uh...
- My wife's in it, and you can't...

1277
01:27:11,586 --> 01:27:15,420
No, no, of course not.
Yes. Quite right. Naturally.

1278
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:18,525
Well, it's...

1279
01:27:20,828 --> 01:27:22,887
Oh, brother.

1280
01:27:25,466 --> 01:27:29,061
- Right down this way.
- This is awfully kind of you, Sergeant.

1281
01:27:29,137 --> 01:27:32,595
I'm a private, mister, but you gotta sleep
somewhere, even if you ain't in the army.

1282
01:27:32,674 --> 01:27:35,108
You won't get into
any trouble, will you?

1283
01:27:35,176 --> 01:27:37,872
What are they gonna do,
bust a private to a civilian?

1284
01:27:37,946 --> 01:27:40,642
- This ain't the Ritz, but it ought to do.
- It's fine.

1285
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:43,411
I'm grateful to find
a friend like you.

1286
01:27:43,484 --> 01:27:46,453
- Tell me, where do you live
in the United States?
- Brooklyn.

1287
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:49,183
- I'll look you up when I get there.
- Get a good sleep.

1288
01:27:49,257 --> 01:27:52,124
Thank you.

1289
01:27:52,193 --> 01:27:54,218
[Sighs]

1290
01:28:04,205 --> 01:28:06,173
Hey. Hey!

1291
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:08,266
- No, no, no, thank you.
- Wake up.

1292
01:28:08,343 --> 01:28:12,439
- No, no, no. Not now, thank you.
- <i>What are you doin'here?</i>

1293
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:14,913
Oh, I had a feeling.

1294
01:28:18,353 --> 01:28:21,186
I am an alien spouse
of female military personnel...

1295
01:28:21,256 --> 01:28:25,124
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.

1296
01:28:25,193 --> 01:28:28,162
Well, why aren't you
at the dependents' hotel?

1297
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,527
I am writing a book about that.

1298
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:33,066
You see, I'm not a woman.

1299
01:28:33,134 --> 01:28:35,967
That's too bad.
But I tell you one thing, friend...

1300
01:28:36,037 --> 01:28:38,562
- You can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.

1301
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,804
You will note, I have not taken
off my clothes in anticipation of that.

1302
01:28:42,877 --> 01:28:45,869
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, but you...

1303
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:47,881
- Can't sleep here.
- That's right.

1304
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:50,008
We're agreed.
Where will I go?

1305
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:52,814
Well, there's only one place left,
and that's a German hotel.

1306
01:28:52,887 --> 01:28:54,878
- But you're a dependent, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

1307
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:57,288
And as a dependent,
you come under military law...

1308
01:28:57,358 --> 01:29:00,259
and all the German hotels
are out of bounds.

1309
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:03,126
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, mister.

1310
01:29:03,197 --> 01:29:05,165
I'm sorry,
but there's an army rule.

1311
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:08,225
- And you can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.

1312
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,467
Beg your pardon.

1313
01:29:16,277 --> 01:29:20,475
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

1314
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:22,675
It's a shame.
Because if we was in Brooklyn...

1315
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,310
you could've slept
with the old man.

1316
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:47,107
Hiya.

1317
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:50,400
Oh. Hi.

1318
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:55,748
- What can I do for you?
- Well, uh...

1319
01:29:55,817 --> 01:29:58,183
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
Can you help me?

1320
01:29:58,252 --> 01:30:00,516
Afraid not. Nothing but women
sleepin' in there.

1321
01:30:00,588 --> 01:30:03,489
Yeah, I know. Building 11.
My wife's in there.

1322
01:30:03,558 --> 01:30:06,459
- A lot of people's wives are in there.
- Yeah.

1323
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:10,486
Have you ever noticed that women always get
a place to sleep? I wonder why that is.

1324
01:30:10,565 --> 01:30:13,227
Well, I suppose it's because
they're the weaker sex.

1325
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:17,032
I don't believe it. I believe
they're stronger. And do you know why?

1326
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,266
Because they get enough sleep,
that's why.

1327
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,934
I am sorry I can't help you.

1328
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:25,342
[Chuckles]
Well, very kind of you, Corporal.

1329
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:27,881
Good night. You from Brooklyn?

1330
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:30,440
Yonkers.

1331
01:30:30,518 --> 01:30:32,543
What are those?

1332
01:30:34,522 --> 01:30:36,820
Good night, buddy.

1333
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:50,598
I am an alien spouse of female military
personnel en route to the United States...

1334
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:53,265
under public law 271
of the congress...

1335
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:55,275
and I've been everywhere in town
looking for a place to sleep.

1336
01:30:55,343 --> 01:30:59,109
You poor man. Well, you can't stay here.
This is a female building.

1337
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,343
It is?
[Mutters]

1338
01:31:02,417 --> 01:31:05,580
Another woman's building.
You know, I've come to the conclusion...

1339
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:07,712
that American men don't sleep.

1340
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:10,553
Well, not in this building.

1341
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,788
I was wondering if there'd be any
objection to my sitting here for a while.

1342
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:16,796
You could sort of imagine
I'm waiting for something.

1343
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,425
Well, it all depends on what
you imagine you're waiting for.

1344
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:23,265
I'm sure I don't want to send you
out on a night like this.

1345
01:31:23,337 --> 01:31:26,500
That's very kind. That's nice.

1346
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:29,975
Tell me, what part of the United States
do you come from?

1347
01:31:30,044 --> 01:31:34,413
- Boston, up in Massachusetts.
- Massachu-chu-chu...

1348
01:31:34,482 --> 01:31:36,814
Right. Is there a place
called Yonkers?

1349
01:31:36,884 --> 01:31:40,421
- Sure. It's in New York.
- Oh. I was wondering.

1350
01:31:40,554 --> 01:31:43,284
Well, I'm...
I'm a little mixed up.

1351
01:31:43,357 --> 01:31:46,520
- May I hold that for you?
- Oh, thanks.

1352
01:31:46,593 --> 01:31:48,686
[Sighs]
You see, I just got married.

1353
01:31:48,762 --> 01:31:50,753
Well, where's your wife?

1354
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:54,130
Oh, she's in another female building.
Building 11.

1355
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:57,693
- And you couldn't find a bed anywhere?
- No... Well, almost.

1356
01:31:57,771 --> 01:31:59,705
There was, uh...
There was one in Brooklyn...

1357
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:02,071
- and another one with a woman in it.
- A woman?

1358
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:04,975
- He was a very disagreeable man.
- Who was?

1359
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:08,674
Her husband. Yeah, it would've been
nicer in Brooklyn.

1360
01:32:08,749 --> 01:32:12,207
- With the husband?
- No. The old man.

1361
01:32:12,286 --> 01:32:14,481
You <i>are</i> tired, aren't you?

1362
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:27,596
- There he is. I'll see you on the boat.
- Okay.

1363
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:29,602
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1364
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:31,729
Pardon me.

1365
01:32:33,707 --> 01:32:36,301
Oh, darling, I was afraid
you'd missed the last bus.

1366
01:32:36,376 --> 01:32:40,005
- Oh, sailor, could you take these bags, please?
- All right.

1367
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,015
Thank you. Henri...
Henri, you look awful.

1368
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,574
- What have you been doing?
- I've been sitting up
all night with a redhead.

1369
01:32:45,652 --> 01:32:47,415
- What?
- Knitting.

1370
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,547
- What?
- You ought to see me purl.

1371
01:32:49,623 --> 01:32:52,490
- Oh, you ought to see her purl.
- What are you talking about?

1372
01:32:52,559 --> 01:32:54,493
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

1373
01:32:54,561 --> 01:32:57,428
<i>Please get on board as soon as possible</i>...
<i>as soon as possible, please.</i>

1374
01:32:57,498 --> 01:32:59,989
- I'd like to show you how to do that sometime.
- We gotta go.

1375
01:33:00,067 --> 01:33:01,591
- Got your papers?
- What?

1376
01:33:01,668 --> 01:33:03,602
- Have you got your papers?
- They're right there.

1377
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,900
Listen, darling. All we have to do
is get aboard the ship.

1378
01:33:05,973 --> 01:33:08,965
Remember, no back talk, no argument.
Just keep your temper. Promise?

1379
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:11,237
- I promise.
- All right. Come on.

1380
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:14,109
<i>You've been to the navy personnel.</i>
<i>They'll clear you through.</i>

1381
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:16,081
Here's your boarding card.

1382
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:19,277
Your orders, please, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

1383
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:22,550
- Lieutenant Gates.
- Right.

1384
01:33:22,623 --> 01:33:24,716
- Here's your boarding card, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

1385
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:26,725
- Surely.
- What do you want, mister?

1386
01:33:26,793 --> 01:33:31,253
- I want to go aboard.
- I'm sorry. This ship is
for war brides and a few...

1387
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:35,461
I know. I know, Sergeant.
Here are my orders.

1388
01:33:35,536 --> 01:33:37,936
Have you got a Rochard
on your list?

1389
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:40,565
- Yeah, a Mrs. Henri Rochard.
- That's me.

1390
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:42,836
- You're not a woman.
- We don't want you. We want your wife.

1391
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,743
You can't have my wife.
That's one thing I'm particular about.

1392
01:33:45,812 --> 01:33:48,804
- Henri.
- Oh, yes, Catherine, I'll remember.

1393
01:33:48,882 --> 01:33:52,716
There's been a slight misunderstanding,
gentlemen. My name is Henri Rochard.

1394
01:33:52,786 --> 01:33:55,311
Henri. Have you ever heard
of a woman called Henri?

1395
01:33:55,389 --> 01:33:58,119
I'm tryin' to think.
You know a lot of dames, Sam.

1396
01:33:58,191 --> 01:34:00,989
- I know a Billie.
- I don't know any. Maybe he's right.

1397
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:03,188
- You see, I am a war bride.
- What?

1398
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,424
- This is my wife.
- [Both] Oh.

1399
01:34:05,499 --> 01:34:08,491
It's a very natural mistake.
You're not the first to have made it.

1400
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:10,628
Now, if my papers are in order,
may I go aboard?

1401
01:34:10,704 --> 01:34:13,571
I guess we'll have
to let him go on.

1402
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,165
- Here's your boarding card.
- Thank you. Good day.

1403
01:34:16,243 --> 01:34:18,006
- Good day.
- Good day.

1404
01:34:18,078 --> 01:34:20,012
You were wonderful, Henri.

1405
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,241
I knew if you kept your temper,
everything would be all right.

1406
01:34:22,316 --> 01:34:24,648
- I thought I behaved quite well.
- Oh, you did.

1407
01:34:24,718 --> 01:34:27,778
May I see your orders, please?

1408
01:34:27,854 --> 01:34:30,948
- Stateroom B-14, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

1409
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,993
How'd you get up here? This ship is
for war brides and military personnel.

1410
01:34:37,064 --> 01:34:39,532
Yes, yes, I know.
My name is Rochard.

1411
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,091
You'll think I'm a bride,
but actually, I'm a husband.

1412
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:44,103
There'll be a moment
or two of confusion...

1413
01:34:44,171 --> 01:34:48,471
- but if we all keep our heads,
everything will be fine.
- I don't think it will.

1414
01:34:48,542 --> 01:34:51,409
- I've got a Mrs. "Rotcherd" on my list.
- Rochard!

1415
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:54,345
She's in A-88 with two other brides
and three children.

1416
01:34:54,414 --> 01:34:58,145
- Oh, well, that, of course,
will have to be altered.
- Not by me it won't.

1417
01:34:58,218 --> 01:35:00,482
I have just explained everything
to the army.

1418
01:35:00,554 --> 01:35:02,545
They understood.
They passed me.

1419
01:35:02,623 --> 01:35:04,557
The army understood,
and they passed you.

1420
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,684
Oh, that's fine.
That's just dandy.

1421
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,820
Did you hear that? The army understood,
and they passed him.

1422
01:35:09,896 --> 01:35:11,830
This is the navy, bud.

1423
01:35:11,898 --> 01:35:15,527
- My friend, I have had weeks of
the United States Army, and...
- Henri.

1424
01:35:15,602 --> 01:35:18,833
And I'm quite prepared
to take on the United States Navy.

1425
01:35:18,905 --> 01:35:23,069
And the United States Navy's
quite prepared to take you on, mister.

1426
01:35:23,143 --> 01:35:25,236
Hey, fellas,
get this guy out of here.

1427
01:35:25,312 --> 01:35:27,712
Just a minute. Have you heard
of a woman called Henri?

1428
01:35:27,781 --> 01:35:31,308
Yeah. Henrietta. Powell Street.
San Francisco. Take him.

1429
01:35:31,385 --> 01:35:34,115
- No, no, no. No. Never mind. Never mind.
- Get goin'.

1430
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,281
All right, I'm going.
Just go on about your business.

1431
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:47,024
Henri, you shouldn't have lost
your temper. Where are you going?

1432
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,295
I'm going someplace to change
back into a man.

1433
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:53,135
- I'm tired of being my own wife.
- You can't give up now.

1434
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:55,674
- Well, make them give up. Someone has to.
- Listen, will you?

1435
01:35:55,742 --> 01:35:58,836
Once on board that ship, everything
will be over, and you'll be a man forever.

1436
01:35:58,912 --> 01:36:01,244
- Now, it's worth a try, isn't it, darling?
- How can we?

1437
01:36:01,314 --> 01:36:04,181
- Well, Henri, I don't know...
- Lieutenant, would you take this bag for me?

1438
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:08,153
- I left something on the bus.
- I'll have someone put it
in the mess hall for you.

1439
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,314
- Now, what were you saying?
- Henri, do you love me?

1440
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:13,484
- Of course I love you.
- And you'll make one more try
to get aboard that boat?

1441
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,494
- If you say so.
- You promise?

1442
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:17,496
- I promise.
- And you'll keep it?

1443
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:19,498
- I promised, didn't I?
- All right. Come on.

1444
01:36:20,767 --> 01:36:22,860
Here. Hold these.

1445
01:36:22,936 --> 01:36:24,767
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

1446
01:36:24,838 --> 01:36:28,934
Nah, that won't do.
Oh, here's a better one here.

1447
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:31,102
Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella.

1448
01:36:31,178 --> 01:36:33,408
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Henri. Lean down.

1449
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,813
Lean down close. I wanna
see somethin'. Uh-huh. That goes perfect.

1450
01:36:36,883 --> 01:36:38,817
- With what?
- Give me your knife.

1451
01:36:38,885 --> 01:36:40,819
You're not going to...
I won't do it.

1452
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:43,355
- This will make a perfectly good wig.
- I won't do it.

1453
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:46,017
- And we've got the clothes right here.
- Catherine, I will not do it.

1454
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:48,357
- But, Henri, you said you loved me.
- Well, I'm not so sure now.

1455
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:51,920
- And you promised. Give me your knife.
- <i>[Ship Whistle Blows]</i>

1456
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:55,092
Come on, Henri.
There's not much time.

1457
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,463
This is ridiculous.

1458
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,407
Catherine, can't you at least
cut it off the mane?

1459
01:37:03,477 --> 01:37:05,604
Henri, you're taking this
much too personally.

1460
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,115
Now, stand so no one
can see what I'm doing.

1461
01:37:25,432 --> 01:37:27,627
Mmm, a little tough.

1462
01:37:28,935 --> 01:37:32,393
Hmm. Won't be so bad
when I get your bangs rolled.

1463
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,906
Wanna see what you look like?

1464
01:37:37,077 --> 01:37:39,011
Horrible.

1465
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:41,547
I don't think I'll be called
upon to defend my honor.

1466
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:44,106
- I doubt it.
- It's a pity.

1467
01:37:44,184 --> 01:37:47,278
- I wonder if some lipstick would help.
- Oh, no.

1468
01:37:47,354 --> 01:37:50,812
- Well, why not?
- I'm more the outdoor type.

1469
01:37:50,891 --> 01:37:53,451
Sea Biscuit. Bang Tail.
You know?

1470
01:37:53,527 --> 01:37:56,860
Oh, silly, hold still.
Let me roll these.

1471
01:38:06,706 --> 01:38:09,504
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot somethin'.
Can you talk like a woman?

1472
01:38:09,576 --> 01:38:12,136
- [High-pitched] You mean like this?
- Can't you do better than that?

1473
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:15,340
- [Own Voice] No.
- Just remember... Keep your
mouth closed. Not a word.

1474
01:38:15,415 --> 01:38:18,748
Leave everything to me.
And keep your head down.

1475
01:38:22,155 --> 01:38:24,749
Oh, sailor, would you put this
in the mess hall for me, please?

1476
01:38:24,825 --> 01:38:26,884
- Sure, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

1477
01:38:27,894 --> 01:38:32,024
- Wait a moment.
- [Wolf Whistle]

1478
01:38:32,098 --> 01:38:34,566
Hey, did you hear that?
I must look pretty good.

1479
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:36,761
- Don't be silly. That was for me.
- For you?

1480
01:38:36,837 --> 01:38:38,805
- Of course.
- I ought to punch him in the nose.

1481
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:42,672
- Henri, remember, you're a lady.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1482
01:38:47,647 --> 01:38:51,913
- We have our boarding cards.
We've been up before.
- Go ahead.

1483
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:57,114
I don't remember
that tall one, Sam.

1484
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:01,092
- It's hard to believe you could
forget a face like that.
- Yeah.

1485
01:39:02,662 --> 01:39:05,153
Lieutenant Gates. B-14.
I was up before.

1486
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:08,065
Oh, yes. Your orders, please.

1487
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:12,661
Say, that's funny. Rochard.

1488
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:15,139
Why aren't you listed among
the military personnel, Lieutenant?

1489
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:18,143
Save your voice. You'll have to
excuse her. She has laryngitis.

1490
01:39:18,211 --> 01:39:21,203
- Now, what were you saying?
- Why isn't the lieutenant
listed among military personnel?

1491
01:39:21,281 --> 01:39:24,808
- Well, you see, she was just married.
- Married? That may be, but...

1492
01:39:24,885 --> 01:39:27,979
Hey, Red. Come here.

1493
01:39:28,054 --> 01:39:32,753
- What's the trouble?
- This lieutenant is listed as a missus.

1494
01:39:32,826 --> 01:39:35,920
Why'd they put you
down as mi...

1495
01:39:35,996 --> 01:39:38,931
How do you do?

1496
01:39:38,999 --> 01:39:43,129
- Why'd they put you down as
missus instead of lieutenant?
- She has laryngitis.

1497
01:39:43,203 --> 01:39:46,195
They possibly didn't list her
as lieutenant because of her husband.

1498
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,935
- Who'd she marry?
- Admiral Rochard.

1499
01:39:49,009 --> 01:39:51,443
- Who?
- Admiral Rochard.

1500
01:39:51,511 --> 01:39:54,139
The name is familiar, but I don't remember it
connected with an admiral.

1501
01:39:54,214 --> 01:39:56,705
You never heard of her husband?
He won't like that.

1502
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,842
Florence, if I were you,
I wouldn't say a word about this.

1503
01:39:58,919 --> 01:40:01,649
Sure. You heard of him, Red.
Admiral Rochard. Sure.

1504
01:40:01,721 --> 01:40:04,087
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe I have. All right.

1505
01:40:04,157 --> 01:40:07,320
- Stateroom A-88, Lieutenant.
- Get your instructions in the mess hall.

1506
01:40:07,394 --> 01:40:10,192
Thanks so much.
Come, Florence.

1507
01:40:15,068 --> 01:40:17,832
First time I ever felt sorry
for an admiral.

1508
01:40:17,904 --> 01:40:19,997
Gams aren't bad.

1509
01:40:20,073 --> 01:40:23,338
Now I'm beginning
to feel sorry for you.

1510
01:40:26,913 --> 01:40:29,040
- In here, please.
- We were just going...

1511
01:40:29,115 --> 01:40:33,313
- Please, Lieutenant. Your instructions first.
- Come on, Florence.

1512
01:40:34,788 --> 01:40:37,951
- I don't like that name Florence.
- Oh, shut up.

1513
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:40,926
- Kitty.
- I've been waiting...

1514
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:43,792
- Shh.
- Oh, no.

1515
01:40:43,863 --> 01:40:46,263
Stand on the other side
so they can't see so well.

1516
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:49,166
This was the only way.
They wouldn't let him... Henri, duck down.

1517
01:40:49,235 --> 01:40:51,795
- I can hear quite well.
- You're too tall. Duck down.

1518
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,499
- He looks awful.
- I didn't have much to work with.

1519
01:40:54,574 --> 01:40:57,270
I don't see how I could get him aboard.
You got a room where we can put him?

1520
01:40:57,344 --> 01:40:59,437
I've got a room, but they wouldn't
let a thing like that in.

1521
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:02,208
We gotta hide him somewhere till we can
change his clothes and the boat sails.

1522
01:41:02,282 --> 01:41:04,807
- What about the linen...
- No, and the men's room won't do either.

1523
01:41:04,884 --> 01:41:07,011
- Somebody's spotted him already.
- What?

1524
01:41:07,087 --> 01:41:11,456
We need a nurse. It's an emergency.
Will you come with me, please?

1525
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:14,493
- I'm a nurse?
- Come along, please.

1526
01:41:14,561 --> 01:41:16,495
I hadn't counted on this.

<i>[Ship Whistle Blows]</i>

1528
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:31,940
- It's very lucky they found a nurse.
- What's the matter?

1529
01:41:32,012 --> 01:41:35,846
- My wife's expectin' a baby.
- What? Oh, no!

1530
01:41:35,915 --> 01:41:40,579
- No. It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- You can say that again.

1531
01:41:40,653 --> 01:41:43,520
- It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- No. No, it isn't.

1532
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:46,889
No. Oh, gee. I wonder if the baby
will be a girl.

1533
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,724
- I'll be grateful if it's a baby.
- You will?

1534
01:41:49,796 --> 01:41:53,027
Oh, you're very kind.

1535
01:41:53,099 --> 01:41:55,397
Gosh, l... I wish I knew
what was going on in there.

1536
01:41:55,468 --> 01:41:58,926
- Oh, you won't have long to wait.
- I won't?

1537
01:41:59,005 --> 01:42:02,668
Oh, gee whiz. Gosh, l... I don't think
I can stand this.

1538
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:05,006
- You got a bigger shock coming.
- I have?

1539
01:42:05,078 --> 01:42:07,046
Mm-hmm.

1540
01:42:07,113 --> 01:42:09,240
- The lieutenant got a little dizzy.
- Thank you.

1541
01:42:09,315 --> 01:42:12,648
- I'll take care of her.
I'll get you some water, dear.
- Pardon me.

01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,984

01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,594
Well, if it isn't Florence, huh?

1547
01:42:32,405 --> 01:42:34,669
Arrest that man.

1548
01:42:34,741 --> 01:42:37,869
- It's all right, Henri. The ship has sailed.
- Hmm?

1549
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:40,538
Come along. Come on, Flo.

1550
01:43:00,266 --> 01:43:02,131
Florence.

1551
01:43:18,284 --> 01:43:20,411
Mr. Rochard, may we come in?

1552
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:25,550
I don't see how I can stop you.
The key's on the outside.

1553
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:28,992
Thank you. Henri, this is Lieutenant Perkins
and Commander Willis.

1554
01:43:29,062 --> 01:43:30,996
The commander's the chaplain.

1555
01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:34,227
Chaplain? Oh, no, no.
No, nothin' doing. I'm sorry, Chaplain.

1556
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,064
- Nothing doing what?
- No more marriages. It isn't worth it.

1557
01:43:37,137 --> 01:43:39,628
- I'm not gonna marry her again, Chaplain.
- Why, Henri.

1558
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:43,540
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We've got the whole thing straightened out.

1559
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:46,807
I'm sorry about the mix-up, sir,
but your case was a little unusual.

1560
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,678
You see, you're an alien spouse
of female military personnel...

1561
01:43:49,749 --> 01:43:53,879
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.

1562
01:43:53,953 --> 01:43:56,319
- Am I now?
- Yes, and under the circumstances...

1563
01:43:56,389 --> 01:43:59,290
- the captain would like
to forget the whole thing.
- [Chuckles]

1564
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:01,759
Don't you understand, dear?
You're free. You can go now.

1565
01:44:01,828 --> 01:44:03,762
- Where?
- Anywhere on the ship.

1566
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,424
We've got you bunked in with one
of the officers. He doesn't mind.

1567
01:44:06,499 --> 01:44:09,559
I think he would mind.
He wouldn't like that at all.

1568
01:44:09,636 --> 01:44:12,764
- You see, I snore terribly.
- Why, Henri, you don't snore.

1569
01:44:12,839 --> 01:44:14,773
- How would you know I don't?
- Oh.

1570
01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:18,902
Couldn't we do something simple?
Couldn't I just stay here?

1571
01:44:18,978 --> 01:44:21,742
- Well, l... I suppose that...
- I don't see why not.

1572
01:44:21,814 --> 01:44:24,374
Well, thank you. That's very nice.
You've been a great help.

1573
01:44:24,450 --> 01:44:27,942
Good night.
Thank you very much.

1574
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:30,216
All right.

1575
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,551
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,331
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

1577
01:44:47,407 --> 01:44:49,739
I believe you would.

1578
01:44:53,346 --> 01:44:56,509
Henri, how will we ever
get out of here?

1579
01:44:56,583 --> 01:45:01,953
I'm not gonna worry about that until
the Statue of Liberty goes by that porthole.
