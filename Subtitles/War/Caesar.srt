00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,590
JULES CÉSAR

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,070
Citizens of Rome Gather round.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,230
Welcome to Gordias. Now Gordias 
was famous for his knot.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,077
The oracles predicted that who 
could untie the knot...

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,393
would conquer the whole world.´

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,439
Many came from far and wide but 
none succeeded,

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,235
until one day the mighty Alexander 
arrived

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,958
Alexander, Decended from the mighty 
God Apollo.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,951
Advance !

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,154
Apollo enlightened Alexander 

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,149
and showed
him how to untie the knot.

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,599
Sylla has returned to Rome to 
establish order.

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,878
He declares that the innocents
have no reason to fear.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,029
But that those guilty of crimes against 
him shall be most severly punished.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,435
The men whose names are written on 
these lists are declared outlaws.

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,433
They have no rights as citizens

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,711
enseforth they may be killed on sight

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,631
Anyone who takes it upon himself to 
kill any of these men...

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,270
will be considered a friend of the state..

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,112
and shall be rewarded with the properties 
and posessions these outlaws leave behind.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,234
The biggest crime under Roman law.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,512
Mother?
- Cornelia?

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,632
Mother?

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,956
Where is my wife?
- at her fathers.

25
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,233
Grandmother The soldiers are comming
- Julia stay with her.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,230
Sulla has taken the city with his army

27
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,034
He has made lists hundreds of people are on them

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,039
Are you?
- No my wife's father is. 

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,476
Julia stay in the house.

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,713
Don't go.
- Father where are you going?

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,190
To get your mother.

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,112
Is he not on the list?

33
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,988
He's the one you want overthere.
- Right.

34
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,548
Have you heard?
- Yes we have to hurry.

35
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,832
What's the point running away 
might as well die right here.

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,829
Please go.
- - She's right Cinna We must leave now.

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,359
Cinna hurry.

38
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,590
Go.
- Please, father.

39
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,559
Go Hurry!

40
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,990
Go.!

41
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,230
Please Cornelia, run !

42
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,471
He has helped Cinna to escape

43
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,589
Give me your name.

44
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,638
It's Caesar, from the house of Julia.

45
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,832
Arrest him.

46
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,236
No please no !

47
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,875
Are you Julius Caesar?
-Yes.

48
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,435
This way....

49
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,755
This way.

50
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,515
That is not negotiable.

51
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,839
Who is he ?

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,598
Julius Caesar.

53
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,472
Nephew to Marius...

54
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,678
You have unfortunate ancestery.


55
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,470
If you think it's unfortunate 
to be descendent from the Gods.

56
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,311
Which God is that?
- The Julia descendent from Aeneas,

57
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,479
Who was...
- The son of Vénus, yes yes.

58
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,194
I recall Marius making such claims.

59
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,592
There are many people these days who 
claim to be descendents from the Gods.

60
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,270
We have a crest which proves it..

61
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,798
I believe you can have them 
fashioned in the market place...

62
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,590
...for a couple of dinars.

63
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,155
Why did you ask to see me ?

64
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,830
Your mother...
She came to see me.

65
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,830
Did she ask you to spare my life ?
And what you agreed ?

66
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,389
Well I promised that I would consider it.

67
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,559
And I'm supposed to be grateful to you ?
- No.

68
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,959
To you we are old friends.
- You killed a lot of old friends...

69
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,310
True, true true.

70
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,871
Old friends of the day become
fresh enemies at night.


71
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,033
What do you want in
exchange for my life ?

72
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,593
Why do you think I want anything in Exchange ?


73
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,270
And like you don't give things
away for free.

74
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,792
I'm not a man without compassion.
I will help you if I can.

75
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,637
First you must understand the 
gravity of the crime.

76
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,549
Cinna was my greatest enemy.
And you helped him to escape.

77
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,189
Did he?

78
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,788
Of course not.

79
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,400
He escaped my soldiers only to be
killed by one of his servants.


80
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,715
My wife ?
- She's well.

81
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,756
I leave women to their health.

82
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,238
And since you are only the son of
Cinna by marriage,

83
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,476
I intend to leave you to yours.

84
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,995
If... ?

85
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,357
If you divorce your wife.

86
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,439
Well ?

87
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,796
No I refuse.
- You refuse to devorce your wife

88
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,798
Even though it may cost you your life ?

89
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,230
My wife is my teacher.

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,392
She's more clever than I am She's 
more honest than I am,


91
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,831
She's a more compelling argument
than I am or you are.

92
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,912
Or your office is.

93
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,311
I won't devorce her.

94
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,837
That Is my answer.
- Ah, Pompée...

95
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,314
What can we do with men such as this ?

96
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,195
I don't know wether to embrace 
him or strangle him.

97
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,154
I think we should let hin go.
- What ?

98
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,119
His uncle Marius
was my greatest enemy.

99
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,915
He got ten Marius inside him.
Look at his eyes.

100
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,999
You want to let him go ?

101
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,558
It's the ones who smile and flatter
you should worry about.

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,990
He speaks plainly.

103
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,316
You speak plainly don't you ?

104
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,318
Always.

105
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,238
Tell me...

106
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,712
Would you kill me if you could ?

107
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,273
In an instant.

108
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,999
You can go.

109
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,673
I said you are free to go.

110
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,277
What a big heart that boy has.

111
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,708
Bring it to me in the morning.

112
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,757
Was this Sylla's plan to slaughter me outside 
so I wouldnt foul the carpet with my blood ?

113
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,508
I came to warn you.
- Why?

114
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,514
Because if you don't leave Rome
I'll have to do as he asks.

115
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,830
And ?

116
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,196
And I don't want to see men like 
you die young..

117
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,671
What do you know about me ?
- You refuse  Sylla.

118
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,515
I'll tell you more some day 
when there is time.

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,836
But now you must leave Rome.

120
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,232
Your family will be safe, 
here take this.

121
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,231
Go east to Bythinie. Show this ring to 
Nicomède, it will keep you safe in his service.

122
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,430
How do I know I can trust you ?
- You don't.

123
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,755
I'll not hand my fate over to that man.

124
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,632
So you'd let him kill you ?

125
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,235
He can try if he wants,
I'm not leaving Rome.

126
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,192
Why must you be so stubborn !

127
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,318
Pompée himself offers you help.
Why don't you accept it?

128
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,319
He's Sylla's man,
it could be a trick.

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,350
Don't you trust anybody at all ?
- yes.

130
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,632
I trust you.
- Then listen to me.

131
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,870
You're not the heaven and earth.
You're just a man.

132
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,233
And some things are bigger 
than you are.

133
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,510
When you were in jail...

134
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,156
...I thought you were dead.

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,600
I started to grieve your death.

136
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,959
I'm asking you to spare me that, Caésar.

137
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,953
How can I live with myself if I knew 
I had one chance to save your life.

138
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,673
And I failed

139
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,750
Is this pig for sale ?
- How much will you give me for it ?

140
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,958
Ten dinars.
- That's good money for a swine.

141
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,237
He requires carving.

142
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,593
Jules César.

143
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,518
We will feed it to my dogs.

144
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,070
That's the coast of Crête.

145
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,831
The ruler there used to make up laws


146
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
and hang them so high
that people couldn't read them.

147
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,110
And if they broke the law he'd 
show then no mercy.

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,154
Today the shores are infected 
by pirates pirates.

149
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,071
We need to anchore for the night.

150
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,792
Where has father gone ?

151
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,957
The other side of the water.

152
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,113
How long does it take to cross the water ?

153
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,238
It depends on the wind.

154
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,276
Sometimes you can cross it in days.

155
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,679
Sometimes if the air is still 
you may not move at all.

156
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,512
Easy on the ropes,
we could use nails.

157
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,037
Its the Roman way isn't it ?

158
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,398
What kind of ransom do you get 
for a Roman these days?

159
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,918
Two talents.

160
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,998
But I'll pay three to watch a roman drowned.

161
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
You'd get fifty from me alive.

162
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,715
And who would collect it ?

163
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,037
They would.

164
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,474
If your men...

165
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,793
...don't return before dawn,

166
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,998
you die.

167
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,231
Your time is up, Roman.

168
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,430
I'll fight one of you for another day.

169
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,233
That's another day.

170
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,992
Nobody is comming back for this Roman.

171
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,312
Throw him in the sea.

172
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,958
Ship !

173
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,352
Fifty talents.

174
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,673
And the money just happened to 
find it's way into your purse ?

175
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,757
Sir I never stole a coin from you.

176
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,350
And I suppose it was the goldsmiths 
who just happened to rob me again.

177
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,234
Sir they've been convicted for it.
_I know how these things work.

178
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,078
You share the profits with
these men.

179
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,319
You pay me well I would never risk 
   my life for a gold coin.

180
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,160
This is the magistrate's testiment 
the goldsmiths have confessed.

181
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,112
Flavius had nothing to do with it.

182
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,670
Are you trying to tell me that a 
man who handles so much gold.

183
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,474
never put a piece into his pocket ?

184
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,070
He's been proven innocent.
This needs your signature.

185
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,58
Strangle him.
- Wait !

186
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,589
He's been proven innocent.

187
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,549
Well I,
just disaprove of the verdict.

188
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,759
Sylla...

189
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,673
He's a good man,
and he's here on my introduction.

190
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,594
Allow me to vouch for him 
and protect him.

191
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,599
You can vouch for him all you like.

192
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,474
But protect him you can't.

193
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,911
 the penalty protests strangulation.

194
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,749
Strangle him.
- There seems to be an error of jugement.

195
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,078
My jugement ?

196
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,793
Pompée...

197
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,638
You're becomming very critical.

198
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,999
You want to rise above me.
Just waiting for your chance.

199
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,149
Those men worship the rising sun 
and not the setting sun.

200
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,553
That's how the saying goes isn't it ?

201
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
But I am not the setting sun not 
yet but in the meantime...

202
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,359
...I expect you to subordinate yourself 
to my wishes wether you understand them...

203
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,989
...or not.

204
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,831
Strangle him !

205
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,468
No...

206
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,798
You...

207
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,392
You strangle him.

208
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,515
No.

209
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,430
 Taije did you hear him say no ?

210
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,668
Ah, my dear general.

211
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,193
I asked you to strangle Flavius
and strangle Flavius you will.

212
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,597
And you will do it with your own bare hands.

213
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,077
You will strangle Flavius
or you yourself will be strangled.

214
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,635
Strangle him !

215
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,871
Strangle him now !

216
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,108
I will not have my orders disobeyed !

217
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,794
I swear to...

218
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,592
Father...

219
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,995
Who are your friends ?

220
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,790
Portia and Marcus.
Don't you remember them ?

221
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,311
Of course Cato's children.
Just don't grow them so much.

222
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,477
Thats our cousin.

223
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,073
Brutus...

224
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,431
What you reading ?
- ´Ethics.

225
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,399
Aristotle ?
- My uncle Cato gave it to me.

226
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,035
How is he ?
- He's as grumpy as ever.

227
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,715
Hasn't chamged a bit.
- Mother.

228
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,919
Caesar !

229
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,959
Don't get up.
- I'm not ill.

230
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,032
Let me get dressed.

231
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,274
I'm well,
I just got up too fast.

232
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,198
You don't have to get dressed.
Lets lie down together.

233
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,198
No wait.

234
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,474
Just...

235
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,908
Cornelia...

236
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,754
I never stopped waiting for you.

237
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,233
I never stopped missing you.

238
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,234
and now...

239
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,319
Here...

240
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,192
This is not supposed to happen.

241
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,474
I'm back now,  my love.

242
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,629
Two years is just too long.

243
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,237
There are those of you who work with Sylla.

244
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,552
and those of you who worked...

245
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,871
...against him.

246
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,430
But not all that worked with 
him agreed with his laws.

247
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,316
I therefor propose that the rights 
of the tribunes be restored

248
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,434
So that once again the people 
can be fairly represented.

249
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,988
I propose a thorough reform of the courts.

250
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,154
And an unqualified reenstatement 
of the senate

251
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,152
As the principal body of gevernment.

252
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,434
Caesar !

253
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,152
Its good to se you fresh 
from another victory.

254
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,512
Oh he let me win.
It makes me feel old.

255
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,996
I'm Glad to see you made it back safely.

256
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,153
I hear you met with a number 
  of obstacles.

257
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,116
Yes. Fortunqtely your friend
Nicomede proved to be a valuable ally.

258
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,154
I never had a chance to thank you...

259
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,759
...for saving my life.

260
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,838
You defied Sylla.

261
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,150
He told you to devorce your wife and you 
said no even though it meant sudden death.

262
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,513
That impressed me.

263
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,350
And it ... 
reminded me of something.

264
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,753
You see my friend,

265
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,831
Sylla once told me 
to devorce my wife.

266
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,668
And unlike you I obeyed him.

267
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,835
I left the one woman I loved.

268
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,115
Life is full of lessons .

269
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,676
So we tought each other
 a thing of two.

270
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,513
Tell me how to get where
   you are now.

271
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,400
Don't tell me I was wrong 
   to hope you were spared.

272
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,599
I have something to give to Rome.

273
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,157
But I have no voice.

274
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,114
If you want a voice in Rome,

275
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,514
Win the people,
Speak from your heart...

276
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,871
And when you make apromise,
         Keep it.

277
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,030
Pompée...

278
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,879
Ipromise you
if you ever need my help...

279
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,835
...just give me a sign,
I'll come to your aid.

280
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,111
My name is Julius Caesar.

281
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,431
I'm here to honor 
my wife, Cornelia...

282
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,275
...publicly
and for the last time.

283
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,999
She was a good woman.

284
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,872
She gave no thought to her own wellbeing.

285
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,550
Only to the wellbeing of others.

286
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,759
Rome was her first and greatest love.

287
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,870
We shared that love.

288
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,479
We dreamt of a Rome 
without dictators.

289
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
Where sons never raise their
 hands against their fathers.

290
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,317
Where brothers never raise 
their swords against brothers.

291
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,275
Where Romans lived at peace 
with fellow Romans by their side.

292
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,034
I ask you now to join with me,

293
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,318
In honoring not only the 
memory of my good wife,

294
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,838
But in memory of all the good men and 
women who have died fighting for a better Rome.

295
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,670
People of Rome, I, Julius Caesar,

296
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,788
make you this promise on the 
body of my beloved wife...

297
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,751
...I will not rest until the Rome
she dreamed of is the Rome we live in.

298
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,799
Join me.

299
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,473
By not only the nephew
 to our beloved Marius,

300
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,799
Who fought against the evils of Sylla
who took his life from him.

301
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,033
But I'm also a son of the Julia,

302
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,273
Who are descendents of the goddess Venus herself.

303
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,152
I offer you my hand.

304
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,199
A power supreme amongst mortal men,

305
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,793
Granted by the gods 
superior to kings.

306
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,910
Let us work together comrades,

307
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,193
in our quest for an empire,
that is boundless,

308
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,432
united ...and free.

309
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,155
We shall have to watch him.

310
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,351
Or use him.

311
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,474
Good morning to you, Caesar...

312
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,239
Hail Caesar.

313
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,557
Greetings, Caesar.
Julia, I have something for you.

314
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,872
Now then... Ah here it is.

315
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,551
And I hope it will make you smile.

316
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,715
That's the first I seen 
you smile in weeks.

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,312
Stop it all of you !

318
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,195
There is nothing he can do about it.

319
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,119
What happened ?
- The price of bread has tripled.

320
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,910
There is no grain in Rome.
--Why ?

321
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,471
Because the grain supply from Egypt
was cut off by pirates.

322
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,069
Half of Rome is without bread.

323
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,919
The city is close to panic.

324
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,350
Only the very rich can afford bread.

325
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,588
We must fight the pirates now or 
Rome will be crippled forever.

326
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,914
So I propose that Pompee be given leigons 
to attack this problem once and for all.


327
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,152
It's not a question of wether or 
not we fight pirates,


328
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,555
It's a matter of how.

329
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,154
I propose we equip ten small armies to fight 
the pirates at different parts of the coast.

330
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,556
So the pirates can destroy Rome
one two by the time ?

331
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,513
The pirates are a bunch of 
uneducated hoodlems.

332
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,395
I hardly think they could stand 
against a Roman assualt of any size.

333
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,194
Lets talk about things are gentlemen.

334
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,357
Not the way we would like then to be.

335
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,316
I can attest to the threat posed by these scavengers.
I was a victem of one of their assults myself.

336
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,036
Then perhaps you will regale us 
with your sea stories Gaius Julius


337
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,557
In the tavern after the work 
of the senate is done.

338
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,437
The work of the senate
 is rarely done.

339
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,236
You see there are not thousands of pirates 
in our waters. But hundreds of thousands.

340
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,398
Enough for all the rogue bands 
preying on single vessles.


341
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,472
There are pirate admirals seeking,

342
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,639
With thousands of ships and troops 
more skilled in naval combat even than our own.

343
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,913
Pretty speaches like this won't
even cook our lunch.

344
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,111
No speeches do as little 
work as the senate.

345
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,075
How dare this arogent newcomer 
insult this Auguste body ?

346
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,193
Auguste and plump, Bibulus,
like your own body.

347
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,518
Apparent from ardent chatter and inactivity.

348
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,031
Enough,...enough,...enough!

349
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,788
We have a man in our company who can 
resolve this conflict with the pirates.

350
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,590
But do we honor him with that duty ?
No.

351
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,997
I'm with Caesar, 
we have no bread.

352
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,592
Now are we a great empire or 
are we going to be ruled by outlaws ?

353
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,352
To perform this commission,

354
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,996
Pompée will have to be given 
an army twice the size 

355
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,352
of the one Sylla used to take Rome

356
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,116
Have we learned nothing from the past ?

357
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,953
I see Rome should go hungary because Cato
can't find a single man he can trust.

358
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,519
Not any man with an army would take the state.

359
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,752
Not every man is a Sylla.

360
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,160
some men are ruled by circunstances but men 
of character bend circumstances to their will.

361
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,833
They make nature behave in such a way that 
their will is carried out on this earth.

362
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,712
They defy the elements.

363
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,958
And sometimes defy their own base of nature.

364
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,358
In order to see their ideals come
 alive before their eyes.

365
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,316
Pompée is such a man.

366
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,358
Those of you who have lived know one 
thing to keep the nation small.

367
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,711
Civil strife.

368
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,517
Tribes fighting tribes rather than 
banding together in one arm of power.

369
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,473
As long as we fight in this room 


370
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,355
seeking personal victories,
enacting petty revenges,

371
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,757
Rome will stay small !

372
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,708
I propose we put our opinions aside 
and let one feeling rule us for a time

373
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,348
The love of Rome.

374
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,357
I propose we put our strengths 
together and become a force

375
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,108
The world has never seen.

376
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,477
I propose you let a man...

377
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,753
...a single man,
lead us out of the dark.

378
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,993
I propose Pompée.

379
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,874
All those in favor.

380
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,276


381
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,839
Marcus...
- Julia.

382
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,110
Julia... look at you.

383
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,718
Brutus, wake up and tell Julia
how beautiful she looks.
.

384
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,956
 Beautiful.
- You like it ?

385
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,231
All dressed for Pompée's triumph...

386
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,598
Who's going with me ?

387
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,036
None of you wants to join 
the counsel of Rome ?

388
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,989
No offense, father, but do you really think we're 
going to trail around with your lecters around.

389
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,670
Rome's greatest general has returned.
And we want to be free to run and follow him...

390
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,552
Run yes,...run...run

391
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,952
Go and enjoy yourselfs.

392
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,758
Come on.
- Thank you pompus.

393
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,553
Brutus ? Arent you going with them?

394
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,633
I want to return this to Apollonius.
- What is this ?

395
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,356
´Ah yes the Plato's law... Did you read it ?
- Yes.

396
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,834
And ?

397
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,993
Plato thinks that democracy is doomed to faliure.

398
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,438
He thinks that a state should 
be run by a dictator.

399
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,999
A dictator who's become 
enlightened through experience and learning.

400
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,159
I don't think plato would get 
along with your uncle Cato.

401
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,477
Brutus ! Hurry up !
- Come on !

402
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,556
Hurry and catch up with your friends
or you'll have to come along with me.

403
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,558
See you at the ceremony.

404
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,518
Goodbye, father.

405
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,033
See, See...

406
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,398
Do you know what i want ?

407
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,312
Thank you for your kindness.

408
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,959
Let me take care of my son now..

409
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,919
Mother...
- Shh... rest.

410
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,837
Something happened to me there.

411
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,634
It's a affliction no more no less.

412
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,952
Your grandfather suffered the same 
spells and lived into old age.

413
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,434
Name something else.

414
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,553
What happen I was watching Pompée.

415
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,518
He's been a friend to me.

416
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,395
We speak together easily like brothers.

417
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,997
Yet we couldn't be more different.

418
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,151
He's a great army leader.

419
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,473
His province has made him the richest 
and most powerful man in Rome.

420
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,869
Your father wanted you to be a statesman
 and now you are a counsel of Rome.

421
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,158
Happened to be beyond his dreams.

422
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,512
I need an army.

423
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,870
To turn yourself into a Pompée ?

424
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,310
How would you pay and feed such an army ?

425
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,989
Your counselship already costs a fortune.

426
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,033
Yes, I am counsel and I am broke.

427
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,671
Your attack today was stronger than usual.

428
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,949
There was something else mother, this 
attack was different in other ways.

429
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,952
How ?

430
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,870
I saw something.

431
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,070
I saw something at that moment.

432
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,951
Not just about myself.

433
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,548
But about the whole humankind.

434
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,876
How we keep ourselves small.

435
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,594
Then  I realized I had not been inspired.

436
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,672
And as I watched pompee I saw 
that he was not inspired.

437
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,952
And he would never be inspired.

438
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,959
And I realized the difference 
between Pompee and me.

439
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,038
Pompée has merely done something.

440
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,550
But I, am for something.

441
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,156
I need légions.

442
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,038
Pompée has them.

443
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,077
He will lend them to me.

444
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,194
Why would pompee do that 
diminishing his own power.

445
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,232
What could you offer him in return 
to equal the value of an army ?

446
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,677
We trust in the wisdom of our fathers

447
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,759
And in their laws. and I, Cato,
trust in him.

448
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,758
Hail Pompée !

449
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,678
Cato, you flatter me.

450
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,788
But let us give credit to another man.

451
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,958
For I could not have fought 
a war across the sea

452
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,313
Without knoledge that Rome was 
in safe hands here at home.

453
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,633
For that we owe a debt of gratitude 
to my friend and fellow council,

454
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,912
Gaius Julius Caesar !

455
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,231
Hail Caesar !

456
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,879
This is my daughter, Julia.
- Yes I know we've met.

457
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,998
It would honor my house if you 
would give us a recitation.

458
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,431
Not in front of so many people ?
- You've done it in larger groups than this.

459
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,513
Father I assure you that I'm 
not prepared for it.

460
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,158
Come...

461
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,319
The daughter of Caesar will recite for us.

462
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,233
Tonight,

463
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,114
Stands beside me and prays with me

464
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,234
A man dear to me and dear to the gods.

465
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,274
Mightier in victory than 
the kings of Mycènes

466
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,869
With their golden haired horses.

467
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,590
And stronger more than the battle ghosts

468
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,996
That ride the shores of  Troy.

469
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,393
Hear me,

470
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,520
Sons of gold headed men.

471
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,758
Hear me sing the victory

472
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,794
Of a man dear to me and to the Goda.

473
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,390
Its really nothing.
- No, Its not your fault.

474
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,873
I'm not sure who's fault it is but I assure you I 
will find out and he will be punished severly.

475
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,555
Thank you, counciler.

476
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,670
What is your name ?
- Calpurnia.

477
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,470
From who's house ?
- Lucius Piso.

478
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,436
I'm sorry for staring,
I thought perhaps...

479
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,708
...we met somewhere before.

480
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,876
Would you like to eat together ?
- I'd be delighted.

481
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,593
What hour do you call this ?

482
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,274
I think it's known as the fifth hour.
- Yes, The sun is comming up.

483
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,512
You're right, I was out with him.

484
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,958
We drank and ate and had entertainment.

485
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,919
He cares for me.
- Ah yes, he's twice your age.

486
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,229
And your friend remember.

487
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,592
Yes, he is my friend.

488
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,028
I just want to know if he 
treats you with respect.

489
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,513
I like him... I do.

490
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,275
I don't love him not yet but ,

491
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,392
..that may come 

492
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,674
Why are you behaving in such a manner ?

493
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,838
He is council.

494
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,236
He's the first man in Rome.

495
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,113
He has légions.

496
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,480
The price is high.

497
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,556
What price ?  It's customary for 
the father to offer a dowery.

498
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,639
You know I have nothing to give you.

499
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,232
I accept.

500
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,074
I want a commission.

501
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,560
Gaul.
- Gaul ? It's taken.

502
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,117
By Cassius.
- I need a victory in battle.

503
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,071
Your not experinced enough in 
warfare and you need legions.

504
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,518
Your légions...

505
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,355
She's all I got,
...I want 50 thousand for her.

506
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,913
50 000 talents ?

507
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,315
Soldiers.

508
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,553
How could you do it ?

509
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,150
How could you take my commission away ?

510
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,954
Because I think Caesar's 
the right man for Gaul.

511
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,354
But I've put my staff to considerable 
  expense preparing my men.

512
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,790
And you'll be re-embursed.
- What ?

513
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,275
And I'll propose that you will
 look after the garrison.

514
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,518
The garrison ?
- This won't do, Pompée.

515
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,669
We should put this before the senate...
- Lets not talk business...

516
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,356
...At my wedding.

517
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,069
It may tempt bad luck.

518
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,436
I have a confession to make.

519
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,074
What's that ?

520
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,235
We did meet before.
or rather...

521
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,356
...I met you 
but you didn't meet me.

522
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,799
It was at the Pompée triumph.

523
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,314
You fell.

524
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,678
Nobody saw it but me.

525
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,437
I held you  to make sure you wouldn't hurt yourself.
- Thank you.

526
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,838
It shames me.

527
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,435
I never know when its 
going to happen.

528
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,032
Many believe those who 
have the condition

529
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,396
are holy...

530
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,150
...Blessed by God.

531
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,753
Perhaps.

532
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,438
What do you suppose a child of both our 
faces blended together would look like ?

533
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,152
I think that it would look  rather beautiful.

534
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,632
Do you ?

535
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,959
Is it something you'd like to find out ?
- Yes.

536
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,756
Are you sure ?

537
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,989
I am less sure about my own name 
than I am about this.

538
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,355
I am terible to have to ask.
- We have servants.

539
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,790
And if I want to go to bed early?

540
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,036
I'll follow you.

541
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,349
Ceasar...

542
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,075
You must make me a promise.
- Anything you like.

543
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,590
Come back from this war alive.

544
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,912
I promise you.

545
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,193
And hurry.
- That's two promises.

546
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,193
And win it.
- That's three promises.

547
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,715
Now it is your turn to promise me one thing.

548
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,078
Will you marry me before I leave.

549
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,752
How many dead ?
- In the region of 23 000 Celtes.

550
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,871
And Romans ?
- 1 12.

551
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,874
I'll have to prepare the burial back in Rome.

552
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,391 
We're not returning to Rome.
We're going farther north.

553
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,871
There's a lot more of Rome out there.

554
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,396
Just has'nt called Rome yet.

555
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,396
The Romans !

556
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,715
We must tell Ceasar to retreat.

557
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,589
What I gave to Ceasar,
I will not revoke.

558
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,554
Wait !
Put down your blades.

559
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,758
Why have you come here ?

560
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,231
This land is ours, 
you have no right to be here .

561
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,712
What is your name ?

562
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,753
Vercingétorix.

563
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,189
You stayed to fight alone ?
- This is my house.

564
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,632
I built it with my own hands.
And you'll burn it down.

565
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,909
You're free to go.

566
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,995
Give me a horse.

567
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,716
You heard him.

568
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,792
Give him a horse.

569
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,230
My dear Ceasar,

570
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,993
The people speak of you with admiration.

571
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,109
Some call you the great as 
they called Pompée.

572
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,678
In the market people sometimes
bow to me as they pass.

573
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,718
You will also be delighted to know

574
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,352
The mariage that began as an advantage,
has blossomed into romance.

575
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,517
Watching Julia and Pompée together 
delights me and saddens me.

576
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,109
That you're not here.

577
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,790
No one could be prouder to be 
your wife, Ceasar.

578
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,196
But after so long without you,

579
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,438
I fear
I'm getting used to my solitude.

580
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,075
Come home soon my darling.

581
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,273
Until then I will be waiting.

582
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,553
Ceasar has killed 300 000 Celtes.

583
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,391
He attacked peaceful villages,
villages who pay taxes to the  Roman state.

584
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,829
Its beyond tolleration !

585
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,237
This is how you thank a great Roman general ?

586
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,715
Ceasar sent
100 000 slaves back to Rome.

587
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,956
Are you saying you havent taken any of them?

588
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,471
Then if any come from him I would have 
got them from somewhere else.

589
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,391
Pompée, you have to be warry.

590
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,478
He's been away three years 
fighting with your légions.

591
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,751
He's doubled their salary.

592
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,430
They are totally devoted  to him.

593
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,712
My lords,
As Cicero has put it so well:

594
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,277
Strain every nerve for the 
preservation of the state.

595
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,472
Look in every corner for the storms.

596
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,515
They will burst upon you if 
you do not see them in time.

597
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,998
I just remembered who he is !

598
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,390
What are you talking about ?
- That man.

599
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,193
Marc Antoine ?

600
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,474
Running from his debtors in Rome 
to find wealth in the provinces.

601
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,352
Like all of us.
- not me !

602
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,075
I still fight for the glory of Rome.

603
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,440
My calvery has been attacked.
- By who ?

604
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,315
Gaél tribesmen. 14 000 dead.
- 14 000 ?

605
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,359
And many more wounded.
They acted under one leader.

606
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,911
His name is Vercingétorix.

607
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,955
Where could we find him ?
- In Alésia.

608
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,311
How long is the march ?
- Eight days.

609
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,356
Vercingétorix is in there
With 18 000 of his men.

610
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,438
Its the most invincible 
stronghold in Gaul.

611
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,314
We'll never break it.
- We won't have to break it.

612
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,036
We'll build a wall around their city.

613
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,880
We'll trap them inside and starve them.

614
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,829
Noboby has ever built a 
fortification of that length.

615
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,431
Then we will be the first.

616
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,435
Let's not waste time.

617
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,997
What do you want ?

618
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,995
I'm here to see Pompée.
- Come here.

619
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,954
Cato...
- Pompée.

620
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,633
Julia...

621
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,155
What brings you to Pisa ?

622
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,797
I've come to speak with you.

623
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,075
Your absence in Rome has been..
criticized.

624
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,356
As you can see,
my wife needs me here.

625
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,236
Can we speak privately ?

626
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,032
What's the matter, Cato ? Did your conversation 
depend on speaking ill of my father ?

627
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,078
Sit, sit , Cato.

628
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,795
Thank you.

629
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,913
Ceasar is about to take the 
last stronghold in gaul.

630
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,320
Vercingétorix has called for every tribe
from the mountains to the sea.

631
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,956
They are on the move toward Alésia.

632
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,073
How many men ?

633
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,632
Two hundred and fifty thousand.

634
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,949
And my husband ?
- Forty thousand.

635
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,836
He'll survive.
He has survived these many years.

636
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,675
He's never been up against so much.

637
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,357
Is this true ?
Will my husband lose this time ?

638
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,308
I don't know noone knows 
the outcome of war.

639
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,239
You are consul, Pompée.
Do something.

640
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,872
If ceasar wins this battle...
- He will become the next Sylla.

641
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,958
Thats what you were going to say
was'nt it ?

642
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,471
That if he wins he will 
become the next Sylla...

643
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,911
Why are you worried, Cato ?

644
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,473
You said he didn't stand a 
chance against the Gauls.

645
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,359
Why call him back ?

646
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,635
Why not leave him there to fight 
this battle to his own death ?

647
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,113
If you leave him there your next
Sylla will extinguish himself.

648
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,830
Your waiting for my husband to fail,
Aren't you ?

649
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,636
And so are you.

650
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,276
To arms !

651
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,439
This is it.

652
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,119
Soldiers at the gate !

653
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,470
He's trying to fool us into 
gathering our troups here.

654
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,229
How do you know what he'll do ?

655
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,273
Because that's what I would do

656
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,718
I will wait here for
Vercingétorix to make his move.

657
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,310
His men are to weak to 
attack our main camp.

658
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,717
He will move his calvery here and 
try to break through the main wall

659
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,798
While his allies attack from the outside.

660
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,197
We cannot let these two 
forces join together.

661
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,599
If they do,
We will not survive.
