22

So far, Masters,
you have cost the British Army £42,000

23
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,657
in what you call miscellaneous costs.

24
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,595

in ammunition and supplies

26
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,390

27
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,835

have been killed also, sir.

28
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:16,603
Your total requisition
for the past 12 months has been £124,563.

29
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,700
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,007
You've sent eight missions
behind the German lines,

31
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,774
and you've achieved nothing.

32
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,578
Colonel Masters, you are a luxury
we cannot afford.

has been a preparatory exploration

35
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,180
into the techniques
which I intend to employ.

36
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,125
The experience
of the great commanders of the past

37
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,128
who have fought over
this very same territory

38
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,255
will ultimately prove invaluable.

39
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,890
Modern warfare
has nothing whatever to do

40
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,959
with the activities
of Alexander the Great or Hannibal.

41
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,527
The principles of desert warfare
have not changed.

42
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,837
The principles of getting value
for your money haven't changed either.

43
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,969
Masters, your outfit
is disbanded forthwith.

44
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,643
Captain Attwood will go back with you,
and you will hand over to him.

45
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,480
-You yourself will take a week's leave...
-Yes, sir.

46
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,281
...to find yourself a suitable uniform.

47
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,517
I know that you have to wear mufti,
but you might shave occasionally.

48
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,682
Yes, indeed, sir.

49
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,191
You will then take over command

50
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,094
of the prisoner of war camp at Sidi Barrani
with effect from the 17th.

51
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,964
I have located, through my contacts
with the Mujabra tribesmen,

52
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,094
the perfect target for my kind of operation.

53
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,403
Where the hell
did you get this photograph?

54
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,378
It appears the Mujabra tribesmen

55
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,941
have learnt how to use
the Brownie cameras I supplied them with.

56
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,957
This camp is about 400 miles
behind the enemy lines.

57
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,191
Precisely. You can't get there, but I can.

58
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,822
Two men are going to stop Rommel.

59
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,129
One of them is Adolf Hitler,
who cannot give him enough fuel,

60
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,002
the other is me,
who's going to blow up the little he has.

61
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,304
Masters, I shall give you one more chance.

62
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,404
Thank you, sir.

63
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,814
This time you've got to succeed.

64
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,342
I shall put the expedition
under the command of a British officer.

65
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,252
But British officers
don't understand my method, sir.

66
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,723
Do as I say, and this time I want him back.

67
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,783
-Yes, sir.
-Alive.

68
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,591
If I must have an officer, sir,
could he be someone

69
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,622
who knows something about pipelines,
petrol installations, that sort of thing?

70
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,532
-We'll see if we have someone to spare.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,571
Don't forget, Masters,
this is your last chance.

72
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,299
Thank you, sir.

73
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,001
-I'll send them back to you.
-Yes, sir.

74
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,210
-Ask Watkins to come in, would you?
-Yes, sir.

75
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,550
Alan, I had an idea.

76
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,256
Take a look at that and that.

77
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,688
Interested?

78
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,569
There must be millions of gallons in there
by the look of things.

79
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,002
-Rommel's?
-Yes.

80
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,938
There. About 400 miles behind their lines.

81
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,671
I got the location pretty accurately
from some of my Mujabra tribesmen.

82
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,736
Actually, they took
the photographs for me.

83
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,839
-Like to go and blow it up?
-We'll give you a show, sir.

84
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,782
Rommel is here.

85
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,979
His lines of communication
are really extended,

86
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,749
so we're going to hit him hard.

87
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,120
Now, if you can destroy
the bulk of his fuel supplies

88
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,022
at that moment,
it might make all the difference.

89
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,151
We'll try, sir.

90
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,061
Rommel's gonna be defeated
by two men, Watkins.

91
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,395
Adolf Hitler,
who can't give him enough fuel,

92
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,560
and me, because I'm gonna blow up
what little he has.

93
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,400
By the way, I'm sending a decoy group
ahead of you.

94

-Not those gangsters, sir.

Yes, they set off a day before you.
Same route, same orders.

for Colonel Masters, sir?

from somewhere.

Yes, sir.

105
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,162
Oh, yes, and I suppose he'd better
know something about petrol.
