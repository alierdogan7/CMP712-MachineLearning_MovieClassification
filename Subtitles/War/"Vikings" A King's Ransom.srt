And then, just over a year ago,

93
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,423
a young man came to the door.

94
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,693
I remember the day,
I was making a loom.

95
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:34,496
The young man
said his name was Rig.

96
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:37,265
He gave us some good advice
on our work

97
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,568
and stayed at our house.

98
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,970
After three days, he left...

99
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,507
And then nine months later,
she gave birth to a son.

100
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,642
(Crowd laughs, baby cries)

101
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,381
Whose child is it?

102
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,185
(Tearful)
I do not know, my lady.

103
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,522
We were all in the same bed.

104
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,557
I was too scared-you see?

105
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:05,127
She is not an honest woman.

106
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,028
She had sex with Rig,

107
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:10,265
and could not bring herself
to tell me the truth!

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,538
Do you know who this Rig was?

109
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,441
No. He was just a young man.

110
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,610
On the contrary.

111
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,746
We know from
our ancient stories

112
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,349
that Rig is another name
for Heimdal.

113
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,319
The God Heimdal?

114
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Peasant man: My lady!

115
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:35,357
Yes, the God Heimdal!

116
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,225
You are fortunate

117
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,127
that he chose your household
to appear in.

118
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,362
That's just a story!

119
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,497
Our whole lives
are just stories.

120
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:45,567
You should be ashamed
you did not trust your wife,

121
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,637
<i>despite the joy and comfort</i>
<i>she has brought you,</i>

122
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:51,039
<i>and the fact that a God</i>
<i>chose you</i>

123
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,941
of all people to visit.

124
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,280
Do not punish her,
but rejoice with her.

125
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,683
Drink wine with her.

126
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,385
And sacrifice
one of your animals

127
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:05,787
to Heimdal the God.

128
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,958
But if I hear
you have harmed this woman,

129
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,028
or this child,

130
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,397
you will answer for it to me!

131
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,733
(Crowd murmurs quietly)

132
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:31,846

Lord Aethelwulf: It seems they
intend to stay here a while.

136
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,662
I had not expected that.

137
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:50,298
My lord, why don't we attack?

138
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,301
They have a strong position.

139
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,303
Perhaps if we can make them
leave their position

140
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:56,605
and attack us.

141
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,440
<i>Saxon warrior 1: How can
we force them to do that?</i>

142
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,309
They're scavengers,
little more than beasts.

143
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,245
We must be able
to out-think them.

144
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,946
<i>Saxon warrior 2</i>
<i>if we leave it much longer,</i>

145
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,314
they'll be even better dug-in.

146
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,683
My lord, if a wolf comes
into your sheep fold,

147
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,218
you don't try to out-think it.

148
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:11,786
You go in and drive it away,

149
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:14,489
- or kill it!
- How dare you argue with me?!

150
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,224
Saxon warrior 2: Lord Aethelwulf,
forgive us. We only meant...

151
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,260
lord Aethelwulf:
I know what you meant.

152
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,829
You meant that you're already
greater warriors than I am...

153
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,464
although only yesterday
you were still green

154
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,266
sucking on
your mother's breasts.

155
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,768
Go do your jobs. Set up camp.

156

Ragnar: Yes, I can see them.

159
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:44,519
What're we waiting for?

160
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,888
To see what they'll do.

161
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:51,693
So you want to hand them
the initiative.

162
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,595
We can't afford
to lose half our men

163
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:56,064
by being stupid and attacking.

164
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,835

<i>Run! Run!</i>

(Grunts of pain rend the air)

182
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,932
(Weapons and shields clank)

183
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,170
Tostig: Odin!

184
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:48,276

(Saxon warriors grunt
and scream in pain)

187
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,788
(Axe whips through air) Ungh!

188
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,724
<i>Aethelwulf: (Praying in Latin)</i>

(Whispering quietly in Latin)

191
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,200
(War cries and screams
rend the air)

192
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:16,638
(Arrow whizzes through the air,
Saxon warrior grunts)

193
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,973
(Weapons clank,
men scream and grunt)

194
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,013
Amen.

(Ragnar blows his nose)

200
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,971
Ragnar: Who are you?

201
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,065
I'm lord Aethelwulf,
brother of king Aelle.

202
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,079
<i>Ragnar: You are the
brother of the king,</i>

203
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,281
yet you lead his army?

204
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,250
Hmm.

205
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:15,487
Does he send you to fight
all his battles?

206
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,623
In the bedroom too?

207
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,529
<i>Floki: Ragnar!</i>

208
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,964
Come and see!

209
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,469
Rollo: Their iron is stronger
and better than ours.

210
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,837
(Hard whack)

211
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:34,640
Leif: (Laughs) And we've captured
a dozen of their horses.

212
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:37,209
<i>Floki: I'm hungry already!</i>

213
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,546
Ragnar:
What ails you my friend?

214
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,982
The gods won't lift my curse.

215
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,019
I am fated to live forever
on this miserable earth.

216
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:53,425
(Men chatter quietly)

217
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:56,729
Rollo: Who is this?

218
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,230
Ragnar: This?

219
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,033
This is the king's brother.

220
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,603
What do you say?

221
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,072
Shall we go visit the king?

222
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,674
<i>King Aelle: God help us!</i>

223
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,677
My brother defeated. Dead.

224
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,579
God help Northumbria.

225
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,282
Lord Edgar: Sire, we do not
know if your brother is dead.

226
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,385
King Aelle: But we do know, my
lord, that he was defeated!

227
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:24,723
Who are these barbarians,
these savages?

228
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:27,826
Why have they come
to torment us?

229
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,429
Bishop Unwan:
Sire, some learned and wise men

230
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,532
say that these northmen
have been sent here by God

231
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,234
to punish our people

232
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:38,570
for their many sins
and transgressions.

233
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:41,106
That we have departed from
the path of righteousness

234
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:42,741
that our lord set out,

235
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,312
so now he is holding us
to terrible account.

236
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,414
(Nobles mutter in agreement)

237
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,050
Noble 3: Forgive me, sire,

238
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,686
but what if God has not
sent these northmen here

239
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,488
to plague us?

240
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,257
Then who has, pray?

241
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,792
Could it not, sire,

242
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,627
rather be the work
of the devil?

243
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,162
(Nobles mutter in agreement)

244
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,765
<i>King Aelle: Go on then, my lord.
What is your advice?</i>

245
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,767
<i>Noble 3</i>
<i>my advice, sire, is that,</i>

246
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,003
as we are facing
the forces of Satan,

247
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,539
we must resist them
at all costs.

248
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,375
Even at the cost of...
Of all our lives,

249
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,444
if necessary.

250
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,280
<i>For evil cannot be accommodated</i>

251
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,716
nor yet ever bargained with.

252
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,352
Several nobles:
Aye! (Murmuring)

253
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,289
<i>Noble 4:</i>
<i>Sire, if I might speak?</i>

254
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:32,758
<i>I-I put it to you</i>

255
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,194
that it might be that
these pagans have come here

256
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,962
by their own account,

257
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,231
and that they are neither
of God

258
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,100
nor the devil.

259
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:42,901
They are just savage men

260
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,170
more interested in robbery
and plunder

261
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,239
than in matters of the spirit.

262
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,375
King Aelle: Then what is your advice?
(Nobles yelling)

263
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,111
Noble 4: Sire, since
they have come for gain,

264
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:54,713
then let us offer them
enough money,

265
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,949
or whatever else they desire,

266
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,718
to go away
and leave us in peace!

267
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,186
(Nobles yell and shout)

268
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,156
Noble 2: Shame! Shame on you!
Shame on you!

269
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,058
<i>Noble 5: He is right!</i>

270
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,060
Why waste more blood?

271
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:10,629
Let's pay them off!

272
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,064
(Nobles yell and shout,
divided)

273
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,133
<i>King Aelle: My lords,</i>

274
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,403
let me think on it,
just a little while.

275
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:20,606
In the meantime,
let it be known

276
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:23,542
I have sent envoys out
to raise more men to arms,

277
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:26,478
for our use if need be.

278
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,915
Nobles: (Muttering quietly)
Long live the king!

279
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:33,519
(Hall buzzes with chatter)

280
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,760
<i>King Aelle: (Sotto
voce) Contend, o lord,</i>

281

282
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:48,901
Fight against those
who fight against me!

283
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:53,539
Draw the spear and javelin
against my pursuers;

284
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:59,445
Say to my soul,
"I am your salvation."

285
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,782
(Door creaks open)

286
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:06,118
Noble 2: Sire, they are here.

287

(Inhales slowly)

288
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,225
(Thundering of hooves
in the distance)

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,133
(Birds chirp)

290
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:24,436

Lord Eadric: Greetings.

295
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,103
King Aelle invites your leader

296
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:01,139
to meet him in his villa
to talk.

297
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:04,443
Who is your leader?

298
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,211
(Silence)

299
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,184
The king did not know that
his brother was still alive.

300

<i>He would like to talk to you</i>
<i>about what he can give you,</i>

301
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,191
to set his brother free.

302
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,700
Do you accept
the king's invitation?

303
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,643
<i>Where are you going?</i>

304
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:39,311

Rollo: We should attack,
while they are weak.

307
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:56,595
How long will it take them
to raise another army?

308

<i>Ragnar: Attack, attack, attack!</i>

309

Imagine the treasures

00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:10,576
in his household?

314
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:12,210
<i>I want them.</i>

315
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:14,813
I want to see how he lives...

316
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:17,816
What manner of men they are,

317
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,418
and I'm hungry.

318
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,019
<i>Rollo: Listen to me:</i>

319

<i>If we agree</i>
<i>to walk into his house</i>

320
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,958
he can kill each
and every one of us.

321

Ragnar: You forget, we
hold his brother hostage.

322
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,865
Why should he care
about his brother?

323
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,702
Do I not care about mine?

324
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:43,342

Forgive me.
Let us feast together...

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,155
King Aelle: Ragnar Lothbrok,

358
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:38,124
may I present my wife Ealswith,
and my son, egbert.

359
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:45,098
Leif: (Speaking old norse)

360
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:48,268
Ragnar: Hello.

361
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,103
<i>(Floki giggles)</i>

362
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:51,838
(Chuckles)

363
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,275
<i>Ealswith: Go on now.</i>

364
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:05,385
(King Aelle claps twice)

365
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:14,194
Vikings:
(Grunting and eating noisily)

366
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,169
(Disgusted shudder)

367
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,538
<i>Bishop Unwan: In the name of
the father, and of the son,</i>

368
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,375
and of the holy spirit, amen.

369
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:29,843
King Aelle and Ealswith: Amen.

370
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,411
<i>All: Amen.</i>

371
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,014
(Priests begin to sing
a prayer)

372
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:50,163
(Conversing in old norse)

373
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:58,471
(Prayer ends)

374
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:00,740
(Vikings grunt and laugh)

375
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,748
(Musicians start to play
a piece)

376
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:16,189
(Sniffs)

377
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,362
(Floki shatters plate,
vikings laugh)

378
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,633
(Plate shatters, vikings laugh)

379
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:32,272
(Speaking old norse)

380
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,282
Shall we talk, king?

381
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:47,620
(Musicians stop playing)

382
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,489
<i>King Aelle: Very well.</i>

383
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,424
What do you want,

384
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,526
for the safe return
of my brother

385
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,962
and for leaving my kingdom?

386
00:23:57,465 --> 00:23:59,099
Is he a priest?

387
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,303
He's a bishop of our church.

388
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,305
A man of God.

389
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,707
I too have a man of God
at home.

390
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:14,914
Two thousand pounds
in gold and silver.

391
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,216
Bishop Unwan: What did he say?

392
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,550
How much?

393
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:19,352
Two thousand pounds.

394
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:25,558
I do not think I heard you
properly, Ragnar Lothbrok.

395
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,694
Ragnar: (Lightly) Hmm...

396
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:34,501
(Bellows loudly)
Two thousand pounds in weight.

397
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:36,603
(Nobles laugh derisively)

398
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:39,038
That is the price.

399
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:45,044
(Viking belches)

400
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,780
(Hall goes quiet)

401
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:54,254
(Benches scrape back)

402
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:57,323
(Metallic rasp
of weapons being drawn)

403
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,596
I agree to the terms.

404
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:05,798
Ragnar: (Belches) Good.

405
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:12,338
(Laughing)

406
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,377
King Aelle: But first...

407
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:20,213
You must return my brother.

408
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:23,783
Ragnar: When we receive payment,
you shall have your brother.

409
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:28,421
You must give me time
to collect such a vast amount.

410
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:33,760
<i>And in the meantime,</i>

411
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:36,963
you and your men must remain
in your camp

412
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,666
and make no further attacks
on my people

413
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,834
or their property.

414
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:44,470
Agreed.

415
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:48,208
Lord Eadric: Sire! How can we
trust the word of a pagan?

416
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,746
Bishop Unwan: Let me
baptize one of them.

417
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:57,150
There is one further condition.

418
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,053
I desire that either you,
or one of your companions,

419
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,489
agrees to be baptized
into our faith.

420
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,657
And that way,

421
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:07,727
I can make peace with a friend
and fellow Christian...

422
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:09,596
And not an enemy.

423
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:13,566
Ragnar: You want one of
us to become Christian?

424
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,168
Yes.

425
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,906
(Speaking old norse)

426
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,643
(Vikings laugh)

427
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,447
<i>Leif: Tostig!</i>

428
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:29,849
(Laughing)

429
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,552
Rollo: (Speaking old norse)

430
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:43,596
I... will be Christian.

431
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:54,140
(Geese honk)

432
00:27:05,953 --> 00:27:06,953
Athelstan: My lady Lagertha,

433
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:08,388
I hope you can find it
in your heart

434
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,790
to speak to the wife
of the late Earl.

435
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,792
Of course. Hello, Siggy.

436
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,560
Please sit down and join us.

437
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,062
Bjorn wait!

438
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,198
Earl Haraldson tried
to kill my father.

439
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,702
(Sighs heavily) I know.

440
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,204
And if he had succeeded,

441
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:28,274
I would be standing
where Siggy's standing now.

442
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,879
So what would you like me
to say to her?

443
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,919
I would ask her to sit down.

444
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,823
Siggy: Thank you.

445
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,067
What can I do for you?

446
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:56,869
Siggy: It is what
I can do for you.

447
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:00,740
I want to serve you.

448
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,845
That is not necessary.

449
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:13,152
I remember very well
how I served

450
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:15,455
the father of my church,

451
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,323
<i>and it did me no harm.</i>

452
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:22,195
<i>In fact, I found in service</i>
<i>a great freedom and honor.</i>

453
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:24,731
When I accepted that I should
forget about myself

454
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:26,999
and serve father Cuthbert...

455
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:30,636
Well... then I became happy.

456
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,789
If it's really what you want,
I accept your offer.

457
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,395
Thank you.

458
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,766
<i>Lagertha: You and your daughter
are now under my protection,</i>

459
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,835
but I will never treat you
as a servant.

460
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:07,740
(River babbles loudly)

461
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:21,454
Bishop Unwan: O lord, holy father,
almighty and eternal God,

462
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:25,558
expel the devil and his
kin from this person:

463
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:27,427
From the head, from the hair,

464
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,662
from the brain, from the brow,

465
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,731
<i>from the ears,</i>
<i>from the nostrils,</i>

466
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,967
<i>from the mouth,</i>
<i>from beneath the tongue,</i>

467
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:36,836
<i>from the throat, from the neck,</i>

468
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:38,738
<i>from the chest, from the heart,</i>

469
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:42,141
<i>from the entire interior</i>
<i>of the body,</i>

470
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,843
<i>from the thoughts,</i>
<i>from the words,</i>

471
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,778
<i>and from the deeds,</i>

472
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:49,348
<i>in the name of Jesus</i>
<i>Christ our lord.</i>

473
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,717
King Aelle and saxons: Amen.

474
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:55,254
Bishop Unwan: I anoint thee...

475
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:59,492
In the name of the father

476
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:02,929
and of the son
and of the holy spirit.

477
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:04,263
Amen.

478
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:13,739
Rollo: (Sputters)
Priests: Et spiritus sancti.

479
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:15,741
(Vikings laugh hysterically)

480
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,213
<i>Bishop Unwan: I now pronounce
you baptized and born again,</i>

481
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:23,249
with the new Christian
name of Rolf.

482
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:28,254
(Vikings laugh)

483
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:36,229
<i>May the lord bless you</i>
<i>and keep you,</i>

484
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,865
<i>from this day hence,</i>
<i>and for ever.</i>

485
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:40,266
<i>Amen.</i>

486
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,068
(Laughter dies down)

487
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:55,615
(Spits angrily)

488
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,123
King Aelle: We have
witnessed a true miracle.

489
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,325
Now I ask you to fulfill
your promises,

490
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,229
return to your ships,

491
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,532
and await your payment
in peace.

492
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,734
Agreed, Ragnar Lothbrok?

493
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:16,469
<i>(Horses whinny)</i>

494
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:27,313
(Water splashes, rollo laughs)

495
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:30,992
(Howling in the distance)

496
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:32,793
(Fire crackles nearby)

497
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,965
(Crackling)

498
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,207
What is it?

499
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:48,576
I can't sleep.

500
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,315
Come here, beside me, daughter.

501
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,026
What worries you?

502
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:08,129
I fear for father, so far away.

503
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,771
Our lives are fated, Gyda.

504
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:19,273
We all have to accept that.

505
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:28,849
Gyda: I can feel it moving
underneath my hand.

506
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:32,520
Mm-hmm. He has a strong kick.

507
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,389
He? Are you so sure it's a boy?

508
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,894
A long time ago,
the seer prophesized

509
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,897
that your father
would have many sons.

510
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,366
That's how I know it's a boy.

511
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:55,376
Now sleep.

512
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,714

Rollo: (Laughing) I won again!

517
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,505
(Under his breath)
Well done... Rolf!

518
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:28,509
What's wrong with you, Floki?

519
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,278
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with me.

520
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:34,482
I did not renounce the gods
in front of everyone.

521
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,853
It was a joke.

522
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,888
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

523
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:43,524
I didn't even know
what the old fool was saying.

524
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:45,693
Floki: It doesn't matter.

525
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:48,596
Surely you've made them
very angry.

526
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,837
Rollo: Don't be stupid.

527
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:59,840
Floki:
No, you are the stupid one...

528
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,276
To risk the wrath of the gods.

529
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:05,146
How will you ever get odin
to forgive you now?

530
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,218
Arne: They're here!
Come and see!

531
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:16,557
(Viking warriors shout
and laugh excitedly)

532
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,768
(Warriors laugh and shout)
