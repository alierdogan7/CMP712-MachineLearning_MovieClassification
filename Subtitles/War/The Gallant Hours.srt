send in a new pitcher.

Relieve Admiral Ghormley?
Yes, sir.

Ghorm, why is the Navy
taking such a licking
at Guadalcanal?

That's easy. Our people
are worn out with day

are better trained
for night fighting.

a couple of pilots awake

is, we all share

410

"Where's the Navy?"

It's black, all right,

414
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,782
but it can get
a hell of a lot blacker.

415
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,853
Less than a year ago we were
clobbered at Pearl Harbor

416
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,724
and they've been
pushing us back ever since.

417
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,761

419
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:25,770
there'll be nothing
to stop them going all
the way down to Australia.

420
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,539

our lines of communication,

421
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,875
they'll cut
our lines of supply,

422
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,981

prolonged for years. Or worse.

423
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,420
Guadalcanal is our

424
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,059

00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,327

your supplies.

But, Admiral, even if I could
scrape up enough supply ships,

429
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,573
every time there's an
air alert they have to
quit unloading and pull out.

430
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,075
Then we'll step up
the unloading.

Are you sure?

447
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,543
What about this proposed
airstrip at in the Dai,

448
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,379
and the Army ground troops
we're sending in to build it?

449
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,648
They're committed.
They're on their way.

450
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,451
Why can't we divert them
to the island, tonight?

451
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,653
But, Admiral,
there's a specific
directive.

452
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,990
But we are faced
with one hell
of an emergency.

453
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,492
The airstrip
isn't that essential.

454
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,728
It's 205 miles
closer to Henderson
than any we've got, sir.

455
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,131
So we increase
our air search area
205 miles.

456
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,802
But that does not save
25,000 men on Guadalcanal.

457
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,138
Admiral, by the time
we went through channels
to try to change...

458
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,340
There won't be time
for channels.

459
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,242
I tell you,
unless we move now,

460
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,711
there won't be any need
for that airstrip.

461
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,213
And, Harry, there's only
one thing to do,

462
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,983
intercept those ground troops
and send them where
they'll do the most good.

463
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,019
And ignore
the directive?
We can argue with them later.

464
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,754
But, Admiral,
we can't do that.

465
00:35:56,787 --> 00:36:01,559
I think we'd be entirely wrong
to take such a decision
into our own hands.

466
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,763
Is that your best judgment?
It's my frank opinion, sir.

467
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,498
Are you prepared
for the consequences?

468
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,666
I am, sir.

469
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,837
I mean the consequences
of losing Guadalcanal?

470
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,940
Or are you concerned with
repercussions from topside?

471
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,543
It isn't just a matter of
repercussions, sir,

472
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,012
I think it would be fairer
to say, that I believe
that these things

473
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,613
have to be
properly coordinated.

474
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,425

leave that one to me, Harry.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

484
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,857
Come in.

485
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,596
Have a seat, Mike.

486
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,332
Quite a bunch out there
still waiting to see you,
sir.

487
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,600
I know.

488
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,769
The pieces beginning to
fit together?

489
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,805
Little by little.

490
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,475
Mike, just how good
is our Intelligence?

491
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,646
Well, the Polynesians resent
the Japs, so they help us.

492
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,581
Missionaries
and Australian coast-watchers

493
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,817
in hiding
along the Solomon's chain

494
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,288
tip us to Jap ships coming
down the slot and air raids.

495
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,258
I've got two men with radios,
here on Rendova.

496
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,261
One in the Shortland's,
and several, here,
in the Russell's.

497
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,962
That's right under
the Japs' noses.

498
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,531
How do they evade
capture?
Some don't.

499
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,702
I see.

500
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,772
Mike, they tell me you're
an expert on the Orient.

501
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,109
Not an expert.
Spent some
years in Japan.

502
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,345
Speak the language,
know most of their
leaders personally.

503
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,781
Tojo, Nomura,
Admiral Yamamoto...

504
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,516
What can you tell me
about Yamamoto?

505
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,453
He's the best they've got.
A fine tactician,
a brilliant strategist,

506
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,989
he commands the
fanatical loyalty of his men.

507
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,625
I understand that
when his fliers
are downed in the water,

508
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,893
they don't even
expect to be picked up.

509
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,161
That's right, sir.

510
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,398
They know he won't
spare planes for rescue.

511
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,800
Nice, very nice.

512
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,301
If you'd like
a personal note, sir,

513
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,470
I can tell you
he's quite a poker player.

514
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,372
You've played with him?
Many times.

515
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,974
When he was naval attache
in Washington.

516
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,176
And he was rough?
Very.

517
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,979
Consistently overplayed
his hand and got away with it.

518
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,349
I hear that he's hot
for naval aviation
and carriers.

519
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,984
That's right, sir.

520
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,887
I guess you know
the part he
played at Pearl?

521
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,225
Just that he was there.
He was there all right.

522
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,827
We recently learned that
it was Yamamoto

523
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,364
who planned and directed
the attack on Pearl Harbor.

524
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,934
Actually Yamamoto
was against war
with the United States.

525
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,071
He predicted that in the end
Japan would lose.

526
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,173
However once the higher-ups
overruled him,

527
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,909
he threw himself
wholeheartedly
into the effort.

528
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,278
Pearl Harbor was
his first assignment.

529
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,580
And it could've been
my last assignment.

530
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,016
If it hadn't been
for engine trouble at sea,

531
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:16,354
I'd of been caught in
the harbor with the rest
of those poor devils.

532
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,089
Well, thanks, Mike.

533
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,025
It'll be your job from
now on to read
Yamamoto's mind for me.

534
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,427
I'll do my best, sir.
I'm sure you will.

535
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,399
Are your whizz kids
making any headway
with the Japanese code?

536
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,067
Some.

537
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,569
Light a fire under them,
will you?

538
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,637
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.

539
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306
And send Andy in, please.
Yes, sir.

540
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,217
You wanted to see me,
sir?

541
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,085
Who else is waiting
out there?
Well, now, let me see.

542
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,388
There's that freighter
captain you sent for.

543
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,089
Three newspaper
correspondents,

544
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,425
a psychological
warfare officer...

545
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,993
(YAWNS)

546
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,829
A psychological
warfare officer
just in from the States.

547
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,732
Am I keeping you up?
No, sir.

548
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,567
Who else is there?
Doc Key for one.

549
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,303
He says if you don't
see him next, he's gonna
bust in here anyway.

550
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,005
Call him.
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,508
Doc, come on in.

552
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,745
Good evening, Doc.

553
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,181
Good morning might be
closer to it, sir.

554
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,483
Does the Admiral
realize he's been
cooped up in this office

555
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,254
seeing person after
person for 16
consecutive hours?

556
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,588
Is that a record?

557
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,323
No, sir,
it isn't a record,

558
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,626
if you'll pardon
my saying so,
it isn't very smart.

559
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,762
As your chief flight
surgeon, I must insist
that you get more rest.

560
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,266
They tell me there are
men on Guadalcanal
who haven't slept in days.

561
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,268
Yes, sir. But they're
not 60 years old,

562
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,137
and they're not fresh
out of a hospital.

563
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,439
Just give me
one more hour.
No, sir.

564
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,342
As long as I'm here,
there's something else
I might as well attend to.

565
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,644
What's that for?
What're you gonna do?

566
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,380
Your shots, sir.
What do I need
those for?

567
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,817
There's no telling
what you'll run
into on Guadalcanal.

568
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,719
How did you know
I was going up there?

569
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,222
I have friends
in high places.

570
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,224
You tell him?
No, sir.

571
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,859
You know me
better than that.

572
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,227
All right, if you'll just
roll up your sleeve, sir.

573
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,995
Now, wait a minute.

574
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,400
You put that ice pick away
and we'll make a deal.

575
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,869
We're not leaving
until tomorrow afternoon,

576
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,405
you can give me
the shots just
before lunch.

577
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,874
Oh, no.
I won't see
anybody else tonight.

578
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,344
I'll have Andy
clear off the office
and I'll go right to bed.

579
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,481
All right, sir.
It's a deal.

580
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,550
Andy, will you explain the
situation to the people
outside and turn in.

581
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,352
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Admiral.

582
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,720
Goodnight.

583
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,860
I thought we were taking off
to Guadalcanal at dawn.

584
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,362
We are.
Well, you just told Doc...

585
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,400
Oh, now, sir,
that's real sneaky.

586
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,737
Goodnight, Andy.

587
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,740
All this fuss over a couple
of little bitty old shots.

588
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,210
Goodnight, Andy.

589
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,048
Goodnight, sir.

590
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,923
ANDY: The Admiral
isn't seeing
anybody else tonight.

591
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,879
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

592
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,481
Come in.

593
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,249
HARRY: Captain Black, sir.

594
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,056
What is it, Harry?

595
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,325
About the airstrip
matter, sir.

596
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,064
What about it?

597
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,232
Well, in view of
the position I took,

598
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,901
if a change in my assignment
would be for the best I...

599
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,569
Because you
bucked me on it?

600
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,005
Oh, that's part
of your job.

601
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,675
If we both thought
exactly alike,
I wouldn't need you.

602
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,644
Thank you, sir.
The orders have gone out,
sir.

603
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,514
Now we both better
jump to one side.

604
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,949
I think so, sir.

605
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,471
Welcome to
Guadalcanal, sir.
Thanks.

606
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,907
Captain Bailey.
You remember Andy Lowe?

607
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,076
How do you do?
Anyone else with you?

608
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,711
No. I left them all
on the
<i>Argonne.</i>

609
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,079
I brought you
four sacks of mail

610
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,516
and nine drums of
aviation gasoline instead.

611
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,186
No reflection on your staff,
Admiral, but you couldn't
have made a better switch.

612
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,157
Sergeant, a load
of gas drums
for you and mail.

613
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,227
Yes, sir.
Okay, you guys,
you heard the man.

614
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,529
Well, Admiral,
where can we
take you first?

615
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,998
I don't want to
tie you up.
Just give me a jeep

616
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,366
and a driver
who knows
his way around.

617
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,568
I'll be glad to
go with you.
No thanks.

618
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,837
I prefer to have
a look around
on my own,

gets together with
you and your G-3.

00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,651
<i>Yamamoto will tolerate</i>
<i>no more postponements.</i>

811
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:51,754
<i>He outlines a blueprint</i>
<i>to be followed at all costs.</i>

812
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,624
<i>On October 22nd,</i>
<i>he will take Henderson Field.</i>

813
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:58,194
<i>On October 23rd,</i>
<i>he will land troops</i>
<i>under heavy air cover.</i>

814
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:02,865
<i>On October 24th, his planes</i>
<i>will commence operations</i>
<i>from Henderson Field.</i>

815
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,201
<i>On October 25th,</i>
<i>his battleships, Cruisers</i>

816
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,137
 <i>and carriers will engage</i>
 <i>the United States naval forces</i>

817
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:12,342
<i>and maintain contact until</i>
<i>those forces are obliterated.</i>

818
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,678
<i>The occupation and surrender</i>
<i>of Guadalcanal will follow.</i>

819
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,482
<i>Until that is accomplished</i>
<i>he cares to hear</i>
<i>no more laughter.</i>

820
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:25,688
PULASKI: A patrol plane
has spotted an enemy fleet
sailing south from Truk,

821
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,158
four carriers,
four battleships,
eighteen cruisers.

822
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:34,030
In addition, we have coast
watcher reports of Japanese
transports and auxiliaries,

823
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,467
plus cruiser escort,
moving down the Slot
from Rabul.

824
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,202
Looks like
the start.
Yes, sir.

825
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,904
I don't get it.
How can Yamamoto
launch an attack

826
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,640
while we still have
land based air
on Guadalcanal?

827
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,678
He's anticipating.
By the time his fleet
moves down to this point,

828
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,981
he assumes
he'll have Henderson Field.

829
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,484
That means Vandergrift
can look forward
to increased pressure.

830
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:58,755
And we can look forward
to the 25th or the 26th
at the outside,

831
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,356
being Zero day.

832
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,194
What's the matter, Frank?

833
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,431
I guess I didn't expect
them to try anything
like this so soon.

834
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,233
Neither did I.

835
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:14,704
We have lost the initiative
for the moment,
but I propose to get it back.

836
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,707
The
<i>Hornet</i>
 and
the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 will throw
the first punch.

837
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,276
Two carriers against
his whole fleet?
Umm-hmm.

838
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,677
That's it, exactly.

839
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,048
Don't forget,
he doesn't know where
our carriers are.

840
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,682
And the trick will be
to keep him guessing.

841
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,017
It could work.

842
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,920
If Kincaid and Murray
made a wide sweep

843
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,023
east of
the Santa Cruz Islands,
beyond their search range,

844
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,360
and then cut back in time,
our carriers could
hit them coming in.

845
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:42,198
Meanwhile we give
Guadalcanal close support
with our cruiser task force.

846
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,700
What do you think,
Mike?

847
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,134
One thing's sure,
Admiral.

848
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,538
He'll never expect
you to come out
looking for him.

849
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,807
There's an old saying,

850
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,446
"No Captain can do very wrong
if he places his ship
alongside that of an enemy."

851
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,118
Well, that'll
hold you
for six months.

852
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,587
Let me have
the alcohol,
will you?

853
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,191
Well, Andy,
looks like
you're next.

854
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,229
I want to see you,
Andy.

855
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,299
(GASPS) Yes, sir.

856
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,734
Well, as long as you're here,
sir, if you'll just
roll up your sleeve...

857
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,236
No, better set up
an appointment, Doc.

858
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,004
Some day when
I have more time.

859
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:23,740
Ah, come in when
you're through
here, Andy.

860
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,041
Yes, sir.

861
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,450
Come in, Andy.

862
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,688
Captain Bailey's
been given command
of the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

863
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,357
And now he's trying
to steal a member
of my staff

864
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,960
for one of his fighter
squadron commanders,
you know anything about it?

865
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,862
No, sir.

866
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,631
You been doing
a little politicking?
Sir?

867
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,267
He asked for you
by name.

868
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,602
Oh, oh,
is that a fact?

869
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,936
Yes, that's a fact.

870
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,671
Well, sir,
I'd certainly
hate to leave you,

871
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,207
but if Captain Bailey
really needs me,
why I'm willing to go.

872
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,375
I'll bet you are,

873
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,177
I hear the big "E's"
gonna see action
in three days.

874
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,679
And if you're not
there, you're gonna
be heart-broken.

875
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,348
Yes, sir.

876
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,184
Well, you'll get
your crack
at combat, Andy.

877
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,620
But right now,
I don't think much
of your timing.

878
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,723
But, sir, what...
What purpose
do I serve here?

879
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,893
Well, unfortunately
I'm used to you.

880
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,829
Well, sir, if...
If that's all, I...

881
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,465
Oh, all right,
all right, all right,

882
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,401
on second thought,
you've been a pretty
sorry excuse for an aide,

883
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,737
so Captain Bailey
can have you.

884
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,639
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

885
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,740
Go on,
get out of here.

886
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,575
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.

887
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:36,512
Oh... Sir, I...
I wondered if...

888
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,081
If I could ask
a special favor.

889
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,583
Yes, sure, Andy.

890
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,186
Well, sir, I realize
I haven't been the world's
best aide, in many ways

891
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,722
I've slipped up on my duty,
but, sir, my conscience
would be a mite clearer

892
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:51,827
if I could leave here knowing
that I had at least performed
one part of my assignment.

893
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,296
What's that?

894
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:59,402
Well, sir,
it was my duty to see
that you got your shots.

895
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,211
Is this in the nature
of one last request?

896
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,379
Well, it's a...

897
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,216
All right.

898
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,519
Get Doc Key.

899
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,222
Yes, sir. Aye, aye, sir.

900
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,694
I'm going after Doc Key.
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

901
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,295
If anybody wants me,
I've gone for Doc Key.

902
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,865
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

903
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,334
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.

904
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,375
I never saw so much
commotion about
a couple of shots.

905
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,744
Not just a couple,
Admiral. Five.

906
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,780
Five?
Five, sir.

907
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,049
Watch out for
the hook, sir.

908
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,417
(ALL LAUGH)

909
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,322
Very funny. Very funny.

910
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,825
Here comes number 1.

911
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,833
DR. KEY: Now,
here comes number 2.

912
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,707
This'll be number three.

913
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,181
<i>NARRATOR: Aboard his flagship,</i>

<i>expresses anxiety</i>

914

Fresh PBY contact,
sir.

922
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:58,287
They report one
large carrier
and six other vessels

923
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,756
200 miles away
on the same bearing.

924
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,312
Issue these orders
to all task force
commanders immediately.

925
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,981
Is this all, sir?

926
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,182
That's all.

927
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,484
Yes, sir.

928
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:31,554

941
01:07:56,939 --> 01:08:00,743
We lost the
<i>Hornet.</i>
They damaged
the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

942
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:04,146
We lost 283 men,
killed or missing.

943
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:09,452
Aircraft,
they lost a minimum
of a hundred.

944
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:15,458
Against that,
our carrier plane losses,
from all causes, were 74.

945
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,029
That it?
That's it, sir.

946
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,466
Any discussion?

947
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,068
Harry?

948
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,538
What's there to say,
sir?

949
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,608
We got the
short end
of the stick.

950
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,811
Tactically, yes.
Strategically, no.

951
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,914
But we lost
the
<i>Hornet,</i>
 sir.

952
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,151
What was our objective?

953
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:47,289
To hang on to Guadalcanal.

954
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:51,894
I'm calling your attention
to the fact that the Marines
are still doing just that.

955
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,197
Yes, sir,
but the Japanese fleet
is still in the area.

956
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,799
We're wide open.

957
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,467
Harry's right, sir.

958
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:02,171
If they follow up today,
we have nothing
to stop them with.

959
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:03,873
Sir...

960
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,009
Go on.

961
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,145
I think it's up to
the Staff to recommend
emergency measures

962
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,382
in the event we're forced
to evacuate Guadalcanal.

963
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,354
You feel that way?

964
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:26,562
It's true
that if the Japs
follow up today,

965
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,866
and their fleet keeps
coming down the slot,

966
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,536
we can't stop them.

967
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:38,340
But I don't think
they'll do that.

968
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,178
With a hundred planes
and pilots lost,

969
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:46,015
the air groups
aboard those Jap carriers
have been cut to pieces.

970
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,951
And why should they
come further south

971
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:52,688
to place themselves
under land-based air attack?

972
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,991
And a second thing,
in our favor,
the record.

973
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,527
Ever since Pearl Harbor,

974
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:02,798
the Japs have
consistently failed
to follow up an advance.

975
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:07,603
I'm gambling that
they won't break the habit.

976
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,372
We could still arrange
evacuation measures
for insurance.

977
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,374
No. No.

978
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:16,378
If they pick up the hint
that we're even
contemplating evacuation,

979
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,782
they'll be down here
like vultures.

980
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,718
In other words,
we lash down
the safety valves.

981
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,420
We lash them down.

982
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:30,159
I want all the senior
commanders
of the services

983
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:34,897
to pool their
mechanics in an
emergency repair force

984
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,634
and work around the clock
to restore ship damage,

985
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,870
particularly the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

986
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:49,278
Well, as far as
I'm concerned, gentlemen,
the battle was a stand-off.

987
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,348
Just when we needed one.

988
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:16,105
"A PBY contact at 1400

989
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:21,810
"reports the enemy fleet
in a general retirement
toward Truk."

990
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:33,355
<i>NARRATOR: On board</i>
<i>the</i>

<i>Andy Lowe</i>
<i>talks to some of his own men</i>

991
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,158

993
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,420
Howdy.

994
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,488
You Andy Lowe?

995
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,691
That's right.
I was told
to double up with you.

996
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,859
Oh, well,
glad to have you.

997
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,996
Whose bunk was that?

998
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,864
A fellow by the name
of Cerella.

999
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:16,932
Dead?

1000
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,534
He's missing.
Same difference.

1001
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:21,537
Well, now I wouldn't
say that.
Well, I would.

1002
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,450
I guess you've got
quite a few extra bunks
on the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 tonight.

1003
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,218
Yeah, quite a few.

1004
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,787
Did he have a family.
Huh?

1005
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,557
The man who used
to bunk up there,
did he have a family?

1006
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,791
No, no.

1007
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,695
Do you mind
if I use your typewriter?

1008
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,263
Help yourself.

1009
01:12:56,472 --> 01:13:00,375
I... I didn't get
your name.

1010
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,745
Roy Webb.
Oh, yeah.

1011
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,414
Aren't you
Squadron Commander
of the F-11?

1012
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,683
I won't be
when I finish this.

1013
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,886
I lost half my
squadron today.

1014
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,722
One half of an
entire squadron.

1015
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,792
Nine planes. Nine men.

1016
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,797
Making out
a strike report?

1017
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,599
No.

1018
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,935
From the look on your face,
I figure it's no love letter.

1019
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:30,139
I'm asking to be
relieved of command.

1020
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,709
Oh, well,
sooner or later we all
need a rest from flying.

1021
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,346
Well, I don't need
a rest from flying.

1022
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,481
I'll fly combat
again tomorrow.

1023
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:42,918
I just do not want
to command.

1024
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:46,488
I lost some guys today.
We all did.
It wasn't your fault.

1025
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,357
Now how can you tell?

1026
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,462
You know, my mother
said to me once,

1027
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:57,199
she said, "Never make
an important decision
when I was tired."

1028
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,136
I found that to be
a good piece of advice.

1029
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,572
I know what I'm doing.

1030
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,122
The Big "E."

1031
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:23,125
Yes, sir,
she brought us home.

1032
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,960
We've fixed most of
the leaks
in the oil tanks,

1033
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,463
but the damage
to the forward
elevator's pretty bad.

1034
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,964
Admiral.

1035
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,033
Andy.
How are you?

1036
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,301
Very good, sir.

1037
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,402
Good evening, sir.
Evening.

1038
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,671
Congratulations
on those two Zeros.
Thank you.

1039
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,674
He splashed
three of them, sir.

1040
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,509
If you'll excuse me,
Admiral.
Certainly.

1041
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,578
Keep after them, Bill.

1042
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:46,415
Well, I hear your relief
is showing up.

1043
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,485
Maybe you can tell me
something about
a Commander Roy Webb?

1044
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,053
Oh, yes sir.
He's...

1045
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,689
He's Squadron Commander
on the
<i>Hornet.</i>

1046
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,325
Would he fit in?

1047
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,327
Well, he'd make
an okay pilot for you, sir.

1048
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,129
He's...
He's experienced,
he's available.

1049
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,867
We need Squadron
Commanders.

1050
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,902
Why is he available?

1051
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,473
Well, right at this time,
the pilots on the
<i>Hornet</i>
have no ship, sir.

1052
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,510
They'll be reassigned,
though.

1053
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:19,214
Andy, I'd like
a straight answer.

1054
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,953
Well, the fact is,
Admiral, Webb asked
to be detached.

1055
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:28,056
Said he was unfit
for command.

1056
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:30,859
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1057
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,160
Come in.

1058
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,198
Lieutenant Commander Webb
to see you, sir.

1059
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,633
Send him in.

1060
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,241
Webb?
Sir.

1061
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,380
I need an aide
who can double
as my pilot.

1062
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,817
Your name has been
submitted. How do you
feel about the job?

1063
01:15:55,851 --> 01:16:00,422
I'd be honored, sir.
Frankly, I think
I belong in combat.

1064
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,292
Well, according to this,
you asked to be relieved.

1065
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,028
Only from command, sir.
Not from combat.

1066
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,432
I've looked at your record,
it's a good one.

1067
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,867
Navy Cross.

1068
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,938
Every job they gave you,
you did well.

1069
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,740
What happened?

1070
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,443
Sir, I just can't give
any more orders.

1071
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,979
Well, you've been
cutting it all right.

1072
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,181
As a Squadron Commander,
yes, sir.

1073
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,583
Now I'm Senior.

1074
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,484
The Air Group Commander
is in the hospital.

1075
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,487
If he doesn't get well,
I'll be next in line
for his job.

1076
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,456
You don't want
the responsibility?

1077
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,791
No, sir.

1078
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,960
That's normal.

1079
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,129
Sir, I don't think
you have the whole...
Sit down.

1080
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,737
I can think of
some wonderful speeches
I could make right now.

1081
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:53,442
Probably have
both of us in tears.

1082
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,878
But I just don't
have the time for
such performances.

1083
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,914
Webb...

1084
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,452
Where do you think our
group commanders come from?

1085
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:07,623
I don't know, sir.
All I do know is that
I'm not the man for the job.

1086
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,158
You think the job requires
a great man?

1087
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,528
Yes, sir.
Well, I have news for you.

1088
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,397
There aren't any great men.

1089
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,698
There are just
great challenges

1090
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,800
that ordinary men
like you and me

1091
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,870
are forced
by circumstances to meet.

1092
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,507
Now, you've proved
you can get the job done.

1093
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,076
You're hooked
by your own record.

1094
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,147
In short,
you don't have any choice.

1095
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,616
Sir, I lost
nine planes yesterday.

1096
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:42,657
I lost those same
nine planes
and 17 others to boot,

1097
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:47,896
plus one destroyer,
two submarines
with all hands,

1098
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:52,868
two LST's, and God knows
how many ground troops.

1099
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,903
Do you want me to go on?

1100
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,440
No, sir.

1101
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,746
I guess I... I just had
the feeling I was alone.

1102
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,419
You were,
and you will be.

1103
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,291
Good luck, Roy.
Thank you, sir.

1104
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,932
You better
step on it, Frank.
The boat's waiting

1105
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,367
and the old man's
raring to go.

1106
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,702
What do you mean?
It's your turn today,

1107
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:30,238
I swam a mile
with him Tuesday.
It's Murphy's turn.

1108
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,573
Murphy's pulling OD.

1109
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,209
So that makes it
your turn.

1110
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,578
Look, I'm still
waterlogged
from Tuesday.

1111
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,613
The Chaplain's
right down the way.

1112
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,717
Doc, couldn't you
take him today?

1113
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,819
Well,
for a consideration.

1114
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:46,588
Like a...
Like a pint
of scotch?

1115
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,123
Like a fifth?

1116
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,159
It's a deal.

1117
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,294
(ALL LAUGH)

1118
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:16,685
Nice work, Doc.
Nice work.

1119
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,253
Where's the old man?

1120
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,355
Well, he's half way
to Japan the last time
I saw him

1121
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,257
and still going
strong.

1122
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:26,428
I said to him,
"Admiral, I think
we've gone far enough.

1123
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,763
"I think it's time
we turned around
and went back."

1124
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,966
He said, "Is that
a medical opinion?"

1125
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,634
I said, "No, sir.

1126
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,937
"It's just the opinion
of a drowning man."

1127
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,105
Doc, I'll make
a deal with you.

1128
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,707
You give me back
my fifth of Scotch,

1129
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,609
I'll give you
some artificial
respiration.

1130
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,612
He's coming in now.
Look at him
kick and splash.

1131
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,348
I wouldn't be
surprised if
he's part walrus.

1132
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,682
I'll tell you
one thing,

1133
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,218
I go with him again,
it's gonna be in
a row boat.

1134
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,953

will be back, Mike?

1149

11 November.

Well, sir,
according to all
available information,

1176
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:36,318
the situation on
Zero Day,
11th November,

1177
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,187
should shape up
as follows.

1178
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,958
Kelly Turner's transports
should be finished
unloading by nightfall.

1179
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,959
That will free
his escort
to move here

1180
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,463
South of Savo Island,
to reinforce
Scott and Callaghan

1181
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,399
if a night action
should develop.

1182
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:55,670
Callaghan's cruiser force
and Scott's cruiser force
will be here.

1183
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,842
Kincaid's force
of battleships
and heavy cruisers

1184
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:04,045
will have escorted
the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 to within
flying range of the enemy,

1185
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,314
about a hundred
or so miles
to the south,

1186
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,217
depending on
when the

is ready to sail.

1187
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,486

sir.

Repairs on
the

will not be
completed on time.

1190
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,492
Then she'll have to
sail as is.

1191
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,027
Half a carrier
is better than none.

1192
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,363
HARRY: Admiral,

1193
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,498
Frank has been going
round and round
with me on this,

1194
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,735
he feels very
strongly that...
Sir...

1195
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,870
Is the plan still open
for discussion?

1196
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:29,938
Certainly.

1197
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,041
Sir, following
the last engagement,

1198
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:37,212
you correctly estimated
that their fleet
would withdraw.

1199
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,749
The rest of us were
a little wrong
about that one.

1200
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,551
This time we know
they're coming all the way.

1201
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,420
And if we lose this one,

1202
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:48,356
Guadalcanal is going
to be another Bataan.

1203
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,459
Impossible to reinforce,
impossible to relieve.

1204
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,730
Vandergrift will wind up
another Wainwright.

1205
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,032
If we lose.

1206
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,468
Well, before we send
Callaghan and Scott

1207
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,871
into those narrow waters,
Admiral,

1208
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,939
let's see what we've got.

1209
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,742
Three cruisers,
a handful of destroyers.

1210
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,645
Now, let's take a look at
what they've got.

1211
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,048
The latest estimate
shows that they'll
have four battleships,

1212
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,484
five heavy cruisers,
two carriers,

1213
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,487
and about
30 destroyers.

1214
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,589
The least we can do
is detach Lee's battleships

1215
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,159
from the
<i>Enterprise</i>
 and
send them on ahead to help.

1216
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,228
The battleships will have to
protect our one carrier

1217
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,798
till she gets within range.

1218
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,099
I may detach them later.

1219
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,569
Well, sir, how long can three
cruisers and a few destroyers

1220
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,338
delay a force
more than twice their size?

1221
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,409

and Norm Scott...

1223
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,012
Come in.

1224
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,984
Admiral Callaghan
and Admiral Scott
are here, sir.

1225
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,957
Send them in.
Aye, aye, sir.

1226
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:03,898
Good evening, sir.
Dan. Norm.

1227
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,102
You know
Harry Black?

1228
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,770
Frank Enright.
Gentlemen.

1229
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:11,172
Mike Pulaski.
How are you,
gentlemen?

1230
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,641
I won't
keep you long.

1231
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:16,845
I just wanted to
wish you good luck
before you shoved off.

1232
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:19,881
We'll probably need
a little luck, sir.

1233
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,916
Looks like
a real brawl.

1234
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,286
I wish I could
change places
with you two.

1235
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,555
We know you do,
sir.

1236
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,724
I don't look for
a carrier action this time.

1237
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,026
I think it'll be
a surface battle.

1238
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,328
Guns and torpedoes.

1239
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,464
Like Norm said,
a brawl.

1240
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:39,734
And you can count on a real
loud rooting section up there.

1241
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,003
Archie Vandergrift
and his Gyrenes.

1242
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:45,406
Sir, we can't promise
Archie the Jap fleet
won't get through.

1243
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,809
But if it does,
Norm and I guarantee

1244
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:51,079
there won't be much left
afloat behind it.

1245
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,581
Is that what you
had in mind, sir?

1246
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,619
All I know is,
the job is in the right hands.

1247
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,954
Thank you, sir.

1248
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:02,690

ENRIGHT: Good luck.

1249
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:05,059
Good luck.
Goodnight, gentlemen.

1250
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,198
Captain Black, sir?

1251
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,102
No word?

1252
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,139
No word.

1253
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:29,017
Sir, there's something
I better tell you.

a routine search.

01:32:57,672 --> 01:33:01,108
All right,
let's have it, Harry.

1330
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:04,412

and this batch I thought
I could take care of myself

exceptions.

Oh, Pearl has asked
for another report.

1333
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,183
Any word?
No, sir.

1334
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:11,819
No contact?
None reported, sir.

1335
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:14,622
There should've been
a contact at 2300

1336
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,691
if they'd maintained
course and speed.

1337
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,695

inaccurate, sir.

what the hell they want with
all these damn statistics?

right there, sir.

in the Com office?

1343

Murphy's the
duty officer, sir.

01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:41,816
And his orders are to get
all the dope up to us pronto.

Oh, Harry, you said
something this afternoon
about a dispatch from Pearl.

1373
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,156
On the problem of
unloading.
What was that?

1374
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,624
Oh, yes sir.

1375
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:06,694
Here it is.

1376
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:09,597
"Delay in unloading ships
at Noumea is alarming.

1377
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,966
"It is noted that some ships
have been at Noumea harbor

1383

No, send it.

1387
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:40,327

change his mind.

1388
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:44,064
That's the second time
somebody has said that
to me tonight.

1389
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:46,600
Change my mind.

1390
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:53,174
Yeah, you're right,
I might do just that.

1391
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:59,980
You don't change your mind,

1392
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:03,350
although I know some minds
that could stand changing.

1393
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:07,021
And I won't
exclude my own.

1394
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:13,994
You change the direction
in which you're going.

1395
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:16,197

direction you take more...

More of your fellow men.

1400
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:38,519
It'd be a whole lot easier
if you could go alone,
wouldn't it, Harry?

1401
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:39,820
Yes, sir.

1402
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:44,792

I don't suppose

1403
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:48,929
anybody ever goes

do you?

1408

1410
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:10,784
"I believe it's better
to tell the truth than to lie.

1459
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,855
I had a machinist mate
fix up a homemade pair.

1460
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,659
A machinist mate?
Yes, sir.

1461
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:48,028
Well that's...
That's very nice.

1462
01:42:56,703 --> 01:43:00,340
Have we anybody from the staff
going back to the States soon?

1463
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:03,443
Yes, I believe
Lieutenant Lockwood
is leaving tomorrow.

1464
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:05,712
Tomorrow?
Yes, sir.

1465
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:11,218
Will you ask him
to do me a favor?

1466
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:12,920
What's that, sir?

1467
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:19,059
Will you ask him
to deliver these
personally

1468
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,296
to Dan Callaghan's
widow?

1469
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:24,097
Yes, sir.

1470
01:43:25,332 --> 01:43:29,236
And these
to Norm Scott's widow,

1471
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,240
with the message,

1472
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:37,144
that their husbands
earned me my new stars.

1473
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:38,946
Yes, sir.

1474
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:42,115
May I add
my warmest
congratulations, Admiral?

1475
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:46,386
Not only on the promotion,
but on the turn of events
at Guadalcanal.

1476
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,723
Even Frank Enright thinks
we may have them licked.

1477
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,291
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1478
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:05,572
Yamamoto doesn't seem
to know
that he's licked.

1479
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:09,409
The rest of their force
is continuing down
the Slot on schedule.

1480
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:12,879
Herding 20 transports
loaded with
invasion troops.

1481
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:16,850
According to the book,
we don't send battleships

1482
01:44:16,883 --> 01:44:20,320
into waters
as narrow as those,
especially at night.

1483
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:23,657
Forget the book?
Forget the book.

1484
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,259
Detach Admiral Lee's
force from the
<i>Enterprise</i>
and send it ahead tonight.

1485
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:27,427
Yes, sir.

1486
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:28,962
HALSEY: The
<i>Enterprise</i>
planes can
follow up tomorrow.

1487
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:30,297
Yes, sir.

1488
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:34,001
May I see the Admiral?

1489
01:44:34,034 --> 01:44:35,702
What is it, Mike?

1490
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,315
We've broken
the Jap code.

1491
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:51,284
Yes, sir.
That was intercepted
from the Shortlands area.

1492
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:54,321
Yamamoto's plane
is due to land
at the Jap air base in Kahili

1493
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,556
at 11:35 on the 18th.

1494
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,959
We've hit the Jackpot.
You think so?

1495
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:01,528
Admiral, this was
made to order.

1496
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:03,463
That's what bothers me.

1497
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:06,266
HARRY: Admiral Lee
has been notified, sir.

1498
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,536
A chance to
get Yamamoto.

1499
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:12,205
Not only Yamamoto
but his whole Staff.

1500
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:16,643
About 750 miles.

1501
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:17,911
That's out of range
for anything we've got,

1502
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:20,347
but the Army P-38's
could make it.

1503
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:26,420
We break the Jap code
at just the right minute.

1504
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:33,694
Then this message falls
into our lap
at just the right minute.

1505
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:39,700
How do we know
this isn't a trap?

1506
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,268
We don't, sir.

1507
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:45,338
On the other hand,
if it is a trap,

1508
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:48,709
wouldn't they go
about it a little
more subtly?

1509
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:51,378
Washington leaves that
up to you, sir.

Archie Vandergrift
and Geiger

1511
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:56,516
I'm leaving
for Guadalcanal now.

1512
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:57,884
Yes, sir.

1513
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:05,392
(SIRENS BLARING)

1514
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:26,079
I see no point,
none at all in
speculating about a trap.

1515
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:29,116
If Yamamoto
doesn't show,

1516
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:32,819
the P-38's will refuse
combat and hightail it.

1517
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:36,289
The question is,
what's the best
plan of attack?

1518
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:39,226
Well, sir, I don't think
that we should try
to get him in the air.

1519
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,461
There's too many variables,
the weather conditions,

1520
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:43,997
he may be late,
he may be early,
we might miss him.

1521
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,332
How would you do it,
Andy?

1522
01:46:45,365 --> 01:46:47,234
Well, hit him
when he's most vulnerable.

1523
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:49,002
After he's landed
on Ballale island,

1524
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:53,340
he's scheduled
to take a sub chaser
from there to Buin.

1525
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:56,376
ANDY: I say strafe him
when he's on the water.

1526
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,080
What do you say, Lamphier?

1527
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:04,184
Oh. Well,
no pun intended, sir,

1528
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:06,987
but I think
that approach is all wet.

1529
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,955
Could you be a little bit
more explicit, Captain?

1530
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:10,924
Sure.

1531
01:47:10,957 --> 01:47:14,995
Now Army pilot's
are gonna carry the ball
in this thing, correct?

1532
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:16,930
Well, I hate to
embarrass anybody,

1533
01:47:16,963 --> 01:47:19,966
but the plain fact is
that Army pilots,
including yours,

1534
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,936
truly, are not so hot
on Naval identification.

1535
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:25,939
Based on past performance
I'd say there's
a strong possibility

1536
01:47:25,972 --> 01:47:29,009
that we might
pick out something else
instead of the sub chaser.

1537
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:30,944
Oh, now looky here...

1538
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:32,646
I'm not through.

1539
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,615
If we do strafe
the right boat,

1540
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:39,352
we could miss Yamamoto,
or maybe just wound him.

1541
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:42,956
And if we sink the boat,
what's the guarantee
that he won't swim away?

1542
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:47,160
Well, there's no guarantee
that you're gonna get him
in the air, either.

1543
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:52,632
Your way might work,
Andy, but...

1544
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:56,670
I think the fellow
who has to do the job
should call the play.

1545
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:00,006
We'll go for him in the air.

1546

(PLANES HOVERING)

1547
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:29,169

only 14, sir.

1548
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:30,570
Must've been
some mechanical trouble.

1549
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:33,406
Four of those P-38's
didn't get off.

1550
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,508
18 was little enough.

Signal from
Admiral Lee, sir.

1552
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,883
Lee's lost two destroyers,
but he sank the

reversed course.

for a field day.

make the most of it.

daybreak and go after

1557
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:50,857
those two transports.
Yes, sir.

01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:52,759

in on this.
Yes, sir.

in on this, too.

Yes, sir.

1562
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:05,038
They're landing
and taking off again

1563

as fast as they can
rearm and refuel.

a shuttle run.

on schedule,

to get well
out of the area

before they can break
radio silence
and report, Admiral.

still a little
early for that.
