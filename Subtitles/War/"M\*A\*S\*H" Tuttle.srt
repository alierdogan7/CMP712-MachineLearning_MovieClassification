1
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,505
Did I ever tell you you look
cute with your shirt off?

2
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:58,673
No.

3
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,011
I think I know why.

4
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:01,847
Now you made me lose count.
I gotta start all over again.

5
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:04,410
- Sleep! I wanna sleep!
- Hoo-ha.

6
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:07,855
- Will you hold it down?
This is very distracting.
- Mail call, sirs.

7
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:11,190
Keep away from him.
He'll start all over again.

8
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:13,787
Captain B.J. Hunnicutt.
Something in a plain, brown envelope.

9
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,695
- [Chuckles]
- They oughta disguise those things more.

10
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:19,031
- It's the <i>Surgical Journal,</i> Radar.
- Oh, yeah?

11
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:23,005
I seen one of those once. I'd rather look
at the outsides of people.

12
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,837
Hey, Hawkeye. You got your newspaper
from home.

13
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,311
- Get away from me with that.
- That's the <i>Crabapple Cove Courier.</i>
You love that.

14
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:33,278
I used to love it.
Same stupid news week after week.

15
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,908
Where's this month's <i> Journal from</i>
<i>the Institute for Applied Nudism?</i>

16
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:39,920
Wanna read Major Burns's issue
of <i>Popular Mechanics?</i>
Sometimes the ads go pretty far.

17
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:43,719
Radar, a picture of a three-way toilet valve
does not go pretty far.

18
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,158
I just deliver 'em.
I don't make 'em up.

19
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,392
Look at this: "How to provide a gastric
reservoir in a total resection of the stomach."

20
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,457
Look, if you can't read without moving
your lips, at least turn the sound off.

21
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:55,503
- What's eating you?
- My back is eating me.

22
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,663
- Still?
- I have a hungry back.

23
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,867
- You want a massage?
- Not unless you put your shirt on.

24
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:02,877
- How about if I x-ray your back later?
- I did already.

25
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:06,176
- There's nothing there.
- Nothing? No spine, nothing?

26
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:09,115
The pain goes
clear through to my lung.

27
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:12,085
- I thought maybe I had a spot.
- Or a Fido or a Rover.

28
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,088
- Oh, you're really cute.
- [Chuckles]

29
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,522
If I die from this, will you read the joke
at my grave?

30
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,821
You know, I'd really dig that.
[Chuckles]

31
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:22,455
Criminy! I'd rather read
the stupid newspaper.

32
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,261
I'm gonna tell you right now
what's gonna be in there.

33
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:28,667
Another article about
incredibly average Vernon Parsons.

34
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:32,935
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- Some dunce I went through
med school with.

35
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:36,273
Every week, he's in the newspaper.
He's being put in charge of this.

36
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,245
- <i>He's being promoted to that.</i>
- So what?

37
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:40,975
He's incredibly average.

38
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,779
The only reason he gets all this stuff
is he's back there with no competition.

39
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,821
He's sitting back there,
resting on his fallen arches.
I'm over here dancing with rats.

40
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,688
You'll live... probably.
Listen to this...

41
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,125
"Transposition of the ileum
in ascending colon."

42
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:58,132
- What an idiot that guy was.
- By the same guy who advocated
total gastrectomy in '49.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,966
- I read that. Fascinating.
- Vernon must have his own press agent.

44
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:05,529
I can't pick up my hometown newspaper
without reading his name.

45
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:08,167
Damn it! There he is again!

46
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:11,644
"Dr. Vernon Parsons has been awarded
a hundred thousand dollar grant...

47
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:16,616
at Boston Hospital for a two-year study
of infectious disease in mice."

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,051
They oughta give him the disease
and split the dough with the mice.

49
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:25,616
Don't they realize
how incredibly average this man is?

50
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,959
I'm going to breakfast.
[Groans Loudly]

51
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:31,693
- Worse, huh?
- Do you see a knife handle
sticking out of my back?

52
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,701
- <i>Look, I hate to give advice.</i>
- Good.

53
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,398
- You never exercise.
- I wrestle periodically with the nurses.

54
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,339
If you'd just do something physical
once in a while, you'd feel better.

55
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,944
You're right.
I feel a lot better.

56
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:47,047
Father, you feeling a bit
under the weather today?

57
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,777
- I have been dragging a bit.
- Not eating, I see.

58
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:53,514
- Food seems to have lost its allure.
- Can I eat your sausage, Father?

59
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:56,751
- By all means, Radar.
- They're really good today. Extra grease.

60
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,350
If you'll pardon the indelicacy,
Father, and with all due respect...

61
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:02,920
to your collar, why don't you stop by
the dispensary and get a good flushing out?

62
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,832
- [Grunts]
- We got here too late
for the hard-boiled eggs.

63
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:08,836
All they have
is scrambled socks.

64
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:12,499
You should've been in the army before they
taught chickens to lay powdered eggs.

65
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:16,237
World War One, I ate turnips for breakfast
every day for a month.

66
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,838
- My tongue smelled like
Arthur Murray's footbath.
- You feeling all right, Father?

67
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:22,213
- Why do you ask?
- <i>You keep pulling at your fingers.</i>

68
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:27,017
- They too close to your hands?
- I seem to be a little arthritic this morning.

69
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,354
- Off his feed too.
- You gonna finish your coffee, Father?

70
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,757
No, no.
Go right ahead, Radar.

71
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,729
Let me see
your eyes, Father.

72
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:40,097
<i>What do you think,</i>
<i>Colonel? How's his sclera?</i>

73
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,569
Slightly icteric. Let's see
underneath your tongue, Father.

74
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:47,734
- That tongue's as yellow
as the streak down my back.
- Don't touch that coffee, Radar.

75
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:51,245
- Why?
- The "Swiss Family Hepatitis"
is swimming around in there.

76
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:55,511
Oh! Gee!
Ooh, ick! I ate his sausage.

77
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:59,418
- Well, I didn't touch them.
- I know, Father. But it was yours.

78
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:02,252
I mean, no offense,
but, wow... ooh, ick!

79
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:04,258
Let's nip this in the bud.

80
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,817
I don't want to live through
another outbreak of camp jaundice.

81
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:09,955
B.J., give Father Mulcahy a blood test.
Hawkeye, examine the staff.

82
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,965
Give 'em a shot of
gamma globulin.

83
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:16,197
Radar, check the latrine area. See if the water
supply's polluted. I'll talk to the cook.

84
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,263
- Let's get busy.
- <i>[B.J.] Come on, Father.</i>

85
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:34,789
It was just laying out there in the open.
I wasn't going through your private papers.

86
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:38,155
- Relax, Frank.
I just wanna see your body.
- Don't be such a rude rodney.

87
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,990
- Frank, there's hepatitis going around.
- Hepatitis?

88
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:43,257
- Yeah. Let me see your eyes.
- Are they yellow?

89
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,731
- How's my liver? Is it tender?
- How should I know? It's your liver.

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,064
Well, feel it.

91
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:51,401
- How does that feel?
- [Giggles] Tickles.

92
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:54,965
- Frank, try to control yourself.
- Something's wrong with me.

93
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,910
- Yeah? Ever since Margaret got engaged?
- No!

94
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,777
Since I've been getting
shortness of breath and heart palpitations.

95
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,511
- Feel my chest.
- Not tonight, darling. I have a headache.

96
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,520
I have a lump here under the sternum,
and that's not supposed to be there.

97
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:08,920
- Is it?
- Frank, go like this.

98
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,290
Feels like a marble.
Not like an aggie, more like an immie.

99
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:16,023
Look, I haven't got time
to feel in your chest for marbles.

100
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:19,032
Let me get some blood. I'll give you
a shot in the behind, and I'll get out of here.

101
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,568
[Whimpers]

102
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,627
Look, while you're here?

103
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:28,768
- Mm-hmm?
- Will you check my arms?
I think my arms are getting longer.

104
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,777
Take two bananas
and call me in the morning.

105
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:33,313
- Feel under my armpit.
- Not for five bucks.

106
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,111
I've got swollen nodes,
and they're getting bigger and bigger.

107
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,175
- You know, I saw that in a movie once?
- Oh, yeah?

108
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:42,155
Yeah. This guy's nodes got so big,
eventually they took over Minneapolis.

109
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,658
And you call yourself
a doctor.

110
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:48,218
Frank, will you for cripe's sake
drop your driveling...

111
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:52,756
your hypochondria
and your pants in that order.

112
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:57,203
You're not such hot stuff. I just read about
someone from your hometown.

113
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:59,866
He got a hundred thousand dollar grant
from Boston Hospital...

114
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,136
for playing with mice.

115
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,804
Don't taunt me, Frank.
I'm holding a sharp object.

116
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,339
A hundred thousand smackers.
That's probably a thousand bucks a mouse.

117
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,944
Ow! Ouch, that hurts!
Take it out! It hurts! Take it out!

118
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:16,047
- I already took it out, Frank.
- Feels like you left a rock in there.

119
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:18,490
Maybe one slipped down
from your head.

120
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,494
<i>You broke off</i>
<i>a needle in me, didn't ya?</i>

121
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,723
These few, lovely moments with you
have contributed more...

122
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:25,322
to the pain in my back then my army cot,
and that's going some.

123
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,665
If you care anything about human life,
you'll feel my lumps before you go.

124
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:32,503
Leave 'em under my pillow.
I'll give 'em a squeeze before I go to sleep.

125
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:37,168
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

126
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:40,237
- I have to have a look at your body, Margaret.
- Ha-ha, don't you wish.

127
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,579
- Lie down in the bed
and let me feel your liver.
- That'll be the day.

128
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:46,246
- Get out of here.
- Margaret, we may be facing
a hepatitis epidemic.

129
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:50,018
- I have to examine you.
You're gonna get a shot too.
- So are you, kiddo.

130
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,150
Let's start small.
Show me your eyes.

131
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:55,390
- Outside. This bulb is too yellow.
- You're serious, aren't you?

132
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:59,866
Believe me. I wouldn't be walking around
poking people's livers if I didn't have to.

133
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,266
- All right. Show me under your tongue.
- No. That's out.

134
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:07,138
- What?
- I will not show you my tongue.
Especially not underneath.

135
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,700
- How 'bout if I show you mine first?
- I can look at my own tongue.

136
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,111
- It's okay.
- Okay? It's gorgeous.

137
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,616
- I knew it.
- I have to have some blood. Let me have a vein.

138
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:19,085
[Sighs Loudly]
Here. Hurry up.

139
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,816
Well, you're certainly braver about this
than my last patient.

140
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,517
- Who was that?
- Frank.

141
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,526
- [Scoffs]
- He's afraid his body's being attacked.

142
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:28,994
He has very little
to worry about.

143
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:32,659
How's your fiance Lieutenant Colonel
Donald Penobscott of West Point?

144
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:37,569
Fine.
He's doing very... well.

145
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:41,700
Well, that certainly sounds
extremely... satisfactory.

146
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,370
- Can I confide in you?
- Sure.

147
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,609
I've been getting some very strange letters
from Donald's mother.

148
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:50,674
- Like what?
- Like she's welcoming me into the family.

149
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,481
Well, listen.
You're not all that bad.

150
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:57,787
She's welcoming me, but in a very
left-handed way. Listen to this.

151
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:01,590
"Dear Margaret, What a pleasure
it will be to include a Houlihan in our clan.

152
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:06,157
"I've only known two Houlihans before,
and they were both charming.

153
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,260
"One was a chauffeur,
who we liked very much...

154
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:12,500
"although we had to let him go
because he drank.

155
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:16,567
"And the other was a young girl
who worked for us as a maid.

156
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:20,011
We still send her Christmas cards
every year... at the state hospital."

157
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,448
If this woman wants to start a fan club
for you, tell her to forget it.

158
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:27,511
She has me sick. I don't know what
she's telling Donald.

159
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,081
What difference does it make? He loves you.
He's not in love with the chauffeur.

160
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,423
Ready?

161
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:41,560
- Come on, Margaret. You're taking
all the fun out of it.
- Yes, that's right. I am.

162
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,968
Margaret, this is not merely
a dream come true.

163
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:47,769
- Gamma globulin goes better
in a person's caboose.
- Not this person's.

164
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:52,438
- Margaret, you're a nurse.
- Oh, all right. Let's get it over with.

165
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:55,005
My sentiments exactly.
Let us not dawdle over a moment like this.

166
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,483
Let us treat it as a professional
encounter of the most...

167
00:09:57,552 --> 00:10:00,043
Oh, Margaret, may I pause on this occasion
to express a few thoughts?

168
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,318
- If you say one word...
- Oh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't. Not a word.

169
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,916
But-But if I did, that word would be
"magnificent." Would that be bad?

170
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:09,828
- Will you please give me the shot?
- Okay. Okay.

171
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,564
There.

172
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:20,040
How dare you come in here
on the pretext of giving me a shot...

173
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:23,908
and then stand there ogling me
as though I were a sideshow attraction.

174
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:26,173
Boy, I show you a little appreciation,
and you hit the roof.

175
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,408
- What do you want from me?
- Respect.

176
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:34,046
Simple respect. I expect nothing more,
and I'll accept nothing less.

177
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:39,616
Hey, that's pretty good.
You got me with that.

178
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:42,959
- Good.
- I mean, you really did.

179
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:45,864
I bet that would work
with Donald's mother.

180
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:49,233
- What?
- Maybe not those words, but that attitude.

181
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:52,398
- Simple respect.
- Maybe.

182
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:55,307
You know, in some ways,
you really are magnificent.

183
00:10:55,376 --> 00:11:00,541
- And not just on the outside.
- Thank you.

184
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,106
- You wanna give me a shot?
- Buzz off!

185
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,549
Just asking.

186
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:08,678
<i>[Man On P.A.] Attention all personnel.</i>
<i>Incoming. Incoming.</i>

187
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:09,788
<i>Welcoming committee to the helipad.</i>
<i>There will be a slight lull in our lull.</i>

188
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:12,848
<i>Welcoming committee to the helipad.</i>
<i>There will be a slight lull in our lull.</i>

189
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:17,088
I don't know what we're gonna do
with this boy over here.

190
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,465
- Oh, God.
- I sent for Hawkeye.

191
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,694
- I think we need another opinion.
- How'd this happen?

192
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,966
He's a tank driver.
When a shell gets inside one of those tubs...

193
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:30,201
it just ricochets around,
chews up everything in its path.

194
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:33,176
- Where do you start?
- I'm here.

195
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:35,509
What's the matter with you?
You're all bent over.

196
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,071
- Who told you?
- You're turning into a question mark.

197
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,813
And the question is how I got this way.
Pretty bad, huh?

198
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,685
Among other things,
he has no stomach to speak of.

199
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,520
- I know they could deal
with this down in Seoul.
- But the trip might kill him.

200
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:50,527
And if one of us tried it
up here, we might kill him.

201
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:53,655
- What do you think?
- You're the chief surgeon. You tell me.

202
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:57,566
He'll need a partial gastrectomy,
maybe even a total.

203
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:00,628
I think B.J. oughta do it. He's the closest
we come to an expert on this.

204
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,866
Expert? I've never done this before.
I've only read about it.

205
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,774
Well, that puts you one up on
the rest of us. Work from the book.

206
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:09,940
- Suppose I make a mistake?
- Suppose we send him down to Seoul
on the buckboard express?

207
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:13,473
- He'll be off your conscience,
but he won't be any more alive.
- It's a tough choice.

208
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:16,180
Fine. Take your time.
What are you gonna do?

209
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,723
All right. I'll do it. Look at this.
I'm sweating already.

210
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,727
Go scrub.
Carmine, prep him.

211
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:26,559
Pierce, see me in my office later
about your back.

212
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,428
Why? Is something wrong with my back?

213
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,491
[Hawkeye Groans]

214
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,537
[Mumbling]

215
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:37,034
"In the colon, transected..."

216
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,770
- What the hell are you doing?
- I wanna see if you got hepatitis...

217
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,439
- before you put your hands in that guy.
- I gave myself a blood test.

218
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:45,779
- Leave me alone, will ya?
- Mind if I give you a shot
while you're scrubbing up?

219
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,785
I'm trying to read.
Will you get out of here?

220
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:50,378
Look, I gotta jab 15 people
before I go to sleep tonight.

221
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:54,858
- Otherwise this entire staff
will be flat on its livers.
- See me after the operation.

222
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:57,190
I'll be waiting at the stage door
with a flower in my buttonhole.

223
00:12:57,262 --> 00:13:02,063
- The Swamp, 10:00.
- Good luck, Beej.

224
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,931
Let's see, "The
terminal ileum is divided...

225
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:08,837
five inches proximal
to the ileocecal valve."

226
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,502
God. Let's jump to the end and see how
this operation turns out.

227
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,647
- How you feeling, Father?
- Uh, fine actually.

228
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,986
- Well, weak, really.
- I brought you some juice.

229
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:29,993
- Oh, thank you.
- Your blood test showed hepatitis.

230
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,859
Probably infectious. We're gonna have
to isolate you for a week or so.

231
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:36,458
You mean I can't see people?
How will I hear confessions tomorrow night?

232
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:39,936
Well, maybe they can write their sins on pieces
of paper and slip them under the door.

233
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,940
- Possibly.
- Then we can auction off the pieces of paper...

234
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,875
and make a fortune
for the orphanage.

235
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:49,607
How am I going to
administer the sacraments?

236
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:52,775
How can I give Holy Communion?
I can't place the Eucharist on their tongues.

237
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:55,615
- I'll infect them all.
- You're gonna have to take
a rain check for a while.

238
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:59,020
What if somebody needs
last rites in the O.R.?

239
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,527
People are depending on me.
I really don't feel all that bad, you know.

240
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:07,224
- You wanna kill yourself?
- Well, at least let's rig up something...

241
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,631
so I can hear confessions
through a flap in the tent.

242
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,794
- Father, you have to rest a little.
- No, no, no, no. Look here.

243
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,862
You don't understand.
Their souls are in my charge.

244
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,773
- Father, you're sick.
- Well, so are you.

245
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,640
Look at your back. That's not stopping you
from doing your work.

246
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:24,614
All right. I'll work out
a light confession schedule for you.

247
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:27,049
Maybe people can cut down
on their sinning and give you a break.

248
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:30,212
- I'm hearing confessions, and that's it.
- All right. Get a little rest.

249
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:31,880
Nobody's pushing
me around.

250
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,192
Good afternoon, Klinger.
I'm checking for hepatitis.

251
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,491
- Drop your pants and show me your eyes.
- Forget it, sir.

252
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:40,793
The last time I dropped my pants,
they put me in the army.

253
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:44,130
The next time I drop 'em, it's to stick 'em
out the porthole and wave bye-bye.

254
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:47,194
- How are your eyes?
- Bloodshot from pounding potatoes.

255
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,866
Come on, Klinger. I want to get home
and slip into some comfortable traction.

256
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:54,344
Here. They look like potato eyes, right?
You are what you mash.

257
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:56,642
- Show me your tongue.
- Gladly.

258
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,275
- Let me see the underside.
- Wait, I'll stand on my head.

259
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,080
What are you so cranky about?

260
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:05,111
Because I drew K.P. 30 straight days
for punching out Zale.

261
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,182
I should get a medal for that.
We're supposed to fight the enemy, aren't we?

262
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,887
You're fighting Zale again?
What about?

263
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:13,430
Aw, it's stupid.
He insulted the Toledo Mud Hens.

264
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:15,796
I take it that's a baseball team
and not yesterday's lunch.

265
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,131
The trouble is
I got a short fuse.

266
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:21,695
My wife, Laverne, keeps writing me,
"When you get angry, count to 10...

267
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,707
and ask St. Anthony for help."

268
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:28,838
I go one, two, three... pow!

269
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:32,007
Once I got to eight.
I never needed any help from St. Anthony.

270
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,644
- I'm too hot-blooded.
- Let me draw a little of
that hot blood from your vein.

271
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,120
- I really gotta work on it.
- Yeah, right.

272
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:40,885
- I can't stand myself when I lose my temper.
- Hold still, will ya?

273
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,451
Sure. So he insults the Mud Hens.
What does he know?

274
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,589
I should get excited over an ignorant remark
from a stupid idiot like him?

275
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,725
- Hold it, will ya?
Talk with the other hand.
- Sure.

276
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:53,293
I'm not wasting my time on him.
That dumb jerk!

277
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:59,400
- Excuse me.
- You want me to stab myself?
Just hold still.

278
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,411
- Right.
- All right?

279
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:06,883
He's always making cracks about my lingerie.
He just doesn't have the guts.

280
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,283
I'd like to see him
in a panty girdle!

281
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:15,792
Sorry. I didn't mean to
raise my voice.

282
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,023
Can I have a little cooperation? The pain
in my back is beginning to grow roots.

283
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:23,227
I gotta calm down.
I don't care what he says about me.

284
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:27,135
But he mentions the Mud Hens again,
he's getting it right in the puss!

285
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,641
- Will you watch it?
- I'm sorry. Did I hurt ya?

286
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:35,236
Fortunately,
I'm in a permanent duck.

287
00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:40,876
Look, during a physical examination,
I'm supposed to get physical, not you.

288
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:42,943
- Now get over there.
- Sir.

289
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:47,214
- Give me that.
- Here, take it.

290
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,123
- Sir?
- Uh-huh?

291
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:52,186
If you find out I got hepatitis,
I'm gonna kiss Zale right on the mouth.

292
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,561
I'm very happy for you.

293
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,829
"The ileocolic segment
is turned upward...

294
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:02,669
and the end of the ileum anastomosed
to the end of the esophagus..." blues.

295
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:04,675
Everything under control?

296
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:08,509
You know what this reminds me of?
Assembling those toys I got as a kid.

297
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,071
Fold Flap "A" into Slot "B."

298
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,140
I could never tell
my flap from my slot.

299
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:17,416
- You can't find that kid's Flap "A,"
don't guess.
- I'm all right.

300
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:21,585
It's amazing how much you can tell
from a few drops of blood though, isn't it?

301
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:26,187
- Yep.
- You could tell everything from
a guy's blood, can't you?

302
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:29,563
Everything that's
fit to print.

303
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:34,571
- It's really sort of fascinating, isn't it?
- I'm all a-tingle myself.

304
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,632
- What are you worried about, Radar?
- Oh, nothing, uh.

305
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,304
Well, I mean, it was just
that I was wondering if...

306
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:45,076
if you could tell if a guy has any,
you know, special problems.

307
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,678
Like, uh, like he's anemic
or, uh, he isn't red-blooded enough or...

308
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:54,453
- What's the matter?
- Well, I'll tell ya.

309
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:58,986
Um, sometimes I go out with the guys.
You know, like to Rosie's Bar?

310
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:01,930
We really have a good time.
We're always, uh, singing...

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,561
<i>and laughing and telling</i>
<i>what we're gonna do after the war.</i>

312
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:10,233
Then a couple of guys will start joking
with some of the business girls.

313
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,037
And before I know it,
I start to feel different.

314
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:16,706
- Different?
- I get sleepy.

315
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:19,375
And you're afraid there's something
wrong with you?

316
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,213
No. Is there?

317
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,652
Yeah. You're suffering from
a severe case of decency.

318
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:28,385
I mean, I really wish I could have a good time
like they do, you know?

319
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,189
I mean, just bust out and drink
and tell lies to strange girls...

320
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:34,754
and come back to camp the next morning
without any sleep and throw up all day.

321
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,627
I really wish I could...
at least just once.

322
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:47,240
Look, everybody's
different, Radar.

323
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,644
You're here with a bunch of guys
you'll probably never see again.

324
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:53,445
You don't have to
try to be like them.

325
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,248
You know, most people act crazy
when they're out of town.

326
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,290
- Hmm.
- But you're different.

327
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:02,622
You always take a little bit
of Iowa with you wherever you go.

328
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:06,425
That's nice.
Don't try to change that.

329
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:09,557
Someday you'll meet somebody
that you'd like to introduce to your mom.

330
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,170
And instead of taking
advantage of her...

331
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,231
you'll offer her a gift
you've been working on all your life.

332
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:19,970
Yourself.

333
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,376
And believe me,
you won't get sleepy.

334
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:28,576
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. [Sniffles]

335
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,883
Thanks.

336
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:34,447
I hate to say this at this point,
but would you drop your pants?

337
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,422
Now, the first time
they did this operation...

338
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:41,294
they came up with an ileocolic segment
that was gangrenous.

339
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,699
This guy doesn't even have that end
of his ileum, so I guess we can forget that.

340
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,034
Did you do a splenectomy,
or did the shell fragment do it for you?

341
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,404
I did some.
The North Koreans did the rest.

342
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:55,469
My God, don't they know this poor guy's
still got a few payments left on his house?

343
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:59,243
I guess his neighbors down at the draft board
didn't mention that in his letter of reference.

344
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,718
- Cut.
- <i>It looks to me like</i>
<i>you oughta bejust about done.</i>

345
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,847
One more stitch, I'll be ready
to start closing. How's he doing?

346
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,518
Stable, Doctor.

347
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,823
I think he's going to make it.
[Chuckles]

348
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:13,796
Cut.

349
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:17,995
There. [Exhales]
I just knitted a soldier.

350
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:22,062
- #<i>#[Big Band]</i>
- I was supposed to give you a shot
in the Swamp at 10:00.

351
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,904
- What are you doing here?
- Hawkeye, Hawkeye,
Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Hawkeye!

352
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,342
I did it! I saved him.
He's alive!

353
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:30,575
- Louis Pasteur couldn't have put it better.
- I'm a life-giver.

354
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:33,412
Congratulations. Really, I mean it.
Show me your tongue.

355
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:37,614
My tongue? That's small potatoes.
I'll show you my butt!

356
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:42,183
Hey! Hey, everybody. All right, all right,
all right. All right.

357
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,694
- Give me your attention.
- A simple "Ah" would be sufficient.

358
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,322
In celebration of the world's
most difficult surgery...

359
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,332
and the world's most
wonderful surgeon...

360
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,062
snatching life out
of the jaws of death...

361
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:56,664
we unveil for you now,
the Hippocrates of Ouijongbu.

362
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:59,232
[Whistling, Cheering]

363
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:08,274
## [Singing]

364
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:17,659
- ## [Continues]
- Dip, Baker, dip!

365
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:25,368
## [Ends]

366
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:27,666
[Cheering]

367
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:35,174
- Uh-huh.
- There's no contamination
of the water supply.

368
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,214
The patient we had here
three weeks ago showed up...

369
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:41,217
in Seoul with a severe case
of infectious hepatitis.

370
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:44,550
Let's hope Father Mulcahy caught it
from him, and this will be the end of it.

371
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:46,783
[Exhales]
I'm for that.

372
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:50,385
- Okay. Now, what's with you?
- What's with me?

373
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:52,943
You been walking around
like Lon Chaney's stand-in.

374
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:55,704
At first I thought it was pleurisy.
Then I thought maybe a disc.

375
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:59,010
- I don't know what it is.
- I hear you've been reading
your hometown newspaper.

376
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,709
You think they're
poisoning the ink?

377
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,718
I think maybe you haven't
made up your mind...

378
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:05,482
how you feel about being over here,
feeding the fleas.

379
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:09,458
As far as I'm concerned, the fleas can eat
out at the Chinese restaurant down the street.

380
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:14,987
How do you feel about spending
the war over here, even though
you're <i>not</i> incredibly average.

381
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,801
- I guess I'm angry.
- <i>How do you feel about being angry?</i>

382
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:24,068
[Sighs] You think I'm mad,
and I won't admit it, huh?

383
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:29,238
I think you're gonna come out of this war with
a merit badge for tying yourself up in knots.

384
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:32,077
Here, take a belt of that.

385
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:35,414
Can I tell you something
as a friend? A tough friend?

386
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,578
Tough friends last longer.

387
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:42,648
When I was an enlisted man, I was short.
Not like I am now.

388
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,694
For a while there,
I thought I'd look taller...

389
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,753
if I could knock a few of the big guys
flat on their backs.

390
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:52,325
Then it dawned on me.
I was just fighting myself
and using their ribs to hurt my hands on.

391
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:56,065
Fig Newtons and Scotch.

392
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:01,600
Listen, it's too big a world to be
in competition with everybody else.

393
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:05,546
The only guy I have to get better
than is who I am right now.

394
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:09,882
<i>And in your case,</i>
<i>that's tough enough.</i>

395
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,353
They're great
if you dunk 'em.

396
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:17,455
So what do I do about
incredibly average Vernon Parsons?

397
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:21,520
Relax. Let him have his little research grant.
Live and let live.

398
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:25,932
And then just to give yourself a little
present, send him an anonymous letter.

399
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,665
That's not a bad idea.

400
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,707
I could tell him I saw him
cheating on an exam once.

401
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:33,208
Tell him you're filing
a malpractice suit.

402
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:37,076
- I'm beginning to feel better.
- Tell him you're filing a paternity suit.

403
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:41,140
[Laughing]
Doctor, Doctor, I can walk.

404
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,956
- Hey, B. J!
- Quiet. Quiet.

405
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,549
- You know what your trouble is?
- Yes, I'm dying.

406
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:53,255
- That's not your trouble.
- Right. My trouble is
I'm not dying fast enough.

407
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,298
- You don't get enough exercise.
- Uh-huh.

408
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:59,096
The cure for a hangover is to get the blood
out of your keister and into your brain.

409
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,797
- Watch this.
- What?

410
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:04,033
Hey, Hawkeye, come on.
Don't do that. That's dangerous.

411
00:24:04,107 --> 00:24:06,041
Are you kidding?
I'm in perfect control.

412
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,043
Come on.
Don't fool around, Hawkeye.

413
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:11,478
- Ow! My head.
- [Hawkeye] My back!

414
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,039
- My head!
- [Hawkeye] My back!
