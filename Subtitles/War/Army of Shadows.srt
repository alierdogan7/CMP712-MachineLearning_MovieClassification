1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:18,560
"Bad memories: be yet welcomed...
you are my distant youth..."

2
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,220
Army in the Shadows

3
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,820
October 20, 1942

4
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,083
- Do you mind if we stop for a while?
- Not at all.

5
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,093
It won't take too long.

6
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,095
Just some shopping.

7
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,098
You have to sort it out for yourself
these days.

8
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,099
It's very understandable.

9
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,090
You will be alright in this camp.

10
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,104
The best camp in France!

11
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,093
This camp was for Germans.

12
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,50
I'm not sure I understand.

13
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,100
At the beginning of the war, we were
expecting a lot of german prisoners.

14
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:32,080
But of course there were none.

15
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:35,083
However, this camp is very useful now.

16
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,084
What good luck!

17
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,080
You said it!

18
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:33,097
Always the same; don't know who they
are, or how to treat them.

19
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:37,101
Some of them arrive without being charged
and stay forever.

20
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:42,072
Some, who committed crimes,
get out very quickly and become influential...

21
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,077
in the department,
or in the Vichy government.

22
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,082
Philippe Gerbier, 41 years old.
Engineer.

23
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:59,005
Vivid and independent mind.
Distant and ironic.

24
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,091
To subdue.

25
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:06,097
Seems to be influential.
To be treated gently.

26
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,070
Suspected of Gaullist thinking.
To subdue.

27
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:20,077
Set free by lack of evidence:
influential, to be treated gently.

28
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:30,087
The room you are going to
was for german officers.

29
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,091
I'm honored.

30
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,073
Certainly to be treated gently...

31
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:53,077
and certainly with caution.

32
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,093
Philippe Gerbier

33
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,095
Colonel Jarret Du Plessis

34
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:12,100
I don't know why you are here
but I'll tell you why I was arrested.

35
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,093
I said in a café that
Admiral Darlant was a bastard.

36
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:22,110
And Marechal Petain is a bastard also,
whose treatment of soldiers is reprehensible.

37
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,101
You, Colonel, have the chance
to suffer for your opinions.

38
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,102
Aubert, a druggist.

39
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,117
Do you know, Sir,
what a Mallert Shell is?

40
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,118
No.

41
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:35,078
It's a component of a
certain chemical reaction.

42
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,083
I am a chemist and I had to keep
a Mallert Shell.

43
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,097
I was censured for shell possession,

44
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,088
and no one would listen to any explications.

45
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,089
Octave Bonnafous.

46
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,104
Business man.

47
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:53,097
I unfortunately stumbled into
a Gaullist meeting...

48
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:56,111
No more laws!
Only bastards!

49
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,100
They took my pension away!

50
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,115
Where should I settle in?

51
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:07,112
As the room leader, allow me
to assign you this free mattress.

52
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,088
I am Legrain, communist.

53
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,091
Here's Armel, teacher and catholic.

54
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,104
Is he sleeping?

55
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,105
No, he's very sick.

56
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,108
No infirmary?

57
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,099
Already full.

58
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,111
Do you play dominos?

59
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm afraid not.

60
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,114
We'll teach you.

61
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:36,117
Thank you, but I would rather not.

62
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:41,111
Excuse us then, but we must finish playing
before they turn off the light.

63
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,090
The Commandant is not as stupid as he looks.

64
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:49,090
He put me in with three idiots
and two lost children.

65
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,105
Going for a walk?

66
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,096
I'm working in the power station.

67
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,109
Well done!

68
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:38,102
I don't get paid,
but I like it and wish to practice.

69
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,081
See you later, comrade!

70
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,099
Are you communist?

71
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,090
No, but we're comrades all the same.

72
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,104
There are people here
from every country.

73
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,080
Russians.

74
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,085
Poles.

75
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:36,092
Algerians.

76
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,120
Jews from all over,

77
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,089
Gypsies.

78
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:11,094
Yugoslavians.

79
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:15,099
Romanian, Czech.

80
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:20,115
Germans against Nazism,
Italians against Fascism.

81
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,106
Spanish against Franco,

82
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:30,114
And some others,
arrested for smuggling.

83
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,094
You alright?

84
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:29,105
I managed the installation
of powerlines in Savoie.

85
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,108
You're an electrician?

86
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:37,150
- Just like you.
- Surely you're more qualified than I.

87
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:41,149
Maybe we could talk about it sometime.

88
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,118
Of course.

89
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,099
With pleasure.

90
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:53,107
The young teacher died one night,
silently.

91
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:58,101
The Algerians carried his body away.
I never heard him speak.

92
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:41,111
I'm not sad.
He's in a better place.

93
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,100
All debts will be paid one day.

94
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,103
Mister Gerbier.

95
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:13,110
I wish to speak with you tonight.

96
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,93
There are two obstacles to escape;
barbed wire and guards.

97
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:44,107
We can pass under the barbed wire,

98
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:49,115
and I can blind the guards
by turning off all the lights.

99
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,115
Why haven't you escaped yet?

100
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:57,120
I didn't want to escape alone,
and leave Armelle.

101
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,089
But I trust you.

102
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,101
Why are you telling me this?

103
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,125
I think you're needed on the outside.

104
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,100
Turn off the light and go to sleep.

105
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,101
Good night.

106
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,105
Secretly, between us,

107
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,107
the escape plan was taking shape.

108
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,098
Little by little.

109
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,107
Gerbier, come here.

110
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,109
Get ready.

111
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,120
Hurry please.

112
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,092
Please salute Legrain for me.

113
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:58,115
- There are the bastards.
- But...

114
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,102
Farewell, Sir.

115
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:34,115
Allow me, please.

116
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,104
Thanks.

117
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:03,126


118
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:08,131


119
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,101


120
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,117


121
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:17,118


122
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:19,109


123
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,128


124
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:30,120


125
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,119
There's just one chance.

126
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,123
I'll ask the soldier for something,

127
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:46,129
and then you'll cross the two gates.

128
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,099
Good luck.

129
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,105
Excuse me sir, do you have a cigarette?

130
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,111


131
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,136
What do you want?

132
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I'd like a shave.

133
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,137
<i>Marechal has said... Marechal has accomplished...</i>
<i>Marechal keeps his promises.</i>

134
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,109
There you go.

135
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,128
I'll get your change.

136
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:37,117
- No wait...
- Wait for your change.

137
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:45,127
Take this.

138
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,132
Not very much, but it's all I have.

139
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,135
Thank you.

140
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:12,121
Paul Dounat received orders
from his organization.

141
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:19,120
He had to be in front of
the Marseilles courts

142
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,132
at noon, and wait there
for a friend he knew.

143
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,129
Police. Papers please.

144
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:04,151
All right.
But follow me anyway.

145
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,118
For a simple check.

146
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,113
Dirty job.

147
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,129
Felix, put on your hat.

148
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,120
No need in the car.

149
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:57,126
This is the guy who betrayed you.

150
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:03,132
I don't think there's any need to question you.

151
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:18,114
We should have refused him.
It's my fault.

152
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:22,129
So much to do,
and such little help.

153
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,120
Bison, faster please.

154
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,134
They'll notice us.

155
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:32,128
I'm also in a hurry.
I have to repair a radio, 

156
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:38,145
and a young agent's bicycle.
And prepare tonight's reception.

157
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,147
Do you have the fake papers?

158
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:43,139
Yes, do you want them now?

159
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,110
The car must stay here.

160
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,150
It might be noticed.

161
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,100
- We'll take a walk.
- I'll come with you.

162
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,147
Not necessary.

163
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,136
Indeed.

164
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,142
I suppose not.

165
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,131
I'll pick you up later tonight.

166
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,145
One false move, and I shoot you.

167
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:24,151
Hell, when we rented this house,
the other one was empty!

168
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,140
Let's go anyway.

169
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:36,129
This way.

170
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,110
Is he the traitor that we're supposed to...

171
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,121
Yes, he is.

172
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:42,123
And are you the boss?

173
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:55,148
He is Claude LeMasque.
He's asked for harder assignments.

174
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,123
I came one hour earlier
to get everything ready...

175
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:02,140
and noticed that
some neighbors had arrived.

176
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,155
There was nobody yesterday!

177
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:07,160
I called immediately,
but you had already left.

178
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,001
It'll be alright.

179
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:12,122
We can begin the interrogating. 

180
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:14,123
I prepared chairs, desk, paper...

181
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,136
This is not a trial.

182
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,080
Here's what it's about.

183
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,140
No way!
The neighbors will hear everything!

184
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,131
Listen...

185
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,147
The walls are paper-thin.

186
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:30,149
The English didn't deliver on
the silenced guns we requested.

187
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,142
Let's look for a better place.

188
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,148
How could you do it?

189
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,124
There's no better place.

190
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,126
The cellar won't work.

191
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,131
And neither will the attic.

192
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,134
We will need a good knife.

193
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,138
Bison has one.

194
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,153
A knife? Are you kidding?

195
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,042
I can't let you do that.

196
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:12,159
Felix! Go look for something
in the kitchen.

197
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,128
Please don't do this.
It's murder!

198
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,120
We are here to kill, regardless.

199
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,135
That's true, but not like this.

200
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:24,126
I know what you mean.

201
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:30,132
I swear I am not scared,
but this is my first time ...

202
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:34,146
This is our first time also,
can't you see?

203
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:36,150
I didn't find anything.

204
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,154
Maybe we could wait for Bison?

205
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,155
No, out of the question.

206
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,147
We must finish it now.

207
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,148
Bloody hell!

208
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:51,150
We can't just smash his head in, can we?

209
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,125
Gag him.

210
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:39,134
We must strangle him.

211
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,139
With our bare hands?

212
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,143
No.
There's a towel in the kitchen.

213
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:03,135
Enough!
You came here for this!

214
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:08,150
You wanted a harder assignment?
Here it is, so don't complain.

215
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,139
Make him sit down.

216
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,141
Felix, go behind.

217
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,133
I will hold his hands
and Masque will grab his legs.

218
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,145
I promise you won't suffer.

219
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,153
We're leaving.

220
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,155
I'm coming.

221
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:05,140
I could not imagine
this was possible.

222
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,141
Neither could I.

223
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,148
Get some cyanide pills.

224
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,152
And if you're arrested, eat them.

225
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,154
I will.

226
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:40,134
A glass of rum.

227
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:19,140
- Jean François!
- Felix!

228
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,159
It's been a long time.
Still young and handsome.

229
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,162
What are you doing in Marseilles?

230
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:33,166
I moved my workshop here from Paris.

231
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,155
And you?

232
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,157
Nothing special.

233
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:42,141
I have to go.
Can you walk a bit with me?

234
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,130
Alright, let's go.

235
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:48,147
Can you wait five minutes?

236
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:50,138
Five minutes.
Not my whole life.

237
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,151
Always lucky!

238
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,154
A bit risky to wear a pilot's jacket?

239
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,155
Fuck them.

240
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,157
- And then?
- And then what?

241
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,127
Just fuck them?

242
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,142
What else? Fight?

243
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,133
I know some more exciting things.

244
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,146
Really exciting?

245
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:21,135
Yes.

246
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:26,141
You'll have to get up early,
sleep on the train, on the road,

247
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,155
without reasons or explanations.

248
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,144
I'm interested.

249
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,159
Come and see me tomorrow,
here's my address.

250
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,010
No, don't write it down.
Just remember it.

251
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,165
And never tell a soul.

252
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,166
Of course.

253
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,100
Everyone says that...
but even a girlfriend...

254
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,040
I don't have one. 

255
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,150
The girl in the bar?

256
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,100
I told her 5 minutes...
she'll have to wait a few more.

257
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,142
Parents you like to talk with...

258
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:51,133
They all died.

259
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,136
Just one brother,
who stayed in Paris.

260
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:59,151
I love him.
But would never confide in him.

261
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,152
<i>Theater and Music Center.</i>

262
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,171
Do you have an appointment?

263
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,160
With Mr. Russel.

264
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:21,162
This way, please.

265
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:37,156
I came as quickly as I could.

266
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,158
It's very urgent indeed.

267
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:42,150
How many people to board
for Gibraltar?

268
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:45,164
Two canadian officers,
from Dieppe commando,

269
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:48,156
three aviators from R.A.F.,

270
00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:52,171
and also two Belgians
sentenced to death by Germans.

271
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:54,173
Eight including me.

272
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:58,166
Where will they wait for the submarine?
The doctor's clinic is under surveillance.

273
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,148
Couldn't we send them outside,
a few at a time?

274
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,141
No, too dangerous.

275
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:12,147
A Canadian officer will want to go into a café
and talk, forgetting his accent.

276
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:18,153
We will be informed of the submarine
arrival just one day in advance.

277
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,168
Everyone must go to the Viella farm.

278
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:23,157
Everyone?

279
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,173
It's not very safe...

280
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,164
We are not an insurance company.

281
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,167
On the contrary, indeed!

282
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,148
You must choose a real trustworthy man
to supervise everything.

283
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,154
I have this man.
You don't know him.

284
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:45,010
He did a very good job
on several recent missions.

285
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,160
He is now in Paris.
To deliver a new radio to Matilda.

286
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,145
- When will he be back?
- Tomorrow morning.

287
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:58,171
Contact him immediately.
Everything must be ready by tomorrow night.

288
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:00,162
I'll be there at the last second.

289
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,177
And take a break.

290
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:06,005
When you will be gone.

291
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:09,170
No, now.
There'll be no time after that.

292
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:59,155
<i>The luggages will be checked</i>
<i>inside the station.</i>

293
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:41,162
Need some help?

294
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,159
Goodbye.

295
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:28,143
Open your case.

296
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,161
No smuggled goods?

297
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,162
No.

298
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:37,151
What is this?

299
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,168
Just a radio.

300
00:46:42,168 --> 00:46:44,159
Okay, you can go.

301
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:54,169
Madam, please, luggage check.

302
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:12,153


303
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,164
Any trouble?

304
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:29,147
Not really. Stopped twice.

305
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:46,154
Tell Felix we need a new quartz.
The frequency has changed.

306
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,157
Alright. May I help you?

307
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:51,158
Certainly not.

308
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:31,150
The second radio is in the case.

309
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,179
Okay. Want something to eat?

310
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,168
No, thanks. I'm going to surprise someone...

311
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,158
Hello, Saint-Luc!

312
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,160
Ah, little Jean!

313
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:39,166
Still so many books around...

314
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,170
And the music instruments...

315
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,171
Nothing's changed.

316
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:50,189
The temperature has changed!

317
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:54,148
So I bought this,
in order to avoid freezing.

318
00:49:57,163 --> 00:50:00,166
I stay there when I work at night
or when I eat.

319
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,158
But how did you get here?

320
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,171
Hope you have a permit.

321
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,174
Oh! Saint-Luc is back to earth.

322
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:12,010
He knows about the permit!

323
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,100
Of course I've got one.
And even...

324
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,184
...and I'm even very hungry.

325
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:19,185
We're going to eat.

326
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,186
Marie.

327
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:21,175
Yes, Mr. Luc.

328
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:24,190
What do we have on today's menu?

329
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,158
Some rutabaga like yesterday.

330
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,160
And? 

331
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,149
Some unticketed cheese.

332
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:36,168
A little butter, but no bread.

333
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,159
I have tickets for bread,

334
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:42,163
and I can give all of them to you.

335
00:50:46,178 --> 00:50:49,181
You're not resourceful.
You're still greedy.

336
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,184
So I am, but what can I do?

337
00:50:52,184 --> 00:50:55,187
What about smuggling?

338
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:57,010
Marie is afraid of cops...
And I...

339
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,179
And you also...

340
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:17,165
It's becoming warmer.

341
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:23,100
I felt very warm this morning.
Twice.

342
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:29,177
So many people on the train or the metro...

343
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:39,155
I was wondering if Matilda,
that I knew only a little bit...

344
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:42,168
was not closer to me than you,
my brother,

345
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:47,100
who I have so much love for,
but with whom I share so few things.

346
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:01,176
I went back to Marseilles the same day,

347
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:07,148
but today I had a very strange feeling.

348
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:11,179
Hello Mrs. Vialla.
Your home has become an hotel!

349
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,149
Hello!

350
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,152
- Hello!
- Good evening sir.

351
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:28,163
The fishing boat will await you
after midnight.

352
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,175
Maybe you can all sail together.

353
00:53:30,175 --> 00:53:35,185
Mrs. Vialla's daughter
will lead you there, surreptitiously.

354
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,190
Perfect.

355
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,005
Am I leaving?

356
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:41,180
No. There's one more passenger.
Unexpected.

357
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:43,188
The big boss.

358
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:46,156
But he will not sail with us.
We're full.

359
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:48,170
You will board with him.
Somewhere else.

360
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,161
Bison will bring him.

361
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:53,165
You'll wait for my light signal.
Three short and one long.

362
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:54,154
Got it.

363
00:53:59,171 --> 00:54:03,175
Madame, we will leave.
How much do I owe you?

364
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:05,166
You can pay later.

365
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,181
You already told me that before.

366
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:11,172
Yet you came back,
so you must like the welcome.

367
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:16,188
You will walk in single file.

368
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:20,192
Not too near,
but always keeping watch over each other.

369
00:54:20,192 --> 00:54:25,186
Not a sound, not a word.

370
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:14,020
Keep quiet, I have a gun!

371
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:17,168
- What are you doing here at night?
- And you?

372
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:19,173
I'm Mrs. Vialla's brother-in-law.

373
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,174
The nurse?

374
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:25,190
I'm verifying that everything is alright.

375
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,191
And then?

376
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,194
It's okay, a police patrol has just departed.

377
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:34,010
Germans are too few and get lost.
So they trust the customs.

378
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,100
And the customs?

379
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,170
The customs? But I am the customs!

380
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,182
I am the only one in charge
in this area.

381
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:41,161
No kidding!

382
00:56:23,182 --> 00:56:24,171
Get on board!

383
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:53,166
Good luck, boss.

384
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:03,177
So strange to think the big boss
looks like any other man.

385
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:09,010
Here in this boat, where base and
tip of the pyramid meet.

386
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,199
Strange.

387
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,168
I'll have to talk with Saint-Luc
about it after the war.

388
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:23,163


389
00:57:25,177 --> 00:57:27,179


390
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,170


391
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:33,174
Watch your steps sir.

392
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:45,186


393
00:57:58,176 --> 00:58:00,178
I'm so happy to be travelling with you.

394
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,167
I feel the same.

395
00:59:01,173 --> 00:59:04,165


396
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,175
I cannot deliver you all the weapons
you asked me for.

397
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:20,192
The English don't believe too much in
the efficiency of the French resistance.

398
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:23,184
They want to keep as many planes
as possible to bomb Germany.

399
00:59:24,196 --> 00:59:26,185
But we will improve 
your transmission equipment.

400
00:59:26,198 --> 00:59:30,168
So we'll send you some radio operators,

401
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:33,171
and we'll help your agents

402
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,163
to improve the landing place
that we will really need for later.
