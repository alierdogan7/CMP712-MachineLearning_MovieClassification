1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,548
MOTHER NIGHT

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,560
"Police"

3
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,723
"Haifa, Israel 1961"

4
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,763
Do you prefer German or English?

5
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
English.

6
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,767
You are to write down your memoirs
for the Haifa Institute...

7
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,770
for the documentation
of war criminals.

8
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,763
You have three weeks to complete
your memoirs before your trial begins.

9
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,778
Do you have any questions?

10
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,771
No. This is great.
Thanks for everything.

11
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,809
"Jews, Negroes...
Mongrel"

12
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,824
<i>You are the only man I know who has</i>
<i>a bad conscience about the war.</i>

13
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
Who is this?

14
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,844
Bernard Liebman.

15
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,848
I have guard duty
from 2:00 till 10:00.

16
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
Oh. I see.

17
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
Everyone else on either side...

18
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,855
is convinced he couldn't have acted
in any other way.

19
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,858
How do you know I have
a bad conscience?

20
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,861
The way you talk
in your sleep.

21
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,854
I can tell something
is troubling you.

22
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,860
What do you imagine
is troubling me, Bernard Liebman?

23
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,877
All I heard were
a couple of names.

24
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,881
"Helga" was one.

25
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,884
"Hoess" was the other one.

26
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,887
I knew Hoess.

27
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
He had no trouble sleeping.

28
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,882
Slept like a baby
right up to the end.

29
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
You know this?

30
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,889
I guess so.

31
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,895
I helped hang him.

32
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,900
- With your testimony?
- No.

33
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,916
With my hands.

34
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,909
Did that give you
lots of satisfaction?

35
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,925
My job was to strap his ankles.

36
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,918
I did a very good job.

37
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
I see.

38
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,938
Afterwards, I packed my bags
to go home.

39
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940
The catch on my suitcase
was broken...

40
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,933
so I buckled it shut
with a big leather strap.

41
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,949
Twice, within one hour...

42
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,953
I did the very same job.

43
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,956
Once to Hoess...

44
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,960
once to my suitcase.

45
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,953
Both jobs felt about the same.

46
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,963
Yeah.

47
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>I, Howard W. Campbell, Jr.,</i>
<i>am an American by birth...</i>

48
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,004
<i>a Nazi by reputation...</i>

49
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,008
<i>and a nationless person</i>
<i>by inclination.</i>

50
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,001
<i>I am awaiting a fair trial for</i>
<i>my war crimes by the state of Israel.</i>

51
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,010
<i>I was born in Schenectady, New York,</i>
<i>on February 16, 1904.</i>

52
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>My father was raised</i>
<i>in Tennessee...</i>

53
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
<i>the son of a Baptist minister.</i>

54
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,022
<i>He was a service engineer</i>
<i>for General Electric.</i>

55
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>Because of his work...</i>

56
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,042
<i>most of his reading consisted</i>
<i>of tradejournals and technical books.</i>

57
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,035
<i>There were a few</i>
<i>notable exceptions.</i>

58
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,050
Howard!

59
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,064
<i>In 1919, when General Electric</i>
<i>relocated my father...</i>

60
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,069
<i>we left Schenectady</i>
<i>and moved to Berlin, Germany.</i>

61
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,084
<i>By 1938...</i>

62
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>I had become a successful</i>
<i>playwright in the German language...</i>

63
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,091
<i>and I had married</i>
<i>the young, beautiful...</i>

64
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,084
<i>and famous German actress Helga Noth.</i>

65
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,103
<i>When my parents left Germany...</i>

66
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,107
<i>they asked me to return</i>
<i>to the United States with them.</i>

67
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>I didn't.</i>

68
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,115
<i>"My dear, sweet Eva...</i>

69
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,118
this is the only way...

70
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,121
I know how to make good...

71
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:26,114
the frightful wrong
which has befallen us.

72
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,129
It does not matter
what lies ahead...

73
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,122
for I have
a full life behind me...

74
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,127
all in those few,
sweet hours with you.

75
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,144
I once told you
that I would pledge my life...

76
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,147
for our nation of two...

77
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,150
and reside there...

78
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,153
even in death...

79
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,157
as surely as I reside in heaven...

80
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,150
when your arms are around me.

81
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,166
Soon it will be time
to keep that pledge...

82
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
and I rejoice to think...

83
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,172
that earthly distractions
will no longer intrude...

84
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,165
on my eternal devotion to you.

85
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,173
From this moment forward...

86
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,188
our nation of two...

87
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,191
is the only country...

88
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,184
I will know."

89
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>As the insanity of the world</i>
<i>descended on us...</i>

90
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,217
<i>my Helga and I survived</i>
<i>by pledging our undying loyalty...</i>

91
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,232
<i>to the only nation</i>
<i>that made any sense to us.</i>

92
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,236
<i>It was called</i>
das Reich der Zwei...

93
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,229
<i>"the nation of two."</i>

94
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,279
<i>It was only one month after my parents</i>
<i>returned to the United States</i>...

95
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,294
<i>three years before America</i>
<i>would enter the war</i>...

96
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,287
<i>when I first met</i>

97
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,297
<i>I call him that because no one</i>
<i>believes he existed but me.</i>

98
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>But he really does exist</i>...
<i>or at least he did...</i>

99
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,306
<i>on that Sunday afternoon</i>
<i>so long ago in Berlin.</i>

100
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
Nice-lookin' men.

101
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
I suppose.

102
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

103
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
Thank God.

104
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,338
I've been goin' crazy
tryin' to find someone to talk to.

105
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
Pardon me?

106
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,333
I'm sorry. You mind if I come over there
so we don't have to holler?

107
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,350
As you please.

108
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,352
"As you please." That sounds like
somethin' an Englishman would say.

109
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,355
- You English, are ya?
- No, I'm American.

110
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,357
That a fact?

111
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,360
Any of my beeswax
what you do for a living?

112
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,363
- Writer.
- No kiddin'!

113
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,366
Well, there's a coincidence,
'cause I was just sittin' over there...

114
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
wishin' I could write...

115
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
'cause I thought up
one hell of a story.

116
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
There's this American, see?

117
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,376
And he's been livin' in Germany so long
he's practically a German himself.

118
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,379
He writes plays in German, is married
to a beautiful German actress.

119
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,372
He knows a lot of big-shot Nazis
who like to hang around theater people.

120
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
Who are you?

121
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,389
Oh, wait a minute.
This gets better.

122
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,392
So this fella knows
there's a war comin'.

123
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,396
America's gonna be on one side,
Germany's gonna be on the other.

124
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,400
So this American, who's been nothin'
but polite to the Nazis so far...

125
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,403
decides to pretend
he's a Nazi himself...

126
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
and he stays on in Germany
once the war comes...

127
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,398
and gets to be
a very useful American spy.

128
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,413
I asked, "Who are you?"

129
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

130
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
I got so carried away I just...

131
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,420
Here you go.
That's me.

132
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,413
"U.S. War Department
Wirtanen, Frank - Major"

133
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,431
So, Mr. Campbell,
what'd you think of my little story?

134
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,434
What did I think of it?
Oh, I don't think much of it.

135
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,427
I mean, it's highly implausible.
It's ridiculous.

136
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,443
Oh, that's okay, 'cause...

137
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,446
today isn't when you give me
your final answer, anyway.

138
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
Final answer?

139
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,441
If you imagine that I'm gonna go home
and think this over, you're mistaken.

140
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,456
I'm gonna sleep like a log.

141
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm not a political man.
I'm just not.

142
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,462
I'm an artist.

143
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,466
If a war comes, it's just gonna
have to get along without me.

144
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
Well, I wish ya
all the luck in the world, Howard.

145
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,471
The worse this Nazi thing gets...

146
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,473
the less anyone's
gonna sleep like a log.

147
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,476
Well, I don't know.
Maybe. We'll see.

148
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
That's right. We'll see.

149
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,482
That's why I don't expect
your final answer today.

150
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,485
If you go through with this,
it'll be strictly on your own...

151
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,488
working your way up with the Nazis
as high as you can go.

152
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,492
To do this right, you'll have to commit
nothing less than high treason.

153
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,495
Even if you do live through the war
without being caught...

154
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,498
your government will never
acknowledge your role as an agent.

155
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,500
We couldn't afford
the security breach.

156
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
You come lookin' for a pardon...

157
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,504
they'll deny
they ever heard of ya.

158
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,497
You'd be left hung out to dry.

159
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,515
You make it sound so attractive.

160
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,518
Oh, I have a feeling I've made it
sound very attractive to you, Howard.

161
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,511
- I've seen your plays.
- Really?

162
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,529
And what did you learn from them?

163
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,532
You're obsessed with the notion
of pure hearts and heroism.

164
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,535
You love good,
and you hate evil...

165
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,528
and you'd sacrifice anything
in the name of romance.

166
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
I'll be in touch.

167
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,553
<i>It was every playwright's</i>
<i>secret dream</i>...

168
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,556
<i>to create the most challenging role</i>
<i>I could imagine...</i>

169
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,549
<i>and then play the part myself.</i>

170
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564

171
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,557
"Three Years Later"

172

"Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,575
This is Howard W. Campbell, Jr...

174
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,578
the last free American...

175
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,571
speaking to you from Berlin, Germany,
the heart of the free world.

176
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,588
There is a fine article
in the current <i>Reader's Digest...</i>

177
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,581
entitled
'There Are No Atheists in Foxholes.'

178
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,596
Well, today I would like
to expand on this theme a little...

179
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,589
and tell you that even though
this is a war inspired by the Jews...

180
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,605
a war that only
the Jews can profit from...

181
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,598
you will find there are
no Jews in foxholes either.

182
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>Every G.I. Joe knows</i>...<i>"</i>

183
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,617
<i>Every Sunday afternoon</i>
<i>wherever my voice could be heard...</i>

184
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,610
<i>people stopped whatever they were</i>
<i>doing just to hear what I'd say next.</i>

185
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,615
<i>Even Berlin's chief of police</i>
<i>and his family were devoted listeners...</i>

186
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,630
<i>and not just because</i>
<i>they were my in-laws.</i>

187
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,633
<i>"Now, to the American folks</i>
<i>at home...</i>

188
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,626
I want you to think of all the Jews
living in your neighborhood."

189
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,641
<i>It took me only a couple of hours</i>
<i>to write each speech...</i>

190
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,634
<i>after which I'd hand it over to</i>
<i>the propaganda ministry for their notes.</i>

191
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
<i>Among those who examined it</i>
<i>was another Allied agent...</i>

192
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,652
<i>whose identity never was</i>
<i>revealed to me.</i>

193
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,654
"Do they have more
or less gasoline?"

194
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,658
<i>My speech would be returned</i>
<i>with all sorts of notations...</i>

195
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,661
<i>including those left</i>
<i>by my fellow spy.</i>

196
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
"To these questions..."

197
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,666
<i>These markings would dictate</i>
<i>certain vocal mannerisms</i>...

198
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,669
<i>pauses, emphases...</i>

199
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,672
<i>coughs, stumbles,</i>
<i>throat-clearings.</i>

200
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,675
"Now let me ask you this:

201
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,679
Do you know of
a single Jewish family...

202
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,682
that has ever received
a telegram from Washington...

203
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,685
that begins...

204
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,688
'The secretary of war
expresses his deep regret...

205
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,692
that your son was killed
in defense of his country'?

206
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,694
Of course not.

207
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,687
No Jewish family would ever
receive such a telegram...

208
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,703
thanks to a personal guarantee
from the American dictator...

209
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,707
Franklin Delano Rosenfeld."

210
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,700
<i>It was in this manner that I broadcast</i>
<i>coded information out of Germany.</i>

211
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,705
<i>I don't know to this day</i>
<i>what information went out through me.</i>

212
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,721
"Why do you take arms
against your German brothers?

213
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,725
<i>You know that Germany's objectives</i>
<i>are the same as your own.</i>

214
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,729
<i>You must understand</i>
<i>that theJews...</i>

215
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,722
<i>can only thrive in a nation</i>
<i>which lives in slavery.</i>

216
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,737
<i>So, my brothers...</i>

217
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
<i>lay down your arms.</i>

218
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>By fighting this war, you'll only</i>
<i>fortify the bank accounts...</i>

219
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,736
<i>of your political leaders</i>
<i>who blindly serve theirJewish masters.</i>

220
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,754
This has been
Howard W. Campbell, Jr...

221
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,758
the last free American.

222
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,751
Thank you for listening.
Heil Hitler."

223
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,789
You are a murderer.

224
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,791
You are a coward.

225
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
You are all cowards!

226
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
You are murdering children!

227
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
You should rot in hell!

228
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,790
Damn you!

229
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,812
Howard just
instinctively understands...

230
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,815
the German ideal
of right and wrong...

231
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,808
the certain triumph
of good over evil...

232
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,813
and the redemptive power of romance.

233
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
Just promise me one thing:

234
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,831
You will not leave
the propaganda ministry...

235
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,833
and return
to playwrighting full-time.

236
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,835
Little chance of that,
Herr Goebbels.

237
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,837
I've always found it ironic
that the man...

238
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,841
who so eloquently communicates
our ideals to the masses...

239
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842
should be born in America.

240
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,846
Well, it's not so ironic.

241
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,839
I consider myself a spiritual native
of my adopted fatherland.

242
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
Something i've always wondered,
Herr Campbell:

243
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,856
Do you ever miss America?

244
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,860
Sometimes. Of course I do.

245
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,864
But I could never be happy
with the Jews in charge of everything.

246
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,867
Jews. The Jews will be
taken care of in due time.

247
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,860
Our friend Hoess here is seeing to it
at a resort he's running in Auschwitz.

248
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,875
My wife and I live
for that day.

249
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,868
Is there a chance we might
meet Mrs. Campbell?

250
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,883
Yes. Of course, Herr Hoess.

251
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,876
I'll ask Helga to join us,
if you'll excuse me.

252
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,883
If that woman walked off a cliff,
I swear, Howard would follow her.

253
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,922
<i>Time passed.</i>

254
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,925
<i>I never told my Helga</i>
<i>I was a spy.</i>

255
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,927
<i>To tell her would only</i>
<i>put her in danger...</i>

256
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,931
<i>and make her live</i>
<i>in constant fear.</i>

257
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,934
<i>So I hid my true self</i>
<i>from her...</i>

258
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,927
<i>knowing that politics had no place</i>
<i>in our nation of two.</i>

259
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,948
<i>I suppose the moral here is:</i>

260
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>You must be careful</i>
<i>what you pretend to be...</i>

261
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,945
<i>because in the end</i>
<i>you are what you pretend to be.</i>

262
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,026
<i>History says</i>
<i>the war ended in 1945.</i>

263
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it ended one year earlier.</i>

264
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,032
<i>My nation of two was</i>
<i>the loser...</i>

265
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,035
<i>insanity the victor.</i>

266
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,038
<i>There were no prisoners...</i>

267
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,040
<i>no survivors.</i>

268
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,044
Why would the Germans
want to kill my Helga?

269
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,046
Sir...

270
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,050
I said enemy guns.

271
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,052
The Russians.

272
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,055
It was Russian fire.

273
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,059
Russian.

274
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,062
It was tragic timing, sir.

275
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,065
The Russians fired
on the Crimean camp...

276
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,068
where she was
entertaining troops.

277
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:14,061
Reich Marshal Goering will issue
an official commendation...

278
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,074
for Mrs. Campbell's bravery.

279
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,078
I am sure
she would be very proud.

280
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,082
Yes. Yes, of course.

281
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,085
Is there anything I can do for you,
Herr Campbell?

282
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:31,078
Please.

283
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,149
<i>"Good afternoon,</i>

305
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,247
- Howard.
- Herr Noth.

306
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,251
Interesting time
to visit your in-laws.

307
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,254
If you wish to stay a while,
perhaps you can help me...

308
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,256
greet the Russians
when they arrive.

309
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,259
I'm going to the front.

310
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,261
Right over that way.

311
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,264
An easy walk from here.
You can make it in a day...

312
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,267
picking buttercups as you go.

313
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,270
May I ask
where you're moving to?

314
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,272
I'm staying here.

315
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,276
My wife is at my brother's home
in Cologne. Resi will join her today.

316
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,280
- But why stay here?
- With the Russian army at my doorstep?

317
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,283
I'm still the chief of police.

318
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:49,276
I'll not have my people say
I fled with my tail between my legs.

319
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,292
Is there anything I can do?

320
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,285
Yes.
You can shoot Resi's dog.

321
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,300
It can't make the trip,
and I can't take care of it here...

322
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,293
so you can shoot it.

323
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,299
- Where is it?
- In the music room with Resi.

324
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,315
She knows it's to be shot.
You'll have no trouble with her.

325
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,318
All right.

326
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,322
You broke my heart
when you married my daughter.

327
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,326
I wanted a German soldier
for a son-in-law.

328
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,329
Yes. I know.

329
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,333
Because I hated you so much,
I studied you.

330
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,337
I listened to everything you said.

331
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,339
Never missed a broadcast.

332
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,343
Did you know that
until this very moment...

333
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,345
nothing would have
delighted me more...

334
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,348
than to prove you were a spy...

335
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,352
to see you shot?

336
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,356
Now I couldn't care less
if you are a spy.

337
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,359
- Do you know why?
- No.

338
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,363
Because now I know
that even if you were a spy...

339
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,356
you could never have served the enemy
as well as you served us.

340
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:14,372
All the ideals that make me
proud of being a Nazi...

341
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,375
they came not from Hitler...

342
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,377
not from Goebbels...

343
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,380
but from you.

344
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,373
You alone kept me from concluding
that Germany had gone insane.

345
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,412
Now, look how you've grown.

346
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
You are here to kill my dog...

347
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,407
aren't you?

348
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,421
Yes.

349
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,414
But, Resi, it's not something
I want to do very much.

350
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,428
That's all right.

351
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,431
I never liked it anyway.

352
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,435
I just felt sorry for it.

353
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm going to the front.
I just came to say good-bye.

354
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,440
Which front?

355
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,443
The Russian.

356
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,447
You'll die, then?

357
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,449
Well, maybe not.

358
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,453
Everybody who isn't dead now
will be dead soon...

359
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,457
including me.

360
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm sure you're going to be fine.

361
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,464
That's all right.
It won't hurt.

362
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,457
Suddenly I just
won't be anymore.

363
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,462
Since we'll all be dead soon,
I might as well tell you something.

364
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,477
What is it?

365
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,470
I love you.

366
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,485
Oh, Resi,
that's very sweet.

367
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,488
No. I mean I really love you.

368
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,491
When Helga was alive
and you two would come here...

369
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,484
sometimes I envied her,
and sometimes I hated her.

370
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,499
When she died, I dreamt
I would grow up and marry you...

371
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,492
and be a famous actress,
and you'd write plays for me.

372
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,504
I see.

373
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,530
I'm very honored.

374
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,534
That's all right.
It doesn't mean anything now.

375
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,537
Nothing means anything.

376
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,530
Go ahead and shoot the dog.

377
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,544
<i>Resi was only half right.</i>

378
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,547
<i>From what I could gather,</i>
<i>she was dead before long...</i>

379
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,550
<i>but I went on living.</i>

380
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,552
<i>Had I actually traveled</i>
<i>to the Russian front...</i>

381
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,556
<i>surely I would have died</i>
<i>as Resi predicted.</i>

382
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,560
<i>Instead, I motorcycled around</i>
<i>the German countryside...</i>

383
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,553
<i>thinking I could simply</i>
<i>wait out the war.</i>

384
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,569
<i>My little respite ended</i>
<i>two months later...</i>

385
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,562
<i>when I was captured by Lieutenant</i>
<i>Bernard B. O'Hare, American 3rd Army.</i>

386
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,576
<i>I had said "good morning"</i>
<i>to him in passing...</i>

387
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,569
<i>and he recognized my voice</i>
<i>from the radio broadcasts.</i>

388
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,575
<i>O'Hare seemed to take all</i>
<i>the things I said rather personally.</i>

389
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>After my capture,</i>
<i>the American army escorted me...</i>

390
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,595
<i>on a private tour</i>
<i>of the Nazi death camp at Oerdre.</i>

391
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,610
<i>They thought it would be</i>
<i>interesting to see my reaction...</i>

392
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,603
<i>to the fruits of my labor.</i>

393
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,620
Take a good look
at your Kraut friends, Campbell...

394
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,613
'cause you're next.

395
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,621
<i>To me,</i>
<i>they looked quite peaceful.</i>

396
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,641
<i>Two days later I was driven away</i>
<i>by two American soldiers.</i>

397
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,634
<i>I couldn't quite tell</i>
<i>if they knew who I was.</i>

398
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,691
Well, Howard...

399
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,694
what did you think of that war?

400
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,696
Is that you, Wirtanen?

401
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,700
I got to hand it to you...
you lived through it.

402
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,703
- A lot of people didn't, you know.
- Yes.

403
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,705
Yes, I know.

404
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,708
I know. My wife.
My wife, for instance.

405
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,712
Yeah. Sorry about that. I found out
about that a few days before you did.

406
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,705
<i>You found out about it before me?</i>
<i>How did you find that out?</i>

407
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,710
<i>That was one of the pieces</i>
<i>of information you broadcast that week.</i>

408
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,724
<i>I broadcast that</i>...

409
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,727
<i>that my wife had died?</i>

410
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,731
<i>I didn't even know it?</i>
<i>You knew she was dead and I didn't?</i>

411
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,735
<i>I would have liked</i>
<i>to have mourned.</i>

412
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,737
<i>Well, what happens to me now?</i>

413
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,740
You've already disappeared.

414
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,733
The 3rd Army's been relieved of ya.
There's no records to show your capture.

415
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,749
So, Howard,
where do you want to go from here?

416
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,751
Oh, I don't know.

417
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,755
I don't suppose there's a hero's
welcome waiting for me anywhere.

418
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,757
Hardly.

419
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,759
We can't exactly start bragging
about all the clever tricks we pulled.

420
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,762
We might need them again
for the next war.

421
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,764
No, your role
will remain classified...

422
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,768
and Uncle Sam's official position is
that you're the scum of the earth.

423
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,771
Scum of the earth, huh?

424
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,773
What about my parents?

425
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,766
I'm sorry, Howard.
They both died about six months ago.

426
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,781
Both?

427
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,774
Father first, and your mother
two days later. Heart both times.

428
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,790
Did anyone tell them
what I was really doing?

429
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,792
Come on, Howard.
What were we supposed to do?

430
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,794
Sacrifice our radio station
in the heart of Berlin...

431
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,796
for the peace of mind
of two old people?

432
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,789
Oh, no, no. We wouldn't want that!
How many people knew what I was doing?

433
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,803
- There were three of us.
- Just three?

434
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,806
- It's probably too many.
- Three people knew me for what I was?

435
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,808
Everyone else knew you
for what you were, too.

436
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,801
Wait. How can you say that?
You think I'm a Nazi? I wasn't a Nazi.

437
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,814
Well, let me ask you
something, Howard:

438
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,816
What would you have done
if Germany had won the war?

439
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,818
Marched right up to your pal
Goebbels and surrendered?

440
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,821
Told him you were actually
a patriotic American spy?

441
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,814
Yes, I might have marched in there!
I might have escaped. I don't know.

442
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,830
Oh, all right.
You want me to be a Nazi?

443
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,833
You go ahead.
Classify me as a Nazi.

444
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,837
You want to hang me? Go ahead
if you think it'll raise morale.

445
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,841
I don't consider this life
any great treasure.

446
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,845
Well, I just want you to know
how little we can really do for you.

447
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,847
How little?

448
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,851
False identity, some cash,
transportation to a new place...

449
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,854
Anywhere you'd like to go, Howard?
How 'bout New York?

450
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,858
You can lose yourself pretty easily.
Plenty of work if you want it.

451
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,862
All right.
New York then.

452
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,865
Of the three that knew
I was a spy, who were the other two?

453
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,867
The second was
General Donovan of the O.S. S...

454
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,871
and the third,
I'm sorry to say, is dead.

455
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,874
You used to attack him
every night on your broadcast.

456
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,878
You called him
Franklin Delano Rosenfeld.

457
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,881
He got a big kick out of that.
He used to listen to you every night.

458
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,874
"Life"

459
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,912
"New York City
1960"

460
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,928
<i>At first I lived</i>
<i>under a false name.</i>

461
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,932
<i>The idea was to start</i>
<i>from scratch, lead a new life.</i>

462
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,936
<i>After a while, though, it became clear</i>
<i>that I really had no life...</i>

463
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,938
<i>so the alias became unnecessary...</i>

464
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,941
<i>and I went back</i>
<i>to using my own name.</i>

465
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,934
<i>No one ever asked whether I was</i>
the <i>Howard W. Campbell, Jr.</i>

466
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,960
<i>All of my belongings,</i>
<i>like myself, were war surplus...</i>

467
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,964
<i>coming from recreation kits</i>
<i>intended for troops overseas.</i>

468
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,967
<i>They even included</i>
<i>phonograph records...</i>

469
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,960
<i>so I became the proud owner of 26 copies</i>
<i>of Bing Crosby's "White Christmas."</i>

470
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,966
"Property of U.S. Gov't"

471
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,983
<i>I survived my purgatory</i>
<i>in New York...</i>

472
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,976
<i>the same way I survived</i>
<i>the hell of wartime Germany</i>...

473
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,981
<i>I let my emotions be stirred</i>
<i>by only one thing</i>...

474
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,995
<i>my love for Helga.</i>

475
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,988
<i>It remained the permanent axis</i>
<i>about which my thoughts revolved.</i>

476
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,002
To you, my love...

477
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,995
to your beauty
and to my undying devotion.

478
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,001
To <i>das Reich der Zwei</i>...

479
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:00,006
nation of two.

480
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,023
It's very nice, isn't it?

481
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,027
It's very dry.

482
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:14,020
Just the way you like it, hmm?

483
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:19,025
Yes.

484
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,076
- Dr. Epstein?
- Yes.

485
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,078
I'm your neighbor from upstairs.

486
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,071
I've cut myself.

487
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,094
Well, you won't need stitches.

488
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,098
The blood often makes these things
look worse than they really are.

489
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,100
Well, thank you, Doctor.
I'm very grateful.

490
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,103
No problem.

491
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,106
I'm only sorry it took this
to provide an introduction.

492
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:33,099
Yes, yes.
No, you're right.

493
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:38,115
That's a very famous name
you have.

494
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
Pardon me?

495
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:44,121
You never heard of
Howard W. Campbell, Jr...

496
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,124
broadcasting from Berlin?

497
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:51,128
From Berlin...

498
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,130
Yes, I do remember now.

499
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,133
It was a long time ago.

500
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:00,137
I never listened to him,
but I remember he was in the news.

501
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,141
Those things fade.

502
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,144
Those things should fade.

503
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:11,137
That insane moment in history
should be forgotten.

504
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,152
You know of Auschwitz?

505
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,156
Yes, yes, of course
I know of Auschwitz.

506
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:23,160
That is where I spent
my young womanhood...

507
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,163
and my son the doctor here...

508
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
he spent his childhood.

509
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:32,169
- Oh, well, I'm sorry.
- Forget Auschwitz.

510
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,162
It doesn't do any good.

511
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,178
There.

512
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,181
No need for amputation.

513
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,184
- Just keep it dry for a few days.
- Well, thank you.

514
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:51,177
No problem.
I'll see you out.

515
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,194
What? Pardon me?

516
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,196
I asked if you spoke German.

517
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:03,189
Oh. No, no, no.
I'm afraid not.

518
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:14,200
Good-bye.
That's "good-bye," isn't it?

519
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,215
It's "till we meet again."

520
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,217
Oh. Till we meet again.

521
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,220
Well, auf Wiedersehen.

522
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,213
Yes.

523
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,234
Yes?

524
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,237
Campbell, it's Adolph Eichmann.

525
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,230
I'm in the cell above you.

526
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:49,246
Yes, Eichmann. Hello.

527
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,249
You're always typing in there...

528
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,252
day and night
and night and day...

529
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:59,256
typing, typing, typing...

530
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,258
Is it bothering you?

531
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:05,262
No. I'm a heavy sleeper.

532
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,266
I'm only curious.
Are you preparing your memoir?

533
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,259
Yes. A command performance
for the Haifa Institute.

534
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:19,276
You're a lucky man.

535
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,278
I'm lucky?

536
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,281
How do you consider me lucky?

537
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,274
You can type.
I'm writing mine longhand.

538
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:41,287
<i>One day I got the idea that a hobby</i>
<i>might help pass the time in purgatory.</i>

539
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,324
<i>Ironically...</i>

540
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,326
<i>in my solitude</i>
<i>I had created something...</i>

541
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,319
<i>that could only be used in concert</i>
<i>with another human being.</i>

542
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,349
Yeah.

543
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,353
George Kraft?

544
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,355
Who is it?

545
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,358
I'm Howard Campbell,
your neighbor from upstairs.

546
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,359
What do you want?

547
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,352
I want to know if you play chess.

548
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,389
I didn't know I had a painter
living under me.

549
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,395
Where do you show your work?

550
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,400
I don't show my work.

551
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,416
Well, you should.

552
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,418
You been painting all your life?

553
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,421
No, not really.

554
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,424
My wife died four years ago...

555
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,426
and I had the choice of either...

556
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,429
coming to Greenwich Village to be
a painter or blowing my brains out...

557
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,422
so I flipped a coin, and here I am.

558
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,438
At least you had painting
you could turn to.

559
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,431
What does that mean?
You mean you lost your wife too?

560
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,446
Yeah. I see you in the hallway
and I say, "yes...

561
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,439
this man too
is a member of the brotherhood."

562
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,456
- The brotherhood?
- Brotherhood of the walking wounded.

563
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,449
World's largest organization, and you
don't know it exists until you're in it.

564
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:28,465
You become a member when you lose
the one thing that gives life meaning.

565
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,458
And the thing that bonds you together,
that holds the group in one piece...

566
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,473
is the fact that the members
are absolutely incapable...

567
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,477
of speaking to one another.

568
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,481
Sorry.
I don't mean to rattle on.

569
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,485
How'd you lose your wife?

570
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,487
I can't speak about it.

571
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,490
Well, of course
you can't speak about it.

572
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,483
You're a member
of the brotherhood.

573
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,560
<i>The day came</i>
<i>that I told him everything.</i>

574
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,562
<i>It all spilled out of me</i>...

575
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,555
You know, I knew the war was over,
and Germany was going to lose...

576
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,569
and here I was an American spy.

577
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,572
<i>My parents,</i>
<i>my boyhood in Germany...</i>

578
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,574

579
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,578

580
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,581
<i>my capture</i>
<i>and my banishment to purgatory.</i>

581
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,574
I didn't have anything to live for.
I lost my wife, I lost my nation of two.

582
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,591
<i>George Kraft, my only living friend,</i>
<i>took it all in stride.</i>

583
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,594
Yeah, but why doesn't
the government come forward and say...

584
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,596
"This man you're spitting on
is a hero"?

585
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,589
George, nobody spits on me.

586
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,605
Nobody even knows I'm alive.

587
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,608
<i>Life continued unchanged...</i>

588
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,601

00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,611
<i>"The White Christian Minuteman</i>

590
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,630
"An American Tragedy!"

591
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,623
<i>Howard W. Campbell, Jr., a great writer</i>

Maybe it was that lady downstairs...
Epstein's mother.

599
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,671
Why wouldn't she just
call the authorities?

600
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,675
Why would she send my address
to some racist newsletter?

601
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,668
Why don't you set the record straight?
It's time you wrote again anyway.

602
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,683
I'm afraid dead men don't
write very well.

603
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,686
That's not true.
All the best writers are dead.

604
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,688
That's the most truthful thing
you've said today.

605
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,692
Listen to me.
It's because while you're dead...

606
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,694
you have nothing to lose,
you can be completely courageous.

607
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,696
Find yourself a woman,
start writing again.

608
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,698
- A woman?
- A woman.

609
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:25,702
George, you better stop drinking.
My portrait's gonna look like a Picasso.

610
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,704
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not changing the subject.

611
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,697
- Sit up.
- I am sitting up.

612
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,713
All right, I tell you what.
You get a woman, then I'll get one.

613
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,706
I don't need a woman.
I'm on fire for my muse.

614
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,721
You, however...
you're a mortal.

615
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,724
You need a woman.

616
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,726
- I already got one.
- No, you don't.

617
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,728
- Yes, I do.
- Had a woman.

618
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,731
- Past tense. She's dead.
- I don't wanna talk about this.

619
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,733
I'm only telling
you what you need to hear.

620
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,736
- If you're gonna speak the truth...
- Oh, God, did I hit a nerve?

621
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,739
- No, you didn't hit a nerve. I'm fine.
- I am so sorry.

622
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,743
No, don't be sorry.
Don't be humble, George.

623
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,747
- I'm abject. I feel really...
- No, you're not abject.

624
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,749
- Go ahead, talk. I can't hear you.
- God, I just...

625
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,752
I just shoot my mouth off,
and l...

626
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,745
I don't know...
I'm gonna...

627
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:31,768
One, two, three, rest.

628
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,761
One, two, three, four.

629
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,795
- Who is it?
- Howard W. Campbell, Jr.?

630
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,811
Who is it?

631
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,814
It's the Reverend Dr. Lionel Jones...

632
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,807
D.D.S., D.D.

633
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,824
I presume you received
our complimentary issue...

634
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,817
of the <i>White Christian Minuteman.</i>

635
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,823
It's all right, Howard.
I'm with friends.

636
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,837
Howard W. Campbell.

637
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,851
What an honor.

638
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,844
I feel as if my whole life
was leading up to this moment.

639
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,858
How do you do?

640
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,862
Please, allow me to introduce you
to my bodyguard...

641
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,864
August Krapptauer.

642
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,857
Vice Bundesfuehrer Emeritus
at the German-American Bund.

643
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,872
A great, great pleasure,
Mr. Campbell.

644
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,875
And my secretary,
Father Patrick Keeley...

645
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,879
former chaplain
of the Detroit Gun Club.

646
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,882
Words fail me, Herr Campbell.

647
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,884
Likewise, I'm sure.

648
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,888
- Could we get some water?
- Yeah, of course, of course.

649
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,881
The climb up your stairs was
quite an effort for our Mr. Krapptauer.

650
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,887
Might we bother you
for a glass of water?

651
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,904
All right. Come on in.

652
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,908
This is my good friend
and neighbor, George Kraft.

653
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,901
How do you do?

654
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,918
- Yours?
- Yes.

655
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,921
What a marvelous likeness
of our Mr. Campbell.

656
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,925
You've done a masterful job
capturing the jaw line.

657
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,927
Have you a background
in dentistry?

658
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,930
Dentistry? No.

659
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,933
Well, as one who's devoted his life
to dental medicine...

660
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,937
allow me to say that you have
perfectly duplicated...

661
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,939
Mr. Campbell's Aryan jaw line.

662
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,943
- Oh, I'm thrilled that you noticed.
- How could I miss it?

663
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,936
Are you familiar with my book,
<i>Christ Was Not a Jew?</i>

664
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,951
I could never find a copy.

665
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,953
Oh, that's too bad.

666
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,956
Father Keeley, make a note
that we must send Mr. Kraft...

667
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,958
an autographed copy.

668
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,951
In it, I reproduce
50 famous paintings of Christ...

669
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,956
and point out that not one of them
shows Jewish jaws or teeth.

670
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,972
- I don't know what to say.
- Well...

671
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,974
I had to publish the book myself.

672
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,967
But what can you expect when
the publishing industry is run by Jews?

673
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,983
Oh, of course, forgive me.

674
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,976
I've been talking so much,
I almost forgot what brought us here.

675
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,991
What does bring you here, Jones?

676
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,984
A surprise for you, Mr. Campbell,
waiting downstairs.

677
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,001
Why don't you just tell me
what this is about?

678
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,004
Forgive me, Mr. Campbell...

679
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,008
but I have promised
not to spoil the surprise.

680
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,010
Now, I give my word...
if you're displeased...

681
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,014
we'll take it away with us
and leave you in peace.

682
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,017
- Where is it?
- At the bottom of the stairwell.

683
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,020
You can't miss it.

684
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,023
All right.

685
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,026
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

686
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:54,019
I'll be right back.

687
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,097
There is no room
in your life for me.

688
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,111
I will say good-bye...

689
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,104
and I will never bother you again.

690
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:36,132
No room in my life?

691
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:40,125
My life is nothing
but room for you.

692
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:49,145
<i>God, you're alive.</i>
<i>How can it be?</i>

693
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:53,149
<i>Oh, look at you.</i>
<i>You haven't changed.</i>

694
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:57,153
- <i>I have so much to tell.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

695
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:01,146
I always knew you'd come back.
I always knew that.

696
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,151
I just didn't know when or how.

697
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,173
There's somebody I want you to meet.
I want you to meet George Kraft.

698
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,190
- This is Helga.
- Hello. Welcome.

699
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,193
I presume you weren't disappointed.

700
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,196
How did you do this?
How did you bring my wife back to me?

701
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,199
A subscriber in West Germany
wired me...

702
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,202
that Mrs. Campbell had just arrived
as a refugee.

703
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,205
One day I learn that you're alive...

704
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,207
a month later
that your wife is alive.

705
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:55,200
Now, what can I call a coincident
like that but the hand of God?

706
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,215
Why don't we let Mr. And Mrs. Campbell
have a few minutes alone now?

707
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,208
Yes, of course. Our chauffeur will
bring up Mrs. Campbell's bags.

708
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,223
No need, no need.

709
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:11,227
- You fool, what are you doing?
- I'm fine, perfectly fine.

710
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,230
You're risking your life,
exerting yourself like that.

711
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,223
It's an honor to risk my life
for a man who served Adolph Hitler...

712
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:23,228
as well as Howard W. Campbell, Jr.

713
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,251
He's gone.

714
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,255
Maybe I should call an ambulance.
Yes.

715
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,259
That's terrible, just terrible.

716
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:47,263
Poor, dear August.

717
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,266
Who's going to carry
the torch now?

718
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:54,270
Excuse me?
Everything all right up here?

719
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,263
No, as a matter of fact.
August just died.

720
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,278
Oh, no. That's a shame.

721
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,282
- Now, that's a real shame.
- Mr. Campbell...

722
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:10,275
Robert Sterling Wilson,
the black fuehrer of Harlem.

723
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,291
I heard about you,
but I never listened to you.

724
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,294
- That's all right.
- We was on different sides.

725
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,287
See, I was on the side with the colored
folks. I was with the Japanese.

726
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,303
I hear you say you didn't think
colored folks was so good.

727
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,306
Now, Robert, let's not squabble
amongst ourselves.

728
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,309
Let's all work to pull together.

729
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,312
Now I'm just telling him like I tell you
and the reverend every morning.

730
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:40,305
Colored people gonna have
a hydrogen bomb all their own...

731
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:45,310
and pretty soon they gonna give Japan
the honor of dropping the first one.

732
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,315
Where?

733
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,329
China, I guess.

734
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,322
On other colored people?

735
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,328
Now whoever told you
a Chinaman was colored?

736
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:19,355
<i>Mutter, Vatter und Resi...</i>

737
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,357
are all dead.

738
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:25,350
Yeah. Yes, I know.

739
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:37,362
But l... I am alive.

740
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,384
How?

741
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,388
Well, l...

742
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,390
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

743
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,393
Our life starts tonight.

744
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,396
We'll check into a hotel.

745
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:04,400
Tomorrow we'll find
a new place to live.

746
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,393
I've found an old store
that has our bed in it.

747
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:13,409
Do you remember our old bed?

748
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,412
- Yeah.
- <i>Ja.</i>

749
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,416
We'll start again
right where we left off.

750
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,419
Nation of two.

751
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,423
- Us.
- That's right.

752
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,416
Yeah.

753
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,434
But...

754
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:42,427
we do not have to
check in to a hotel.

755
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:55,440
It's been so long.

756
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,445
I'm no longer a young man.

757
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,466
<i>She had been captured and raped</i>
<i>in the Crimea...</i>

758
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:26,482
<i>and then shipped to the Ukraine</i>
<i>and put to work on a labor gang.</i>

759
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,486
<i>Nobody told her the war was over.</i>

760
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,479
<i>After her repatriation, she was sent</i>
<i>to Dresden, East Germany...</i>

761
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:39,495
<i>and put to work</i>
<i>in a cigarette factory.</i>

762
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,498
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>she escaped to West Berlin...</i>

763
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,491
<i>and days later,</i>
<i>she was flying back to my embrace.</i>

764
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,497
<i>All that mattered now was that</i>
<i>our nation of two was whole again.</i>

765
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

766
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,518
Welcome home.

767
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,536
Now here...
Here it is right here.

768
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,539
Excuse us. Here.

769
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,532
Helga, right here.
Here's the bed.

770
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,538
It's locked. Veterans Day.
It's Veterans Day. Damn it.

771
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,553
Oh, goddamn it!

772
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,546
Howard, you have changed.

773
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,562
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

774
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,555
Yes, I've changed, but people should
be changed by world wars.

775
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,570
Otherwise, what are world wars for?

776
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,563
Maybe you have changed so much
that you do not love me anymore.

777
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,582
How could you say that
after last night, huh?

778
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,585
We really have not talked
anything over.

779
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,588
But, Helga, what is there
to talk about?

780
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,592
No words could change
the way I feel.

781
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,594
Do you mean it?

782
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,587
Yes, of course I mean it.

783
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,592
Nothing I could say
could spoil it.

784
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,610
Nothing you could ever say
could spoil it.

785
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:38,603
Never, never.

786
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,611
I'm not Helga.

787
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:51,627
I'm Resi...

788
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,620
her little sister.

789
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,642
What?

790
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,646
You said you loved me.

791
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,649
- How could you do this to me?
- I love you.

792
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,653
You love me? How could you love me?
You don't even know who I am.

793
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,656
When I got to West Berlin...

794
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,658
they gave me papers
to fill out...

795
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:26,662
name, occupation,
nearest living relative.

796
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:30,655
I had a choice.
I could stay Resi Noth...

797
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:35,660
secret machine operator
with no family anywhere...

798
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,676
or I could be Helga Noth...

799
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,669
famous actress and wife
of a brilliant, handsome playwright...

800
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,685
living in America.

801
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,689
A man I love deeply.

802
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,682
Who should I have been?

803
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,701
Howard, for ten years
in that factory...

804
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:09,694
the only things that kept me alive
were daydreams of being my sister Helga.

805
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:17,702
So Resi disappeared.

806
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:25,710
I don't know what to say.

807
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,728
You picked a hell of a person to be.

808
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,732
That is who I am.

809
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,725
I am Helga.

810
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,743
You believed it.

811
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,736
Was I or was I not Helga
to you last night?

812
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,749
That's a hell of a question
to ask a gentleman.

813
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,758
Am I entitled to an answer?

814
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,787
Would you sometime
write a play for me?

815
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:51,796
I don't think I can write anymore.

816
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:57,802
Did Helga inspire you to write?

817
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,820
Not to write,
but to write the way I wrote.

818
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,823
We used to say that
I wrote parts for her...

819
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,827
that let her play
the quintessence of Helga.

820
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,820
I want you to do that
for me one day.

821
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,836
The q...

822
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,829
- The quintes...
- Quintessence.

823
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,837
The quintessence of Resi.

824
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,847
Maybe I will.

825
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:56,872
<i>Resi was growing younger</i>
<i>by the second.</i>

826
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,875
<i>Although she had bleached her hair white</i>
<i>to appear older...</i>

827
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,878
<i>it now spoke to me of peroxide...</i>

828
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,871
<i>and girls who run away to Hollywood.</i>

829
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,885
Finally, I have a home.

830
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,878
It takes a heap of living
to make a house a home.

831
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,895
- Who did that?
- Who did what?

832
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,898
That.

833
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,900
Howard Campbell?

834
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,893
You know him?

835
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,908
It's funny...
You look just like him.

836
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,911
Don't that look
like the gentleman you're with?

837
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,914
Let me see.

838
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,907
"Israel Locates
War Criminal in U.S."

839
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:47,912
Before the Jews put you in the zoo,
I'm gonna have some fun with you myself.

840
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,928
You felt that one, huh?
That was for Private Irvin Buchanan.

841
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,930
- Is that you?
- No, he was my best friend.

842
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,934
Five miles in from Omaha Beach,
the Germans, they cut his nuts off...

843
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,936
and they hung him
from a telephone pole.

844
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,939
And this... this is for Axel Brewer.

845
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,943
He got run over
by a tiger tank in Aachen.

846
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,946
- This is for Eddie McCarty.
- Please!

847
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,948
He got cut in half
by a schmeizer.

848
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,941
And this... this is for...

849
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,960
Do not speak, <i>liebling.</i>

850
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,975
- Where are we?
- We are safe.

851
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:43,968
You have been asleep.
They will not find us here.

852
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,974
- Who won't find us here?
- The Jews, sweetheart.

853
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,990
What's on my chest?

854
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,994
You had your ribs taped up.

855
01:14:58,994 --> 01:14:59,995
By whom?

856
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:03,999
The doctor who lives
in your building.

857
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,992
- Epstein.
- <i>Ja,</i> that was him. He was very nice.

858
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,008
I used his phone to call Dr. Jones,
and he brought us here.

859
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:17,001
How nice to have friends.

860
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,018
<i>Ja,</i> come in.

861
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:27,011
- How's he doing?
- He has just woken up.

862
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,025
How's your head?

863
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,026
Splitting.

864
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:35,019
- You ought to take an aspirin.
- Thanks for the advice.

865
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:40,024
You see, most things in this world
don't work, but aspirin do.

866
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,042
Resi, the newspapers...

867
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:51,046
Is it true the Israelis
want to put me on trial?

868
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:55,039
Dr. Jones says the American government
will not let you go...

869
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,054
but the Jews will send men
to kidnap you...

870
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,057
like they did Herr Eichmann.

871
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:06,061
It ain't like having a Jew here,
a Jew there after you.

872
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:10,054
They got everything after you
but the Jewish hydrogen bomb.

873
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:17,072
What the hell is that?

874
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,075
That was your friend.

875
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:24,068
- Jones?
- No, George Kraft.

876
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,083
What's George doing here?

877
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,076
He is coming with us.
We are all leaving the country.

878
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:37,081
Dr. Jones has made
the arrangements.

879
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:58,113
Howard! Look who's up and around.
How do you feel?

880
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,116
I'd stand a better chance if it weren't
for the racket you're making.

881
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:05,120
Sorry, just killing a little time.
God, you scared me half to death.

882
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,122
I was worried sick about you.

883
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:11,126
You know, it was bound to happen
sooner or later.

884
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,128
Well, it's all for the best.
You'll see.

885
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,131
You'll have a new identity,
get a new place, new country...

886
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,133
be able to start writing again.

887
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,135
I might even be a better painter
in Mexico.

888
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:24,139
- Mexico?
- Well, look who's back on his feet.

889
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,142
Well, I guess you can't keep
a good man down.

890
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:31,146
That's the spirit.
Howard...

891
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,148
Wednesday night is
the weekly meeting...

892
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:37,152
of the Iron Guard of the White Sons
of the American Constitution.

893
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:41,145
Father Keeley and I want to stage a
memorial service for August Krapptauer.

894
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:46,150
We thought that perhaps you,
being Krapptauer's mentor...

895
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,164
might say a few words.

896
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:53,168
I've thought of a general theme,
if that helps.

897
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,170
I'm sure I could use one.

898
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,174
I think the theme should be...

899
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:03,167
"His Truth Goes Marching On."

900
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:15,179
What could I possibly say
to a bunch of junior storm troopers?

901
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:22,197
I knew their fearless leader
for all of 20 seconds...

902
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,190
before he dropped dead
on my stairway.

903
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,213
You'll find the right words.

904
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:42,206
You always do.

905
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,228
When we get to Mexico...

906
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:57,221
I'm going to write again.

907
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,253
Did I have something to do
with this miracle?

908
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:22,257
Mm-hmm, everything.

909
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,260
Very little, but some.

910
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,253
Yes.

911
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,268
The real miracle...

912
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:37,261
is the talent you were born with.

913
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:43,267
The real miracle is your ability
to raise the dead.

914
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:52,276
- The love does that.
- Yes.

915
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:57,281
It raised me too.

916
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,298
<i>Today, the mayor admitted</i>
<i>his embarrassment...</i>

917
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,302
<i>that a notorious war criminal</i>
<i>had been living an anonymous life...</i>

918
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,304
<i>in New York</i>
<i>for at least some of that time.</i>

919
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:13,308
<i>He also noted that neither he</i>
<i>nor the United States government...</i>

920
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,301
<i>have any authority to hand Campbell over</i>
<i>to the Israeli government for trial.</i>

921
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:21,316
<i>However, it all may be a moot point.</i>

922
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:25,309
<i>Howard W. Campbell has,</i>
<i>once again, escaped without a trace.</i>

923
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,325
<i>This is Campbell's</i>
<i>last known residence.</i>

924
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,328
<i>The modest apartment in Greenwich</i>
<i>Village has been vandalized...</i>

925
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:37,321
<i>by locals angered by Campbell's</i>
<i>latest escape from justice.</i>

926
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,335
<i>The United States government</i>
<i>has promised to make a full review...</i>

927
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,338
<i>of Campbell's citizenship status...</i>

928
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,341
<i>and to find out why he was never</i>
<i>brought to trial previously.</i>

929
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:50,345
<i>In the meantime, Israel has stepped up</i>
<i>its demands for Campbell...</i>

930
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:54,349
<i>encouraged by the idea that he may not</i>
<i>be a citizen of the U. S...</i>

931
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:58,353
<i>that he may, in fact,</i>
<i>be a citizen of nowhere at all.</i>

932
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:02,357
<i>We must never forget that</i>
<i>a propagandist of Campbell's sort...</i>
<i>"Israeli Vice-Consul"</i>

933
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:06,350
<i>is every bit as much of a mass murderer</i>
<i>as Eichmann, Himmler and even Hitler.</i>

934
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,366
<i>How many millions of people</i>
<i>lost their lives...</i>

935
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,359
<i>because of the lies he spread</i>
<i>during the war?</i>

936
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,376
<i>We will find Campbell,</i>
<i>just as we found Eichmann.</i>

937
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,379
<i>A man can't hide forever</i>
<i>when his hands are covered...</i>

938
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,372
<i>with the blood</i>
<i>of six million human beings.</i>

939
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,388
"Work Makes You Free"
Howard W. Campbell, Jr...

940
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,391
wanted to be here tonight...

941
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:40,384
to tell you of his long and fulfilling
association with your fallen hero.

942
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:45,400
But he's asked me to make this
brief statement to you...

943
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,403
on his behalf.

944
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:52,396
The truth of your leader,
August Krapptauer, and those like him...

945
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,410
will be with mankind forever...

946
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,414
as long as there are men and women
who listen to their guts...

947
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:03,407
instead of their minds.

948
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,424
And now for a special treat.

949
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,426
A subscriber to the
<i>White Christian Minuteman</i> in Vermont...

950
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:15,419
has made us a loan
of some very rare material...

951
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:20,435
which I'm sure you'll find
most inspiring.

952
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:24,428
Robert?

953
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,449
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>This is Howard W. Campbell, Jr...</i>

954
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,452
<i>the last free American.</i>

955
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,456
<i>Tonight, I would like to ask</i>
<i>a common question:</i>

956
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,458
<i>Why are we enemies of theJew?</i>

957
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,460
<i>The answer is simple.</i>

958
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,464
<i>TheJew is the cause</i>
<i>and the beneficiary of our slavery.</i>

959
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,467
<i>He has made two halves</i>
<i>of the fatherland.</i>

960
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:56,471
<i>TheJew has no interest in the solution</i>
<i>of Germany's problems.</i>

961
01:22:56,471 --> 01:23:00,475
<i>He can't.</i>
<i>He wants them to remain unsolved.</i>

962
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:04,479
<i>You see, he has a better trump in</i>
<i>his hand if a nation lives in slavery...</i>

963
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,481
<i>than one that is free.</i>

964
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,484
<i>TheJew is the cause</i>
<i>of our misery...</i>

965
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,487
<i>and today he lives on our trust.</i>

966
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,490
<i>And that is why,</i>
<i>as National Socialists...</i>

967
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,492
<i>we are enemies of theJew.</i>

968
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:21,496
<i>He has ruined our race,</i>
<i>rotted our morals...</i>

969
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:25,489
<i>corrupted our traditions</i>
<i>and broken our power.</i>

970
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:29,504
<i>As long as we are true</i>
<i>to our Aryan heritage...</i>

971
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,506
<i>he is a leper among us.</i>

972
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:35,499
<i>If we ignore our destiny, he will</i>
<i>triumph over us and our future.</i>

973
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,515
<i>TheJew is the plastic demon</i>
<i>of the fall of mankind.</i>

974
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:44,519
<i>He thrives in filth and garbage,</i>
<i>and he spreads disease.</i>

975
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,522
<i>He steals our possessions</i>
<i>and lusts after our women.</i>

976
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,525
<i>He pretends to be afraid</i>
<i>of this victim...</i>

977
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,528
<i>and before the unfortunate one knows it,</i>
<i>his neck is broken.</i>

978
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:57,532
<i>We areJew-haters</i>
<i>because we are proud to be Aryans.</i>

979
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:01,536
<i>It isn't true that we eat a Jew</i>
<i>with every breakfast.</i>

980
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:05,540
<i>But it is true that theJew</i>
<i>is slowly eating away at our future.</i>

981
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,543
<i>That is going to change</i>
<i>as surely as we are Aryans...</i>

982
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,546
<i>as surely as world supremacy...</i>

983
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:15,539
<i>is the birthright</i>
<i>of the Aryan race.</i>

984
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:24,559
"Leave Thru Coal Bin Door.
Cross Alley #645. Life In Danger!"
<i>This has been Howard W. Campbell, Jr...</i>

985
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,562
<i>the last free American.</i>

986
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,564
<i>Thank you for listening.</i>

987
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:33,557
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

988
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:44,628
I gotta admit, Howard, act three
had me on the edge of my seat.

989
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:50,645
My blue fairy godmother.

990
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,648
I was beginning to wonder
if you really existed.

991
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:56,651
I exist all right.
I'm just retired. Eight years now.

992
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,644
Imagine my surprise when they called me
out of retirement two months ago.

993
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,659
- For me?
- Yeah.

994
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,652
- Why all this sudden interest in me?
- That's what I'm supposed to find out.

995
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:14,669
Well, it's no mystery
why the Israelis wouldn't want me.

996
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,673
No, the mystery is why the Russians
should think you're such a fat prize.

997
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:22,677
The Russians?
What Russians?

998
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:26,681
Well, at least two in this country.

999
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,685
One is your friend,
Colonel Iona Potipov.

1000
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:34,678
- Potipov?
- Sorry, you know him as George Kraft.

1001
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,683
He's been operating in the U.S.
As a Russian spy since '35.

1002
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:43,698
George Kraft's not a spy.

1003
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,701
- I mean, George told me about his wife.
- His wife?

1004
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,705
In Indianapolis who died four years ago?
No such person.

1005
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,708
He's got a wife, all right,
still living in Proscurov.

1006
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,711
He just hasn't seen her for 25 years.

1007
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,704
I don't imagine he's mentioned the three
children or nine grandchildren.

1008
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,718
- Kraft, he was...
- Potipov.

1009
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,721
Whatever. He was living
in the building for three years.

1010
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,723
I mean, he didn't
introduce himself to me.

1011
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,726
I went downstairs.
I introduced myself to him.

1012
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,729
From what I can tell, you weren't part
of his original agenda.

1013
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:17,732
Just sort of an unexpected perk.

1014
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,735
Everything was nice and quiet
until he sent an anonymous letter...

1015
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:23,738
to your protege, Dr. Jones,
telling him where you were.

1016
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:27,731
Then the excrement
really hit the air-conditioning.

1017
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,745
It was Kraft.

1018
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:33,748
If it makes you feel any better,
he really is a painter.

1019
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,751
I don't think much of his work,
but what do I know about art?

1020
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:40,755
Maybe it's okay. Maybe that's
the one thing you can't fake.

1021
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:44,748
Maybe you're the exception
to that too.

1022
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,765
What was Kraft's plan for me?

1023
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,768
Well, when he tipped off Jones...

1024
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,771
he knew you'd become news again.

1025
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,774
He figured he could get you out of the
country easier and stay by your side.

1026
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:03,767
And you could be kidnapped
with fewer international complications.

1027
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,782
I see. I see.

1028
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,784
Well...

1029
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:13,788
you said there was two Russian spies.

1030
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,790
Who's the other?
Jones?

1031
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,793
Nah, Jones is
the one true friend you got.

1032
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,786
Seems he's the only one
with your best interest at heart.

1033
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:27,791
Who's the other one?

1034
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,818
No, not Resi.

1035
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,811
No, goddamn you!
Not Resi!

1036
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:53,828
Relax, Howard,
I'm only the messenger.

1037
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,831
You're a goddamn liar.

1038
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:00,835
I'm sure she had you thinking about your
new life and how nice it would be...

1039
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,838
but it wouldn't have gone that way.

1040
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,841
When you got to the airport in Mexico
City, there'd be a second plane...

1041
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:10,834
and off you'd go on a one-way trip
to Moscow, all expenses paid.

1042
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,870
What could the Russians
possibly want...

1043
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:39,874
with such a burned-out piece
of World War II surplus?

1044
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,876
They can exhibit you
as a prime example...

1045
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:45,880
of the fascist war criminals
that this country shelters.

1046
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,883
<i>They also hope you'll confess</i>
<i>to all sorts of collusion...</i>

1047
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:52,876
<i>between the Nazis and Americans</i>
<i>before and after the war.</i>

1048
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,882
I think that's our echo.

1049
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:04,899
You've been typing
for almost 15 hours straight.

1050
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:08,892
Me, I've barely written
five pages in as many days.

1051
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:12,907
When do you eat?

1052
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:16,911
I don't know.

1053
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:20,915
I hear your trial starts
in a couple of days.

1054
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,918
Where's your lawyer?

1055
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:27,911
He's trying to find the one person
who'll corroborate my defense.

1056
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,918
So far I'm told he
doesn't exist.

1057
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,934
Listen, Campbell,
can I give you some advice?

1058
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,936
Certainly.

1059
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:45,940
Spend some time
in the exercise yard...

1060
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,933
or have them bring in
a radio or television.

1061
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,947
You've got to learn to relax.

1062
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:56,940
It is important to learn
how to relax.

1063
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:07,951
That's how I got here!

1064
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:18,962
Hey, Eichmann, can I ask you
a personal question?

1065
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,978
Certainly.

1066
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,971
Do you believe you're guilty
of murdering six million Jews?

1067
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:33,988
Absolutely not.

1068
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,990
Oh, you were simply a soldier,
were you?

1069
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,993
Taking orders from higher-ups,
is that right, Eichmann...

1070
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:42,986
like any good soldier?

1071
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,004
- Campbell?
- Yes.

1072
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:54,008
- About those six million...
- Yes?

1073
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:58,012
I don't need credit for all of them.

1074
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:02,005
I'm sure I could spare you a few.

1075
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:25,039
- Where were you?
- We were worried about you, old boy.

1076
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,043
- You are cold.
- I just stepped outside for some air.

1077
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:33,047
- That was a bit of a risk, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was a bit of a risk...

1078
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:37,051
but you know what Jones says:
"I'll sacrifice anything for the truth."

1079
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:41,055
This is torture having to stay
in this cramped room...

1080
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:44,058
for the fear of our lives.

1081
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,060
How can people treat us like this?

1082
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,062
Oh, I don't know, Resi.

1083
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,065
You know, in spite of everything...

1084
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,067
I still believe people
are really good at heart.

1085
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:56,070
You know?

1086
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:00,063
Tomorrow we will start our new lives,
and then you will be able to relax.

1087
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:05,068
Oh, yes, to relax.

1088
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:10,084
- You know, I was thinking...
- What? Tell me.

1089
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:14,077
I was thinking that maybe Mexico
isn't what we want.

1090
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,092
We can just go on from there.

1091
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,096
Maybe right at the Mexico City airport,
we could just get right on another jet.

1092
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,098
Onto...

1093
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:28,102
I don't know.
We could go to the Caribbean.

1094
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:32,095
- We could go to Moscow maybe.
- Moscow?

1095
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:37,111
That's a novel idea.

1096
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:41,104
- You don't like it?
- I would have to think about it.

1097
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,123
I want you
to think about it, too, okay?

1098
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:52,126
- Yeah, if you want.
- Yeah.

1099
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,129
You know,
the more I think about it...

1100
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,130
the better it sounds.

1101
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,133
What can you possibly
find interesting about Moscow?

1102
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:03,126
Well, I don't know.
I'd like to visit an old friend.

1103
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,140
You never told me
you had a friend in Moscow.

1104
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,143
Gee, George, I guess it just
never came up in a conversation.

1105
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:13,136
What's his name?

1106
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,150
Colonel Iona Potipov.

1107
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,152
- Don't know him.
- Don't know him, huh?

1108
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:22,156
It doesn't matter. He's just a spy
trying to get me to Mexico City...

1109
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,159
so I can be kidnapped
and flown to Russia to stand trial.

1110
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:29,152
- That is not...
- Don't even think about it.

1111
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:35,158
God, Howard, this is ridiculous.

1112
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,171
Cowboys and Indians.

1113
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:41,164
Yeah, all right, George.

1114
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:51,185
Howard, this is not who I am.
This is the way things are.

1115
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:54,188
Nobody should know that
better than you.

1116
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:58,181
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Sweetheart.

1117
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:04,187
That dream about Mexico...
it was really true.

1118
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,204
Tomorrow we were all
going to escape.

1119
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,207
It was our mission
to get to Moscow...

1120
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:17,211
but then I was not going
to go through with it...

1121
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,214
because I love you.

1122
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:23,217
I told you I was not gonna go through
with it, did I not?

1123
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:25,219
Yes, you did.
She told me.

1124
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:28,222
And he agreed with me. He came up
with the dream of Mexico...

1125
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:32,226
where we would all get out
of this trap together.

1126
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:36,219
- How did you find out?
- American agents.

1127
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:40,234
They'll be raiding our
happy little home any minute now.

1128
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:43,237
That's unfortunate.

1129
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,240
Then we must leave right now, <i>liebling,</i>
while we still can.

1130
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:50,244
It's too late, darling.
We're already surrounded.

1131
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:53,247
- Then we will fight them.
- Resi, you don't understand.

1132
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:57,240
I said, we are surrounded.

1133
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,254
Does that matter?

1134
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:04,247
Yes, of course that matters. We...

1135
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,263
You mean,
why don't I die for love...

1136
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:13,267
like a hero
in a Howard W. Campbell play?

1137
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,268
Yeah.

1138
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:18,261
<i>Ja,</i> that is exactly
what I mean.

1139
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:40,283
Let us die together...
here and now.

1140
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:46,300
You have a full life ahead of you.

1141
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:50,293
I have a full life behind me.

1142
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:55,298
All in those few sweet hours
with you.

1143
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:02,316
Sounds like a line
I might have written as a young man.

1144
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:06,309
It <i>is</i> a line you wrote
as a young man.

1145
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:10,324
A foolish young man.

1146
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:14,328
I adore that man.

1147
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:18,321
I'm sorry, I can't congratulate you
on your taste in men.

1148
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:31,345
You no longer...

1149
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:35,338
you no longer believe
that love is the only thing to live for?

1150
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,353
Well, no.

1151
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:43,346
Then tell me what to live for.

1152
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:47,361
Tell me anything.
It does not have to be love.

1153
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:50,364
Anything at all!
I will live for that chair...

1154
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:54,357
or that picture on the wall
or that crack over there!

1155
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,372
Just tell me.
Tell me what you live for...

1156
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,374
and I will live for that too!

1157
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:04,367
Resi, what I live for is...

1158
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:09,372
I'm an old man.

1159
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:13,387
I will show you what to live for.

1160
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:17,380
I will show you a woman
who dies for love.

1161
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:22,385
No, Resi.
No, no, my God.

1162
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:32,395
Don't move a muscle.

1163
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:48,422
<i>The morning after the raid</i>
<i>on Jones's basement...</i>

1164
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,424
<i>I was released...</i>

1165
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:54,417
<i>thanks, I suppose,</i>
<i>to my blue fairy godmother.</i>

1166
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,433
<i>I was deposited</i>
<i>onto the streets of New York...</i>

1167
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:02,436
<i>restored to the mainstream of life.</i>

1168
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:05,439
<i>I took several steps</i>
<i>down the sidewalk...</i>

1169
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:09,432
<i>when something happened.</i>

1170
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:44,478
<i>It was not guilt that froze me.</i>

1171
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:48,471
<i>I had taught myself</i>
<i>never to feel guilt.</i>

1172
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:00,494
<i>It wasn't the fear of death.</i>

1173
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:04,487
<i>I had taught myself</i>
<i>to think of death as a friend.</i>

1174
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:09,503
<i>It was not the thought</i>
<i>of being unloved that froze me.</i>

1175
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:13,496
<i>I had taught myself</i>
<i>to do without love.</i>

1176
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:18,512
<i>What froze me was the fact</i>
<i>that I had absolutely no reason...</i>

1177
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:22,505
<i>to move in any direction.</i>

1178
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:49,532
Are you all right?

1179
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,547
Yes.

1180
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:57,551
Been standing there a long time.

1181
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:01,544
Waiting for somebody?

1182
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:08,551
You lost?

1183
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:20,563
Better move on then,
don't you think?

1184
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:25,568
Yeah.

1185
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:40,583
"Nazi Pig"

1186
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:29,632
"Keep Out"

1187
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:31,694
"Let's Finish The Job!"

1188
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,730
Who is it?

1189
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:00,723
- It's Howard Campbell.
- What do you want?

1190
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,737
Could I come in?

1191
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:07,730
You're going to have to tell me
what this is about.

1192
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:12,735
I want to go to Israel
to stand trial.

1193
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:18,752
What?

1194
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:22,745
I want to be tried
for my crimes against humanity.

1195
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,762
What do you want from me?

1196
01:44:28,762 --> 01:44:32,766
I want to surrender
to an Auschwitzer.

1197
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:36,759
Then find one who thinks
of Auschwitz all the time.

1198
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:52,786
And don't speak Yiddish!
We are in America now!

1199
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,789
If you can't remember,
I will remember for both of us.

1200
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,791
- You still want revenge, is that it?
- Yes.

1201
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:01,784
Then go on with your plan
because it proves nothing.

1202
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,793
Mr. Campbell,
I think I can help you.

1203
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:42,825
Thank you.

1204
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:00,843
Yes.

1205
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:19,862
"Translation: 'Corpse carriers
to the guardhouse."'

1206
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:29,883
"Tomorrow"

1207
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,886
"My Trial"

1208
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:36,879
"Begins"

1209
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,929
<i>"Dear Howard</i>...

1210
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:19,922
<i>The discipline of a lifetime now</i>
<i>collapses like the walls ofJericho.</i>

1211
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:24,938
<i>What is the tune</i>
<i>that Joshua's trumpet plays?</i>

1212
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:28,931
<i>Is that the music of my conscience?</i>
<i>I doubt it. I've done you no wrong.</i>

1213
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:33,936
<i>I think the music must be an old</i>
<i>soldier's itch for a little treason.</i>

1214
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:37,951
<i>And treason this letter is.</i>

1215
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:41,955
<i>I hereby violate</i>
<i>my direct and explicit orders...</i>

1216
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:45,948
<i>and identify myself as the man</i>
<i>you knew as Frank Wirtanen. "</i>

1217
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,963
<i>I affirm and will affirm</i>
<i>under oath...</i>

1218
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:52,966
<i>that I recruited you</i>
<i>as an American agent...</i>

1219
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:56,970
<i>and that you,</i>
<i>at great personal sacrifice...</i>

1220
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:00,963
<i>became one of the most effective</i>
<i>agents of the Second World War.</i>

1221
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:06,980
<i>If there must be a trial</i>
<i>of Howard W. Campbell, Jr...</i>

1222
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,983
<i>let it be one hell of a contest...</i>

1223
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:12,986
<i>and may justice be served.</i>

1224
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:16,979
<i>Yours truly, Frank.</i>

1225
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:40,013
<i>May justice be served.</i>

1226
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:44,006
<i>I like the sound of that.</i>

1227
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:03,025
<i>They say that a hanging man</i>
<i>hears glorious music.</i>

1228
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:09,031
<i>I wonder what it sounds like.</i>

1229
