KESTREL: Your mission.

734
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:27,782
My agreement with the Americans
was for his extraction and mine.

But the bomb,
that was our mission.

736

Gruenewald is the atomic bomb.

Yes.

739
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,002
The first prototype was a failure,

740
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:43,756
but Dr. Gruenewald corrected
his trigger design this morning.

741
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:48,302
The Waf fen-SS will take possession of
the second bomb tomorrow for the test.

742
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:52,515
If it works, they will have
no further need of him.

743
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:53,766
So they'll kill him?

744
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,852
Yes.

745
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,480
He's been a prisoner
at the factory for months.

746
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,692
His research is the only thing
that's kept him alive.

747
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,860
What about the other prisoners?

748
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,821
We'll only have
one truck waiting.

749

we won't have room for anybody else.
