1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,700
On this map, all the territory indicated
green is known as an act

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
"Louisiana Purchase," the area that is
Pres. Jefferson bought from Napoleon.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,100
Today covers a large part of even 15
States, and even the part of Canada.

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,100
The area is more than twice
greater than the original 15 states.

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
But with this purchase,

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,100
inadvertently came the infamous pirate,
sea robber, Jean Lafitte.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,100
If you were a little
patient, ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,300
could increase the pleasure
in a film that you will see,

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
if you know why
the Jean Lafitte ...

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,400
and his little insular
stronghold in Barataria Bay,

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,800
near the mouth of the Mississippi River, were so
important for both sides in the war 1812th whatever.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,900
Nadiruaa English army knew
that they will control New Orleans

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,700
give control over the entire course of the river
Mississippi and bring certain victory.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
England command stressed
access to New Orleans

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,800
the river is not an option.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,000
But this network of water
roads, you see here,

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,300
called branches, which
is controlled by Jean Lafitte,

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,200
was the rear entrance
in New Orleans.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
Both the British and the Americans
they knew

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,500
Lafitte the key. And what
this pirate do?

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
This, ladies and gentlemen,
our story.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,300
<i> <font color=#2B60DE> MARINE robbers </ i>

23
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,100
<i> Jean Lafitte, the last sea robber and
still lives in the immortal words of Byron: </ i>

24
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,100
<i> "He left a pirate name other times-

<i> Three U.S. President condemned,

26
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,100
But Fate has put in the hands of this man
without a country, the fate of one,

27
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,400
United States, which fought for
own existence in the war 1812th I. ..

28
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,900
... Experienced defeat after defeat. Now
Only one man stood in defense,

29
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,800
to prevent a deadly Scorecard
shot - uneducated general,

30
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,000
the name of Andrew Jackson, with acicom hunters
the squirrels and inexperienced recruits.

31
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,100
Come on, boy. Over here.

32
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,200
No you will not do nothing.

33
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,800
You must be hungry.
Will one cookie?

34
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Come on, boy.
Certainly good.

35
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,100
Better not look at the dog,
than a rifle, soldier.

36
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Place it in your hands.

37
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
You are English?

38
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,300
If I had, you
would be dead.

39
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
How long were you in the military?
- From the day before.

40
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, boy, how
do you feel?

41
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,300
A bit hungry.

42
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,500
You're not hungry until your stomach
not cleave along Kiem.

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,100
Hang on now that musket.

44
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,100
How long have you been with
Old eagle face?

45
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,500
I am old
Eagle face.

46
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,100
You? Andy Jackson himself?

47
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
The thought and me
sometimes scares.

48
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,400
How did someone like you get this
task? Now I can relax, right?

49
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,900
More krpa damn boots?
- Better them than your feet!

50
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
Andy, you're not coming here,

51
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
since you sent me to wander and gather
people in this chill. - I know, I know.

52
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,700
And you know, this is more difficult to tolerate when
these bones weaken. Sit down.

53
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,100
Here, have some fine
hot soup.

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Thank you, Mr. Peavey!

55
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,500
Inside the waiting one officer. Came
and see all the way from Washington.

56
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,900
Why did not you say so?

57
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,600
He did not say it was an emergency,
only official visit.

58
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,700
What's the news? To
ease, Captain.

59
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Captain Wilkes, I come in the name of
President Maddison, sir.

60
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,300
The English won Washington.
They burned the capital and the White House.

61
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,200
The President is safe?
- He got away, sir.

62
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
But the next few weeks,

63
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,000
government will be monitored from
President's saddle horse.

64
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,800
We pray that this
horse does not stumble.

65
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,100
The fate of the country in
your hands, General.

66
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
England invading fleet
sent to New Orleans.

67
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
On ships have
16,000.

68
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,900
16th ..?

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,900
They expect them to stop S. ..?

70
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
Here we have 1,200 people,

71
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,500
and most of these boys does not
shoes, let alone a man. How do I ...?

72
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
New Orleans?

73
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Obviously here we have more
chickens, but soldiers.

74
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,100
Move it.

75
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Let's see.

76
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,200
If you control the Mississippi,
will keep this country by the throat.

77
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Maybe we could
set up a defense here.

78
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,100
And there.
- Not there.

79
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
Why not you?
- It's Barataria.

80
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Each piece of the swamp
controls Lafitte, the pirate.

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
From New Orleans to the Gulf.
First we have to agree with him.

82
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
Agree? With a pirate?

83
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,300
What kind of deal,
We will hang him.

84
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,100
Trying to hang him
already 10 years.

85
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,600
When Andy talks about hanging,
you should see a rope.

86
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
<i> JEAN LAFITTE provides a rare
opportunity - without taxes </ i>

87
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,000
<i> MARKET seven seas. </ i>

welcome to the market Jean Lafittea.

89
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Without taxes. No additional charges
the war was lost.

90
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Come on, we cleaned the deck.
Well, what have you got there?

91
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Gentlemen, this is a real
Spanish lace!

92
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
How exciting!

93
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,200
It looks like it's from the harem. So-
you will not feel like a sultan.

94
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
Take care of gentlemen.

95
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Gentlemen, what is life
without the right spices?

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,700
Me personally this is the King of France
asked to sell on his behalf.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Apparently the King of France
has a bad taste.

98
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Ma'am, this is a fine piece of the picture.
He just needs a little polishing.

99
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
What, you do not like children?

100
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,400
Mobi, eaerna cane.

101
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Pickpocket.

102
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mobi! eaerna cane.

103
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Hello, General.

104
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,700
When you steal the sea,
Then you sea robber.

105
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,500
When you steal the
land, then you are a thief.

106
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Mobile, Mobile, eaerna cane.

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,900
Excuse me, sir. I
you dropped your wallet.

108
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,100
Thank you!

109
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,100
I did not expect that
the pirate ... - What?

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I wanted to say, thank you.

111
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
General Dominique?

112
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Good afternoon, madam.

113
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,000
I brought you
something as a souvenir.

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

115
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,900
For beauty, honor.

116
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,500
It gave me the car in Austerlitz.

117
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,400
General, you should not have.
Really should not have.

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Bonnie, give me the money, not
belong to either you or your father.

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Move it. You know that half
every dollar goes Lafitteu.

120
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
Just try to take it,
I'll rip your belly.

121
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
Look, Bonnie, half
belongs to the boss.

122
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Keep your claws out
ocevog of cargo!

123
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
If you were not the daughter of Captain
Brown, I'd ...

124
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
You what?
- Bitch one!

125
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Who pushed Bonnie?
- I am.

126
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,100
Move, Dominique,
I'll kill that filthy squid.

127
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,800
Dame can not beat with a broken
bottles. - I do not have a sword.

128
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
Bring it on!

129
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,100
It was Jean Lafitte!

130
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Go get 'em!

131
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the end of our little show.

132
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
We hope you
enjoy the show.

133
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,600
Let it be
just a hint of what,

134
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,800
we went through, we find
brought treasures Seven Seas.

135
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,100
We take the risk,
and you bargain.

136
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Thanks, Lafitte.

137
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,600
Thank you, Mr. Lafitte, exceptional
performance, as always.

138
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
Thank you all, gentlemen.

139
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Hey!
- What is it?

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Why not nauci handled scissors
cutting as you handle a knife?

141
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,700
Governor's daughter. What
you think you doing here?

142
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,200
You do not think
came to buy?

143
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss Claiborne!

144
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Good day, madame Mercier,
I'm glad to see you.

145
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's go guys, run it.

146
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,800
Now everyone can show appreciation,
so a little more open wallet.

147
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Goodbye.

148
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,300
My dear, we are very honored
your distinctive prisutnoau.

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Better not tell her husband
where you purchased this scarf.

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
Mr. Lafitte, never say.

151
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,200
Actually her and you can not blame him.

152
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
He's a pirate.

153
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
You'll see why
my hands are tied.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Sales of goods without taxes,
signed by Jean Lafitte.

155
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,900
How to gather taxes, when half
New Orleans business with these pirates.

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
There must be a way, they are breaking the law.
- We can not arrest the whole town.

157
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
It is true that, in fact,
nobody cares.

158
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,300
Nobody wants to pay taxes
in a war that we are losing.

159
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,700
If you think so, sir. Phipps,
maybe you need to resign.

160
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,400
I am a loyal American, sir.

161
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay, okay, we have
Lafittea today in shackles.

162
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,400
Annette.

163
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,700
I did not ask to
fall in love with you.

164
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
After I
first saw you,

165
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,300
I had thought to be 4 months
knowing that we'll be out of sight.

166
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,700
Neither typhoons or hurricanes, and not
could erase from my mind.

167
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,400
And you came back here.

168
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,900
What I thought might be
just a dream, you've done stvarnoau.

169
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,900
Now you say it's over.

170
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Jean,

171
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,300
my father is here
sent to the President,

172
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,000
to this country
brought a kind of unity.

173
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
And I, behold, there

174
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
in love with a man, which can destroy
all that my father is trying to build.

175
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,000
Who, me?
- Yes, you.

176
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,000
I feel like I'm
on the side of the enemy.

177
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,300
Half my people we are jumping the neck, because they
do not allow attacking U.S. ships.

178
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Love for you
it cost me a lot of money.

179
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Jean ...

180
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
It's not about what you do not do,
already about what they should.

181
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,200
We are losing the war. Englishmen
just burned Washington.

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,500
What does it matter to us?

183
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,000
New Orleans might be next.

184
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,600
New Orleans had three different
Flags in the last 15 years.

185
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,000
It does not matter what will be
and fourth. - It is important to me.

186
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
You do not know what it means
belong to a country.

187
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
You want a country?
I'll give it to you.

188
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You can have Barataria.

189
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,600
Barataria?

190
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Barataria's kingdom
a thousand fighters.

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,500
Ships that sail
Gulf and Caribbean.

192
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Do you know what they offer
King of Barataria?

193
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,300
$ 500
dead or alive.

194
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
It will not charge it.

195
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,100
Jean, a girl must be proud
on his love, do not be ashamed of it.

196
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,100
How can I tell people that I love
man, who is the head of a price?

197
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,900
You're just not ...

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
What did not?
Say it.

199
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
You are not worthy of respect.

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,900
Worthy of respect.

201
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,800
What do you want the code
weapons, not a man.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,700
I want a man with a feeling of
honor, duty and loyalty.

203
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,800
Not savages. -Savage you
was not good enough,

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,700
when you needed breath of fresh air in
your boring social life.

205
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
My life may be boring,

206
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
but 'barato' continues
means cheap.

207
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,000
I think it's better to
get back to the carriage.

208
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Too late, gentlemen. Just
You missed a good opportunity.

209
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,100
Hooch, set the best
archers on those trees.

210
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Blue, cover the bridge.

211
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,700
We can take them, boss. - No
shooting. I do not want trouble.

212
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Come on. Quick!

213
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,900
Now you will see,
Governor.

214
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,100
I swear, sir, there are people Lafitteovi
maintain sales an hour ago.

215
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,600
I know, I know.

216
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm glad, Governor.
- You look funny, sir.

217
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Governor, you
I did not expect!

218
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
Obviously, madame.

219
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Can you explain,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

220
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
why do you find in this
beznacajnoj swamp,

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,300
hands full
krijumcarenih things.

222
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,900
Even my own daughter.
- Excuse me. Father, I ...

223
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
You're looking good
bargain, Miss?

224
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,800
Governor!

225
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Looking for something special?

226
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,900
I ask you!
Mr. Phipps?

227
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,600
Yes, sir.
- Read my manifesto.

228
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm offering $ 500 reward

229
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,100
to capture Jean Lafittea.

230
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
$ 500? That's new.
- Dead or alive.

231
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,500
William CC Claiborne,
Governor Louis'.

232
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,100
I, Jean Lafitte,
I offer 10 thousand dollars

233
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,800
Hearing Governor Claiborne.

234
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
Lieutenant!

235
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
Capture this man!
- Carefully, Governor.

236
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
You are not at home.

237
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Governor!

238
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,700
One hundred guns were directed
to you at this moment.

239
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,500
It is better not to take risks,
Governor, people can get hurt.

240
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Just the fear that someone
of you to be hurt,

241
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,400
inhibit me that this pirate
immediately brought to justice.

242
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,100
Sir, I'm a pirate.
Pirate.

243
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,300
You laugh!
I just laugh!

244
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,300
Did not realize that
your country is at war?

245
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Will you laugh and
when the British march,

246
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
and you you do not have any
State or the flag?

247
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,500
And you! Will you laugh
when General Jackson rides

248
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,600
and expel you and your koljace
out of Barataria?

249
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
And others have tried before.

250
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
It will be differently
with Jackson.

251
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,000
He swore to you that there is no
places under the American flag.

252
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm truly sorry
to hear that, Governor.

253
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
I've always respected
American flag.

254
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,400
Miss, are you coming?

255
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm not looking for trouble.

256
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,300
While with me,
she's a lady.

257
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
It's a lady!

258
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,900
Come, come, fix
I will you. You're next.

259
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,800
I do not know how to swim.
I've got to get him out.

260
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,200
Cowards.

261
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
There were days when I could
handle ten of these at once.

262
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,000
If you were not so drunk
I would beat you up.

263
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay, okay.

264
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,100
These punks down there!
- Who are you yelling?

265
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,500
On you! Now get out before
than you send patrol.

266
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
Who do you nare?uje?

267
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,700
I was a ship's captain
before you. Get down!

268
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Come on, fatty. - Stop it, Paul.
- Come on, I'll fix you, too!

269
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Shut up, Paul!
- Stop it, honey.

270
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
These rats here
they first began.

271
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes, he would not hurt a fly!
- They insulted my lady.

272
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,000
You must be blind.

273
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,300
This monster, lady?

274
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,900
Who are you calling ...
- Get out of that and do not carve.

275
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Mr. Brown, you will allow
to discuss this with me?

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Bonnie is right.
You monster. Erase.

277
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,400
It is a case
with the lady.

278
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,100
Come on, Paul.

279
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,900
You should have seen me, Bonnie. Arranged
I have four of, yet I used fists.

280
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Why do not you use the on Lafitteu?
Instead of those rats.

281
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,600
I'll choose the time.
Come on, let's go have a drink.

282
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
And, no, you will not.
You've got sloshed.

283
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
Only one.
- Get back to the ship.

284
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Here comes another one.
- Everybody stand back. Be careful.

285
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,000
Keep them away from the line.

286
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Sale.
- Come on, Paul.

287
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,800
Before you
gets in your mouth.

288
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,200
Come here.
Look at that.

289
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
U.S. ships that
Lafitte never attacks.

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
And what happens? All
Gold from New Orleans

291
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,600
He slipped through the hands to
those Yankee falcon.

292
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,300
Lucky charm.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Buy lucky charm
and long live.

294
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
Passengers for Corinthian,
Embark.

295
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
Take care, boarding burden.

296
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Just a little, please.
- You can not let them. - Yes, sir.

297
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,400
But now it's all yours,
Captain Carruthers.

298
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,900
Sign here and download
governor consignment for safekeeping.

299
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I'd rather have the burden of cobras,
but the devil's bait.

300
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,000
Already has enough trouble with the lock.
- Maybe you mist be walked on hand.

301
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,500
Mr. Miggs.

302
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,900
You just give us
a few minutes?

303
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes, sir.
- Good.

304
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
Give a signal to visitors
go ashore.

305
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,400
All visitors to the coast.

306
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,800
I never thought I'd
you see that keep a child.

307
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I wish you luck.
- It will take me.

308
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,400
Marie!
- Annette.

309
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,800
I found a message that you left your father.
You're coming home with me, now.

311
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Sorry, Annette.

312
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
It goes with me
Spain. We'll be married.

313
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Stay out of it, Antonio.

314
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,400
Annette, manage fathers
life, but do not mine.

315
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,200
She will not listen to reason,
Antonio, maybe you will.

316
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,900
I talked to your father, says that
we need to wait until the war is not to wind up.

317
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,600
And I I will not wait!

318
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,700
Stop, think
only upon himself.

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,900
It makes no sense to talk with her, Antonio.
He knows all about how to be a lady.

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
But nothing about it
how to be a woman.

321
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
You're probably right.

322
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
Ah, Marie.

323
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Annette, please
did not think so.

324
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,900
Very nice, but ... - Annette,
I'm sorry. - It should not be so separate.

325
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Annette, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

326
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,900
If you do not want to sail with us, you must
leave. - Okay, now I'm leaving.

327
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,300
Okay, you two, I'll figure out
How do I tell my father. Beware it.

328
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Look, just do not
thought. Will you catch cold!

329
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,900
Visitors to the coast,
sail.

330
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,400
I wish I could
be at your wedding.

331
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,200
Annette, I had
time purchase wedding dress,

332
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
so I borrowed your
new dress.

333
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,300
Which one? - What you sewed
Madame de Dupre.

334
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,800
Of white crepe?

335
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,200
Annette!
- Yes?

337
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,100
I took my mom and brooch!
- Did you leave me anything?

338
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,200
Yes, father.

339
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Then, Rumbo? Have you caught
that the Portuguese galleon?

340
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
The English is the
first docepali.

341
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
And you Flint,
What did you catch?

342
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Ten pounds of iron in the trunk.
Well that did not sink.

343
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,700
The boss does not like him
Captains of returning empty-handed.

344
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,200
We will convene Captain's Council ...

345
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,700
boss may not be long head.

346
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,600
It is time to ask
few questions Lafitteu.

347
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,600
Sure you want to respond?
Maybe they get.

348
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
Trouble on the horizon, Pyke.

349
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,900
But why stay in Barataria?

350
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Listen to me! Jackson
We send out comes.

351
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,300
And the English blockade
We were there close.

352
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
And you do not give us immersed
U.S. ships.

353
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,700
I say, let's send 100 boats to sink,
pick up values ??and

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,900
let's go to New Orleans,
before Jackson arrived.

355
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
I agree. - Jean,
listen to their captain.

356
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,100
We the people must,
back to him.

357
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,100
Now we have more dealers
from the beach, but the pirates.

358
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,100
What impedes us to stay in
Barataria, and roll back to Jackson?

359
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Our children were born here.

360
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Hut on the beach is the only home
which many will know.

361
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If we go from Barataria,
I'll lose Carribu.

362
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,900
And I'm Tina.

363
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,200
Sailor's home is
deck beneath his feet.

364
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
And why are you wearing a bag
French country around the neck?

365
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
This, Mr Pyke,

366
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,000
reminds me of all the lies,
to talk about the country.

367
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Majcica country, fathers
country, country.

368
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
All this is just a country,
which will bury you.

369
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,300
A shed
blood defending it.

370
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,500
I say that
belong to the sea.

371
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Man belongs there,
Where do you want to belong.

372
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,800
I do not like when I push against.

373
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Neither Claiborne nor Jackson,
or Englishmen or more!

374
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,300
Wait, I want to say something.

375
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
Here, Miguel.

376
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
I forgot.

377
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,100
Boss, may I speak?

378
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Already has enough
unimportant been told.

379
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,000
This is Scipiov home.
Just say it.

380
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,000
I know the law, boss.
I can not dislodge.

381
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,000
Law? What law?

382
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,600
I do not remember, sir, boss?
I was told,

383
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,100
The law on human rights.

384
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,700
Ah, there it is. Regulations
U.S. Declaration.

385
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,500
That all men are
are created equal.

386
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
We are equal in Barataria.
- Silence!

387
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,700
I want to hear the rules.
Continue, Scipio.

388
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,200
That their Creator
determined given rights.

389
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,500
Inalienable rights.

390
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,500
Thank you. -What are these rights?

391
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,500
So to give them
no one can take away!

392
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,600
While no one came
with more artillery.

393
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
That's it!
- Okay, okay!

394
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,600
Thank you, gentlemen.
Continue, Scipio!

395
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,700
Life, liberty and
the achievement of happiness.

396
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,400
It is better than ours
Law Fraternity.

397
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,900
We tell no
guarantee happiness.

398
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,900
None of these
rules is not for us.

399
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,100
They are Americans. - Barataria
The U.S. is, is not it? - Of course!

400
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
As long as we
this pile of sand,

401
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,000
we have all the rights
that we guarantee.

402
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Nobody has the right to evict.

403
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,700
That's right, boss.
- Nonsense!

404
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,100
Of all of these bljezgarija
Freedom and rights me sick.

405
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,000
He says he wants to stay
and be Americans.

406
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,100
Do not lie,
said to you.

407
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,300
This is the only America,
to which he cared.

408
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
He's right.
- Stay out of it, Bonnie.

409
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,300
My father was the best
water you've ever had.

410
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,700
And while all of you are here chatting,

411
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
He went for cargo, valuable
quarter of a million dollars in gold.

412
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,900
What are you talking about?

413
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,300
For months there was no ship
Treasure at a distance of 150 km.

414
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,900
Gold transferred from New Orleans,
right in front of you.

415
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,700
The only ship that sailed from the
port last week was Corinthian.

416
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,200
Sailed before two nights.

417
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,700
Corinthian? He
the U.S., boss.

418
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,400
No one shall order my
father who ship to attack.

419
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,500
Least Lafitte.

420
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,800
My father had his own fleet,
while you fought for scraps.

421
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
No longer betray
orders, Lafitte.

422
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,700
Now it works
Captain Brown.

423
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Flint, Captain Rumbo,
on their ships.

424
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
Slowly, Jean,

425
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,000
quarter of a million is a significant prey.
- We will follow the one who returned.

426
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
Right.

427
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,600
I'll take Ravena and crew'll
congregate on the beach, if I have to.

428
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,800
Jean, you're still the boss. And I
I still assistant.

429
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
I do not like to miss a good fight.

430
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Just pray that
Retrieve your father,

431
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,500
before it touches
the American ship.

432
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,300
I see a ship. Approaching
the. Could be Vulci.

433
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,200
What do you see, Dominique?

434
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Two boats.

435
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,400
One is Vulci.
- And the other?

436
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
All hands on deck.

437
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
For this it is worth
shed a little blood.

438
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Quarter of a million dollars.

439
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,700
We'll see.
- Vraaajte up!

440
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Vraaajte up!

441
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Come on, look alive a bit.
Get it. Faster.

442
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,700
Come on. Hurry.

443
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Is it fixed properly, Gramby?

444
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,500
Yes, Captain. Raises
easily as a puff box.

445
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,000
Good!

446
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Enough promises, Brown. Let's open
and see of which has inutra.

447
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,100
It will be later
time for that.

448
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,500
We have to go, you do not burn the ship.
Diego, release all the ropes.

449
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,600
All return to the ship.
- We all go back to the ship!

450
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Disengage the hooks.
- Disengage the hooks!

451
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Burn it, Chighizola.

452
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Gramby, be ready to fire a salvo
the hull. We do not want to leave evidence.

453
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,300
Yes, Captain.
Prepare top No. 1

454
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,700
Hey, Brown? Are you
saw the Torah on board?

455
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,900
Come here, Mouse,
Before you crisp-fried.

456
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,600
Catch this.
Toro!

457
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,900
Come on, Mouse,
come here.

458
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,900
Toro Toro. Idiot
silly, where are you?

459
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,100
Move the boat to
We are caught by fire.

460
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
Jump, Mouse, leaped.

461
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,600
Fire unit.

462
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,100
It would break his ribs.

463
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,000
Goodbye, Corinthian.

464
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
Captain, what is the Toro!

465
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,600
Leave the bags and
Hop, stupid.

466
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,700
What do you want?

467
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
What the hell are waiting for?
Jump!

468
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,300
When you try to work on next time
kill, I'll kill you myself.

469
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,300
Prepare to
firing twos.

470
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,000
Because you two are almost burned.
It is better that the loot is worth something.

471
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
What are you doing?

472
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
You can not do that.

473
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,700
You know that Brown does not allow
private property.

474
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,900
What are you trying?
Get a knife in the throat?

475
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,100
What have you got there?
Necklaces?

476
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
We sear the third for good luck.

477
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Sobo, prepare three.
- Yes, Captain.

478
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,200
Even the one waiting there.

479
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Fire!

480
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
Hans?
Yes, boss?

481
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,400
Prepare for
switch. - Yes, boss.

482
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Arm yourself for boarding.
Prepare hooks to capture.

483
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,600
Lights out.
- Lights out!

484
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Do not waste too much of the rum, waiting
We have a lot of sea. - Yes, Captain.

485
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
About which they are arguing about towels?

486
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,700
They just fit. - Enough
svakakvog trash. - Hey, Brown!

487
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,800
This is the amulet, which
someone did not bring happiness.

488
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,900
Hey, Brown!

489
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Hey, Captain, do you find this
music does not break my heart?

490
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,800
Just not feeling.
What have you got here?

491
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,800
Look, wedding dress.

492
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Do not I look nice?

493
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Neither barracuda would not marry you.
- Kiss the bride. And you get lice?

494
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Open it!

495
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
What is Gramby?
Do not believe me?

496
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
View of gold returns
man faith, Captain.

497
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,800
Inside is a quarter of a million
dollars. - We want to see the gold!

498
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Well, open.

499
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,900
The thought of these gold
shaking hands, Gramby?

500
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,300
Open it, Gramby.
- Open up!

501
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,800
Just as I told you!

502
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
True, Captain.
It paid off.

503
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
K itself hands.
Move it!

504
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,200
You've seen gold. USA
return to positions.

505
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,400
You heard the captain.

506
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,100
Save it before
These sharks go crazy.

507
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
What do you have, Deacon?

508
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,800
Slightly more valuable than all of your
glittering cunning devil.

509
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,900
Books.
- Pirate who reads books.

510
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
At least this is my boss will not mind.

511
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,100
You're looking at the head, Deacon!

512
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes, I see.

513
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,200
What happened to
you, Tim?

514
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
I lost my ear
in battle, Captain.

515
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,900
Anyway, there is nothing to hear.

516
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Oh, I do not care about listening to
ear I had a diamond ring.

517
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,700
Five pieces a month, regular
income, real brotherhood.

518
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,200
What are our losses? - 4 killed
2 missing and 4 wounded.

519
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Enough, six dead.

520
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,600
Seven.

521
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Accounts and you, Mr. Brown.

522
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Because I'm going to hang you.

523
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,700
You're not one you
hang Lafitte!

524
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Quickly lose
friends, Mr. Brown.

525
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,600
Is there anyone else on the
his side?

526
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Jean! You always
called fair.

527
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Give him a chance. - Is he gave
people a chance to Corinthian?

528
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,600
The boat rescue
Worse deck.

529
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,700
You knew my orders.

530
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,000
All people trapped
board are left alive.

531
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,300
Gramby? You're his assistant.

532
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,900
You had a hand in this? -He received
I have orders from his captain.

533
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
Your captain more
will not issue orders.

534
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,200
Jean! You can hang them all.

535
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,100
I guess I do not keep the entire crew
responsible for the actions of one man?

536
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm not so wide of the heart
as a general. Then, Gramby?

537
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,400
Brown or follow me?

538
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,200
You.
- You ... what?

539
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,400
You, boss!

540
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,700
All right.

541
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Hang him.

542
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
Gramby, do not!

543
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,800
Jack, Tiny, deacon, hold.

544
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Not me.

545
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,000
Gramby!

546
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
What are you mumbling, Deacon?

547
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,900
Prayer for a dying ship.

548
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,800
Dominique, set a course for
Barataria. Full sail.

549
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Positions!

550
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,700
All in their places!

551
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,200
Spread your sails!

552
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Beluche, signal Raven
let go of us.

553
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Yes, General.

554
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,400
Where did he come from?

555
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,600
With Corinthian. My friend Toro
he risked his life to save this brat.

556
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,600
I now feel that the
a saint?

557
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,300
A saint who will save us?

558
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,900
It's a boy with Corinthian! - From
looked at him, I get chills.

559
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
He is the only witness
all that.

560
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Too small to throw back.
- He can hang us all.

561
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,800
Not too small to speak.

562
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,900
"Bad luck."

563
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,600
If you ask me, he
hodajuaa death penalty.

564
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,000
Just have killed.

565
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,600
It is better to kill him.

566
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,200
Deacon. Better
pray for us.

567
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Everybody move.
Unleash mol.

568
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,200
Okay, continue to
beach. Do not stop the boat.

569
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Same goes for buyers
in Nosperovo warehouse.

570
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Why we do not want
tell me what happened?

571
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,600
My mouth can not pronounce
what my eyes saw.

572
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,300
Come on, do not stay.

573
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, what you got there?
- Personal belongings.

574
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,000
They hanged Brown!

575
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,300
They hanged Brown.
They hanged Brown!

576
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,800
Hey?
- What is it?

577
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,600
What's this?

578
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,300
This is my dear mother, Pyke!
- You've never had a mother!

579
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,800
Since when do you betray
orders, Pyke?

580
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,500
And why not share
booty on the beach, as always?

581
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,300
Do not provoke trouble today,
because you'll pass as Brown.

582
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
Captain Rumbo!

583
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
Do not!

584
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,500
Come on, boy!

585
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,500
This dork is a Corinthian?

586
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,500
Your friend Brown
left two survivors.

587
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,100
Boy and his dog.
Come on, son.

588
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,000
Well, at least the dog
can talk.

589
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,200
Coming reason
do not share the spoils.

590
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,400
One move the knife
will take care of it.

591
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,800
Do you need help, General?
- No, it is not necessary.

592
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,300
Too seen.

593
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,300
He is the Corinthian, is not it?

594
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Do you want to go with you, boss?
- Lafitte, me and the other captains ...

595
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm glad you
back, boss.

596
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,600
And to me, sir, boss. - Are
heard of Brown? - Yes.

597
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,000
Hello, boss.
Would you like shrimp?

598
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Hold it.

599
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
Let her go, Beluche!

600
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,600
Well you, boss?

601
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,700
I am. She could not
hit a boat with an ax.

602
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Dirty, smelly killer.
- Your father got what he deserved.

603
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,400
People under my leadership
consuming burden, not lives.

604
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,900
It is all that remains of
crew and passengers with Corinthian.

605
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,500
Brown killed everybody's right to
fall under the U.S. flag.

606
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,600
Only one flag for rights
all of us, black as your heart.

607
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,900
He did not even slightly
care for your people.

608
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,000
Just for the chance that you
lost the governor's daughter.

609
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,600
Bonnie is right.

610
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,000
We are not interested to become
Americans, like you, Lafitte.

611
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
We are interested only
division of spoils.

612
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,900
This little one is between
us and a quarter million in gold.

613
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,300
Listen, Lafitte. One
language is as bad as the 20 more

614
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,900
You, sharks,
are you hungry?

615
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,600
It is simple. Lafittte to become
America, we want to share the gold.

616
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,700
Cut the neck brat.

617
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,800
Okay, Gramby, you
do it.

618
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,500
Flint?

619
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,300
Rumbo, do you?

620
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,200
Well, Bonnie,
knife is yours, give you.

621
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
Only one throat
I want to cut.

622
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,500
Come on, boy. Go to the boss
house, with it you'll be safe.

623
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,900
Well, get out!

624
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,800
Already you have shown
his courage.

625
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,600
What do you want?

626
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,900
Find out what you will
with me, sir.

627
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
I do not know.

628
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,100
Why are you standing there?
If you're gonna come in, come.

629
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,100
I can not go into the captain's
chambers without permission, sir.

630
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,300
I said, Come.
- Thank you, sir.

631
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,100
You stay here, kid.
Stay.

632
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,000
Everyone would be better to
I threw alligators.

633
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,600
But it would not be just
a mouthful, is not it?

634
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,100
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.

635
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,900
Are you hungry?
- No, sir!

636
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,900
Well, not too much.

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,600
What's your name, boy?
- Miggs, sir.

638
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,000
How long have you run out of
cab? - All my life.

639
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,400
It's a long time.
What can you do?

640
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
I know darn well sails.
- I was in the house.

641
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,000
I have never lived in the house.
- Sit down and eat.

642
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,900
Thank you, sir.

643
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,600
There's nothing special
about the house.

644
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,800
It's just a body,
in dry dock.

645
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,900
All my life dream to have a house,

646
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,100
and when he get yourself, then
is on the wrong street.

647
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,400
Yes, sir!

648
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Do not always agree with
me, unless you really do not know.

649
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
I do not call anyone "sir."

650
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,600
Apart from someone who
You can appreciate.

651
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,700
Yes, sir!

652
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,100
What are you staring, Miggs?

653
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,900
Very nice lady, sir.

654
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,300
Yes ...

655
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,300
It is a very expensive box.

656
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,200
Coming troops, Jean.
Enter into Barataria Bay.

657
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,600
Americans?
- I do not see the flag.

658
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,000
They come with open guns.
There had to be Corinthian.

659
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,500
Guns on the wall facing the sea. - Already
are. Watch out for the kid. - Yes, sir.

660
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,600
People with guns.
- In places are.

661
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,000
Release cannon openings.

662
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
Do not shoot!

663
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,200
What do you see, Pyke? -Ordered
in battle formation, boss.

664
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,600
It will be action.
- Wait a minute!

665
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,200
Disseminated flag.

666
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,200
These are English.

667
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,900
Send signals.

668
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,000
I never understood it
waving flags.

669
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,200
General! What do they say?

670
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,300
Seeking permission ...

671
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,600
For landing on shore.

672
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
That they blow, boss?

673
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,700
Tell them to disembark.

674
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,700
Attention!

675
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,800
Gentlemen!
- Are you Mr. Lafitte?

676
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,200
Follow me, please.

677
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,000
Gentlemen, Mr. Lafitte!

678
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,500
Gentlemen. What can
do for you?

679
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,800
Mr. Lafitte, I
Captain Lockyer.

680
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,900
Frigates from her Majesty,

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Captain McWilliams! Lieutenant Rogers!
Captain Caldwell!

682
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,400
Captains?

683
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,000
This is a general Dominique You!

684
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,900
Former commander of Napoleon!

685
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,300
And now assistant Jean Lafittea.

686
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,000
Commodore of our fleet,

687
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,100

689
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,400
So.

690
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,700
Two warships us
waiting in the harbor, Mr. Lafitte.

691
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,400
That we would not have caused concern,
we need to continue with our work.

692
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,300
We have an important letter for you.

693
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,600
About what?

694
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
English War Cabinet made
Strategic assessment of Barataria.

695
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,800
Control back
entrance to New Orleans.

696
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Your key positions us
can be of great benefit.

697
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,100
When planning
to attack New Orleans?

698
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,200
We'll be in New Orleans
in two weeks, sir.

699
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,900
Your help we can save
time and potentially life.

700
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Gentlemen, I never talk
about the job before eating.

701
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,600
Eric ...

702
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,100
You will join me,
of course. - Thank you.

703
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,800
Would you be so kind as to answer
to Sophia that we will be late?

704
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,200
To avoid interruptions.
- With pleasure.

705
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,700
Mr Pyke.

706
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,400
I have to admit, Mr. Lafitte, live
much better than would be expected.

707
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
It is ... I mean, you ...

708
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,500
You were expecting me zateai with wood
foot and bandage over one eye?

709
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,600
Actually we did not know
what we expected.

710
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,400
Do you have a portrait that attractive.

711
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
I guess copy Barrow?

712
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,700
No, sir, original. Only.

713
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,700
The lady would be your
wife? - No, it would not be!

714
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
Captain ... no, no. You, sir.

715
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,000
Is this your medal
courage against the Americans?

716
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,800
No, sir, I had
luck against the French.

717
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,100
I see.
- S Nelson, the battle of the Nile.

718
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,500
Your'm not familiar with.
- What? This?

719
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,300
Vagrant, Marengo,
I forgot from where.

720
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,700
You know, at that time we
beating in many battles.

721
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,300
In this war would be on the side
winner, is not it, Mr. Lafitte?

722
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,100
Oh yes, the side where I
I do, I will be victorious.

723
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,500
If we now join
against Americans,

724
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,500
spend the inland
backwater to New Orleans

725
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,000
each letter of the letters
will be achieved.

726
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,800
How generous
may be a crown?

727
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,700
We offer considerable estates
for you and your people.

728
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
Country? For sailors?

729
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Royal pardon for all.

730
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,100
Do not ask nobody's forgiveness.

731
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,900
I think I am turning
wrong man.

732
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,600
I thought that Mr.
Lafitte Barataria leader.

733
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,500
If the offer is good,
will resist criticism.

734
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,800
Offer is nice.

735
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,000
We are authorized by the Crown to pay
you 30 thousand in gold!

736
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,900
General, will you,
please pass the salt?

737
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,700
Of course! Please.

738
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,200
I think you are right
heard Captain McWilliams?

739
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,700
He said 30 thousand
dollars, Mr. Lafitte.

740
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
Oh yes, I heard it.

741
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Can you pick up your plate?

742
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,900
Pick him up, please.

743
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,700
From what has been made?

744
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,400
My God, pure gold!

745
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,100
He has 30 thousand dollars
Values ??in this table.

746
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,500
We offer one thing
You can not buy with money.

747
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,400
EIN captain in
Royal Navy.

748
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,800
I see you with anyone
you have a job?

749
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,400
Ships Jean Lafitte
sail the world.

750
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,000
Hundreds captain hears
his commandments.

751
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,700
I take it that
as your answer, Lafitte?

752
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,000
You receive my reply ...
for the week.

753
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,600
When we get to New
Orleans, it will be too late.

754
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,500
And if I refuse?
- We have 50 warships.

755
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,400
16 thousand people, power
on land and sea,

756
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,500
Fresh after victory
over Napoleon.

757
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,300
England is a good friend,
but a bad enemy.

758
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,300
We do not need friends! I do not
we fear no enemy.

759
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,700
If you refuse, Lafitte, I have orders
raznesti Baratariju to bits. And I will.

760
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,500
I'll give you your answer
for the week.

761
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,000
Gentlemen, you have 10 minutes
to catch the tide.

762
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Eric, you make sure that the gentlemen
ispraaena be on their boats.

763
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,600
All right, sir.

764
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,500
One week.

765
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,200
How many people wanted to send
this little angel in heaven.

766
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,400
Hope
You treat well, boss.

767
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,700
Yet the New Orleans location
where the Corinthian ...

768
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,100
Come here!

769
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
I will not say anything!

770
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,900
You just have to
trumpet fanfare?

771
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,000
Do not let him kill me, Mr.
Lafitte. - No you will not do nothing, Miggs.

772
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,700
We'll just take you to Maspero,
in New Orleans. - What is it?

773
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,400
There, we keep our
valuable cargo.

774
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,700
You'll leave me
there all alone?

775
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,500
No. Pyke wife Tina
will take care of you.

776
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,500
I'd rather be with you, Mr.
Lafitte. -That's gratitude.

777
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,600
Only a couple of people, which
I believe, as well as his wife.

778
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,200
His wife did not
at all like him.

779
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,500
If I'm going to be
I bring Mead?

780
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,600
Who Mead?
- He is a very good guard.

781
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,700
It frightens me. Better it
bring with them.

782
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:24,000
Thank you, sir - then go with Pyke
on the dock. I'll come right away.

783
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Come on, boy.
And watch out for the wolf.

784
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,100
And Scipio, make sure
Head in the best clothes.

785
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,700
When you stand in front of the Governor Claiborne,
should shine like brilliant admiral.

786
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,000
10 years, Mr Pyke, I worry about
chief's clothes without your help!

787
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,700
What's wrong with you, Scipio? Is
it because too much reading?

788
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,600
Come on, kid.

789
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Boss, I want to pack
and the English letters?

790
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,600
No, Scipio.

791
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,400
It will take me to check valid
Really your only American rules.

792
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,600
Mr. Head achieve
it all worth it.

793
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,500
<i> Yankee blockhead arrived in the city </ i>

794
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
<i> See the governor's daughter. </ i>

795
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,400
<i> listened to his secret plans
and then pushed him into the water. </ i>

796
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,100
You have a great voice, General.

797
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,100
Thank you.

798
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,600
Do you think that these letters will

799
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,600
to lift Corinthian
from the bottom of the sea?

800
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,000
I think it will open the door,

801
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,300
that you Claiborne
slammed in his face?

802
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,500
General, you drink?

803
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,100
You are right!

804
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,100
I felt the need
rink

805
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,900
for ten years,

806
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,600
of the night when you're me
while drinking different types of wine.

807
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,900
Wine of freedom!

808
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,000
You showed me a world that
no boundaries, rules, flags.

809
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,600
General ...

810
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,400
There comes a time when
the man wants to change.

811
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,600
Belong to doing something,
or maybe someone.

812
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,800
Do you understand what will
you do it, Jean?

813
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,200
Motherland, women,
ideal? It's all false!

814
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,900
I never had a home.

815
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,100
Why do not I have ideals?

816
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Ideals ... They are used to
clouded eyes fool you.

817
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,900
Like you! Well, me too!

818
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,600
I understand that and that is why I
escaped from France.

819
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,600
And I'll become an American
so I stopped running.

820
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,400
And you do not need these medals
to be felt as a general.

821
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,600
Previously, I've never
disappointment, Jean.

822
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,600
If you can trust
a single man,

823
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,300
it's you.

824
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,000
You will see, Dominique.

825
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,600
I'm going back home country greater than the
handbags country, you wear around your neck.

826
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,300
These are pretty important
documents, Mr. Lafitte.

827
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,200
It's about safety
your country, Governor.

828
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,800
By now you are worried about our laws.
Where'd concern for our safety?

829
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,600
I read some your
American rules.

830
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,000
If you are not the only
dead letter ...

831
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,900
might be worth fighting for them.
I have people, ships, weapons.

832
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,400
You need only ask.

833
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,300
We can not as Englishmen
offer 30 thousand dollars.

834
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,200
I did not come for the money.
- And what do you want?

835
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,600
Forgiveness for me and my people.

836
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,900
Put us on
American flag.

837
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,200
You think you can walk in here,
throw some papers on the table and expect

838
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,300
you pardon for thousands of crimes?

839
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,600
For the week, the English
can you do an apostate.

840
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,300
Or let me
join you ...

841
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,000
or you may be you
asked to join me.

842
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,200
And with you on our side, think
that we can reject the English attack?

843
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,800
With the combination of Claiborne,
Jackson and Lafittea?

844
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,500
We can conquer the world.
- I'm not so ambitious, Lafitte.

845
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,800
I just want to save
United States.

846
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,100
That you lie on your palms.

847
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,300
Almost feel the urge
accept your offer.

848
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,700
Okay, Lafitte.

849
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,800
I will convene an emergency tonight
Meeting of the Council of Defense.

850
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,900
I'm sure that on my recommendation
accept your proposal. - OK!

851
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,900
Dad, I'm ... I'm sorry!
- It's okay, honey.

852
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,300
I did not know you had company,
the door was open.

853
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,800
This is Mr. Jean Lafitte,
My daughter, Annette.

854
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,500
How are you?

855
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,900
And both of them are alive.
- Yes. Mr. Lafitte and I

856
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,400
We became best friends.

857
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,100
Excuse the expression.

858
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
What should you, dear?

859
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,000
Your consent to the guest list
for the reception of General Jackson.

860
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,700
We have good news for Jackson!

861
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,700
Still would not have
Baratariju attack.

862
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,000
Mr. Lafitte offered
fight on our side.

863
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,000
I knew it!

864
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,200
I knew he would come help, Father.
- I'm glad you approve of it, Miss.

865
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,700
Now excuse me.
- Do you have transportation?

866
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,500
No, I told her coachman to me
waiting. I did not know you and I want you to go.

867
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,800
I understand. Annette, would you say Cato
carriage to put at the disposal of Mr. Lafitteu?

868
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,500
Sure. This way, Mr. Lafitte.

869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,500
I constantly keep an eye on
My gun is constantly being pointed at him.

870
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,300
If I knew you were there, I'd be afraid
over you, but our friends pirates.

871
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,400
Get that silly thing and told members
Defence Council for tonight's meeting.

872
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,400
If I may be open, sir, is
it wise to trust a man ...

873
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Not naga?aj just told to
meeting. -Yes, sir!

874
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,500
I have prepared you a carriage.
- Thank you, Cato. I'll get out.

875
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,000
Jean, do not be like that!

876
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,000
So you want it to say. - It seems to me
that was the last time enough said.

877
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,500
It was just
my stupid pride.

878
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,600
Now, when I
what have you done ...

879
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
I did it just
for his people and himself.

880
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,600
If you're going to feel better if
hurt me, go ahead. Jean ...

881
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,300
Loving you,

882
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
most important thing in my life.

883
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,500
Please believe it.
- Annette.

884
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,600
Annette!
- Yes. Father.

885
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,400
What will people think?
- About what?

886
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,000
You left out Mercier
the guest list.

887
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Dad, I know that Mr.
Mercier is always upsets.

888
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,800
I know, honey, but the people in our
position must hide feelings.

889
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,800
I will endeavor, Father. - Maybe we should
invite our friends, pirates.

890
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,300
You should meet with General
Jackson as soon as possible.

891
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,700
I announce our engagement.
- I'd be thrilled.

892
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,100
What did you say?

893
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,700
Do not be a coward, tell him. - She
I'd be thrilled, Father.

894
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,100
Do we have to yell at each
other? Why are you standing there?

895
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,200
Oh, stung my hand on a thorn.

896
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,800
If we reach
agreement with Lafitteom,

897
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,800
maybe we should be hanged
pirate flag in the city.

898
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,100
We're not here for discussion
Reputation Jean Lafittea!

899
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,400
He offered his assistance and
waiting for our answer.

900
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,400
Respond cannon.

901
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Before I surrendered to the English,
but given the land into the hands of the rabble.

902
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,600
At least maintain their dignity.
- General Jackson will need

903
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,600
men and ammunition. Lafitte
We offer both.

904
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,300
On the battlefield, General
do not ask who delivered bullets.

905
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,200
I completely agree
with the Governor!

906
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,700
At Jackson's place would
rather have a deal with the Devil.

907
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,200
In any case, here we have
decide on the authenticity of these letters.

908
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,400
That is not the question. - You believe that
fake? - Not enough are authentic.

909
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,300
Only proven to work with the English.
- Renegade is, I do not believe that he was a traitor.

910
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,700
You think Lafitte waived 30
thousand and position in the British Army,

911
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,200
Just because, in order to
become a U.S. citizen?

912
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,400
You would not, Mr. Mercier?
- Gentlemen, I agree with all the put,

913
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,500
but we can not ignore the opinion
our esteemed governor.

914
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,600
We are wasting time. Give me an order
to throw Lafittea of ??Barataria!

915
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,700
You have my vote!
- Mine!

916
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Solve at least one enemy.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen! Consider this.

917
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,700
Lafitte is one of the best
hope, that this country has.

918
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,800
Gentlemen, we can not
agree. Vote.

919
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,700
You know what, chief? Already the
I feel appreciated.

920
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,100
What do you think, Pyke, what
chances for people to be with us.

921
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,200
Just tell me how
you want to vote.

922
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,100
We're not so, Pyke.

923
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,500
From now on, everything must
be democratic.

924
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,700
Maybe a little friendly
persuasion, but democratic.

925
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,000
Boss!

926
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,400
Englishmen.
- They waited.

927
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,500
Pyke, can you see someone
to find. - OK!

928
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,100
Calalou! Calalou!

929
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,700
Calalou!

930
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:39,000
You're back where
you started, Lafitte?

931
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,100
There is no one to listen to your
orders, except mosquitoes.

932
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,200
How are you British
missed? - English?

933
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,900
Your American friends
We were visited.

934
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,400
You lie like a dog!

935
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,200
See ...

936
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,000
Recognize U.S.
uniform when I see it.

937
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,100
We fired at them, but
We Dominique prevented.

938
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,200
All called them out
docekaju, klicu them.

939
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
Sing "Yankee Doodle."

940
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,700
Then we resort
exploded in his face.

941
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,800
Does someone pulled?
- Some fled to the swamps.

942
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,100
Some were put in chains,
to be hanged.

943
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,200
Dominique was right!

944
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,300
No one can believe that.

945
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,500
Oh, how I've waited for this moment, when
I'll see you broken, defeated.

946
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,900
Now when I see it, it hurts. -Don't
give me your pity.

947
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,500
More I liked your
hatred. - Where are you going?

948
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,900
New Orleans!

949
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,300
I'll wring your people from jail
if I have to kill the Jackson.

950
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,800
No! Do not go
in New Orleans!

951
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,700
Because if the Americans do not
kill your own people will.

952
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,300
We ourselves go to Cartagena,
perhaps to Galvez in the Gulf.

953
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,400
Why do you care
What will happen to me?

954
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,900
Because you're a part of it all, I
ever loved. I hated it.

955
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,300
Very nicely sung,
Ms. Claiborne. Thank you.

956
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
Thanks to you, my dear.

957
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,900
This is my favorite song Rachel.
You gave me a feeling of home.

958
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,700
It's the least we could do
make for a brave soldier,

959
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,800
who came to defend our city.

960
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,100
Not to mention the beautiful ladies,
that adorn it. - Thank you.

961
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
I want to assure you, sir, that
hearts and homes of the city

962
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,700
open to you
and your people.

963
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,900
I am very grateful, ma'am.

964
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,500
I can assure you that we will
Defend your city from danger.

965
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,300
You're charming, General.
But they said they are from the countryside.

966
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:25,100
But farmer from Tenesseeja,
ma'am. That is the key.

967
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,400
General Jackson, were
We honored if you

968
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,300
you and your officers tomorrow
had dinner with us.

969
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,600
I accept with pleasure,
lady, on one condition.

970
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,200
The condition?

971
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,900
That tomorrow evening
I'm still alive.

972
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,700
You will not be living or tomorrow morning,
if you do not drink your milk.

973
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,100
Not now, Mr. Peavey!
- I put in your medicine.

974
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,400
Mr. Peavey. - Do not mind
to it, Miss. Claiborne,

975
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,800
shame me since
before your birth.

976
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,400
Come on! Drink a cure!

977
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,600
Commodore Patterson comes.

978
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,100
General Jackson,
Commodore Patterson.

979
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,900
Commodore.
- General.

980
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,500
I am pleased to inform you
the mission is accomplished.

981
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,600
Barataria is
completely destroyed.

982
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
What?

983
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,900
Father, how could they?
You promised Mr. Lafitteu!

984
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,200
What about Lafitteom?
- It is not among the prisoners.

985
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,500
Father, you gave him the word.
- Excuse me, Miss Claiborne.

986
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
Governor. General.

987
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,100
There is serious news.

988
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,000
English army arrived
to Lake Bourne.

989
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,900
English! On the lake?

990
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,200
It is less than 50 km.

991
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,300
General, what can we do?

992
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Keep a cool head.

993
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,400
Mr. Peavey, Colonel,
Major Reed.

994
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:50,000
General, is expected to defend New Orleans
with this ... poor more trained people?

995
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,900
My troops are trained
to fight, not for show.

996
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,800
But they lack guns,
gunpowder and ammunition.

997
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,500
But no heart for a fight. - We have
think of our homes, families.

998
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,200
It seems that you have to think
at all, except at home.

999
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,000
Brave words, but you can not
they shoot down the enemy.

1000
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,500
We'll stay alive
only if we surrender.

1001
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,800
I'll be very clear, gentlemen!

1002
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,000
Before I give this
city, I will burn it to the ground.

1003
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,500
General Jackson, we have the right
decide on their own fate.

1004
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,500
You'll discover that we have
strong civilian government.

1005
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,900
And you'll discover that you have
receive orders from me.

1006
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,300
If I have to declare
state of emergency.

1007
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,900
We are in the hands of a madman!

1008
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,200
Philip, do not!

1009
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,600
Completely clear to me, sir,
you're either a coward or a traitor.

1010
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,000
Racunajte the militia, sir.

1011
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
The entire New Orleans
with you, General.

1012
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,100
The city is yours. Zapovijedajte.
- My son will follow you, General.

1013
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,300
Perhaps the general
at least explained his plans.

1014
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,600
Senator, that the hair on my head
know my plans, I'd cut it.

When Andy like bad-tempered, I would be
out of the way, if I were you.

1018
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,300
What is it, Andy?

1019
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,700
Something bothers you?

1020
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,200
I've never seen you so many dead
people say you're going to defend them.

1021
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,900
Defend the United
States, Mr. Peavy.

1022
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,300
Better beware force for later.

1023
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,200
Andy, please,
Drink your milk.

1024
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,300
Give me a break, drink it.

1025
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,100
If you drink, ispeai
I'll get you a nice turkey.

1026
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Not now, Mr. Peavy,

1027
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,400
just keep those barkers
away from me.

1028
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,200
Waiting for me a lot of important
job. - All right, Andy.

1029
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,100
It is a stubborn man
I've seen in my life.

1030
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,600
How long do I have to try,
only that he drank a cure.

1031
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,900
Do not move!

1032
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,500
I do not call a guard.

1033
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,800
I'll call guard
when I'm ready.

1034
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,100
Who are you?
- Jean Lafitte.

1035
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,600
So ...

1036
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,600
What do you want?

1037
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,100
Sign the authorization to
my people released from prison.

1038
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,400
You know, I just do not like
when we are threatened.

1039
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,300
Do not even shoot, Mr. Peavy.

1040
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,700
It is an old trick, Jackson.

1041
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:13,000
Mr. Peavy, greet
Mr. Lafittea, pirates.

1042
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,800
How are you, Mr. Lafitte,
I'm glad to meet you.

1043
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,400
To pull the trigger now, Andy?

1044
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,300
Do you have anything to say before
answer this question?

1045
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,200
Yes.

1046
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,400
I want to publish my testament.

1047
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,400
The stolen gold
you buried?

1048
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:39,600
No. A warehouse full of gunpowder
and eight thousand flint.

1049
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,500
Flint for muskets?
- In exchange for my people.

1050
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,400
Where are these flint?
- Where is the gunpowder.

1051
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,700
Put the guns on
table, Mr. Lafitte.

1052
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,900
How much powder?

1053
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,000
I do not like to talk with weapons
pointed at his back.

1054
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,400
Leave us alone, Mr. Peavy.

1055
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,700
You want to tie
before I go, Andy?

1056
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,100
No, no, thank you.

1057
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,400
(I'm out, if I
need anything. Just call.)

1058
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,400
Come on, get out!

1059
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,500
So what's with the Flint?

1060
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,400
What about my people?

1061
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,100
Flint and gunpowder in the city?

1062
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,600
You'll find out when my
last man get out of jail.

1063

1064
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,500
I need gunpowder and flint, but you will not
get approval, until I find out where they are.

1065
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,500
Playing live, Jackson.

01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,800
And if we put a bullet in
head, however, I will kill you catch up.

Let me go! I have to go in there.

What's with that guy? - I do not know,
Andy, blebeae some nonsense.

1069

Talk in English!

I do not understand.

1071

Do not stand just so, can you

Keep them, blow bridges, fell trees,

Yes, Mr. Jackson. - Son!

Yes, sir.

As soon as my people
get out of jail.

They sing "Yankee Doodle"
General. Maybe you go.

1108
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,500
The first will dance on the rope.

Thank you, gentlemen.

1113

because of the goodness of our brotherhood
better than all the lies countries.

Only one thing
Life can trust ...

01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,200
That will end by death!

1119
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,600
So! When it arrives ...

1120
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,300

1121
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,600

Why did you come here?
- Of all the people in the world,

you've never
want to let you down.

1128
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,500
Everyone with whom I have believed me
betrayed. Why would you be differently?

1129
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,800
I promised your country ...
Read this.

01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:31,800
Why do you think you can trust him?
- He believed me today.

1132
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,800
One of his word and
I blew the head.

1133
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,900
Instead, we gave
freedom for all of you.

1134
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,700
In exchange for weapons and supplies,

1135

People will not listen.
- I do not have time to convince them.

1138
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,900
This is freedom
for you and them.

1139
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,000
Freedom - to continue to run,

1140
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,000

Inverted.
Appeal to the English.

1146
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,100
Kentucky, if you make them too high,
you will not be able to see the English.

1147
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,700
I'll make them a high that no
they see me, General.

1148
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,100
General, this is my cotton
packed and ready for shipment.

1149
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:47,300
Then you'll help defend him.
Mr. Peavey, give him a musket.

1150
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,300
Yes, General.

1151
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,700
Here you go. I do not shoot himself.

1152
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,900
Well, stop the
line, sir.

1153

Sarge, set good shooters

In 3.bateriji need filling powder.
Take care of it. - Yes, sir.

1156
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,200
Guys, you have an extra cup of coffee?
- Help yourself.

1157
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,600
Good morning, General.

1158
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,600
Well, son, that now
feel? - All right, sir.

1159
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,300
I bet that was the morning radio
Kentucky, but here with me, huh?

1160
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,300
No way, sir! At home I in
This time Gaca in the mud with pigs.

1161
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,300
Andy, you better drink some
coffee, well you will do.

1162
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,400
Not now, Mr. Peavey.
- Okay, I'll drink it.

1163
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,400
This is so bad, that would
horse shoe floating.

1164
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,900
Come on, soldiers, hurry up!
We do not have all day.

1165
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:05,700
Nobody has excess silica, Major.
What's this? - I'm just so found.

1166
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,300
How old is expected to face a hawk
win the war, no flints for muskets?

1167
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,700
Why not let the Old Hawk
face some worries about private?

1168
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,900
Excuse me, sir.
- It's okay.

1169
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,500
They called me once
and worse names.

1170
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Actually, General,
we are close to the bottom of the barrels.

1171
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,400
It will be enough for flint
Male, when Lafitte appears.

1172
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,700
Indeed we expect that will come?

1173
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,100
Well, Major, otherwise
make my hair may become gray.

1174
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,000
If you ask me, you cursed pirates
returned to New Orleans and robbery in the city.

1175
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,700
Battalion, whoa!

1176
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,500
General, do you think that these will
poles stop red coat?

1177
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,300
Will slow them enough
to beat them.

1178
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,700
Win, no silica
For the male?

1179
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,200
What's this? - For the
serving your country.

1180
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,900
I thought my life
worth more than $ 1.

1181
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,500
Documents, please. Thank you.

1182
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,500
Your musket.

1183
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,900
From this fog we get sick more
but from that lunch on Tuesday.

1184
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,700
I hope it will remain so. Not
I can shoot what they see.

1185
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,100
Andy, you better put your scarf.
- Good to meet you, Mr. Peavey.

1186
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:51,100
I see that you're cold, put a scarf.
Andy Jackson, come back!

1187
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,300
Document, please. You are not
write the next of kin.

1188
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,800
I have none, sir.

1189
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Who we notify in case of ...
- Well ... - Family Claiborne. Thank you.

1190
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,300
Your musket.

1191
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,800
Your musket.

1192
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,700
What I'm going with this? - When the Fire and keep
without gunpowder, using the butt as a bat.

1193
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,600
You receive later gunpowder.

1194
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,000
If you arrive.

1195
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,400
Governor, how are citizens
recruited for me?

1196
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:29,900
So far more than 300, General.
- More than I expected.

1197
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,500
This is very urgent.

1198
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:38,300
We have more manpower than
ammunition. Out of gunpowder.

1199
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,800
Yes, I know ...

1200
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,900
Coming soon yet.

1201
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,700
I hope they keep the promise Lafitte
better, but we are his to him.

1202
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,500
What is it?
- Enemy!

1203
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,000
Excuse me, sir, that
Only our patrol returns.

1204
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,500
Why did they shoot? - I guess they
someone nervous fingers.

1205
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,000
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1206
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,900
Pull back.

1207
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You do not recognize U.S.
trumpet when you hear?

1208
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,700
It is our patrols.

1209
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:14,100
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1210
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,700
Cease fire!

1211
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,200
English, General.
I think they're in the woods.

1212
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,900
Tell me what happened.
son. - Thousands of them.

1213
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,500
Where? Near-forest
cypress trees, next to the river.

1214
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,600
Ready to attack?
- Gather, sir,

1215
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,600
550 meters away. Although they were not
can stop, General. Nothing!

1216
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,000
Got hot coffee down there,
I might wash the smell of gunpowder.

1217
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,000
Thank you, General!
- Major Reed!

1218
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,100
Send me couriers.

1219
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,200
Colonel Butler, looks
that will soon begin.

1220
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,300
You came here because of fighting
and by God, I'll fight it.

1221
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You think you're signed up for
Sunday Mass, soldier?

1222
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Sergeant! - Yes, sir! - Return of
civilians to their battle stations.

1223
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,800
These civilians will only annoy us
When the battle began, General.

1224
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,700
That is why we must all
keep them together, soldier.

1225
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,200
You, on that gun.

1226
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,000
Do you know bunglers
how to put a charge?

1227
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,700
What are you, Andy, to break the ice?
- This is directed will only affect rabbits.

1228
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,100
Let me, please.
- Get out, Mr. Peavey!

1229
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,900
Do not waste this power, Andy.

1230
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,900
Get back to where you or I,
I swear to God, I have to kill you.

1231
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,700
Add water to it,
Mr. Peavey. - Yes, sir.

1232
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,200
It's okay. These are just a rocket.

1233
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,300
More bark than bite you!

1234
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,100
Ready to fire?
- Ready, sir!

1235
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,600
Fire!

1236
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,500
Fog is too thick
to see anything.

1237
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,200
Can we somehow stop
These missiles, General?

1238
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,500
We do not have enough gunpowder, to
spend it on missiles, Governor.

1239
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,900
Only create confusion before
than go on the attack.

1240
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,100
They tried the same
and in Bladensburg.

1241
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,400
General, arrived
Lafitte and his men.

1242
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,900
Thank God. Where are they?

1243
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,100
Come from the swamp.

1244
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,900
A little late, Mr. Lafitte.

1245
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,100
We used
travel overland.

1246
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,400
Although late,
you're welcome.

1247
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,700
We have prepared a warm docek.

1248
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,900
It will be warmer and, if flint
and gunpowder do not share the battlefield.

1249
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,900
Colonel Butler? - Yes, sir? - This
it takes people in the 3rd battery.

1250
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,700
Yes, sir. Immediately.

1251
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,000
Hold it right!
- I intend to!

1252
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,600
Captain, this share
stock. - Yes, sir!

1253
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,400
Hey, I heard that
came Jean Lafitte.

1254
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,800
I've never seen a pirate.

1255
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,900
Go and give him a kiss,
brought gunpowder.

1256
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,200
What we have here, Andy?
- Power from Heaven, sir, Peavey.

1257
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,300
Just let the good fight,
as they fought against us.

1258
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,200
Go get some of my denim,
some help here.

1259
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,400
How long have you brought gunpowder?

1260
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,400
Enough that you can
shoot the whole month.

1261
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,400
Now we have to fight thereby.

1262
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,700
Here! Give me a flint!

1263
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,000
Flint as you need.
- Flint of the pirates?

1264
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,100
Englishmen will not know the difference.

1265
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,800
Whence comes such a powder?

1266
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,800
We purchased specially for you.

1267
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,700
You thought that you will lose
war, before we arrived.

1268
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,400
Yeah? Now that you have brought
gunpowder, you can go home.

1269
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,200
Beluche, get on it
tree. Yes, General.

1270
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,900
Pablo, you go to it.
- Yes, General.

1271
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,500
Give me the guidelines.
- Yes, General.

1272
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,500
In it you will shoot, Lafitte?
There was no command to fire.

1273
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,600
These flares create too
noise, silence we them.

1274
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,100
It is a waste of
gunpowder, Mr. Lafitte!

1275
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,600
I would not say, General. See
where they come out of the fog.

1276
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,100
That could be seen in the
Shoot, my people would have already been shot!

1277
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,000
We topdiju who does not have
see the target to hit.

1278
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,800
What do you say, that distance?
- I would say ... 550 meters.

1279
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,200
Okay, just give.
Your gunpowder.

1280
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,300
There is a charge!

1281
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,900
Odlican hit!
Blow have them!

1282
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,400
Excellent job, General!
- Not a bad top, you know.

1283
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,000
Back to posts!

1284
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,300
Hey, boss.
- What is it?

1285
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,800
Who is so good with a cannon?
- One man, sir.

1286
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,900
Mr. Lafitte, my compliments.
- Need to congratulate the general.

1287
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,500
General?
- General Dominique You.

1288
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,500
Fought with Napoleon.
- Come on ... silent.

1289
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,900
It's an honor to have you with us, sir.
- It is an honor, General.

1290
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,500
Very handsome man.
- Well, Dominique,

1291
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,500
we still have a lot of war.

1292
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,100
Beluche! Fill the top!
- Yes, sir!

1293
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,900
Horseface, purify it!

1294
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,400
Battalion, prepare bayonets!

1295
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:39,400
Prepare bayonets!

1296
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,800
Prepare bayonets!

1297
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,500
This is the loudest silence
I've ever heard, boss.

1298
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,700
Enjoy it while it lasts.

1299
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,300
I wonder how many hours?
- What do you care, do not go anywhere.

1300
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,300
Weapons preparation!

1301
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Weapons preparation!

1302
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,700
Weapons preparation!

1303
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,400
Battalion in the plane of the attack!

1304
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,800
Forward, march!

1305
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,600
Like someone slaughtered a pig.

1306
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,500
It is music, play bagpipes.

1307
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,900
Will you fight or dance?

1308
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,100
This causes a tingling at Kiem.
- Yes, sir, it is intended.

1309
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,200
Okay, all the places!
- All the places!

1310
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,800
Just relax, guys.

1311
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:09,700
Mr. Lafitte, make sure your
People do not shoot until they are well

1312
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,200
see the target. Muskets are
of effective over long distances.

1313
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,600
Add me spyglass,
Mr. Peavey.

1314
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,800
If not for this damn fog
My long-Kentucky

1315
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,400
them blew 100 meters
before the shoot.

1316
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,100
What is the range of your
Guns? - Range?

1317
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,100
These beauties all hit squirrel
the eye to almost 300 meters.

1318
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,900
Then you just need to know
when they come into range.

1319
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:39,300
I would not say that we will send the English
signal. -The English would not, but I do I want!

1320
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,900
Tired of life, Mr. Lafitte?

1321
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,200
I'll go with you, boss.
- No, you're too big a target.

1322
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
Mouse?
- Yes, boss.

1323
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,100
Got powder with you?
- Yes, boss.

1324
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,900
General, can you give me
one of your Indians?

1325
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,400
Is it good with a bow?
- Good enough.

1326
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,900
Come on, Pyke.

1327
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,300
No, Toro, you wait here.

1328
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,400
It looks like the battle will
soon to start, huh?

1329
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,300
This is about 300 meters.

1330
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,300
Mouse, gunpowder.

1331
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,300
Here it is!
- Lafitteov signal.

1332
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,100
Shall we shoot, sir? - No.
I want to give them a chance to return.

1333
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,300
But the enemy is in range, sir!
- As Lafitte, Colonel.

1334
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,300
I'm going to count 40 seconds
before firing.

1335
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,600
Every second, are getting closer.
- I'm going to count 40 seconds, Major!

1336
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,600
Fire!

1337
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,200
Battalion, whoa!
Fire!

1338
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,400
That must be
quite a surprise, Governor.

1339
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,600
Annette and Captain Lafitte.

1340
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,300
Yes, the father does not always know
a first for kaerkine plans.

1341
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,900
Why do you care uci
dance, Lizzie?

1342
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,500
I learn them.

1343
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:20,100
Why did not you go back for more
a piece of pie, it's very good?

1344
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:25,200
I'd rather stay observe how
you and Lizzie lovingly watching.

1345
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:30,000
Listen! How many times have I told you
not to call me Lizzie, Miss Pest!

1346
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,800
Come on, I'm going and reloading the
the dance floor.

1347
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:38,200
Lizzie has precious!
Lizzie has precious!

1348
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,200
Why are you hiding in there?

1349
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,100
I do not hide it.
Looking for friends.

1350
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,500
I bet you do not
do you know anyone here.

1351
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,900
Ah, I know! My
A friend of Mr. Lafitte.

1352
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,800
Where did you meet him?
- It's a big secret.

1353
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,200
I've never watched so.
- You're not the Jean Lafitte.

1354
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,100
What are you afraid?
- I'm afraid I see anything!

1355
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,100
See?

1356
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,600
I bet the Whistle
does not work. - I do!

1357
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,200
See?

1358
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,600
Let me fuanem.
- No!

1359
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:49,800
You know what, if you go to call
my friend Mr. Lafittea,

1360
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,900
I'll give you that trying some.

1361
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,400
What I'm going to tell him?

1362
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,100
Just tell him that Miggs here
and that it wants to immediately see.

1363
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:07,900
So ... good. Beware this for me
and do not eat any.

1364
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,600
Marjorie! Marjorie!

1365
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,600
Stop it. Where did you get it?

1366
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,500
From my friend, Miggs.

1367
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,100
It seems that someone won.
Inherited his mother's charm.

1368
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,600
I can not say that someone named
Miggs sounds appropriate for zeta.

1369
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,700
Miggs?

1370
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,700
Miggs ...

1371
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,300
Hello, my son, what is the news about my
friend, Captain Thomas with Corinthian.

1372
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,600
I do not know, sir.
- Wait a minute.

1373
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,800
How did you get so
quickly returned?

1374
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,700
Everyone thank you very much
in this tribute.

1375
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,200
There is another man who
he deserved to get these same honors.

1376
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,400
He brought me three things,
necessary, in Chalmette:

1377
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,000
Flints for muskets,

1378
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,300
Gunpowder and brave people.

1379
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,800
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. Lafitte.

1380
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:38,300
Once again, my
personal gratification.

1381
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,800
You know, for a man who has spent most of
life was spent in an unstable deck,

1382
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,500
rather slow dance.

1383
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:48,200
The trust generals, dancing
I always causes seasickness.

1384
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,700
Ms. Claiborne, nice
you like a princess.

1385
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,400
Thank you, General.
- That's my Rachel here

1386
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,900
We showed you
Rural dance steps.

1387
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,700
I wish I was there for you,
General. - I am too.

1388
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,500
General Dominique,

1389
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:31,500
I see that you have an eye for beauty,
as well as for artillery.

1390
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,500
General Jackson, I want you
present this lovely lady,

1391
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,300
Miss Bonnie Brown.

1392
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,900
I'm glad, Miss Brown.

1393
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
Perhaps you will
interest, Miss,

1394
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,300
I was recommended by General
for its exceptional contribution to the struggle.

1395
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,300
Thank you, sir. Excuse me,
Bonnie. General?

1396
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,900
I have to admit something,

1397
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,700
I do not want to lie
General like you.

1398
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,900
See ... I was just ...

1399
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,500
Actually, I was
only distributor.

1400
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,400
Well, I've seen the fight
General, my friend.

1401
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,600
I am very grateful.

1402
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,500
Thank you.
- Miss Brown.

1403
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,300
Something is wrong with your hand?

1404
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,900
Yes, Miss. She needs
your beautiful hand. Come on, Bonnie.

1405
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,700
This is like a fairy tale.
- Yes, is not it? Is not that right, Jean?

1406
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,900
Yes, it is ... how much we still have to
stay? - Not for long.

1407
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
You're lucky, Annette.

1408
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,600
This is so romantic.

1409
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,000
You have to bring the bridegroom
at my house for dinner.

1410
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,300
With pleasure.
- Lucky you man, Lafitte.

1411
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,500
On the contrary, sir,
I'm the lucky one.

1412
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,900
Well, see you soon,
very soon!

1413
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,900
Do not you think we already
exposed long enough?

1414
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,900
Maybe I am,
but you're not.

1415
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,500
I want every woman in the world
be jealous of me.

1416
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:13,900
Annette, we can
see the ring? - Of course!

1417
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,100
I can not do it!
- Bonnie!

1418
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,800
All you have to say is
'Congratulations'. I smile.

1419
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,600
That's enough, let's go.

1420
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,800
I'd rather him smash
bottle on his head.

1421
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,000
My general!
- Jean, Miss Claiborne.

1422
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,800
Miss Brown barely
waiting to congratulate you.

1423
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:48,600
That's it. Good luck to both of them.

1424
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,900
Thank you, very kind of you.

1425
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,700
It is a fish that is hard
catch, Miss Claiborne.

1426
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,700
Yes, it was not easy.

1427
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:03,400
What are you looking at? Something
wrong with my clothes?

1428
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:07,700
Not at all, you look good.
- You're gorgeous, the dress is beautiful.

1429
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,600
Did you know that the same kind of madame
de Dupre made for me?

1430
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,500
But she's my sister
took the Corinthian.

1431
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,700
Corinthian?

1432
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,500
Would not that be embarrassing,
both wear the same clothes?

1433
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,500
Proof that tailors
never be trusted.

1434
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,900
I hear a waltz. Miss,

1435
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,900
I insist that I
tribute dance.

1436
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
Excuse me.
- Of course.

1437
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,300
Jean.

1438
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,900
I did not want.

1439
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Jean, I'll go from here.

1440
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:09,400
I will solve the dresses,
I'll burn it.

1441
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,300
No one has ever
will not see it, I swear.

1442
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,200
Will it revive her sister?
- Annette does not have to know.

1443
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:21,100
You could say that the Corinthian sank in
storm, was lost at sea, who would know?

1444
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,100
I'll know.

1445
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,300
What are you going to do?

1446
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:33,800
Tell her.
- You're a fool.

1447
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:36,800
You'll lose everything you've
loved and for which you have fought.

1448
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,200
You gave up everything
you had, all that you are.

1449
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Jean, I do not even want
see how far you lose.

1450
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,700
Would you be able to love a man,
who killed your sister?

1451
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,600
I could love a man
who killed my father!

1452
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:57,000
Mr. Lafitte, there was a boy who
you want to see. It's called Miggs.

1453
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Where is it? -There,
with your dog.

1454
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,900
Tell him that I was waiting behind the house,

1455
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
right now, you know?

1456
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,800
Is it really your friend?
- Yes, of course. Go now.

1457
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,800
Go back, wait for me
there with Miggs.

1458
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,800
Jean, I'm afraid.
- Go!

1459
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,800
Have Miggs.

1460
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Maybe we have to fight for
output, boss. To call people?

1461
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
No, I would not be fighting.
Listen up, everyone.

1462
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,300
Go to Raven. Prepare
him to sail.

1463
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,300
I will come if I can.
- You're not going to come to terms with this without me.

1464
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,800
Dominique, this is an order!

1465
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
If you do not I come to
two hours sail.

1466
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,200
You heard the boss. Come on.

1467
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,700
Something is very odd.
Boy refuses to answer.

1468
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:54,300
How do we expect to match,
when all vicete on it?

1469
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,700
Annette was right. Listen,
son, no you will not do nothing.

1470
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
We just want to know how you left
Corinthian? How did you get back?

1471
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,400
Corinthian yet
could agree.

1472
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:09,000
I do not know ... was night.

1473
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,600
Spread your wings and
flown? - Stupid!

1474
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:18,900
You did not fall overboard?
- That's right, sir! I fell over.

1475
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,600
How did this happen? Tell us.

1476
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,000
There was a storm,

1477
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,700
big waves.

1478
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,000
There was no storm, my son.
- Yes, it was!

1479
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,900
And there have been big waves ...

1480
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,800
Is the ship sinking?
- What? No ...

1481
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,300
I do not know.

1482
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,700
I know what you'll get
to tell the truth.

1483
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,100
For God's sake, Mercier,
do not raise your hand to a child.

1484
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,900
I put a quarter of a million dollars
that ship and I'll find out what happened.

1485
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,800
Wait, Mercier, ship
is certainly sunk.

1486
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,500
Were they British?

1487
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,000
No, sir.

1488
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:57,000
Was he Lafitte? - Mr.
Mercier, how dare you?

1489
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,000
Mercier, do not stand at my
porch and the amount of such charges!

1490
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:04,500
If you were British, then who is?
- Mr. Lafitte was not even there! He was ...

1491
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,100
Lafitte was it?
- Mr. Lafitte was ...

1492
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,900
He's what?

1493
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,600
I can not answer that
question! I was there.

1494
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,600
What?

1495
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
Corinthian is submerged.

1496
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,700
Were there any survivors?

1497
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,600
All but one were killed.

1498
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,300
Have you participated
in fact, Lafitte?

1499
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,700
I was their boss.

1500
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,800
Mr. Lafitte!

1501
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,900
Mr. Lafitte, I just
come say hi to you,

1502
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I did not want this to happen.

1503
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,800
Mr. Lafitte!

1504
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,800
Jean!
- Hang the murderer!

1505
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:55,700
Jean, tell them it was not you!
- You would not believe it.

1506
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:00,600
Mr. Lafitte, I did not want! - No
need for arbitrating! Hang him now!

1507
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,300
Bring the rope!

1508
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,500
Father, stop them!

1509
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,900
You want to defend this killer?

1510
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:13,400
Father, he did not do it,
I can guarantee life.

1511
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,600
And what is the life
your sister?

1512
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,400
Father.

1513
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,000
G. Peaky.

1514
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,400
G. Peaky. Call General
Jackson, tell him what you intend.

1515
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,800
Do not worry, honey, I'm going
for him. - Hurry!

1516
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,800
Switch rope over!

1517
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:43,000
Not here! Hang him
on the street, where it belongs.

1518
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,900
Wait! Nobody criticizes
this man, as I do.

1519
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:49,100
I lost my daughter. But you can not
take the law into their own hands.

1520
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:52,600
Lafitte himself outlawed! - Yes!
I'll be happy to see him hanged,

1521
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:56,600
but not from the wild crowd. - Turn soft
to associate with him. Give it here!

1522
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:02,400
You're insane! Behave
like animals!

1523
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:13,700
By God, I'll kill
the first to be moved!

1524
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:19,000
This city is still under
state of emergency.

1525
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:21,300
How does this apply
the killer?

1526
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,300
Responsible for the death of 80 people ...

1527
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,000
Silence!

1528
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,000
Lafitte, are you
sunk the ship?

1529
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,900
I was responsible.

1530
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:38,100
I risked myself
Wealth on Corinthian.

1531
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,100
What have you risked to
front, Mr. Mercier?

1532
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:45,800
Jean has offered to assist in the defense of our
country, and you have destroyed Baratariju!

1533
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:49,400
And yet we came to help.
- It's not about that, Miss Claiborne!

1534
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,400
That being said, sir!

1535
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,400
I gave a promise to this man.

1536
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:58,900
A full pardon for all his
man, who join me on the battlefield.

1537
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,800
He gave his word.

1538
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I'll keep mine.

1539
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,500
I will keep you in word, General.

1540
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,600
I'll meet up with one
Clock advantages.

1541
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,100
Release him.

1542
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,700
Okay, Lafitte,
Your clock is started.

1543
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,800
Jean!

1544
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:36,400
I'll go with you. - Annette,
what kind of life we ??have?

1545
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,300
Without a country, without a home,
without belonging icemu.

1546
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:45,700
We belong to each other.
You are the whole world that I want.

1547
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,000
Annette, you do not know what
meant to spend his life on the run.

1548
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:54,100
I want to live and die with you.

1549
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,800
Jean!

1550
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,800
Too much love, that
I'd brought with me.

1551
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,100
What you can bring
the memory of you.

1552
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:25,300
I can not give you back your daughter, you
lost to Corinthian, Governor.

1553
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:32,900
I can give you back what
I love most in the world.

1554
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,200
Lafitte!

1555
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:51,900
No corner of the world,
where you'll be safe.

1556
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,500
At least leave
all of you safe.

1557
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,400
In the American New Orleans.

1558
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:19,800
Keeps the wind in your sails!

1559
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,700
You'll hang the flag?
- We do not have flags.

1560
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,200
What course?

1561
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,400
The open sea.

1562
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,000
Keep the wind in the stern.

1563
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,200
Where are we going, Dominique?
- Where it belongs.

1564
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,900
When a man loses everything
Others, still has the sea.

1565
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,300
This deck is the only
homeland we have.

1566
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,600
It's all homeland
I want.
