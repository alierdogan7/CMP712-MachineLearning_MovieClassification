01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:13,616
of the reasons
for Private Ackerman's behavior.

1197
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:17,453
- Sir, I can explain. You see‒
- I hope you can.

1198
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:20,915
I'll read you the charges that'll
be brought against you...

1199
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:24,251
at your court-martial.

1200
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:27,463
"That said officer willfully
persecuted Private Noah Ackerman..."

1201
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:31,675
by ordering mass punishment of his entire
company as a means of disciplining him,

1202
01:46:33,303 --> 01:46:36,138
by willfully and knowingly
permitting savage beatings...

1203
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:40,059
to be inflicted upon him
by members of his company,

1204
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:45,022
"by attempting to blackmail Private Michael
Whiteacre who interceded in his behalf."

1205

You want me to go on?

1206
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:53,906
I thought not.

1207
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:57,535
I've proffered these charges
against you, and...

1208
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:00,496
I officially serve you
with them now.

How much? Five bucks.

I don't see anything.

1213
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:22,309
[ Cowley ] I think it's Ackerman.
[ Abbott ] You're crazy.

1214
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,311
Ackerman's in New York
living it up.

1215
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:26,439
[ Cowley ] If it isn't Ackerman, it's
somebody who looks like Ackerman.

1216

[ Donnelly ] Nobody looks like Ackerman.
[ Burnecker Laughs ]

1217

[ Donnelly ] All right.
Don't just sit there.

I've just found a pigeon
with 20 bucks.

[ Man ♪2 ] King and queen.

Five.
You're out of your mind.

1222
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,925
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Captain.
May I help you?

1223
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:39,386
Yes, uh, do you have a Captain
Hardenburg in this section?

1224
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:42,890
Yes, he's here. Would it
be possible to see him?

1225
01:48:42,974 --> 01:48:45,768
Are you a friend of his?
Mmm. Yes.

1226
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,103
Very good. He's right in there.
Go right in.

1227
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:50,105
Thank you.

Captain Hardenburg?

1229
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:09,208
Is that you, Diestl?
Yes, sir.

1230
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:11,835
I was just released
from my hospital this afternoon,

1231
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,296
and I came to say good-bye.

1232
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:16,882
That's very nice of you.

1233
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:19,552
Well, are you feeling
any better, sir?

1234
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:24,515
Ah, better each day.
Good.

1235
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:28,102
But they tell me
I will be here for six months.

1236
01:49:28,186 --> 01:49:31,397
Six months. Ah, well, I'm sorry
that it will be so long for you.

1237
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,607
Oh, why sorry?

1238
01:49:33,692 --> 01:49:38,195
It gives me the opportunity
to think of the future.

1239
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:42,658
I plan to go into politics.
Oh, yes.

1240
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:48,581
My face will be a reminder of what
I have given for the fatherland.

1241
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:51,166
It will stand me
in good stead...

1242
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:54,211
before audiences
at public meetings.

1243
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:57,298
Well,

1244
01:49:57,382 --> 01:49:59,592
you know, sir, that...

1246
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:06,098
Yes, remarkable.
Remarkable.

1247
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:10,185
Glass eyes, plastic noses,

1248

reconstructed cheekbones.

1249
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:17,610
I have written to Gretchen
in this kind of detail...

1250
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,821
to prepare her for it.

1251
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:24,325
And she has assured me
she is proud of me,

1252
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,536
and it will make no difference.

1253
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,372
Gretchen is
the name of my wife.

1254
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:33,042
Yes, I know.

1255
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,794
How do you know?

1256
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:41,467
Oh, yes. You delivered
a package for me.

1257
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,138
She's quite handsome,
isn't she?

1258
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:49,433
Yes, sir.
She's quite handsome.

1259
01:50:49,517 --> 01:50:51,435
She will be very useful
to my career.

1260
01:50:53,396 --> 01:50:56,148
What I would like
for you to do for me is...

1261
01:50:56,232 --> 01:51:00,569
visit her again...
to reassure her.

1262
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,658
I know it's
a great deal to ask,

1263
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:10,829
to speak for a man to his wife
under these circumstances,

1264
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:15,167
but I want her to hear
from a third party that I am...

1265
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,211
salvageable.

1266

Yes, I-I-I will be
glad to do that.

Thank you, Diestl.

01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:31,433
Now, come closer.

1269
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,899
Yes, sir.

1270
01:51:40,443 --> 01:51:42,903

Yes, it's all right.

I want you to bring me

Well, I think, uh‒ Wh-What
is the matter with you?

1276

Not for me.

For him.

01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:17,563
He has no hands left...
or anything left.

1279
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,565
He wants to die.

1280
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,443
I've promised him.

1281
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:26,238
[ Whispering ] He whispers to me...
when we are alone.

1282
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:28,240
And he can hear.

1283
01:52:32,912 --> 01:52:36,165
He's a watchmaker...
in Nuremberg.

1284
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:38,751
He specializes in stopwatches.

1285
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:42,755
He has three children,
and he wants to die.

1286
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:04,109
Where is my hand?

1287
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,154
Approximately over his heart.

1288
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:09,239
Good.

1289
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:12,534
That's where I will place
the bayonet.

1290
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:16,997
We have practiced it
every night for a week.

1291

Come back tonight
with the bayonet.

the bayonet?

Yes, sir.

I'm all right.
And you?

1303

Forgive me, Lieutenant.
I must look awful,

1304
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:21,682
but I haven't slept
for so many weeks.

1305

We've had so many air raids.
Mmm.

Come in.
Excuse me.

They come over
two or three times a night.

You can't imagine
what it's like.

1309
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:37,990
The soldiers at the front would
strike under such conditions.

1310
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:41,326
I mean it.

1311

Do you hear from your husband?

01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:31,043
He killed himself.

1322
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:39,843

- He killed himself with a bayonet.

I have the letter somewhere.

He asked me to come here
and speak to you for him.

1325
01:58:06,704 --> 01:58:09,331
Perhaps it's just as well.

1326
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:15,128
He wanted to come back here.

1327
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,340
Naturally,
I didn't encourage him.

1328
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:22,094
I spent a whole night
composing a most tactful letter.

1329
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:27,182
I told him, of course, he would be better
off in some permanent veteran's hospital.

What are you doing now?

be a little realistic.

Oh, it was bad, huh?

01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:49,014
No. They moved us around a
little bit, but you know, it's‒

Listen now, uh,

what's the matter with you,
being so near the front?

1347
01:59:53,686 --> 01:59:57,689
Well, you know me.
It was a mistake in the orders.

1348
01:59:57,773 --> 01:59:59,691
But you, what are you doing here?
Are you stationed here?

1349

No, as a matter of fact, I'm
waiting for transportation.

Let's go someplace where we can talk.
I'll buy you a drink for old-time's sake.

1352
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,534
Brandt, I see you are
a captain from taking pictures.

1353
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:12,996
It's an outrage.
I should be a major.

1354

You have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

1355

I'll take that.
Bring us some glasses.

days waiting for somebody to go to Paris.

Listen. What are you
doing in Paris, Brandt?

Well, my headquarters are there.

Very near. A few miles.

1705

All right, I didn't tell you.

1706

it was that called.

kill everybody in the camp?

They want me to kill every man, woman and child
in the camp before the Americans get here.

1714
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:15,388
6,000 people.

1715
02:35:20,561 --> 02:35:24,439
And the man who asked me to do this‒ this
same man‒ will walk the streets free.

1716
02:35:24,523 --> 02:35:27,984
And they will come to him,
the Americans, the Russians,

1717

and he will say, "I've never
heard of concentration camps."

1718

He will say there never was a national
policy to kill 12 million people.

1719
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:38,828
The SS invented it.

1720

Nobody in the government
ever heard of it.

1721
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:47,420

explain to the Americans.

understand what they see here.

[ Man ] Captain, this is the mayor of the
town we just came through on our way up here.

of civilians in to help us.

the sergeant, Captain,

Yes, what is it?

1742
02:38:41,887 --> 02:38:44,180

Sorry, Rabbi.
We're doing all we can.

1745
02:38:51,355 --> 02:38:55,024
Of course. I know that.

1746
02:38:55,108 --> 02:38:57,777
But there's nothing
to be done for them.

1747
02:38:57,861 --> 02:39:01,239
Nothing material.
We understand that.

1748
02:39:01,323 --> 02:39:03,866
All efforts must be
for the living.

is a luxury.

to collect all of us,

1752

the living
and those without hope,

1753
02:39:22,302 --> 02:39:24,512
and hold a religious service‒

1754

who have come to their end here.

There has never been a religious
service for us in this place.

Permit me, Captain.
I don't like to intrude.

I understand why the rabbi
has made this request,

1758

but this is
not the time for it.

perhaps the captain doesn't understand.

1760

If you allow this gentleman to hold the
services, I'm obliged to warn you.

1761
02:39:53,542 --> 02:39:58,921
There will be riots. The other prisoners
will not stand for it, and...

1762
02:39:59,006 --> 02:40:02,383
the generals who are coming
will not like what they see.

1763
02:40:09,224 --> 02:40:14,270
The, uh, other prisoners will not stand
for it and the generals will not like it?

1764
02:40:14,354 --> 02:40:16,856
That's a fact.
I guarantee it.

1765
02:40:28,493 --> 02:40:32,580
I'm gonna guarantee
something myself.

1766

I'm gonna guarantee that you‒
you'll hold your services.

1767

I'm also gonna guarantee that
machine guns will be set up...

1769

And further, I will guarantee that anyone who
attempts to interfere with those services...

1770
02:40:45,802 --> 02:40:47,970
will be fired upon
by those machine guns.
