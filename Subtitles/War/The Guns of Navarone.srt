1
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,515
Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...

2
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,519
have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,084
These once-proud stones...

4
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,754
these ruined and shattered temples...

5
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,266
bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here...

6
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,631
and to the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...

7
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,368
on this sea and these islands.

8
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,913
But, though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,542
and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.

10
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,747
In 1943, so the story goes...

11
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,791
2,000 British soldiers lay marooned
on the tiny island of Kheros...

12
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,986
exhausted and helpless.

13
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,062
They had exactly
one week to live...

14
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,564
for the Axis high command
had determined...

15
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,034
on a show of strength
in the Aegean Sea...

16
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,803
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...

17
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,941
itself of no military value, but only
a few miles off the coast of Turkey.

18
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,216
The cream of the German war machine,
rested and ready...

19
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,655
was to spearhead the attack...

20
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,487
and the men on Kheros were doomed...

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,461
unless they could be evacuated
before the blitz.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,226
But the only passage to and from Kheros
was guarded and blocked...

23
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,804
by two great, newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...

24
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,603
on the nearby island of Navarone.

25
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:30,010
Guns too powerful and accurate for any
Allied ship in the Aegean to challenge.

26
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,155
Allied intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,855
only one week
before the appointed date.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,629
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.

29
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,856
Yes?

30
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,298
Sorry. I'm looking
for Commodore Jensen.

31
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,902
I'm Jensen.

32
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,266
Come in, Mallory.

33
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,042
You're late.

34
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,413
Well, I'm sorry.

35
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,987
My plane was attacked outside of Crete
and we got into Alex on one engine, sir.

36
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,115
The Germans have raised the price on you
and Andrea Stavrou to £10,000 apiece.

37
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,059
- Are you flattered?
- No, sir. How did you know that?

38
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,220
I should do.
I'm your boss.

39
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,391
You've been working for me
for the past 18 months.

40
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,796
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance
at long last.

41
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,270
- They told you you were going on leave?
- Yes, sir, they did.

42
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,002
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.

43
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,236
Not yet, at any rate.

44
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,810
Well, here's your old chum.
Come say hello.

45
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,076
Keith, you haven't changed
since Athens.

46
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,516
Hello, Roy.

47
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,518
Come along, gentlemen, will you.

48
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,595
Barnsby, these gentlemen have
a special interest in Navarone.

49
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:21,537
We picked you up on radio, of course,
but you can be more specific now.

50
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,140
I'll be specific.

51
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,802
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful.

52
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,273
Squadron Leader Barnsby
is Australian.

53
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,717
But we'd love to go back.
Wouldn't we, boys?

54
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,253
- Sure!
- Just as soon as we can, but...

55
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,555
only on one condition.

56
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,594
We want the joker who thought
this one up to come along with us.

57
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,130
And when we get there...

58
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,702
we're gonna shove him out
at 10,000 feet...

59
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,429
without a parachute.

60
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,502
- It was as bad as that?
- Bad?

61
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,109
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.

62
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,112
You're quite sure about that,
Squadron Leader?

63
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,944
- This is important.
- So's my life.

64
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,483
To me, anyway.

65
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,454
And the lives of these jokers here,
and the 18 men we lost tonight.

66
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,459
Look, sir...

67
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,393
first...

68
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,331
you've got that bloody old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.

69
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,994
Then you got
the bloody cliff overhang.

70
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,507
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the bloody guns.

71
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,079
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...

72
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,080
to smash that bloody rock.

73
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,115
And that's the bloody truth, sir.

74
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,054
- I know how to hit those guns, sir.
- Yes?

75
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,816
Yes, sir.

76
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,689
You fill a plane full ofTNT...

77
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,765
and then you do a suicide dive
right into that cave.

78
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,368
There's just one problem, sir.

79
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,368
Getting someone to pilot the plane.

80
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,241
I see.

81
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,208
Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.

82
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,445
Thank you, Squadron Leader,
and all of you.

83
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,386
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more...

84
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,387
and I'm sorry.

85
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,329
As you've probably surmised,
Mallory...

86
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,697
I'm the bloody joker
they'd like to heave out at 10,000 feet.

87
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,634
I can't say I blame them.

88
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,241
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.

89
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,435
Anyway, this is why
you were hauled out of Crete.

90
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,076
And don't mislay this, will you?

91
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,448
No, sir.

92
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,921
Well, we're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?

93
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,570
- Any questions?
- Well, only one.

94
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,073
Why me?

95
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,409
What you want
is a seagoing taxi driver.

96
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,412
There must be a dozen men
who know these waters as well as I do.

97
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,949
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.

98
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,112
Franklin will explain it to you.
It's all his idea anyway.

99
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,623
First, you speak Greek like a Greek
and German like a German.

100
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,889
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.

101
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,362
But most important...

102
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,695
before the war you were the greatest
mountain climber in the world.

103
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,962
Keith Mallory, the human fly.

104
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,367
Come to the point.

105
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,238
The point is,
our Resistance contacts on Navarone...

106
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,243
say there's only one spot on the entire
coast the Germans don't bother watching.

107
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,880
That's the south cliff...

108
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,611
because it's 400 feet straight up
and it can't be climbed by man or beast.

109
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,152
That's where you come in.

110
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,122
- Oh, that was your idea too, was it?
- That's right.

111
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,786
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.

112
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,627
After that, you can put your ship about
and take a richly deserved leave...

113
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,328
and a long-overdue promotion.

114
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,994
I see.

115
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,888
Can you do it?

116
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,991
With all due respect to Major Franklin,
I think the operation is insane.

117
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,362
But that's none of my business.

118
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,303
My business is the climb, and I haven't
done any climbing in five years.

119
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:52,406
That's a long time.
Too long for this cliff.

120
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
And you're asking me
to do it at night.

121
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,277
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.

122
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,948
I'll have a go at it myself, then.

123
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,683
Don't be a fool.

124
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,692
Even with your luck, you'll
get yourself and your team killed.

125
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,090
Then it's scrubbed?

126
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,030
No, it's not scrubbed.
It can't be.

127
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,433
Not now.

128
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,773
This is our last hope.

129
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,438
The Germans won't expect us to throw in
a team of saboteurs at this late date.

130
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,943
Those 2,000 men on Kheros are
going to die next Wednesday morning...

131
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,951
unless somebody climbs that cliff.

132
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,353
There's nobody else we can get
in time.

133
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,860
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.

134
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,440
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavrou out of Crete to help me.

135
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,310
On the contrary.

136
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,548
You'll find him waiting for you
in your hotel at this very moment.

137
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,223
You think of everything,
don't you, sir?

138
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,988
I have to.
It's part of my job.

139
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,962
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.

140
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,966
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.

141
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,969
Now, you'll want to know some more
about the team.

142
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,506
Sidney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?

143
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,739
Franklin here considers it the best team
in the business; I'm inclined to agree.

144
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,214
He himself is ideal for the job.
He's experienced and extremely capable.

145
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,149
Don't blush, Roy.

146
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,948
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you?

147
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,683
- If you say so, sir.
- I do indeed.

148
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,318
It was Napoleon who said, when somebody
was being promoted to general...

149
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,363
"Yes, yes, I know he's brilliant,
but is he lucky?"

150
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:57,127
The emperor knew the value of luck,
and our Roy seems to have it.

151
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,699
This is our Corporal Miller...

152
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,936
a professor of chemistry
in private life...

153
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,639
and an absolute genius
with high explosives.

154
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,679
He blew up Rommel's headquarters
in Tobruk...

155
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,716
without damaging a single window
of the orphanage next door.

156
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,311
They don't come any better. We tried to
promote him, but he just won't wear it.

157
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,057
This is Butcher Brown,
our mechanical marvel.

158
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,663
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.

159
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,630
He's also the best man with a knife
that I've ever met.

160
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,635
He got trained in the Spanish Civil War.
They call him the Butcher of Barcelona.

161
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,872
Private Spiro Pappadimos.

162
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,843
What's his particular genius?

163
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,678
He's a born killer, an extremely useful
man to have along on a job like this.

164
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,687
His father happens to be our
chief Resistance contact on Navarone.

165
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,224
The family sent him to America
ten years ago to get an education...

166
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,693
and I'm afraid
he got the wrong kind.

167
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,388
Well, there's the team.

168
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,227
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.

169
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,302
And of course there's Lucky here,
and the redoubtable Mr. Stavrou...

170
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,666
and yourself.

171
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,441
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?

172
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,202
You can't.

173
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,042
We're sending six destroyers through
Navarone Channel Tuesday at midnight...

174
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,013
to take the men off Kheros.

175
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,550
If those guns aren't spiked by then...

176
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.

177
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,092
There's your car, gentlemen.

178
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,873
Surprised?

179
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,547
I did not think
I would see you again so soon.

180
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,776
You thought
you'd have to look for me?

181
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,816
When the time came,
I would find you.

182
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,121
What is it?

183
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,197
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.

184
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,966
- Do you know it?
- I know it.

185
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,735
I also know
I have work to do on Crete.

186
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,969
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major that I used to know.

187
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,178
Name of Franklin.

188
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,182
He's a man who still has
to prove to himself that he's a hero.

189
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,885
I will speak to this Franklin.
Where do I find him?

190
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,581
That's the man.

191
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,193
You can speak with him on the way.

192
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,309
Do you think they've got
any chance at all, sir?

193
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,912
Frankly, no.

194
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,413
Not a chance in the world.

195
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,412
I should be very surprised
if they get even halfway to Navarone.

196
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,151
It's just a waste of six good men.

197
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,316
However,
I suppose that doesn't matter...

198
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,260
considering how many
have been wasted already.

199
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,764
I'm glad it's not my decision.

200
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,701
I'm only the middle man.

201
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,476
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.

202
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,444
Anything can happen in a war.

203
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,640
Slap in the middle
of absolute insanity...

204
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,275
people pull out
the most extraordinary resources...

205
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,583
ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.

206
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,590
Pity we can't beat the problems of peace
in the same way.

207
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,458
It would be so much cheaper
for everybody.

208
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,397
I never thought of it
in just that way, sir.

209
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,832
- You're a philosopher, sir.
- No.

210
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm just the man who has to send people
out on jobs like this one.

211
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,906
Must've been delayed, sir.
I'm sure he'll be here in a moment.

212
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,993
- Major Franklin?
- That's right.

213
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,505
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come along with me.

214
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,836
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.

215
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,472
When you're all quite ready.

216
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,802
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.

217
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,771
Where does everybody else sleep?

218
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,467
Nobody sleeps. On your feet.
We've got homework to do.

219
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,909
Well, if you insist, Major.

220
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,240
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?

221
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,875
No, friend, microphones.

222
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,853
This is the British army post.
Don't you trust anyone?

223
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,856
No. That is why
I have lived so long.

224
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:59,225
Mr. Stavrou is Colonel Stavrou
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.

225
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,162
He outranks us all.

226
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,564
The 19th Regiment no longer exists...

227
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,035
for the time being.

228
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,697
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
- Andrea.

229
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,139
- Oh, please continue.
- Right.

230
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,371
If you're ready, Corporal.

231
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,642
Oh, yes, sir. Ready, sir.
Ready, willing and able, sir.

232
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,240
Champing at the very bit.

233
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,013
Captain Mallory and, uh, Andrea...

234
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,020
are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.

235
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,023
I'm going to tell you where we're going
and why we're going there.

236
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,026
That is, if you really
want to know, Professor.

237
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,461
I'm all ears, sir.
All ears.

238
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,397
We have to avoid the coast road.

239
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,766
That means a 12-mile trek across the
mountain to these ruins... St. Alexis...

240
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,739
where some of the Resistance people
from the town of Mandrakos...

241
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,742
will come and meet us,
if and when they can make it.

242
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,937
Any questions?

243
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,108
I have an alternate route to that place.
May I borrow your pencil, please?

244
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,414
Does the major
think this is possible?

245
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,392
I see.
That's a thought, isn't it?

246
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,990
Let's reexamine the plan...

247
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,530
and see if we have any alternative.

248
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,934
Watch out!

249
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,172
How long do you think
he's been out there?

250
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,573
I imagined I heard something
about ten minutes ago.

251
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,204
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.

252
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,545
Ten minutes, eh?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.

253
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,519
Well? What's your name?
What are you doing here?

254
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,881
The major asked you a question.
Answer the major.

255
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,822
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.

256
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,456
I'll try Greek.

257
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,207
Translation, sir, please.

258
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,336
- He doesn't speak English.
- Then why was he listening?

259
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,315
- What are you doing to that man?
- Do you know him?

260
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,183
That's Nikolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?

261
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,187
Look, Franklin,
I've had a hard day.

262
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,417
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?

263
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,427
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him.

264
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,428
Just idle curiosity, I'm sure.
He doesn't speak English.

265
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,159
Then why does he listen? Why carry a
knife? Why did he try and stab this man?

266
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,668
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.

267
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:24,572
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't mark a man as a criminal.

268
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,007
- You there, let him go.
- Major Baker.

269
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,344
Arrest this man and hold him
incommunicado for at least a week.

270
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,749
After that I don't care, but my advice
is you kick him out of Castelrosso.

271
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,616
Just who the hell are you
to give me advice, Major?

272
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,124
Then I'm asking you as a favor.

273
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,023
I'll consider it.

274
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,221
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

275
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,389
I said, let him go!

276
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,330
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?

277
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,991
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Then use it.

278
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,262
- Shoot the laundry boy.
- Are you crazy?

279
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,604
And if the major gets in your way,
shoot him too. That's an order.

280
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,683
Captain, this man's insane.
Surely you won't let him do this.

281
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,917
I can't stop him. He's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.

282
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,858
Of course,
he doesn't have to shoot you.

283
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,327
All he has to do is call our HQ
and you'll be on the first ship home...

284
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,024
as a private...

285
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,765
unless you give him your word
that you'll do exactly as he says.

286
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,345
All right. If it means that much to you,
you have my word.

287
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,251
Take him, Sergeant.

288
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,253
Stupid theatricals.

289
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,292
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion...

290
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,057
but I just saved your life.

291
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,119
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.

292
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,750
I mean, it's embarrassing.
Just look at it.

293
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,724
No, it's exactly what we want.

294
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:28,025
I know you wanted a boat that no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace.

295
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,065
Just give me 36 hours.

296
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,730
I know where I can lay my hands on
a German E-boat in perfect condition.

297
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:40,571
Only one careful owner. Say the word,
I'll pop over to Rhodes and get it.

298
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,545
Rhodes? Won't the Germans
have something to say about that?

299
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,412
I suppose they would if they knew, but
I've got some good connections there.

300
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,417
- What do you say?
- No, thanks.

301
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,055
- We can't wait.
- Pity.

302
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,420
Well, I'll get a couple of my chaps
to give yours a hand with your gear.

303
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,051
No, that's all right, thank you.

304
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,858
Right. I get it.
Special cargo and all that, what?

305
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,557
Well, good luck to you.

306
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,006
Brown?

307
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,008
- Yes, sir?
- What do you think?

308
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,742
She's a bit of a monster, sir,
but I think I've got her worried.

309
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,354
Comfortable, Professor?

310
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,991
Yes, thank you.

311
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,355
The boys have almost finished.

312
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,061
- Permission to speak?
- What about?

313
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,029
Well, the condition of this vessel.

314
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:40,029
Talk to Captain Mallory about that.
He's in charge of transportation.

315
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,399
Very good, sir.

316
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,174
I've inspected this boat,
and you ought to know that...

317
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,539
I can't swim.

318
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,512
I'll keep it in mind.

319
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,591
Dead on ten, sir.

320
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,402
Hello, Lucky.
Hello, Lucky.

321
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,068
Report by signal.
Report by signal.

322
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,908
Hello, George Mike William.
Hello, George Mike William.

323
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,880
Strength three.
Strength three. Over.

324
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,519
Hello, Lucky.

325
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,646
High Flight reports Indians on warpath
in your territory...

326
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,816
so please be careful.

327
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,158
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.

328
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,492
Repeat...

329
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,468
Ship ahoy!

330
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,354
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.

331
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,936
Lower your sails!

332
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,307
Lower your sails!

333
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,749
We are coming aboard!

334
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,165
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I should think we'll manage.

335
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,009
- You want a breather?
- Wouldn't mind.

336
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,254
Funny the way that German officer
kept speaking English to us back there.

337
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,083
Almost as if he knew who we were.

338
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,059
Yes, I had the same thought.

339
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,857
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.

340
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,834
- I shouldn't have done it.
- What's that?

341
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,270
Dragged you into this.
I'm sorry.

342
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,572
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.

343
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,976
No, I'm stupid sometimes.

344
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:14,107
Even as a kid, I took it for granted
people wanted to play the games I liked.

345
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,244
I'd get furious when they didn't.

346
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,188
And now they have to.
So why worry?

347
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,148
- Hot coffee.
- Oh, that's good.

348
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,995
Sorry, Captain. There's a serious
shortage of cups aboard this ship.

349
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,331
Remember, I did point out
certain deficiencies in this vessel.

350
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,230
I remember.

351
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,338
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

352
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,710
Any time you want another chat, sir...
about this boat, I mean...

353
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,180
I'm available.

354
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,682
Right.

355
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,385
And I still can't swim.

356
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,798
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.

357
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,335
I don't mind him
as much as he seems to mind me.

358
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,241
- Have you been together long?
- Since the beginning out here.

359
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,710
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.

360
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,612
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.

361
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,054
Yes.

362
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,662
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.

363
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,335
He's going to kill me
when the war is over.

364
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,542
You're not serious.

365
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,202
Yes, I am.

366
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,772
So is he.

367
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,317
About a year ago
I gave a German patrol a safe conduct...

368
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,792
to get some of their wounded
into hospital.

369
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,764
Still had some romantic notions in those
days about fighting a civilized war.

370
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,999
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.

371
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,905
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.

372
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,938
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.

373
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,911
They were all killed.

374
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,078
I helped him to bury them.

375
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,791
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.

376
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,761
But after it was over he turned to me
and said as far as he was concerned...

377
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,666
it wasn't the Germans
who were responsible, but me.

378
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,970
Me and my stupid Anglo-Saxon decency.

379
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,869
Then he told me
what he was going to do, and when.

380
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,846
Do you think he still means to do it?

381
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,249
He's from Crete.

382
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,251
Those people don't make idle threats.

383
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,626
When I thought I was getting leave...

384
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,754
I was going to ask for transfer
to another area.

385
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,596
Some time to think,
get ready for it.

386
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,999
And I messed that up.

387
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,130
I'm sorry.

388
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,071
That's all right.

389
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,767
It's gonna be a long war.

390
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,744
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?

391
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,049
Well, I'm not,
not if he gets the right opportunity.

392
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:17,885
What I'm banking on is that right now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.

393
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,625
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...

394
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,928
he'll do his best to keep me alive.

395
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,265
I hope.

396
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,202
That's nice of him.

397
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,506
Well, I can see his point.

398
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,643
The only way to win a war
is to be just as nasty as the enemy.

399
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:43,345
Only we might wake up one day and find
out we're even nastier than they are.

400
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,649
- I can't say that worries me.
- Well, you're lucky.

401
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,903
Think I'd better have a look
at the hold...

402
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,138
before Miller tells me to.

403
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,140
Help!

404
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,954
Well, we saved the explosives...

405
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,753
the guns, and most of the ammunition.

406
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,355
I'm afraid we've lost
the food and the medical supplies.

407
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,197
But if we make our rendezvous
with the Resistance at St. Alexis...

408
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,204
they should be able to
supply us with both.

409
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,138
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.

410
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,438
Pappadimos and Miller...

411
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,309
you'll have the first shift
with the stretcher.

412
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,441
You're officially taking command
of this team, sir?

413
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,486
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?

414
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,488
Just for the record.

415
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,776
This afternoon on the boat...

416
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,404
you fumbled your job.

417
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,846
How did that happen?

418
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,454
I don't know, sir.

419
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:30,184
The man was a foot away from you with
his back turned. You only wounded him.

420
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,851
How could you miss?

421
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,895
I must have hesitated, sir.

422
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,694
You hesitated?

423
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,530
A man of your experience?

424
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,300
The Butcher of Barcelona?
How could you hesitate?

425
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,275
Then I was tired.

426
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,845
I'm tired and I'm fed up.

427
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,780
I've been fighting this war
a long time.

428
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,854
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.

429
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,423
You shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a moving target.

430
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,552
You kill him with a knife,
you're close enough to smell him.

431
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,262
I smell them in my sleep.

432
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,060
After the last time,
I made a pact with myself.

433
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,434
I'd do my job...

434
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,370
but I wouldn't do
the other anymore.

435
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,276
Not if I could help it.

436
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,505
Who gave you the right
to make a private peace?

437
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,383
You think you're the only one
who's tired?

438
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,853
- I do my job, sir.
- Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.

439
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,827
There will, of course,
be a code word.

440
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:16,830
If we don't answer it,
there'll be a patrol up here in no time.

441
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,229
Let's pack the gear
and get out of here.

442
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,087
Let's go.

443
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,422
Well?

444
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,533
The major's leg is broken
in two places.

445
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,867
For all we know, he's hurt inside too.
He needs proper medical attention.

446
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,271
What do you suggest?

447
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,433
If we leave him here,
the Germans will take care of him.

448
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,535
They'd get him to a hospital.

449
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:40,241
If he doesn't get sulfanilamide
for his leg, he doesn't stand a chance.

450
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,681
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.

451
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,186
We have two choices.

452
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,916
Take him with us, and if
he doesn't get help soon, he'll die.

453
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:53,654
Or we can leave him here, in which case
he'll tell the Germans everything.

454
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,787
Roy? Never!

455
00:58:55,899 --> 00:59:00,666
He might not be able to help himself.
They have other drugs besides sulfa.

456
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,431
All they have to do is to shoot him
full of Scopolamine...

457
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,041
and he'll tell them
our whole plan in detail.

458
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,609
There is, of course,
a third choice.

459
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,609
One bullet now.

460
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,180
Better for him,
better for us.

461
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:16,149
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.

462
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,651
Why don't we just drop him
off the cliff and save a bullet?

463
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,619
And why don't you shut up?

464
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,489
Yes, there's a third choice.

465
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,256
We'll make it if necessary...

466
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,694
when it's necessary...

467
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,130
and not before!

468
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,236
Now, let's get moving.

469
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,506
From now on, your job is
to look after Major Franklin.

470
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,575
I said move!

471
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,915
Morning.

472
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,985
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

473
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,784
It's just bad luck.

474
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,586
What do we do now?

475
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,991
- Where are we?
- We're on our way.

476
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,162
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.

477
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,567
Anyway, the professor here won the toss,
and he's just dying to carry you.

478
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:17,366
- Aren't you, Professor?
- That's right.

479
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,974
You're nowhere near as heavy
as I thought you were.

480
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,703
Now, look...

481
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,972
you've got to leave me.

482
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,345
You're out of your mind.

483
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,680
It's radio time.

484
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,220
Well, it's all on your plate now.

485
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,718
You'll never be able
to thank me enough, will you?

486
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,694
I wanted the job all the time.

487
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,116
Hello, Lucky.

488
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,954
Report by signal.

489
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,152
Hello, George Mike William.

490
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,129
Strength four. Over.

491
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,462
Hello, Lucky.
This is most urgent.

492
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,027
Paddington Station will close
at midnight x-minus-one.

493
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,902
Do you understand?
X-minus-one.

494
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,702
Over.

495
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,708
We've lost a full day.

496
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,376
Germans are going to hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.

497
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,320
Gives us until midnight
the day after tomorrow.

498
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,817
Message understood.
Over and out.

499
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,236
I'd like to be alone
with the major.

500
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,006
Roy, that was foolish.

501
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,845
You almost ruined everything.
We just heard from headquarters.

502
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,277
We're cancelled out.

503
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,585
- Scrubbed.
- What?

504
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,020
They're going for
an amphibious landing...

505
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:25,184
the day after tomorrow
on the east coast.

506
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,427
The Turkish side.

507
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,596
And they're coming in force.

508
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:38,866
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.

509
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,841
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.

510
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:46,312
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.

511
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,280
We'll have you taken care of.

512
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:57,756
You try this again,
I'll have Andrea break your other leg.

513
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,516
Good luck.

514
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,918
Do not worry.

515
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,889
I shall see you tonight
at St. Alexis.

516
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,113
Good evening, gentlemen.

517
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,643
Obviously, this place
has been used before.

518
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,982
Any food around?

519
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,317
I regret to say no.

520
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,730
Weren't you a little careless just now?
We might have been anyone.

521
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,926
Oh, no, no. I heard you coming
five minutes ago.

522
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,553
It's time to relieve Andrea.

523
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,948
- I'll take it.
- No.

524
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,662
Pappadimos, you go.

525
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,356
- Maybe he brought us some food.
- Hold it.

526
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,330
He might be faking.

527
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,535
Saved.

528
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,481
Don't move!

529
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,515
Raise your hands.

530
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,249
Raise your hands high.

531
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,691
All of you.

532
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,093
You there, with the food, speak!

533
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,602
You are not Germans.

534
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,199
Which of you is Major Franklin?

535
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,542
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?

536
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,045
My name is Maria Pappadimos.

537
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,210
You may put your hands down now.

538
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,899
- They told us Pappadimos was a man.
- My father. He was taken two days ago.

539
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,367
He was taken?

540
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:46,065
He told them nothing.
He will die first.

541
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,008
- You have any sisters or brothers?
- I have a brother, Spiro, in America.

542
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,849
He's not that far away.

543
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,314
He's that handsome devil
right over there.

544
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,132
What did you do that for?

545
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,503
To remind you
to write letters occasionally.

546
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,634
- There happens to be a war on.
- I mean before the war!

547
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,805
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.

548
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,882
Well, I'm sorry, brother.

549
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,968
Which of you did this?

550
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,806
I'm afraid it was me.

551
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:57,139
- Who is she?
- She's my friend Anna. She's one of us.

552
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,006
It's bad that this happened to her.

553
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,216
Before the Germans came,
she was a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.

554
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,582
Last year she was caught.

555
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,954
They tortured her
to make her betray us.

556
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,357
They whipped her
until the white of her bones showed.

557
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,523
Some nights,
we could hear her screaming.

558
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,830
Then they took her to the fortress,
and they kept her there for six months.

559
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,097
When they let her go...

560
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,298
she could not speak.

561
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:32,107
She has never spoken since,
not even in her dreams.

562
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,842
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.

563
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,420
But she's a good fighter...
as good as any of you.

564
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,455
She's like a ghost.
She goes anywhere.

565
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:45,252
She got us these guns,
and she kills without mercy.

566
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,657
You are very lucky, brother.

567
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,203
No, they're friends!
Our friends!

568
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,534
It's gangrene, sir.

569
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,506
If the major's leg doesn't come off,
he's gonna die.

570
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,077
Does he know?

571
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,644
I don't think so.

572
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,612
Sir?

573
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,248
Beg pardon, sir, but this is the first
chance I've had to talk to you alone.

574
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:33,521
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.

575
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,492
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.

576
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,033
I'll think it over.

577
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,904
That's gangrene.
What choice do we have now, Captain?

578
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,374
- Who relieved you?
- She did.

579
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,980
- In future, take orders only from me.
- Yes, sir.
