All Czech patriots should be
ready to die for their country.

187
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,049
I want to carry on fighting.

188
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,851
We don't have that many left
that are willing to do that.

189
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,321
We are what's left
of the Czech resistance.

190
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
I suggest a lesser rank
should be assassinated.

Perhaps a few of them.

192
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,840
Heydrich is the head of the secret police.

193
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,049
Only Hitler and Himmler are
above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

194
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,281
VANEK: Exactly my point.

195
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,721
You really think you'll ever get close
enough to assassinate Heydrich?

196

Our orders have come direct
from the Czech government in London.

197
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,244
So this is about the Czech government
in London trying to impress the allies?

198
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,208
It was the allies that gave us
to the Germans in the first place.

199
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,362
Munich was a betrayal,

200
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,205
but it is also now history.

201
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,210
I think what the Czech government
in London is asking is this.

202
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,964
Is Czechoslovakia

203
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,886
still ready and willing
to resist Nazi Germany?

but if you do, never walk together.

216
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,524

an excuse for why you're not at work.

There is a fire escape to the left.

To the right it continues

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,445
Utmost priority.

361
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,648
We assist with everything possible.

362
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,721
So...

363
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,847
This is your show, bratři.

364
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,202
So, we know that Heydrich
returns to his family

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,363
every day at Panenské Břežany.

366
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,161
But, both his chateau and the castle
are both heavily guarded.

367
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,766
They are not feasible targets.

368
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,080
But once a month,

369
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,369
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

370
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,930
And we can predict this

371
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,846
because his personal carriages
are prepared several days in advance.

372
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,167
But, again, the station and the train
are both heavily guarded.

373
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,687
What about derailing
the train outside of Prague?

374
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,731
We can derail the train, but that is
no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

375
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,645
I have made contact
with an ex-pupil of mine

376
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,167
who works as a repair man
inside the castle.

377
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,049
He's willing to help,

378
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,124
but he only knows when Heydrich
arrives in the morning

379
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,725
and when he leaves.

380
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,164
What good is that?

381
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,206
You can build a picture

382
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,805
of his routine.

383
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,010
Sometimes he travels with an armed
escort and sometimes he does not.

384
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,844
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

385
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,886
There is a safe house near the castle.

386
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,282
The repairman could drop off
the timetable every day before work.

387
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,327
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

388
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,606
Good.

389
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,807
And Jan and I will follow the route
from the chateau to the castle.

UNCLE HAJSKY: Gentlemen, this operation

391
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,408
will involve almost everyone
we have left in the resistance.

392
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,767
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

393
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,288
If you are arrested,
you will face some harsh facts.

394
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,522
There will be no escape.

395
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,570
You'll be tortured until you reveal
everything you know,

396
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,250
and then you will be executed.

397
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,327
You must protect your fellow comrades

398
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,528

any links you have to them.

If we can use a rope

then 30 seconds...

422

Even if a rope can stop the car,

we still need more than 30 seconds
to escape from here.

is to succeed. Yes?

over Czechoslovakia.

503
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,611
And when Heydrich took
over here last September,

504
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,610
his first order was to
execute all the prisoners.

505
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,810
My father was among 5,000 shot
in the first week by Heydrich.
