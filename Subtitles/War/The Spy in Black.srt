00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,099
- How long Long Hope? - An hour.

179
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:49,179
- They stop you there and telegraph.. - Thank you.

180
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:03,831
Distance there.

181
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,795
- From Telegraph? - You are. do you think?

182
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,473
- Six? - Six.

183
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,994
Basis.

184
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:18,367
- Buena travesía. - ¿Ud. cree, Walter?

185
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:23,043
For you. It is easy, stays on the bridge. And I?

186
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,406
It is a miracle that still make progress in this pileup.

187
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:31,527
When will we be in dry dock to look at the engine?

188
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,058
- I'll look. - I hope so.

189
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,094
- Is the new teacher? - Yup.

190
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,337
Go change. The other was called "the Merciless".

191
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,337
- Do you have the pass? - Yup.

192
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,147
I'm special agent. See?

193
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,744
"Police Orkney", during the war.

194
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,870
No up or down the dock without me knowing.

195
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,389
- ¿Sweetheart. Anne Burnett? - Sí.

196
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,234
It can happen.

197
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:59,834
My name is Bob Bratt. The pastor and his wife have come for her.

198
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,070
- Thank you. - The'll get it.

199
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:13,519
- Close the door. - Roger that.

200
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,999
Soy el Rvdo. Matthews. Mi mujer.

201
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,367
- Thanks for coming. - Welcome.

202
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,085
Probably prefer to stay at our house

203
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:25,090
- In school. - That's very kind, but ...

204
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:29,299
Thought it would be inappropriate for a girl so young to live alone.

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,661
- I can take care of myself. - My wife is a good housekeeper.

206
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:37,138
- The price is very reasonable. - I do not doubt.

207
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,220
I will discuss another time. Bye Bye.

208
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,546
- Bye Bye. - I'll show you the way.

209
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,067
- Close the door. - Roger that.

210
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:09,928
MINE FIELD

211
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:16,886
SUMERGIRSE A 15 METROS

212
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,613
- 15 meters. - 4 auxiliary flood.

213
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,578
4 auxiliary flood!

214
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,860
- Slow down. - Easy, sir.

215
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,378
Stop the pump. Shut auxiliary.

216
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,425
Stop the pump, close auxiliary!

217
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,064
SUMERGIRSE A 25 METROS

218
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:50,709
- 25 meters. - Flood fifths.

219
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,476
Fifths flood!

220
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,441
Stay 25 meters.

221
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:18,094
Hot? Fear makes you sweat, huh?

222
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:24,375
- We have touched something, have you heard? - No we would be telling.

223
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,712
We have spent.

224
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,596
The one that got the map the Iron Cross deserves.

225
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,148
Without it we would not have the wood.

226
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,519
Stop engine.

227
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,471
Stopping engines.

228
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,716
Do you hear something?

229
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:58,727
No, sir. Nothing.

230
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,406
- All right. I go. 10 meters. - 10 meters.

231
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:03,052
Suban el periscope.

232
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,332
- Prepárense to emerge. - ¡Prepárense to emerge!

233
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,094
- Ventilation closed. - Empty number ones.

234
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,383
- Empty numbers two and three. - Empty two and three.

235
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,985
8 m.

236
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,029
7...

237
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:30,863
- 5 ... - Stop empty. Stations!

238
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:47,645
- We review the details? - Do you think I'll forget?

239
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,158
To be sure. Ready? On top of the cliff?

240
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,564
- Northeast, surrounding rocks. - Then?

241
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,531
Follow telegraph poles. Search the road.

242
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,606
- At 5 km.? - Right.

243
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,416
At the fork, left.

244
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:05,935
- In the cairn? - Stop and look for the sign O-NO.

245
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,693
- ¿La mujer? - Fraulein Thiel.

246
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,502
- Moto ground. - Password?

247
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,584
I do not know what enchantment ...

248
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:19,619
- Why are they smiling? - I imagine him saying it to her.

249
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,907
If you are so funny, quédesela. Come on.

250
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:28,865
We see every day at this hour.

251
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,231
Yes, sir.

252
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:33,029
- Do you have everything? - Yup.

253
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,201
- Glasses? ¿Gun? - All.

254
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:37,836
Luck.

255
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,966
Who goes there?

256
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,814
- Agente Bob Bratt. - Pase.

257
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,326
A quiet night.

258
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,249
Hello there!

259
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,025
Turn off the light!

260
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,384
- Did you call? - What makes this light?

261
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,549
- I'm sorry. - Turn it off!

262
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:35,988
Yes I do.

263
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,594
- Did not read the rules? - No.

264
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:50,159
- Worse. He is a teacher! - Are you, Mr. Bratt.? I'm sorry.

265
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,198
It's okay.

266
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,203
I'm alone and the fleet here, I have to be vigilant.

267
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,888
A spy would give anything to get here, but it would catch.

268
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,085
- Good night. - Good night.

269
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:30,595
I do not know what spell makes me so sad.

270
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:35,553
An ancient legend duped me and not let me.

271
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:55,044
- What did the patrol? - They saw the light.

272
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,729
- He's alone. - Of course.

273
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,216
- Where does this door? - A kitchen.

274
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,911
- Does the ladder? - A room.

275
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:36,722
Butter!

276
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,687
What a shock.

277
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:46,808
Ud. es Fraulein Thiel.

278
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,489
Sí, capitán Hardt.

279
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:55,049
- Speak English, please. - What I like in English?

280
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:57,373
- Come in. - Thank you.

281
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:06,738
- How did you get here? - Demure look and fake passport.

282
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,791
Speak English like a native.

283
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:12,946
I have no choice. I am the teacher.

284
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,835
- 'Maestra! - Me llamo Anne Burnett.

285
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,671
- Llámeme así. - Anne Burnett.

286
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,597
Are you crazy? In uniform here?

287
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:28,764
Si muero, as will be official, not as spies.

288
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,408
As civil tengo in this defense.

289
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,807
Le ask apologies.

290
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:43,452
A whole ham, bread and butter.

291
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,888
- Butter! - Butter.

292
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,768
English has long passed strictures.

293
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:09,192
I did not know to be secret agent was so nice.

294
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,438
Have unpleasant moments.

295
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:16,155
Speaking of which, school starts the day after tomorrow.

296
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,355
- I do not know how I go. - Me neither.

297
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:27,799
In Germany no longer wear silk stockings.

298
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,286
I'll teach her room. He's upstairs.

299
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:36,926
- Do not know what I have to do. - I'll tell you tomorrow.

300
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,291
Tomorrow, no. Now!

301
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,851
What are your orders?

302
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:52,023
- Excuse me? - Your orders, Captain Hardt!

303
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:56,179
Presentarme a Fraulein Thiel y obedecerle.

304
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,107
Exactly! Pick up your bike and go to bed.

305
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:09,878
- I'm taking her to bed? - You can park in the laundry.

306
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:20,126
Forgiveness.

307
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,603
Good night.

308
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:36,572
Why encloses me?

309
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,057
- Come clean in the morning. - I can close.

310
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,341
It's safer that way.

311
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:03,537
- Can I come in? - Come in.

312
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,654
- Good Morning. - Good Morning.

313
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,817
Have breakfast in my room. The view is nice.

314
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:15,220
I have more important things to do than admire the view.

315
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,749
It's okay.

316
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:10,059
En fin. ¿El plan?

317
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,944
Sinking 15 of these ships.

318
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:16,546
How?

319
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:19,192
Will tell him.

320
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,793
Who is?

321
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:31,600
A British officer resentful. He was in command of a destroyer.

322
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:34,326
- I lost in an accident. - How?

323
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:36,803
An incorrect order. He had drunk.

324
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:41,010
Traitor and drunk, a pride for the British navy.

325
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:44,772
- Where did it happen? - In Cyprus.

326
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:49,896
- HMS Connaught. 16 February. - ¿Lo knew?

327
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:54,293
- Clear. The commander Ashington. - Lieutenant. They withdrew the vessel.

328
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:59,538
- Where did you meet her? - In Leith, a month ago.

329
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:03,218
- And she found it valuable. - Pretty.

330
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,822
- For who? - Germany.

331
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,502
Just to Germany?

332
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:11,826
And for me.

333
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:16,748
I guess I'll know.

334
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,716
Down in a minute.

335
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:24,272
Capitán Hardt.

336
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,002
Let's sit down and learn to know.

337
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:35,087
- Give a drink and relax. - I'd rather go to work.

338
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,449
Drink when you can is my motto.

339
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,888
Whenever you can concentrate on the job.

340
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,448
The Germans are all the same.

341
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,254
Close the curtains and take the maps. See if we started.

342
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:56,616
Three years we are helplessly in Keith ago.

343
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,428
- We face in Jutland. - And they have not gone further.

344
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:01,946
- You mean ... - Okay, we both win.

345
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,627
With the fleet around the corner,

346
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,867
and that the large fleet in Scapa watches,

347
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:12,874
- It is impossible to get to Ireland ... - I know. What is your plan?

348
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:19,796
Two squadrons of cruisers will sweep southward.

349
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,434
I know that too. It is routine.

350
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:28,087
Do not you give anything to know when, where and how?

351
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,007
- Do you know? - Save time, but get.

352
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:33,971
- Which squad? - The 1st and 5th.

353
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:35,854
The route?

354
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:42,057
Here it is, in pencil. East of Swona.

355
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,213
If we leave them to step ...

356
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,014
- En Sandwick Bay. - En Sandwick Bay,

357
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,704
- Would sink a few. - Exactly.

358
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,627
They could change the path, but I would warn.

359
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,706
- Who? - My brother. He is captain of flags.

360
00:35:00,954 --> 00:35:04,632
- And also ...? - No. Is fraternal confidence.

361
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,235
When will the operation take place?

362
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:14,354
Tomorrow. Past. It is not known. But I tell you.

363
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:17,997
We can not cease blocking an assumption.

364
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,127
It is not an assumption. Come out of the sea.

365
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,083
- The date? - I get it.

366
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:26,849
It would be the biggest defeat of the war.

367
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,693
So we agree?

368
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:33,449
I hope so.

369
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,018
- Until the next meeting. - Until the next meeting.

370
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,780
Pórtate them.

371
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:52,147
- Mr Ashington, what is your boat? - The old Warspite.

372
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:54,430
Did not go with the squad?

373
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,435
- They're fixing it, as always. - A shame.

374
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:05,917
Look children. When looking at this map, you see that our country

375
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:10,921
He is the protector of countries and bigger colonies.

376
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:14,406
I know I read in like but mi is the German public.

377
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,240
- I'm about to become British. - And how do I continue?

378
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,765
Talk of the empire where the sun never sets.

379
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,375
You have to explain it.

380
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:30,616
¿Va west of this al setback?

381
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,777
I worry. Sure children know.

382
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:41,224
Sure you can teach more important things.

383
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:44,862
How to penetrate an enclave as Gibraltar.

384
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,464
How to cheat British and German officers.

385
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:55,028
Things that are not taught in school.

386
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,919
That would be evening classes for adults.

387
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:02,280
It's night and I'm an adult.

388
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:04,362
But it's not my student.

389
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:13,124
What happened to Miss. Burnett?

390
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:17,654
- You know "Red Riding Hood"? - Beat well.

391
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,446
So this is different.

392
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:30,096
- Did you have an accident? - Exactly.

393
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:34,385
- Was this? - Obey orders in my service.

394
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:36,747
What a service!

395
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,621
Have you ever sunk a ship unarmed?

396
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,671
- It's different! - It's the same.

397
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:57,632
Why do I despise? Obey orders, like you.

398
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,036
We do not choose the missions.

399
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:04,568
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.

400
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,972
Where is the key?

401
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:13,494
Here.

402
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:17,930
Good night.

403
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,071
Thank you, children. Very pretty. Now you may go.

404
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,919
- Thank you very much. Good Morning. - Good Morning.

405
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:19,345
- Any news? - What I have. They start tomorrow.

406
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:20,863
- What time? - 7:00 a.m.

407
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,703
- No change? - No.

408
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,671
- Tonight is the meet. - Be ready for ten.

409
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,030
- Today? - Clear. Good job.

410
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:32,032
- What's wrong here? - Fraulein Thiel's coming with me.

411
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:42,195
- I'm the Reverend. Hector Mathews. - Oh yeah? I mean, how are you?

412
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:46,281
You. Forgive. I'm John Harris. I'm looking for the school.

413
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,964
- What's it going? -. Ms. Burnett is my fiancee.

414
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:52,045
I did not know he had intercourse with the Episcopal Church.

415
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,409
Soon will.

416
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:58,173
If you are going to stay on the island could stay at my residence.

417
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:02,049
- It will save good money. - Appreciate it.

418
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,454
- And bring your fiancee to dinner. - Okay ...

419
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:09,334
If I get your coupons meat, we will prepare a roast.

420
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:13,057
- The carry in my pocket but ... - Let me.

421
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,184
At 7:30 o'clock.

422
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,629
- Ud. querrá to stay. - ¿Y matter what? See you in ...

423
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:26,631
- I only see one thing: orders. - Where are they?

424
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:28,632
- Here. - What do you mean there?

425
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,678
What are those orders?

426
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:33,311
Once you complete mission. Has boarding.

427
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:35,675
- Once completed? - That's it.

428
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:38,122
What has been completed?

429
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:43,081
Without their submarines find our squad?

430
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,765
- He's right. - No two ways about it.

431
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,822
I'll pass the message to Schuster. We leave tomorrow night.

432
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:02,820
That already makes more sense.

433
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:05,264
- Who is it? - It is not closed.

434
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,788
I'm so sorry. Guess I will have another room.

435
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:15,429
Come in.

436
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,389
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.

437
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,386
- It is difficult to find a room. - Pretty.

438
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,995
- Íbamos to have tea. - You are welcome.

439
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,553
Thanks but came to find my fiancee, Miss. Burnett.

440
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:29,316
- Are you here? - Milk and sugar?

441
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,477
- Very friendly. - Let me help you.

442
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:34,003
I appreciate that. It weighs a little.

443
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,083
- How are you? - Sit.

444
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,561
Thank you.

445
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:44,131
I should warn that I have come, right?

446
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,606
- Your tea. - Thank you.

447
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,332
I'll give it a voice.

448
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:56,179
Here we do not like the voice rises.

449
00:42:58,426 --> 00:42:59,940
As you wish ...

450
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:05,110
You'll be surprised to find me here, right?

451
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,467
- Tart? - No thanks.

452
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:13,434
I brought this gramophone, and lots of new albums.

453
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:19,120
Do you know the "March of the Soldier"?

454
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:24,040
It's big, but has a lovely sound.

455
00:43:42,058 --> 00:43:45,257
I do not recognize this band of metal.

456
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,621
- What is it? - The Iron Cross, second class.

457
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:54,062
¿Second class? Are you. Prisoner of war?

458
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,423
Yo no. Ud. sí.

459
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,265
OMG.

460
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:06,348
They have not arrived!

461
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:10,307
In times of war, being late is a criminal waste.

462
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,995
- The meat will burn. - I bring.

463
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:15,357
I will not wait more.

464
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:20,638
Rev. disappoint me. Harris.

465
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:24,720
Bless these foods that we are going to take. Amen.

466
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:35,093
- Son macaroni. - I think you owe me an Expli ...

467
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:48,105
- Wait to come back here. - Why?

468
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,702
- 'Stay here! - Those hurry.

469
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,926
- Who is it? - The Rev.. Matthews and his wife.

470
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,294
Excuse me.

471
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,897
- Good night. - A dreadful night for visitors.

472
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:46,459
Social obligations are before time.

473
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:50,591
- It's a compliment. - It's not. We waited an hour.

474
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,944
- Out? - A table.

475
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,514
- At the table? - Exactly.

476
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:58,512
- He's upset about the meat. - There is nothing material.

477
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:03,198
If you., And Rev.. they could not come, should have sent a message.

478
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:06,959
- Do we expect? - Do not you got the invitation?

479
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:11,006
- I'm afraid not. - I'm surprised not to tell.

480
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,727
- But it's true. - Strange.

481
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:16,406
If it were your fiance, to see her after so long,

482
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:19,725
- I forget everything. - Do you have an explanation?

483
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:22,933
- When he arrived, he suffered a stroke. - Attack?

484
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:25,692
Yes, it was suffocating. He could not speak.

485
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,215
Are you sick? What a relief.

486
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:32,458
I booked a room and did not understand her not to come.

487
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,014
He's gone to bed an hour ago.

488
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:37,701
- It is the most sensible. - An embarrassing situation.

489
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:41,539
Ms.. Matthews should stay tonight.

490
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,704
- It should? - There's no need.

491
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:48,026
As Reverend, I say that your position ...

492
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:50,836
- What future wife? - People might talk.

493
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:53,911
In time of war? Do not worry about me.

494
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,200
My conscience calls me talk to the Reverend. Harris.

495
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:02,757
I will not bother to satisfy his conscience.

496
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:04,246
Good night.

497
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:08,038
But ... ¿Me is challenging?

498
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,765
Not at all. But in my house decide.

499
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:14,484
We'll see what you think the Education Committee.

500
00:47:14,654 --> 00:47:16,213
- Bye Bye. - Bye Bye.

501
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:20,291
I understand, but his conscience bothered him all night. Bye Bye.

502
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:23,697
- Good night. - Good night.

503
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:38,461
¿Sandwick Bay? What a journey!

504
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:40,584
- At 2 h. will be there. - I hope so.

505
00:47:41,874 --> 00:47:45,074
Te are 15 submarines in order to spend a ni torpedo.

506
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,878
- All right. - We could sink a few.

507
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,235
Tomorrow will come and pick us up.

508
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,395
Yes, sir. Too bad the battle is lost

509
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:56,318
- For that woman. - It's not your business.

510
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:08,650
- Good luck! - Thank you.

511
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:16,538
- Schuster! - Sir?

512
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,134
I almost forgot.

513
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:21,579
- What is it? - Butter.

514
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,268
- I'm sorry. - Come on.

515
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:07,968
- Did you send the message? - He's on his way.

516
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,529
Often cold. I'm in bad shape.

517
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,090
I was left sitting in the bushes.

518
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:16,222
I do not usually entertain British officials

519
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:18,615
however helpful they have been.

520
00:49:18,786 --> 00:49:22,542
- How does it feel to make history? - I prepare a hot coffee.

521
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:26,750
It has been an exhausting night, you would be better going to bed.

522
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:32,475
To you. Still has some way, why do not you give an example?

523
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,716
A little touch, do not you see that we want to be together?

524
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:40,033
In the hours of the day will be. If you are wondering Where you walk.

525
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:43,318
- I'll have another drink. - Certainly.

526
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,083
Tomorrow have all day to say goodbye.

527
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,931
Good night.

528
00:49:56,894 --> 00:50:01,175
- Do not stop until he gets it. - Sleep well.

529
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:10,415
Much better.

530
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:13,384
- Not given choice. - He leaves happy.

531
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:16,620
Take your whiskey and is convinced her love for him.

532
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:18,741
In a minute I'm going to bed.

533
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,426
No, no. I want to talk to you. And make that coffee.

534
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:24,269
It's 4:00. We'll talk tomorrow.

535
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:27,752
Tomorrow? We will not have another chance like this.

536
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,636
The work is done.

537
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:33,760
In one hour the submarines are waiting and two attack.

538
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,762
And in a week, you., And I will be in Kiel,

539
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,161

540
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:42,923
Then on to Berlin. I see us eating at the Hotel Adlon.

541
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:47,609
Will the Iron Cross in your bag and be the only girl in Berlin

542
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,604

543
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,728
I'm going to bed.

544
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:59,894
I have served many commanders and not admire none to you.

545
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,340
- What will you do back home? -. Has told you.

546
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:06,975
- Travel to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. - And after Berlin?

547
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:10,141
Jobs. Another island. Another Ashington.

548
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:12,618
And another captain Hardt?

549
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,947
Perhaps. Let me pass.

550
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:21,069
Commander Thiel, just to get a win.

551
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:24,715
A good commander is to celebrate with his men.

552
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:27,713
If I'm in charge, I order you to let me pass.

553
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,820
David.

554
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:56,668
Jill.

555
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:04,153
- They have been horrible 10 minutes. - And for me.

556
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:07,874
- Now it's all over. - Yes, dear.

557
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:16,037
Who would think to go out without a coat?

558
00:54:16,605 --> 00:54:18,562
Do not run these risks.

559
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,647
- Where is he? - Upstairs in his room.

560
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,880
You are amazing.

561
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,010
Lord.

562
00:54:31,376 --> 00:54:32,810
Agente Bob Pratt, señor.

563
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,128
- Who I am? - Commander Blacklock.

564
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:38,134
When the patrol arrives wait for the signal.

565
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,132
- Where is your bracelet? - I saved it in the pocket

566
00:54:42,304 --> 00:54:44,614
for if there were German spies.

567
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:47,586
- Keep your eyes open. - Yes, sir.

568
00:54:55,473 --> 00:54:58,434
David, you do not arrestarás until I'm gone, right?

569
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:02,113
Trust us. For now it's all right here.

570
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:04,874
Déjalo volver a su boat for that fight.

571
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,002
You might find out who the real Thiel and Ashington.

572
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,723
- You hear that? - What is it?

573
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:14,559
The flotilla of destroyers.

574
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,689
They have been carrying bombs all night.

575
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:23,411
Within hours, they will not be underwater in Sandwick Bay,

576
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:28,046
only a few grease stains adrift.

577
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:40,820
- I'm getting dizzy. - Here.

578
00:55:41,707 --> 00:55:43,381
Drink this.

579
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:50,786
You'll make history.

580
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:56,950
Ya lo sé.

581
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:02,160
Go get your stuff and go directly to St. Magnus,

582
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,315
leave in an hour.

583
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:09,526
Nothing is mine. Everything is Anne Burnett.

584
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:11,766
Well, come on.

585
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:27,254
- I'll bring the detainee half an hour. - Yes, sir.

586
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:30,103
Do not want the hassle we save him?

587
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:33,257
No. I have personal reasons to do so.

588
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,329
Take care of her.

589
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:43,963
I'll be on the bridge. You can use my cabin.

590
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,524
- Very friendly. - It's small, but cozy.

591
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:50,054
- It's all yours. - Thank you.

592
00:56:55,302 --> 00:56:57,055
Okay ...

593
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:04,423
Walter, oiga.

594
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:08,949
If the me of a day in dry dock, you will lose one whole week.

595
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:12,231
- We'll see. - I hope so.

596
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:13,748
Forgive.

597
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:18,469
Pastor! Stay in school.

598
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,872
- Poor. - To the Rescue! Bye Bye.

599
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:26,957
- You will be careful, right? - Silly.

600
00:57:30,568 --> 00:57:34,040
- All present. - Thank you.

601
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:36,890
- Go behind. - You guys.

602
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:40,570
Monitor the window, but without seeing them.

603
00:57:40,895 --> 00:57:44,095
Two for the Road. The rest, in front of the house.

604
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,581
Stay here. The rest with me.

605
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:52,063
- ¿In the shoot? - No.

606
00:57:52,624 --> 00:57:55,698
There is a pastor in school. Let go and wait for me.

607
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,982
He will be angry. Stay here.

608
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:18,272
Capitán Hardt, soy el comandante Blacklock.

609
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:27,484
If you surrender, we will treat as a POW.

610
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,004
If not, we will kill him.

611
00:58:29,491 --> 00:58:31,643
- No one at school. - What?

612
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,091
¡Suéltenlo!

613
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:50,779
DO LEVEL IN STROMNESS

614
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,508
Drop moorings!

615
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:59,070
- Wait. Comes a passenger. - Yes, sir.

616
00:59:03,116 --> 00:59:06,235
Mr. Harris, I'll tell the commander that has embarked.

617
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,085
If all fue as predicted,

618
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:21,123
Why I have not seen the Rev.. Harris?

619
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:25,969
We tied him in school because he was a nuisance.

620
00:59:26,573 --> 00:59:28,770
Was lucky not to suffer the same fate.

621
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:33,375
- Blacklock would not have hesitated. - I can not understand.

622
00:59:33,538 --> 00:59:37,534
I will help. The Germans tried to kill Anne Burnett

623
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:40,501
to put in place a spy. Fortunately, they failed.

624
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:45,335
The shot of a cliff, but patrol boat rescued.

625
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:49,779
With your help, we arrested the spy in Thurso.

626
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:53,306
Then we replace with a counter-spy.

627
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:57,831
A trial, we found a brave volunteer,

628
00:59:58,276 --> 01:00:00,712
the you. known as Anne Burnett.

629
01:00:00,878 --> 01:00:05,113
The Anne Burnett school is not the teacher,

630
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:08,595
Anne Burnett or German.

631
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:11,838
- It's no Anne Burnett. - Correct.

632
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:16,606
- Who is it? - That's a military secret.

633
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:25,054
- What, Blacklock? - Hardt has escaped.

634
01:00:25,216 --> 01:00:27,857
- The German? - Harris wears clothes.

635
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:29,168
Excuse me.

636
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,534
Communication! Advise all patrols of the island.

637
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:35,815
No escape.

638
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:06,886
Now loading!

639
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
Stop!

640
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,607
All in single file.

641
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:23,135
One by one. So no.

642
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:37,062
They are put there.

643
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,948
Here's all, sir.

644
01:01:40,512 --> 01:01:43,267
Eight German prisoners starved.

645
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:45,068
Do they come from a submarine?

646
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:48,469
They ran into one of its mines.

647
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,197
One of his ...?

648
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,473
- Do you think you are funny? - You can not.

649
01:01:59,726 --> 01:02:02,037
Right, march!

650
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,282
Have not you heard?

651
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,123
I do not understand.

652
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,444
It's like talking to rag dolls.

653
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:13,655
Well, stay calm, mackerel depressing.

654
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:19,213
- What do I do with them? - Distribute them from stem to stern.

655
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,579
¡Dating!

656
01:02:23,904 --> 01:02:26,784
- Yes, sir. - Them coffee.

657
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,896
Poor.

658
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:37,228
- ¡Walter! - ¿James?

659
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:40,945
I am not superstitious, but I do not like.

660
01:02:41,116 --> 01:02:43,074
Take care of the engine and the boat.

661
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:46,232
No let me take care of the engine.

662
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,600
Fix attempt six weeks ago.

663
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:54,922
I do not like those Germans. Unlucky.

664
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:58,048
They could go in the St. Ninian with the other prisoners.

665
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:01,203
It goes full. They will not give us problems.

666
01:03:01,972 --> 01:03:04,727
4 in the castle and 4 in the chamber,

667
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:09,334
a sentinel for four. No one can reach them.

668
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:13,613
Ya. A ver.

669
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,679
Too young.

670
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:51,321
- Father, only speak German. - Shut up or die.

671
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:55,282
Captain Hardt. Taking command of the ship.

672
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:57,808
Take care of the crew. Come on!

673
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:17,865
His successor has been delayed.

674
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:29,227
No sausages. It's what you eat, right?

675
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,319
- The Germans! - Stop!

676
01:04:53,534 --> 01:04:55,730
The down there!

677
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:58,734
¡Doddie!

678
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:08,699
¡Doddie!

679
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:10,738
Give me the pistol.

680
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,101
- Out of my bridge! - Pull the gun.

681
01:05:17,431 --> 01:05:21,427
-. You're my prisoner. - Get out of here or I'll shoot!

682
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:23,473
Do not move.

683
01:05:23,996 --> 01:05:26,796
- Your boat is in my hands. - Who are you.?

684
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:29,428
- I'm a German officer. - With those clothes?

685
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,560
At the moment, yes. Where is the radio?

686
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:35,603
- No. - Do not have a radio?

687
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:38,441
He did not leave the house no German.

688
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,958
The patrol took over, and there were nine.

689
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:44,168
Not suspected Shepherd on the dock?

690
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:48,088
He embarked in the last minute. I gave him your message.

691
01:05:48,254 --> 01:05:50,929
- I he said. - Thank you, Bob.

692
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:55,297
- Give credit Hardt ... - I give you for being so expensive.

693
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,133
You can not escape.

694
01:05:57,981 --> 01:06:00,292
Communication. To Scrabster and Thurso.

695
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:03,377
"Arresting officer disguised as a German shepherd. Stop".

696
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:05,697
To all the patrols.

697
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:09,145
"Forcing St. Magnus to turn and wait destroyer."

698
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:17,353
Drop. Attention.

699
01:06:20,718 --> 01:06:22,870
- I need two men. - Very well.

700
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,997
Keep an eye on the crew and passengers.

701
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:28,474
To monitor crew and passengers! Come with me.

702
01:06:31,246 --> 01:06:34,240
Stay calm. Let's take a look.

703
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,920
Out.

704
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,815
- How did he escape? - Thank you.

705
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:49,210
Feelings lose women, Fraulein Thiel.

706
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:52,020
- ¿O Anne Burnett? - ¡Sra. Blacklock!

707
01:06:53,062 --> 01:06:56,853
He kept his secret well. How thoughtful.

708
01:06:57,145 --> 01:06:58,579
What will you do with the boat?

709
01:06:58,786 --> 01:07:01,302
Head for the submarines will Sandwick.

710
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:03,745
- You can not! - I'm not under his command.

711
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,949
- It is full of mines. - We have to take the risk.

712
01:07:07,112 --> 01:07:11,154
- It's not just about us. - This is the life of my classmates!

713
01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:15,152
- There are children and women on board. - If you die is up to you.

714
01:07:15,438 --> 01:07:17,715
It is war. Do not forget, like I did.

715
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,681
- We are enemies. - I prefer.

716
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:23,444
Me too. This is more simple.

717
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:25,685
Come on.

718
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,088
- New route: this. - Yup.

719
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:43,938
Now what?

720
01:07:57,189 --> 01:08:00,308
Listen. They are prisoners of war.

721
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:03,142
I do not want noise and panic.

722
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:06,504
Whoever disobeys orders will die.

723
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,990
With one exception.

724
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:19,562
- Be quiet! - Easy.

725
01:08:19,806 --> 01:08:24,405
A19, A24, A7 have been to St. Magnus. Follow your route.

726
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:27,205
There are eight Germans.

727
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:31,532
- You should go home. - Thank you.

728
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:35,926
Si se unen a Hardt...

729
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:40,499
- A17 message. - They have not seen. Is delayed.

730
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:45,102
He changed his route between A7 and A17.

731
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,583
Sandwick Bay.

732
01:08:50,988 --> 01:08:53,299
My wife is on board.

733
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,825
- Auxiliary. - Mr.

734
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:57,712
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.

735
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,113
I'm sorry. You will have to forget personal matters.

736
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,713
Sir?

737
01:09:08,921 --> 01:09:12,917
The Germans are aimed at Sandwick Bay in St. Magnus.

738
01:09:13,244 --> 01:09:15,919
Blacklock will teach your route possible.

739
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:18,962
It goes by Seitha Wound to cut him off.

740
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:22,244
- You have to sink? - If you do not give up.

741
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,260
Captain!

742
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:39,656
Captain!

743
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:47,227
- Walter, are you there? - What?

744
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:52,428
In this we follow the speed.

745
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:55,870
Kill the bearings.

746
01:09:56,837 --> 01:10:00,468
Much effort for engines. I do not know how to endure.

747
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,760
- Where are we going? - To the east.

748
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:07,397
Soon we will leave British waters.

749
01:10:07,564 --> 01:10:10,205
- We depend on providence. - Do not,

750
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:12,882
someone who despises your life and theirs.

751
01:10:13,048 --> 01:10:16,680
It is my fault. Forget that we were at war,

752
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:20,210
which kills any human feeling.

753
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:40,382
- Can you go faster? - It's the most.

754
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,964
The old man is deaf or dumb. Or pursued by a submarine.

755
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,131
Out.

756
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,007
Out!

757
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,330
We should see it anymore.

758
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,811
- Have they changed course. - I think not.

759
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:44,908
Look, Felix. Not the St. Magnus?

760
01:11:48,118 --> 01:11:51,431
It is. What do you do here?

761
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:53,675
- Sospechoso. - Would chupado.

762
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:56,719
We can not spend the torpedoes.

763
01:11:57,726 --> 01:12:00,606
But a pair of shells together.

764
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,442
Prepárense to emerge.

765
01:12:04,931 --> 01:12:07,367
On your marks. Objective: steamship.

766
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:30,060
Quite the bandera inglesa.

767
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:46,470
¡El U29!

768
01:12:49,404 --> 01:12:52,318
¡Schuster! ¡Schuster!

769
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:58,965
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

770
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:04,851
¡Soy yo, Hardt!

771
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:19,662
Someone makes us signals.

772
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,818
H - A

773
01:13:22,228 --> 01:13:23,228
Fire!

774
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,157
They opened fire after that point.

775
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:45,482
We should take a look. Change of address.

776
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:00,653
Lifeguards catch floats.

777
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,732
Stay calm.

778
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,258
A lifeboat!

779
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:25,511
Keep calm and put on the floats.

780
01:14:27,356 --> 01:14:31,192
Donald, stop what you're doing and go up. Hurry.

781
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,329
There it is.

782
01:14:50,293 --> 01:14:51,612
Take out the cannons.

783
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:59,411
- Do not shoot, it's sinking. - They go to the boats.

784
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,614
Look, a destroyer!

785
01:15:04,663 --> 01:15:06,097
Immersion!

786
01:15:06,344 --> 01:15:10,101
He bombed a submarine. 's Shoot.

787
01:15:16,572 --> 01:15:17,767
Objective: submarine.

788
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:23,768
Loading launched deep!

789
01:16:12,253 --> 01:16:13,926
TURN OFF ENGINE

790
01:16:23,821 --> 01:16:26,337
- Dispersaos. - Sin Ud. no.

791
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:29,737
That's an order!

792
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:34,021
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.

793
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:43,667
My own submarine sank us.

794
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:53,911
Venga, Miss. Fast.

795
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,560
Why are you here? It should also go.

796
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:03,688
If you do not mind, I'd rather stay.

797
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,962
As you. Want.

798
01:17:07,854 --> 01:17:10,768
Captain, do you have a cigarette?

799
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,568
No, but a pipe.

800
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:17,210
- No smoke a pipe. - A poco late to learn.

801
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:55,923
It's there. I see.
