1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Western Poland, 1932

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
INVINCIBLE

3
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,001
INVINCIBLE
(based on real-life events)

4
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:53,978
It was in a country far away.
I don't know which one.

5
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,021
But it was a distant land.

6
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:57,978
A prince lost his mind
and imagined himself...

7
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:02,183
- ...to be a rooster.
- A rooster? Like this one?

8
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:06,378
Yes. He took refuge
under the dining-room table...

9
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:11,220
...striped naked, and refused
to eat anything but grain.

10
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,377
- And then?
- The King called in magicians and doctors...

11
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:18,014
...to cure his son,
but to no avail.

12
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,777
One day, an unknown sage
arrived, took off his clothes...

13
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:27,864
...and joined the prince under the table,
saying he too was a rooster.

14
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:32,058
Eventually, the sage convinced
the prince to get dressed.

15
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,058
And finally to sit down and eat
with the others. "Don't ever think"...

16
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,101
...said the sage, "...that by
eating like...

17
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:40,058
...a man, with other|men at the table...

18
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,057
...a rooster ceases to
be what he is."

19
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,380
"You can do anything with...

20
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,616
...men in their world.
Or even for them."

21
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,844
"And yet remain the
rooster that your are."

22
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,983
I'm so proud of you, Benjamin.

23
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,978
Such young little fellow, and 
brighter than all the adults.

24
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,977
Guess what?
I have some money.

25
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:01,842
How would you like to
eat in a restaurant?

26
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,419
A restaurant?
Really?

27
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,381
What do you think
about her and me, huh?

28
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,138
- You'd be fine.
- Yeah, it's true!

29
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,643
Miss? Miss!

30
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,822
She has nice tits,
and a fine ass.

31
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:21,382
- I wouldn't say no to sleeping with her.
- Miss!

32
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,301
Miss, miss!

33
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,401
Hey, miss! Where the hell are
the...

34
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,058
...girls in this stinking
place, huh?

35
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,643
Could I have another one, please?

36
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,981
Hey, fatty!
You should watch your weight.

37
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:55,978
Or soon you'll be wider than
you're tall. Like a potato.

38
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:58,977
Like a stuffed pig!

39
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,177
Hey, fatty!
What's your name?

40
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:06,943
He's not fat!
He's my brother and he's strong.

41
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm a blacksmith. My name
is Zishe. Zishe Breitbart.

42
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:19,457
Hey, fatty!
I'm talking to you.

43
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,296
Our fatty is a jew.

44
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:26,297
A big fat jew.

45
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:29,218
A fat one, and a thin one.

46
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:34,218
The fat jew eats too much,
and the thin jew not enough.

47
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:37,103
Hey, fatty! Why doesn't...

48
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,902
...the little one
eat anything, huh?

49
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,964
You should eat more,
like your fat brother.

50
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,944
Good idea.

51
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,983
You're too thin.

52
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:51,663
- The thick and the thin...
- ...together through thick and thin.

53
00:05:57,145 --> 00:06:00,262
- Open your mouth!
- And eat!

54
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,661
Hey!

55
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,021
Hey!

56
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,803
You will pay me for this!
Have you an idea...

57
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,061
... how much beer that was?
One hectolitre.

58
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:35,298
And do you know how much a barrel costs?
And how much that table costs?

59
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,580
It wasn't his fault,
the others started it!

60
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,776
As for the money,
I'd like to pay.

61
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes, we'd really like to pay for
this, but we don't have any money.

62
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:46,123
What I should do
is call the police.

63
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,381
But I think there's a way
for you to pay for the damage.

64
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:52,378
The circus is in town.
Outside, by the gate.

65
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:56,378
There's a famous "strongman".
And there's prize money to be won...

66
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,535
...for the man who can beat him!

67
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,141
Ladies and Gentlemen,
dear children!

68
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:09,157
I would like to announce that our
Hercules has a challenger!

69
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:12,681
A strong young man, without doubt.

70
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,417
But in more than 20 years...

71
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,015
...our Hercules,
our Colossus of Rhodes...

72
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,982
...has never been defeated.

73
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:32,977
For years we have been
raising the prize...

74
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:37,494
...to the amount of 5.000 Zloty
for any man...

75
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:43,216
...who proves himself stronger.
Not without reason...

76
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:47,776
...the ancients have proclaimed
the Colossus of Rhodes...

77
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:52,222
...one of the 7
Wonders of the World!

78
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:16,760
And now, highly esteemed audience...

79
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:19,656
...his challenger this evening:

80
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:23,974
Zishe Breitbart!
Blacksmith from this town.

81
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,937
I can do more!
I can do more!

82
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:05,378
Yitzak, come! There's a visitor.
A real gentleman.

83
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:09,458
- What does he want?
- I don't know. He arrived in a motorcar.

84
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:14,300
And, oh my God, I have
nothing to offer him.

85
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:29,777
Landwehr. Alfred Landwehr.

86
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,760
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Breitbart.

87
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:35,656
And this is your strong son.

88
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,583
- Please! Sit down!
- Thank you.

89
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,339
I'm an agent for variety artists.

90
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,774
Dancers, chucklers, magicians.

91
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:56,541
Everything that is in demand.
And the demand in Berlin is enormous.

92
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,600
I possess an instinct for
great talents.

93
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,575
For people who will go
straight to the top.

94
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,578
I was at the circus yesterday to
see the local strongman, when your son--

95
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,621
You need not go on.
We are respectable people.

96
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,578
For a jew this is not
the right thing.

97
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,453
But the most gifted people
in cinema, in theatre and art are.

98
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:18,982
I never even thought about leaving.
I belong in this smithy...

99
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,581
- ...in our little Shtetl.
- You see, our jewish Shtetls...

100
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,725
...are like holy
books, open...

101
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:28,785
...to the eyes of God. And the
Day of the Torment...

102
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,823
...even the fish tremble
in the brook.

103
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:36,780
In spring, during Passover,
the trees rejoice.

104
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,978
Sir... you're like a shopkeeper,
with empty shelves.

105
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,262
With nothing to sell.

106
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,935
Son... you'll have
to attend university!

107
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,280
You've said that beautifully...

108
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,856
...really.

109
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:58,217
Do you know how old the
boy is? 9!

110
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:02,440
This little fellow
is just 9 years old.

111
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,336
And to think that this
is my brother, Benjamin.

112
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:09,139
Look at what an incredible
boy my brother is.

113
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:20,458
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Are you all right?

114
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,503
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine! Me too.

115
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:32,378
Good morning, Mr. Landwehr!
We've just been talking about you.

116
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:35,042
Did you sleep in the motorcar?

117
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:37,619
There isn't even a hotel
around here to spend the night.

118
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:42,493
- Good morning. Mornin'. Mornin'.
- You are an exceptional man.

119
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:45,083
I am, when i'm after
an exceptional talent.

120
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,302
Zishe, listen!

121
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:50,121
I want you to come with
me just for the day!

122
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,157
I have something to show you.

123
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:57,063
- But i can't leave. I must work.
- Your father...

124
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,101
...would excuse you
for an afternoon, huh?

125
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:01,058
My son is able to make up his
own mind...

126
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,624
...about such things.

127
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,103
You'll be most interested to see
what i'm going to show you.

128
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:42,760
Look Zishe, look
at all the motorcars!

129
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,735
There must be every motorcar
in the whole world...

130
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:47,902
...right in Berlin!

131
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,740
More than motorcars, young man.
Watch what's coming.

132
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,618
That's a flying machine!
I've read about it.

133
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:06,443
Look at how many
people it can carry.

134
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:11,298
Aeroplanes will never compete
against that.

135
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:36,101
Benjamin!

136
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,537
- Benjamin, wake up!
- I am awake!

137
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:45,137
- I've been thinking.
- So have I.

138
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,120
Do you believe God gives to
each of us a gift?

139
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,976
Of course.

140
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,984
God made me strong,
Benjamin. Don't you think...

141
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,703
...that he made me strong
for a reason?

142
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:06,620
A blacksmith needs to be strong.

143
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:11,460
But I am stronger than a
blacksmith needs to be.

144
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:16,621
Sometimes we don't understand
why God does what He does.

145
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:23,537
This is what I must find out.

146
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,904
- Zishe?
- What? Tell me.

147
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:35,744
The Book of Prophets says:
"Spare me...

148
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:39,744
...that i may recover strength,
before i go hence...

149
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,936
...and be no more.
And be no more."

150
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,501
- And?
- And, what?

151
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,977
- What do you think about it?
- About what?

152
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,004
Berlin.

153
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,944
Let me talk to the
Rabbi first.

154
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,378
But before anything, we have to
celebrate Passover.

155
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,821
But...

156
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:21,220
Children, when we fled Egypt,
we didn't...

157
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:23,456
...have time for the
bread to rise.

158
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:27,458
Hannah? What happened
when we came to the sea?

159
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:30,901
- Hashem opened the seas.
- Yes, he did!

160
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:34,841
And, Raffael? How many
years did we stay in the desert?

161
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,328
Forty.

162
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:39,343
Yes. All right.

163
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,822
- Search for it!
- Yes!

164
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:57,661
Where is it?

165
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,977
It must be somewhere.

166
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,214
Maybe under the pillow.
Hannele found it!

167
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:16,217
- Wonderful!
- Hannele found it!

168
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,775
- She has found it.
- Very well!

169
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,821
Wonderful!

170
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,977
- How much do you want for it?
- 6 Zloty.

171
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,583
No, that's too much!

172
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,439
Yes...

173
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,214
- 6!
- Yes.

174
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:38,981
I want to thank the Allmighty
for my good wife, and my children.

175
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:43,661
You are the salt of earth.
And you fill my heart with joy.

176
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,959
Today, I want to thank
God in particular...

177
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,054
...for my strong firstborn.

178
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:55,663
Zishe, my son! You will
go out into the World...

179
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,977
...but don't ever forget
who you are!

180
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,503
Hold on! Hold on!

181
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:41,783
I've travelled very far. I've been as
far as Vilna. But a thing like this...

182
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,821
...a thing like this i've
never seen before.

183
00:21:43,822 --> 00:21:45,778
Can you give me a ride?

184
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:50,620
- Where can we take you?
- You're not going to Berlin, by any chance?

185
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,977
- Are you hungry?
- All the time.

186
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,977
My mother has never been
able to feed me enough.

187
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:10,263
And you want to walk
all the way to Berlin?

188
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:15,616
Yes. I have a ticket for
the train, first class.

189
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:20,679
But i'm going to return the ticket, and
my mother will get a new dress instead.

190
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:24,778
I've heard there are
many pretty girls in Berlin.

191
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,222
Girls like you won't find in
the country. Maybe you'll meet one.

192
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:32,854
I have already, sort of.
In a dream.

193
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:38,138
But I couldn't see her face, because...
I know it sounds strange...

194
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:43,140
...but there was so much light.
I think she was a princess.

195
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:21,058
You didn't come specially for me?
How did you know?

196
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:23,722
Your reputation is
faster than your feet.

197
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,299
My name is Delilah.

198
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:30,023
Better take care, Samson!

199
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,300
Berlin, May 1932

200
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,982
It's me, Zishe!
Zishe Breitbart!

201
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:07,095
You want to talk to Mr. Landwehr?

202
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:10,780
Are you still there?
Hello? Hello?

203
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:14,823
- Speak please.
- What?

204
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:18,977
- Please speak.
- Yes!

205
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:21,977
- Where are you?
- In Berlin.

206
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:24,080
Come and see us at once.
Mr. Landwehr...

207
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:27,095
...is expecting you. We
thought you were lost.

208
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,896
A girl you say.

209
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,021
And she wanted to marry
you at once?

210
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,978
Well, actually no.

211
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:41,204
She just wanted to keep me.

212
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,343
Don't just stand there,
have a seat.

213
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,381
Thank you.

214
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:53,781
You realize, that the possibilities
to employ you are...

215
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:57,494
- ...somewhat limited.
- Yes? What do you mean by that?

216
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:01,821
No, no, don't be afraid!

217
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:07,859
I'm good at the work i do.
The best, if i may say so.

218
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:13,776
I'm going to employ you in an
establishment called...

219
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,857
..."Hanussen's Palace
of the Occult".

220
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:21,978
I don't quite understand.
What am i supposed to do there?

221
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:26,377
I've talked to Hanussen, and he
was immediately pleased with my idea.

222
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:30,378
Hanussen has understood something
about the insecurity of our times.

223
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,723
Inflation, unemployment,
mass strikes...

224
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,981
...attempted coups, bank rushes.

225
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:38,978
People long for a
strong man, a leader.

226
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:42,978
And Hanussen is the clairvoyant,
the prophet of this longing.

227
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,977
And what does that have
to do with me?

228
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:51,703
I can tell you! You will be
a kind of contrasting program:

229
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:55,041
The strenght of the body,
against the...

230
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:57,698
...dark powers of the
spirit of the occult.

231
00:26:57,785 --> 00:27:00,861
And i have to point out to you
right now that you...

232
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:03,337
...must play a certain game.

233
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,701
I can't do that.
I'm strong, that's all.

234
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:11,743
I don't demand anything else from you.
And furthermore, you'll keep your mouth shut!

235
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:15,058
I'll meet with tomorrow
at Hanussen's.

236
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,615
Dismissed!

237
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:23,905
PALACE OF THE OCCULT

238
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:31,901
No, impossible!

239
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,537
What if he carries a weapon,
pearhaps a spear?

240
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:39,538
No, he shouldn't look like
some primitive man.

241
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,043
Someone from primordial times.

242
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:45,461
That's my demand.
Take it off!

243
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:49,504
Take it off! I hope you're all
in for the dark instincts.

244
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:55,358
How about a Greek or a Roman?
You know, a gladiator?

245
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:02,663
Turn! Turn around!

246
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:07,855
Pearhaps for the first act.

247
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,320
After the break
he can be dressed as...

248
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,176
...some kind of
heroic figure.

249
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,042
How's "Zishe, The Strong"?

250
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,860
By no means! The jewish name
must go at once!

251
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,456
You see, my boy... my public
consists of film stars.

252
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:27,742
Above all, followers
of the National Socialists.

253
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:31,653
Big shots of the party.

254
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,023
We will aryanize you.

255
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:45,979
A jew should never
be as strong as you.

256
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,975
The new act!

257
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:41,378
- Yes, i'm the strong man.
- I'm the magician here.

258
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,320
You don't look like a magician.

259
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,376
Oh, indeed?
Well, then watch!

260
00:30:55,905 --> 00:31:00,376
Don't be deceived.
The ace may seem like the ace.

261
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:04,378
And the queen may seem like the queen.
But the truth here is always...

262
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:07,423
...what one does not see.

263
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,319
If you want to see the place,
i can show you around.

264
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,093
Follow me, but quiet.

265
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,941
This is Hanussen's
"Circle of the Occult".

266
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:52,261
No, performers really
shouldn't be here.

267
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:54,218
Hanussen doesn't like it.

268
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,900
Place your hands in the light.

269
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,900
Make contact with one another.

270
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,600
Feel the energy surge
through you.

271
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I am... your clairvoyant.

272
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
I see your future.

273
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Excuse me!

274
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
My name is...

275
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,900
Actually, I wanted to tell you...

276
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,800
...you are the most...

277
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,650
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I'd like to welcome you...

278
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,600
...with all my heart to a new
spring and summer...

279
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,600
...program at Hanussen's...

280
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,500
...Palace of the Occult.

281
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Now we shall begin with someone
all of you are certainly familiar with.

282
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Herr Rothschild, the banker!

283
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Trying to run off with
the profits of the Great War.

284
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,350
The laughter backstage
is not permitted! If...

285
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:59,600
...anyone laughs, it'd better be
the audience, do you understand me?

286
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Yes. I understand.

287
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Wig!
Put your wig on!

288
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,300
- Put it on! Quickly!
- And now, Ladies and Gentlemen!

289
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:21,450
Helmet!

290
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,600
A novelty in our program. A man
of monstrous physical strenght.

291
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,100
The victor of all
roman gladiators.

292
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,600
I give you: Siegfried!

293
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Out!

294
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,350
After the great battle against...

295
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,300
...the Cimbers and
Teutons, Siegfried...

296
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,000
...was taken to the
roman arena as a prisoner.

297
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,000
They put him in chains.

298
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,500
But chains could not hold him.

299
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Siegfried, the Aryan King!

300
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,950
Siegfried won every fight.
He took the cuirass...

301
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:58,190
...from the strongest
of all defeated gladiators.

302
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,999
And from Varus, he took
not only his...

303
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
...head, but his heirlooms.

304
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,600
And now Ladies and Gentlemen,
the man who...

305
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:53,200
...is in league with
the powers of the occult.

306
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,300
The Master of the abysses of
the soul, whose power over the...

307
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,800
...soul itself is able to
achieve unbelievable things.

308
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,900
The man who is endowed
with more power..

309
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
...than the strongest body could
ever possess: Erik Jan Hanussen!

310
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,800
Venerable audience:

311
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,150
You are familiar with the
phenomenon which i myself...

312
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:45,300
...cannot fully explain.

313
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:48,000
I have been endowed with
a misterious gift.

314
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,700
Retracting the aura
of the cosmos...

315
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,700
...and transmitting its rays back to
people who are gifted... mediums.

316
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,200
And, are we not all in reality
endowed with a medial gift?

317
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,700
These rays of cosmic energy
are known as "Hypnosis".

318
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,300
And they manifest all
the power of the occult.

319
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,000
The unknown side of
the human psyche.

320
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,200
And it will prove to you that
all our german people...

321
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,700
...are full of unknown power.
A die will be cast.

322
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,900
- Four!
- Four. Table four. Is there?

323
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,000
Count Helldorf!
Good evening, Sir.

324
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,300
Good evening.

325
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,800
The Police Chief of Berlin!

326
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,050
May i ask your
enchanting companion...

327
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:58,800
...to come up on stage,
please?

328
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Please.

329
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
- What is your name?
- Hedda Christianson.

330
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,500
- And i think i've seen you on the screen.
- Yes, I've done two talkies.

331
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,050
But I'm still a beginner.

332
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:25,050
The beginning of a
great carrier, no doubt!

333
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,100
Don't worry.
Just relax.

334
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm now going to send
you into trance.

335
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Count Helldorf, the most
charming of all...

336
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,400
...police chiefs, will be there
to keep an eye on you.

337
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,900
And some of our sturdiest
Stormtroopers...

338
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,300
...in Berlin will be
there to support him.

339
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,100
- Certainly!
- Always ready! To victory!

340
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Focus on this object.
And listen to my voice.

341
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,700
Follow my voice.
My voice is leading you.

342
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,400
Keep your eyes fixed,
watch this object.

343
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,200
Focus your eyes.
The power of the whole people...

344
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,900
...will concentrate in you.

345
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,700
Your legs are getting heavy.
Very heavy.

346
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Your arms are getting heavy.

347
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Heavier and heavier...

348
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,600
Your eyelids are
getting heavy.

349
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Very heavy...
You feel sleepy.

350
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,100
You feel tired.
Very tired...

351
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,000
You want to sleep.
Your eyes are closing.

352
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,600
Your eyelids are becoming heavier.
And heavier.

353
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,300
Your eyes are closing.
And you feel sleepy.

354
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,200
Tired. Very tired.
You want to sleep.

355
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,900
Let yourself sink. You're sinking
deeper and deeper.

356
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,700
To the bottom of a
bottomless lake.

357
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:18,400
You are asleep.

358
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,900
I now place a coin
on the back of her hand.

359
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,300
I invoke all black powers
from the blackest abyss.

360
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,900
The coin on your hand
is growing hot.

361
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,200
Very hot.

362
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,900
You feel your hand getting
hotter... and hotter.

363
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,800
Yet you feel no pain.
No pain.

364
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,200
The coin is burning now.

365
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,200
Your hand is being burned.
Yet you feel no pain.

366
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,900
No pain.
Listen to my voice.

367
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm now going to wake you up.
I will count to three.

368
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,000
When i count to three,
you will awake.

369
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,400
You will feel well, very well.
And you will awake.

370
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,300
One. You feel your body
becoming lighter. And lighter.

371
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,350
Two. Let your body
drift up slowly...

372
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:27,000
...towards the surface
of the lake.

373
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,400
Three! You break the
surface of the water.

374
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,000
You open your eyes,
and you're awake.

375
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,900
You're awake.
You're strong.

376
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,900
You are feeling strong,
and you are feeling good.

377
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,000
Are you awake now?
Are you awake?

378
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Yes.

379
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,100
- Where am I? What happened?
- Count Helldorf, Sir.

380
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Can you please come up on stage
as a witness?

381
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,550
Will you please take
the coin from the back...

382
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,500
...of the hand of your
charming companion?

383
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,000
- What do you see now?
- Hedwig, my darling!

384
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,450
For God's Sake,
what has happened?

385
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,400
Please describe what you see.

386
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,900
A blister. A blister
from a burn.

387
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,900
- A big blister on her hand.
- Are you in pain?

388
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No, not at all!

389
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,800
Come in.

390
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,400
Well?

391
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,900
Well, the cost--
The costume and all this.

392
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,500
What about it?

393
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Marta... my darling!

394
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,000
Have you met our new strong man?

395
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:07,300
His name is Zishe.

396
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Yes.

397
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,500
I have big plans for him.

398
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,500
- I've seen you before.
- Yes, backstage.

399
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,900
- No.
- Where then?

400
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
A dream.

401
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,400
- A dream?
- Yes, actually...

402
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,600
What i want to say is...

403
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,400
The costume... I don't feel
quite right as a Teuton.

404
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Champagne!

405
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Sit.

406
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Sit!

407
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,300
Take a sip.

408
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,600
No, thank you.

409
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Now listen! My boy!

410
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,800
You don't seem to
be quite clear yet.

411
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,400
We are entertainers.

412
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,500
We work for a sole employer.
And that is the public.

413
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,400
We give them what they want.
We articulate their colective dreams.

414
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,100
Now: if you still don't understand this
at the end of intermission...

415
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,800
...pearhaps we should send you
back to your little Shtetl.

416
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:45,000
In Poland.

417
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,400
I'm homesick.
I miss my brothers and sisters.

418
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And working with my father.

419
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,800
I work here for a clairvoyant.

420
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:18,800
His name is Hanussen.
And he is a mystery to me.

421
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I have the power to radiate
energy onto you.

422
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,400
You feel pulled.
Something is drawing you.

423
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,900
You're sinking. Sinking.

424
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,900
Sinking...

425
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,300
What the power of the body can
achieve, Ladies and Gentlemen...

426
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,500
...the power of the spirit
can also achieve.

427
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,200
And more, much more.

428
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,400
The frail body of
our pianist is...

429
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,500
...able to perform far
greater things...

430
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,100
...Ladies and Gentlemen.
Just as our people...

431
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,200
...are capable of developing
unimaginable powers.

432
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,400
They merely need to be led.

433
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:03,000
And, like a cosmic event,
like a comet in the sky...

434
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,100
...a figure of light has
come among us.

435
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,600
And this force, which will
crush all foreign vermin...

436
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,900
...has a name: Adolf Hitler.

437
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,400
He will. I see it, i see it
clearly before my eyes.

438
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,300
One day he will lead
our thirsting people.

439
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,200
I am the seer.
I am the prophet of his coming.

440
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,200
To victory!

441
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,150
The flag up high...

442
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,900
...the troops tight together!

443
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,150
SA marches with firm...

444
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:56,300
...and calm steps!

445
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,500
To victory! To victory!

446
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,400
So lively, so early
in the morning?

447
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,700
I am, you see... possibly
in the wrong place.

448
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,850
Marta, leave us for a moment.

449
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:29,700
I'll call you when i need you.

450
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,400
- Something on your mind?
- You see, the audience...

451
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,700
I don't feel right
with the audience.

452
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,400
Pearhaps i'm just too jewish.

453
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,500
I understand you
better than you think.

454
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,200
Really?

455
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,900
We are alike, you and i.

456
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Yes.

457
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,100
We are showmen.
We provide the...

458
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:25,100
...bewildered a beacon of light.

459
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,700
The audience doesn't seem
very bewildered to me.

460
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:30,900
There are a lot of those
nazis out there...

461
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,200
...who seem to know exactly
where they are going.

462
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,200
And i am their prophet.

463
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,200
You know, my boy, what
my dream is?

464
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,800
Something... much
grander than this.

465
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,600
And i've already found it.

466
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,050
I want to be to the present
what the...

467
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,800
...Oracle of Delphi
was to antiquety.

468
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,100
High ranking party
members have..

469
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:04,200
...already intimated to me
that I will be the Minister...

470
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,600
...of the Occult in
Hitler's future cabinet.

471
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,300
I have just awakened the barbaric
prehistoric demons...

472
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,600
...to a new godless life.

473
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,250
Look, I am not particularly
religious...

474
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:23,600
...but in my family
there is God.

475
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,900
If there is such a
thing as God...

476
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,200
...then he dwells here.

477
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,700
And this God protects me.

478
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Gives me power.

479
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,400
Do you want to see what
real power is? Marta!

480
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,100
Marta!

481
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Sing!
Sing!

482
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,900
- Which song?
- The one about chandelier.

483
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,400
"As long as my panties
are hanging...

484
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,400
...in the chandelier
come morning...

485
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,500
...you can be sure that
i still love you."

486
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,700
Now the proof.

487
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,900
Turn around.

488
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,900
Look, my boy.

489
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,900
The roundest butt on
God's wide earth.

490
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,800
And it's mine.

491
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
All mine.

492
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
EXIT

493
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,700
I didn't want to disturb you.
I'm sorry.

494
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,900
You're not disturbing me at all.
Please, stay.

495
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,100
That was really won--
Wonderful.

496
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,400
Why don't you sit
down next to me?

497
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,900
I don't know anything about music.
Tell me, where did you learn all this?

498
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,600
I thought you were a princess when
I first heard you play. Tell me.

499
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,300
I studied at the Conservatory,
in Prague.

500
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:01,900
You see, i had high hopes then.

501
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,650
And i've never really
given them up.

502
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:07,300
And why are you here?

503
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,550
The reason is that
i'm a stateless person.

504
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,800
Do you know what that means?

505
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:15,700
As a child they kept pushing
me around between three countries.

506
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,300
I never knew my parents.
And when Hanussen was in Prague...

507
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,500
- ...he took me away with him.
- He was in Prague?

508
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:28,200
Yes, in Prague. And he gave me
work with his Palace Orchestra.

509
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,200
I'm sure you have noticed that
he doesn't treat me well.

510
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,600
Ye. Yes, i've noticed that.

511
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,900
But i stay with him all the same.
Well, yes.

512
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,400
Why am i still with him?

513
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,300
Miss Marta, I want you to...
I am...

514
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Zishe, I know what you mean.

515
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,000
Your music...
It's so beautiful when you play.

516
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,200
- You see, I have a dream.
- Can you tell me what it is?

517
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,200
Someday I'd like to play
Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.

518
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,800
With a full orchestra
to accompany me.

519
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:12,300
I would give anything for that.

520
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,600
I have a vision deep inside.

521
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,400
Come with me.
I'll show you.
