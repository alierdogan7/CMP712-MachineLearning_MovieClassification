1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,753
The Beaufort Castle,
a twelfth-century Crusader fort,

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,599
has passed from hand to hand,
from army to army,

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,676
for hundreds of years.

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,588
Bloody battles have turned it into
a mythological symbol of bravery.

5
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,996
In 1982, on the first day
of the Lebanon War,

6
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,873
the Israeli flag was raised
on the mountain

7
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,634
at the end of a fierce
and controversial battle.

8
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,309
Eighteen years later,
in the wake of public protest,

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,755
the Israeli government decided
to leave Lebanon.

10
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,995
Incoming, incoming.

11
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,714
Impact, impact.

12
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,593
Get in, it's not over yet.

13
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,792
Did you come to save us?

14
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,758
I知 Oshri.
The company sergeant.

15
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,871
This is Liraz, the outpost
commander. Welcome to Beaufort.

16
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,036
Ziv Faran. Bomb Squad.
- Nice to meet you.

17
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,759
Is it like this all the time?
- It was quiet until you arrived.

18
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,279
Impact. Impact.

19
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,792
See that doorway, over there? That's
the entrance to the protected area.

20
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,478
Sprint to it
and don't stop for anything.

21
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,431
Even if you hear, "Incoming,
incoming," keep running.

22
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,152
Got it?
Let's go. Get up.

23
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,873
Go. Run.

24
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,954
Got stuck?

25
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,553
Want to wait a moment?

26
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,992
No, it's okay.
Let's go.

27
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,913
Incoming, incoming.

28
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,672
Impact, impact.

29
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,953
Bardelas Leader,
what a guest!

30
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,990
Meet Ziv from the
Bomb Squad.

31
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,720
He'll hang around here for a few
days, to open the road for us.

32
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,315
Pavel, Robbie.

33
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,233
Pavel, go to the J-curve.

34
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,711
Right.
J- curve.

35
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,068
Have a seat.

36
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,269
That's the road...
- Can you see the device?

37
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,078
Not really.

38
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,992
It's around here.
Well hidden.

39
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,314
Bomb camouflage. They got
that from us. It's IDF. - May I?

40
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,316
Yeah, sure.

41
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,196
They put them there under
our noses. Ballsy bastards.

42
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,158
I don't know what blew up on
you, but this looks hot to me.

43
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,112
Impossible.

44
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,519
I was there. There was an explosion,
I saw it with my own eyes.

45
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,750
Could they have come back
and reset the device?

46
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,674
No. Impossible.

47
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,435
Robbie and Pavel have been
observing it since the event.

48
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,749
We have tapes.

49
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,879
Anything's possible.

50
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,149
We're ineffective in fog. We had
a few hours with no visibility.

51
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,035
Wait, what's the problem?
I don't get it.

52
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,954
The device has looked like this
for two weeks.

53
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,679
Your people have seen
all the pictures.

54
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,070
You drove us nuts in debriefing.
There's nothing new here.

55
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,031
Look, no one
has actually seen it.

56
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,231
We know nothing
about the parameter.

57
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
Chances are there's more than one
device. It's really dangerous.

58
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,671
Is that what they sent you for?

59
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,349
To tell us it's dangerous?
I know it's dangerous.

60
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,238
Believe me, I know.

61
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,111
I want to talk to my commander.

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,351
I think we should
cancel the operation.

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,473
What do you mean, cancel?

64
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,836
We can't stay here
with a blocked road.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,958
We waited a month for you only
to hear that it's dangerous?

66
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,833
Look, I知 sorry
I have to disappoint you.

67
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,073
I know you guys
want to go home.

68
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,670
But... Kabarnit Procedure
isn't appropriate here.

69
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,355
I知 not doing it.

70
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,036
What do you mean,
you're not doing it?

71
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,878
Where did that come from?

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,912
It's dangerous.

73
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,516
It's not a game.
- Listen, Ziv.

74
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,594
You want to talk to your
commanding officer, fine.

75
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,990
Check with him, consult,
that's cool.

76
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,071
But "I'm not doing it?"

77
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,396
Where did that come from?

78
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,477
Who's asking you?

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,199
Liraz...

80
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,750
If you don't do it,
they won't cancel it.

81
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,673
They'll just bring in someone
else to do it in your place.

82
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,232
Do you have a red phone here?

83
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,873
Talk to whoever you want.

84
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,193
They know everything you do,
and they sent you here anyway.

85
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,634
Can I have a moment alone?

86
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,355
Come on.

87
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,194
Why don't they just send in
a D9 armored bulldozer?

88
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,879
Seriously.
Why send in a man on foot?

89
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,833
They want to investigate
the device, not blow it up.

90
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,553
It's rare,
to find a whole device.

91
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,950
Even so,
it seems totally crazy to me.

92
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,392
That's his job, Oshri.

93
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,955
Disposing of bombs.
What do you want?

94
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,918
They'll send him back home.
Wanna bet?

95
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,153
No way.
- I'm telling you.

96
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,275
Okay.
We're on.

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,915
Cigarette?

98
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,589
I don't smoke.

99
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,474
Want to start?

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,389
Ziv.

101
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,715
Ziv.
You awake?

102
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,437
Come on, let's go up
to the observation post.

103
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,519
Okay, give me a minute.

104
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,513
Ziv,

105
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,592
this is how you sleep
at Beaufort.

106
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,239
I値l wait for you up top.

107
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,554
No, thanks.

108
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,273
Don't let him get to you.

109
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,473
What was your name again?

110
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,389
Koris.

111
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,589
What's he like?
Do you guys like him?

112
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,915
Does it matter?

113
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,119
You're right.
Doesn't matter...

114
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,833
Liraz is exactly what the army
needs here now.

115
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,431
Someone who can't believe
they actually gave him the job.

116
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,272
Who's there?
- Ziv, bomb squad.

117
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,955
Ziv the bomb squad.

118
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,193
Come here,
let's have a look at you.

119
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,038
Have you seen Liraz?
I知 looking for him.

120
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,870
Liraz?
Not here.

121
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,238
Are you lost?

122
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,874
Where am I?
- Far away.

123
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,918
As far as you can get.
If you're here, it's by mistake.

124
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,951
Are you alone on watch here?

125
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,439
Shpitz, Ziv the bomb squad wants
to know if I知 here alone.

126
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,117
What's up, Ziv the bomb squad?
- Have you seen Liraz?

127
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,198
Why do you want Liraz?
What for?

128
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,315
Stay with us. We'll make you
a deluxe Beaufort toast.

129
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,879
Make you one? Pesto, cherry
tomatoes, Dijon mustard.

130
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,789
You like? -No, thanks.
He's waiting for me.

131
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,316
Good, because we're fresh out
of pesto and cherry tomatoes.

132
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,959
And mustard.

133
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,631
Say, bomb squad,

134
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,917
do they really teach you
to dismantle bombs?

135
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,110
How did you get to that unit, anyway?
Did you get there by mistake,

136
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,151
or did you want to go there?

137
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,514
Mostly by mistake,
but I知 not sorry.

138
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,436
You? Are you here by mistake,
or did you want to be here?

139
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,791
I wanted to be here.
That's the mistake!

140
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,834
Get it?

141
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,910
And what's it like?
Interesting?

142
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,353
What do you do here all day?
- Guard the mountain.

143
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,871
So it doesn't escape.

144
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,829
Have a nice shift.

145
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,595
Excuse me,

146
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,434
have you seen Liraz?

147
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,798
Soldier.
Soldier..?

148
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,115
Soldier...

149
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,033
What happened, buddy?

150
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,712
What's that thing there?
There's a dummy there.

151
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,229
Yeah, reinforcements.

152
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
"Spooks". There are six of them
dispersed over the guard posts,

153
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,871
to attract fire.

154
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,513
Are you serious?

155
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,472
What happened?
Did you talk to it?

156
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,834
That's good.

157
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,758
It means they're doing
their job, no?

158
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,275
Okay, let's go up,
I値l show you the road.

159
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,834
A bit to the right...

160
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,995
Arnoon. The device exploded
exactly in the middle.

161
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,149
On the curve.

162
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,912
Can you see it?

163
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,712
Sorry about earlier,
at the observation post.

164
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,470
I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that.

165
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,509
It's okay.

166
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,190
What did your commander
tell you when you spoke to him?

167
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,079
That it has to be done.
There's no alternative.

168
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,232
And that I should be careful.

169
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,753
Look, I wasn't trying
to get out of the job, earlier.

170
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,670
I spent a year at HQ,
waiting for this.

171
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,593
Yeah, but come the moment of
truth, your balls start shaking.

172
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,756
That's the way it is.
No way around it.

173
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,238
My balls aren't shaking.

174
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,915
I said what I did
because it's really dangerous.

175
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,912
What exactly are you
going to do there?

176
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,716
We go together
to the evaluation point,

177
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,836
I observe the device

178
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,350
and then go in,
with a medic behind me.

179
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,990
I make sure there's no trip wire
or device that could explode,

180
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,556
and if not, I go to the device,
dismantle it and take it with me.

181
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,152
Did they drill you on this?

182
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,874
Dozens of times.

183
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,798
And what if the device
explodes?

184
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,239
It's not supposed to.

185
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,390
Tell me, do your parents
know you're here?

186
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,758
Of course not.

187
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,594
What for?

188
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,717
They know I知 on the northern
border, but not inside Lebanon.

189
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,070
My mother hasn't known
where I am since I was nine.

190
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,109
Afraid to ask.

191
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,469
And you?

192
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,600
If my dad knew I was here, he'd
come and take me out by force.

193
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,439
I知 serious. He wouldn't
let me out of the house.

194
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,555
So you guys are serious
lefties, then?

195
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,035
Did you know they didn't even
need to take this mountain?

196
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,114
Had they waited until morning,
the terrorists would have run.

197
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,789
They could've come up
without battle or casualties.

198
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,431
You could say that
about any battle.

199
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,596
The fact is that the troops
fought here like men.

200
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,994
They even issued an order not
to conquer, not to come up here.

201
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,233
Oh yeah?
So why did they?

202
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,231
No one knows to this day. Somehow
the order disappeared into thin air.

203
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,509
Impossible.

204
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,350
My uncle was killed here in '82.
My mother's brother.

205
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,311
What, in the conquest battle?

206
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,160
From what I gather, fifty meters
from where we stand now.

207
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,157
Caught a bullet
as he entered the fort.

208
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,596
So what are you doing here?
Are you insane?

209
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,188
If I was your father, I wouldn't
let you out of the house either.

210
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,197
I壇 tie you to the refrigerator,
or something.

211
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,434
I致e been hearing stories about
this mountain my entire life.

212
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,551
I had to see it.

213
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,072
To be able to say I was
here, before we leave Lebanon.

214
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,319
You should have told me.
I壇 have sent you pictures.

215
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,111
Relax,
we're not leaving so soon.

216
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,192
I bet your kids
will still be here.

217
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,917
Maybe, as tourists.
- Maybe.

218
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,710
What is it?
- Liquorice.

219
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,511
My mother brings it
from Holland.

220
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,552
It's salty.
A little strong.

221
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,954
Bardelas from Leader.

222
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,719
Roger, over, Leader.

223
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,111
Copy stand down.
- Copy that.

224
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,233
Stand down.
Good morning. -Good morning.

225
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,711
Panther, Bardelas,
move to Tomato.

226
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,109
Roger. Tomato.

227
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,229
Ziv.

228
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,949
Identify it?

229
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,789
Send in the dog.

230
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,989
Nadav.

231
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,875
Thanks.

232
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,192
Okay, I知 going in.
Send me Koris.

233
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,119
I知 going in with you,
not Koris.

234
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,518
No way.
That's not what we agreed.

235
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,439
I don't care. I致e decided
that I知 going in with you.

236
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,950
That's not procedure.
- That's the way it's going to be.

237
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,156
It's a shame we're standing
here, exposed.

238
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,755
If you have a problem,
you can go back to the outpost.

239
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,119
Keep your distance, kid.

240
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,828
Go on, boy.

241
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,799
Come out my Beloved,

242
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,309
the Bride to meet;

243
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,280
the inner light of Shabbat,

244
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,273
let us greet.

245
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,072
To welcome the Shabbat,
let us progress,

246
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,752
for it is the source
from which to bless.

247
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,880
From the beginning,
chosen before time,

248
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,553
last in deed,
but in thought - prime.

249
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,468
Come out my Beloved,

250
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,833
the Bride to meet...

251
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,629
You know, they told us to start
getting rid of equipment.

252
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,194
When the convoy arrives tonight,
anything unnecessary, goes.

253
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,999
Bit by bit.

254
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,553
Until the evacuation.

255
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,472
No one gets rid of anything.

256
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,197
Not even a water boiler.
Not without my authorization. Got it?

257
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,511
I知 telling you
what they told us.

258
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,153
Anything that's not vital,
goes.

259
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,839
What's not vital?

260
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,792
Show me one thing
that isn't vital here.

261
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,638
The television,
for instance.

262
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,313
Why isn't it vital?

263
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,994
Why? Are you being punished?
Don't you deserve to watch TV?

264
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,555
There's no such thing as
not vital. Everything's vital.

265
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,478
If one thing's not vital here,
then everything's not vital.

266
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,793
I don't understand.

267
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,638
You don't have to understand.

268
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,351
You're early.
You have nine more minutes.

269
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,709
I saved you the drag
of the nine last minutes.

270
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,593
There's food.
Go eat.

271
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,751
A feast.
The cook outdid himself.

272
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,231
Idiots. Who prepares a meal
at midnight?

273
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,038
We also have permission
to shower.

274
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,159
Well, did you?

275
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,077
I知 on the ready team.
I値l shower tomorrow morning.

276
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,478
Also, they brought
new sleeping bags.

277
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,434
Brand new, from the factory.

278
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,068
I put one on your bunk.

279
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,718
What's up, Koris?
Everything okay?

280
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,352
Great. Perfect.

281
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,194
I知 not touching their food,

282
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,631
their sleeping bags
or their water!

283
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,518
It's like dancing on the blood.

284
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,793
Next time they should leave the road
closed. Shouldn't send anything.

285
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,797
It's killing me.
A man died here.

286
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,272
He came, said "Hi,"
and died.

287
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,232
And what for?

288
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,074
To open a shitty road
that only we use.

289
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,470
For a year I致e been keeping
my batteries upside-down.

290
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,591
Like an idiot.
So I don't waste them.

291
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,194
Turn them back only
before operational activity.

292
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,637
Fuck them now.

293
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,709
Stop it.

294
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,358
What, night alert procedure?

295
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,799
Think they can't see this post?

296
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,552
Think they don't know
you're here?

297
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,914
Bullshit. On the contrary.
You're here so they can see you.

298
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,919
What are we here for?

299
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,312
So that they know we haven't
run away yet.

300
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,351
Stop it, Koris.
This isn't a game.

301
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,077
What's this, Pavel?
Why is this on the truck?

302
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,993
I told you, that's the order.

303
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,919
Really,
I didn't make this up.

304
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,071
Take it off.
Forget the order. Are you nuts?

305
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,829
What do you mean?

306
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,998
Where are you going?

307
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,074
They told me to leave. No more
clearing roads on foot. -Said who?

308
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,315
Command.

309
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,910
Okay. Take it off. I don't care
what they told you.

310
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,869
Get him down.

311
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,830
What are you doing?

312
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,198
The dog isn't leaving.
Understand?

313
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,238
I don't care what they told you.
File a complaint. He's not leaving!

314
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,351
What's it to you? Who are you?
My orders are to leave

315
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,631
and no one sent a replacement for me.
The dog doesn't stay without me.

316
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,512
You're not my commander.
You can't make me stay.

317
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,710
Does it make sense to evacuate
a dog, but leave soldiers?

318
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,512
This dog stays here.
Understand?

319
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,079
Stop it, Liraz.
Stop it.

320
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,630
Move.
- It's not Nadav's fault.

321
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,230
He hasn't been home in a month,
and has no replacement.

322
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,671
There's no more road clearing
on foot.

323
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,757
So why keep him here?

324
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,468
What for? This is it.
It's over. Done.

325
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,113
We're holding up the convoy.

326
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,679
In a minute
there'll be missiles.

327
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,918
I don't care what they told you.
The dog stays, understand?

328
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,708
He's like a weapon. I can't
abandon him. No way.

329
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,195
So tell Command
it was my order.

330
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,158
Now get your stuff.

331
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,638
Get on the truck and fuck off.

332
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,714
Fuck off.
Go.

333
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,149
Get out of here.
I don't want to see your face.

334
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,078
Get out of my sight.

335
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,629
You don't deserve to be here.

336
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,028
Crazy bastard.

337
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,715
Go.

338
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,832
Go on,
back to the protected area.

339
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,476
Incoming, incoming.

340
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,159
Impact, impact.

341
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,795
Incoming, incoming.

342
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,437
Impact. Impact.

343
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,952
Wait, buddy.
Give it a few more seconds.

344
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,995
Incoming, incoming.

345
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,152
How many days
do you have left here?

346
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,391
Eighteen.
Including today.

347
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,080
Okay, listen. Why should you
dry out here for 18 more days?

348
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,515
Next convoy, go back to Israel.
You've done your share.

349
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,592
Where did that come from?

350
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,077
If you have something to say,
Liraz, say it.

351
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,756
I have nothing to say.
You've done your bit, man.

352
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,995
Get out.

353
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,237
Go say goodbye to the
kids before you leave.

354
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,918
Give them a tour a the fortress.

355
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,630
You sure?
- Yeah. Sure.

356
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,039
Come with me?
We'll bring them some goodies.

357
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,635
Let the kids run loose
a little bit.

358
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,030
Like Kalimi did to us
on our first tour of duty here.

359
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,312
Impact. Impact.
- You go.

360
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,873
At this point
I don't belong there.

361
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,595
But you go.
It's important.

362
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,715
Hold on a minute.

363
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,669
Put down the camera, Shpitz.
Photograph the landscape.

364
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,155
Not the people. We don't want to be
in tomorrow's newspaper.

365
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,599
Wow.
This was their bunker.

366
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,269
And this,
their guard post.

367
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,190
Soldiers have been on this damn
mountain for a thousand years.

368
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,038
But no mortar shells
fall here, right?

369
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,879
Never.
The fortress is sacred.

370
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,638
The Hezbollah
respect the Crusaders.

371
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,359
It's so quiet here.

372
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,029
Who's Michael?
- What?

373
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,793
Michael. Is there something
you want to tell us?

374
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,558
Michelle. Michelle,
asshole.

375
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,359
My girlfriend.

376
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,635
Lives in New Jersey.

377
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,677
I知 on a plane a day after
I知 out of the army,

378
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,552
land on her doorstep
twelve hours later.

379
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,310
Are you sure that's
how you spell Michelle?

380
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,837
Don't mess with my head. I知
sure, I checked a million times.

381
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,231
One more word and I値l have you
studying English all night.

382
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,953
If you checked, it's cool.

383
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,954
Doesn't matter. She'll leave you
after a week anyway.

384
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,639
You're not cut out
for an American.

385
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,717
Watch it, Kundalini!

386
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,117
Besides, her dad's Israeli.

387
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,833
Even worse.

388
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,229
Say, what about Liraz?

389
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,915
Does he have a girlfriend?

390
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,719
Lilach.
Six years together.

391
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,109
You seen her?

392
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,595
Do you guys hang out together?
- Sometimes. Not much.

393
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,994
What's he like?

394
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,673
Not much of a dancer.

395
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,237
I can't see him dancing,
with his M16...

396
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,753
What, are you making fun
of him?

397
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,428
I just can't imagine him being
romantic. Dunno. I just can't.

398
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,352
Truth is, he's not
all that big on romance.

399
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,159
How could he be romantic?

400
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,999
Last year I saw him
on the street, in Tiberias,

401
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,959
in jeans, with his gun
slung around his shoulder.

402
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,757
What kind of jerk
carries his weapon on leave?

403
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,996
Did he see you?
Did you say hi?

404
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,515
He pretended not to see me.
Crossed the street.

405
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,112
What did you expect? For him
to stop and give you a hug? -No.

406
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,350
But he could have nodded.

407
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,433
He knows me,
after all.

408
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,755
At the outpost
he doesn't say hi, either.

409
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,678
Why does he keep
such a distance from us, anyway?

410
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,990
What's the deal?
Are you guys short of friends?

411
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,434
Leave him alone.

412
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,678
What kind of a soldier was he?

413
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,632
Devoted.
A real workhorse.

414
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,839
From Day One he knew he wanted
to be an officer.

415
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,278
Took the test three times,
but was rejected.

416
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,038
They wouldn't let him in.

417
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,431
Said he wasn't officer
material.

418
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,995
So he drove the battalion
commander crazy.

419
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,549
Sat outside his office every
day, begged him for a chance.

420
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,317
In the end they let him
take the course.

421
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,198
He graduated with the top marks.
They couldn't figure him out.

422
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,158
Was he liked in your company?

423
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,233
Sure.
King of the world.

424
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,677
The soldiers, mind you,
not the commanders.

425
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,553
Why, don't you like him?

426
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,593
Sure.
He's a good officer.

427
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,199
You can tell he cares.

428
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,074
You're lucky they didn't stick
you with some faggot officer.

429
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,078
If something happens here,
you know you can count on him.

430
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,878
They didn't send him here
for nothing.

431
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,999
I知 here just because of him.
If he weren't here,

432
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,588
I could have finished
my service easy.

433
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,995
Every night out in Nahariya.

434
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,351
Everyone knows that if
something serious happens here,

435
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,357
he's the only one
who'll know how to function.

436
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,198
Like he functioned with Ziv?

437
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,951
Stop the bullshit, Koris.
What could he have done?

438
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,799
The guy died for nothing.
I swear.

439
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,918
And the next day, suddenly they
cancel Kabarnit Procedure.

440
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,430
Two days later they bring in
the D9, plow over the road.

441
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,437
So what did he die for?
I still don't get it.

442
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,991
Am I the only one
who thinks it's weird?

443
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,149
A good officer, who can function,
wouldn't let that happen.

444
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,272
Koris, he takes orders
just like you, okay?

445
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,360
He doesn't decide
when to send in the D9.

446
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,078
Think he makes those decisions?

447
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,036
And why aren't we allowed
to talk about the evacuation?

448
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,594
As if we were 3-year-olds?
- What do you want him to say?

449
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,400
4 old whores who don't know shit
about the army are brainwashing

450
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,794
the whole country
with their bullshit.

451
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,433
What's it got to do with you?

452
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,796
What do you want him to say?
- I want him to stand up like a man

453
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,353
and tell us that Hezbollah
will be here in two weeks.

454
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,313
And that all the IDF is doing
now is for nothing. That's what.

455
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,753
Okay, forget politics.

456
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,678
No, it pisses me off!

457
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,988
Someone died here. How can you
say it was for nothing?

458
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,275
You know what? Not for nothing.
You got your chow, okay?

459
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,755
Koris, I値l throw my helmet
in your face. -Okay, enough!

460
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,033
Suddenly the landscape
seems different.

461
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,829
I don't know why.

462
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,388
It's a well-known phenomenon.

463
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,916
When you're here long enough,
the view changes.

464
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,233
Suddenly you see new things.

465
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,353
It's just a new angle.

466
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,956
No, something changes
in your head, believe me.

467
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,639
You end up missing this place.

468
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,032
So when are you running away
from here?

469
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,833
I知 not running away.
Don't say that.

470
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,309
My time has come. -You're right.
That's cool. Sorry.

471
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,590
When are you
getting out of here?

472
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,429
In two days.

473
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,589
Come here,
give me a hug.

474
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,874
Come on,
don't be afraid.

475
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,349
You come to me.

476
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,914
When you're in New Jersey,

477
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,912
every night,
before you fuck Michelle,

478
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,591
think about us here
for one minute.

479
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,833
Picture this moment.

480
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,230
Swear you won't go a day
without thinking of us.

481
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,271
One minute.
That's enough.

482
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,313
Cool. It's a deal.

483
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,350
Take care.
- Okay.

484
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,994
Sure?
- Sure.

485
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,589
What?

486
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,431
Good luck.
- Thanks.

487
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,548
Hang in there.

488
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,633
Want me to cry?
Come on.

489
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,197
Get your gear.
Let's get the hell out of here.

490
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,512
Noah! -What?

491
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,354
In the ark
gather the forest animals...

492
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,553
In 21 days I値l kiss Michelle
on the lips,

493
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,914
do you believe it?

494
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,398
Are you with me,
Honey?

495
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,596
Ever hear of
Kundalini meditation?

496
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,392
It's a kind of snake
that lies coiled in your pelvis.

497
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,756
And you have to awaken it
from its dormant state.

498
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,837
If it awakens inside, it can
actually bring salvation.

499
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,836
And it calms your soul,

500
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,356
mends the broken pieces in your
heart. True spiritual life.

501
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,874
Want me to demonstrate,
Honey?

502
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,756
Kundalini, stage one:
stand with bent knees

503
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,274
and shake your body.

504
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,835
Shake it, shake it.

505
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,153
Relax, from the earth
to the sky.

506
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,874
I知 afraid, Master Shakura.
I can't relax.

507
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,631
Have no fear, I知 with you.
We're together.

508
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,674
Let it out of you,
naturally, freely.

509
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,753
Don't lead,
let yourself be led,

510
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,158
carried away. Yes, shake hard.
Shake hard.

511
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,675
Now, shake hard,
shake deep...

512
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,875
Impact. Impact.

513
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,317
Missile at Green Post.
Missile at Green.

514
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,989
Zitlawi!

515
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,359
Get an extinguisher.

516
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,596
And get the ready team
with a doctor.

519
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,349
Impact, impact.

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,354
Incoming, incoming.

522
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,197
Impact. Impact.

523
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,916
Tell them we have an injury
or a casualty.

524
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,513
Where's the ready team,
why aren't they here?

525
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,073
Where's the doctor,

We got hit by a missile.

529
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,554
Liraz, here's the extinguisher.
Clear, clear!

530
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,873
Go in with you?
- Wait outside.

531
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,434
Oshri, get me Caesar.

532
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,275

533
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,509

535
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,437
A serious injury.
I need a helo ASAP.

537
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,393
Zitlawi,

538
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,715
What's the status?

539
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,356
Helo. Get a helo.
Don't tell me to calm down.

540
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,915
Motherfucker. -Got to get him
onto a stretcher. Get him down.

541
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,069
Support his head.

542
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,474
Get him up.
Get him up.

543
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,989
Impact, impact.

544
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,236
Support his head, Liraz.

Take over for me
on the stretcher.

548
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,914
I知 on duty here
until the ready team arrives.

549
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,109
Stay here.

550
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,914
Keep your eyes peeled.
It could be a combined attack.

551
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,190
Where's the ready team?
Fuck.

552
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,351
Must be waiting
for the shelling to stop.

553
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,193
Go with Zitlawi.
Go.

554
