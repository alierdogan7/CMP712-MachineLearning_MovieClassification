00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:32,371
"How can we make
that convincing?"

703
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:35,407
We tried to make shots as
long as possible,

704
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:39,661
use panning shots so that
there was no possibility

705
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:41,330
of--of trickery,

706
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:45,200
and going
from respected dignitaries

707
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:49,888
or--or high churchmen straight
to the bodies and corpses

708
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:53,142
so it couldn't be suggested
that--that we were

709
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,144
faking the film.

710
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:00,882
NARRATOR: Hitchcock was struck
by the contrast

711
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,353
between the normal lives
of Germans living near the camps

712
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,721
and the nightmare within.

713
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:09,191
He suggested using maps
to highlight

714
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:12,361
how close they were.

715
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,363
Alfred Hitchcock's--
one of his contributions

716
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,532
to the film is that
he had a particular

717
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,083
conceptualization
of those maps.

718
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:20,002
He also thought they
were very important

719
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,621
because he said not only
should they show the sites

720
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,957
of atrocity
or the concentration camps

721
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,075
were close
to population centers,

722
00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:29,845
they should do so
on a map that was very simple,

723
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,214
and it should be like
a school's atlas.

724
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:44,443
We wanted to know whether
the Germans surrounding

725
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:48,480
the concentration camp
knew about it.

726
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,099
So Hitch did
this drawing, circles,

727
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:54,436
one mile from the camp,
two miles from the camp,

728
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:57,623
10 miles from the camp,
20 miles from the camp.

729
00:57:57,657 --> 00:58:03,662
His idea was show
the area surrounding each camp

730
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:09,168
and show how people had
led a normal life outside.

731
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,503
FILM NARRATOR:
Ebensee is a holiday resort

732
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,889
in the mountains.

733
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,808
The air is clean and pure.

734
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:19,595
It cures sickness,
and there is a sweetness

735
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,796
about the place,

736
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,849
a gentle peace.

737
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,315
In this place,
the Luftwaffe

738
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:44,670
or SS Panzer officer
on leave relaxes,

739
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:47,873
eats well, breathes deeply,

740
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,375
finds romance.

741
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,962
Everything is charming
and picturesque...

742
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,519
but the concentration camp
had become

743
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:03,939
an integral part
of the German economic system.

744
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,059
So it was here, too.

745
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,944
Able to see the mountains,

746
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,030
but what use are mountains
without food?

747

NARRATOR: Even as Hitchcock
and Bernstein worked,

748
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:23,191
events in postwar Europe
were developing

749
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:28,463
in unexpected directions.

750
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,116
In many of the camps,
thousands of survivors

751
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,136
remained, marooned.

752
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,839
BERNEY: Now we were faced with--
with--in--in Belsen anyway

753
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:40,976
over 20,000
who refused to go,

754
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,644
and the same situation occurred

755
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,399
to other concentration camps
and slave labor

756
00:59:47,433 --> 00:59:49,735
all over the British
part of Germany

757
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:52,688
and the American part
of Germany, too.

758
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:55,223
So all of a sudden, we had
another big problem

759
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:57,025
on our hands--how to handle

760
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:00,612
this humanitarian
disaster situation.

761

MAN: I was born in Bergen-Belsen
in the displaced persons' camp.

762
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,959
Both my parents were
liberated at Belsen.

763
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,578
My mother put together
a team to work

764
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:20,682
alongside the British
medical personnel

765
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,435
to try and save as many
as possible

766
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:28,223
of the thousands
of critically ill survivors.

767
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:32,277
At the same time,
my father emerged

768
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:38,617
as the leader, the political
leader of the survivors.

769
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:41,203
Most of them did not
want to go back

770
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,823
to their country of origin
but wanted to go, settle

771
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,909
in Palestine or elsewhere,

772
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:51,046
the United States,
Canada, and the like.

773
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,299
BERNEY: And apparently
the American answer was

774
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:56,084
definitely no.

775
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,887
"We're not taking
any ex-prisoners in.

776
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,024
We've got problems of our own."

777
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,009
Britain said, "No. There's
no way we're going to take

778
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:10,649
hundreds of thousands
of--of these homeless,
stateless people in."

779
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:13,819
So that was the situation.

780
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,988

I am in heaven.

781
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:18,490

at the time about Palestine,
