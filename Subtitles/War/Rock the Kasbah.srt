01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,401
If you're saying 10 bucks,
I'm sorry.

1538
01:42:22,403 --> 01:42:24,270
'Cause I only got five bucks.
It's all I got.

1539

You can't do it for five?

Here, man, take it.

1541

I'll find somewhere else
for five, I promise you.

01:42:29,244 --> 01:42:32,011
[ Speaking Dari ]
It's what I got. It's all I got.

1543
01:42:32,013 --> 01:42:35,314
[ Speaking Dari ] Thank you so much.
Thanks. Appreciate it.

1544
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:38,618
That's great. That'll be...
All right, give me some string.

five more bucks. Give me...

1546
01:42:47,362 --> 01:42:50,596
Well, that's ugly. Give me...
Give me that blue one.

1547
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,934
Which one...
I don't need all of this.

1548
01:42:54,936 --> 01:42:56,536
Which one's better?
This one?

1549
01:42:56,538 --> 01:42:58,538
Give me...
That one's clean.

1550
01:43:00,942 --> 01:43:04,644
Now it's mixed in there. That's the color.
Which one's better, this or this?

1551
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:06,112
Which one?

1552
01:43:06,114 --> 01:43:08,614
I'm taking that one.
Between these two. [ Speaking Dari ]

1553
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:11,284
Ah. Ah.

1554
01:43:11,286 --> 01:43:12,785
I just wanna take
one of these.

1555
01:43:12,787 --> 01:43:15,121
I want two of these.
This one or this one?

1556
01:43:15,123 --> 01:43:16,956
This one?

1557
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,791
I got that one. Here.

1558
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:21,873
[ Muffled ] This one or this one?
[ Speaking Dari ]

1559
01:43:25,133 --> 01:43:26,732
I'm gonna decide
on my own.

1560
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:29,168
I've already put this one in my mouth.
I'm keeping that one.

1561
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:32,505
And that reminds me of someone,
and this is brand new and mysterious.

1562
01:43:32,507 --> 01:43:34,340
So you keep that one.
We'll call it square.

1563
01:43:34,342 --> 01:43:36,742
[ Speaking Dari ]
Oh.

1564
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,545
Okay.
