[Intercom Buzzes]

20
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,838
Officer: Colonel Gilfillan
will address the men.

21
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,506
Aye, aye, sir.

22
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,553
Boatswain:
Now hear this.

23
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,145
Now hear this.

24
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,589
Gilfillan: Marines,
Company B, First Battalion,

25
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,456
this is Colonel Gilfillan.

26
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,792
We're gonna be landing on
a Jap-held island before long.

27
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,524
A couple of things
I've said to you before

28
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,159
I think are worth repeating.

29
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:46,463
When you hit that beach,

30
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,733
there's gonna be a lot of
noise and smoke and confusion.

31
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:51,034
You're gonna have
to keep your eyes

32
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,541
on your squad leaders
and platoon leaders.

33
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,737
I don't want any lost
little lambs runnin' around.

34
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,609
You know where lambs end up.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,807
And let's get it straight,
this is a big island.

36
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,281
There's a lot about it
we don't know yet,

37
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,648
and a lot
we're gonna have to find out

38
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,879
from theJaps themselves.

39
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:08,014
We used to say that the only
good Jap was a dead Jap.

40
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:11,492
I'll remind you
that that's changed.

41
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,791
From here on in,

42
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:18,425
a good Jap is also a Jap
prisoner who tells us things.

43
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,025
Now, this is an order.

44
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,503
Whenever possible,
you will take prisoners.

45
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,665
I say again,
you will take prisoners.

46
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,336
Some of us were together
at Guadalcanal

47
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,969
and again at Tarawa.

48
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,775
I was proud to be with you.

49
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,679
I know it will be
the same after this.

50
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,410
Believe me,

51
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:40,081
this trip is necessary.

52
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,784
All hands, good luck.

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,851
I'll see you on the beach.

54
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,493
Wouldn't you know,
I'd get a stinkin' cold.

55
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,934
What's the matter,
Whitney?

56
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,972
I don't like the dreams
I've been having.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,803
Ah, don't let it
worry you.

58
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,365
I've landed
on 2 Jap islands,

59
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,774
and I'm still here.

60
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,210
Yeah, but this guy
I'm a replacement for,

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,804
where's he?

62
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:06,940
Got a half inch
of whiskey.

63
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:07,948
It's all I got left
in the world.

64
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,575
- You want it?
- I don't drink.

65
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,313
You will.

66
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,319
Gonna make
some more

67
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,753
the first
minute I get.

68
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,688
No, thanks,
I don't drink.

69
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,453
Okay,just take this
ashore for me.

70
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:18,551
Come on.

71
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,323
What is it?

72
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,057
It's a gazintuh.

73
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,122
This <i>goes into</i> that.

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,565
It's a still!

75
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,330
Shh!

76
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:28,665
Just get it ashore.

77
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,070
Watch out for
Sergeant Zelenko.

78
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,164
But I don't drink.

79
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:35,267
Yeah, I know.
You told me, but I do.

80
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,911
Boatswain: Now hear this.

81
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,539
Now hear this.

82
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:44,450
All troops lay below
and prepare to debark.

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,648
All troops lay below
and prepare to debark.

85
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,215
Hey, you, Whitney.

86
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,783
What are you carrying,
a still?

87
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:52,793
Sergeant, I don't--

88
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,762
Now, look, pal,
we've a war to fight.

89
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:57,732
Yeah, and you're
gonna fight it sober.

90
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:02,399
Sergeant, I don't drink.

91
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,167
Come with me.

92
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,178
Now, listen to me...
you new men...

93
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,716
step up here.

94
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,150
Don't let Slattery
give you a snow job

95
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,482
and get you into trouble.

96
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,682
He's got no more sense than
a setting hen in a hurricane.

97
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:23,555
That's why
he's been a private

98
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,753
longer than any man
in the Marine Corps...

99
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,887
and he'll die
a private.

100
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,194
Don't have nothin'
to do with him.

101
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,734
Except when things
get tough,

102
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,771
stick to him
like plaster.

103
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,602
The best fighting man
I know.

104
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,335
But before and after,

105
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,241
he's a no-good,
money-burnin',

106
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,212
gin-drinkin'
horsehead.

107
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,442
Now, let's get moving.

108
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,781
Got a lot of coal to dig.

109
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,110
Hey, Zelenko!

110
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,486
Where's Lieutenant Anderson?

111
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,287
Coffman, you shouldn't
worry so much.

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,292
He'll be here.

113
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:02,062
Yeah, but he said he'd meet us
on the deck, like always.

114
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,998
Take your pack off and
loosen your leggings.

115
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,591
Did he ever miss
a train before?

116
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,729
Conroy: hey,
where's the lieutenant?

117
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,537
Pharmacist's mate:
I don't know.

118
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,768
Lieutenant, I--

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,808
Lieutenant, I--
I can't make it.

120
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,817
I'm sick.

121
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,477
You gotta
scratch me out.

122
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,892
[Crying]

123
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,725
Please, Lieutenant...

124
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:11,380
you've gotta get me out
of this landing.

125
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:15,444
I can't get away with it
anymore after...

126
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,280
Tarawa, the Canal.

127
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,779
Call me a psycho,
court-martial me.

128
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,687
I don't care!

129
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,555
The war's comin' out
of my ears! I'm sick!

130
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,153
Anderson, Thinking:
So am I.

131
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,891
Do you hear me,
Lieutenant?

132
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,525
Do you hear me?

133
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,626
Anderson: I hear you.

134
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,323
Anderson: Both of us had it
comin' out of our ears.

135
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,383
So what do I tell him,
think of ice cream sodas,

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,655
Fourth ofJuly?

137
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,994
There are no bands
playing here.

138
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,665
The first time I saw him
he was just as scared...

139
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,675
a hundred years ago.

140
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:47,071
Greetings, on this first day
of the new term.

141
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:54,208
Oh, I see we have a transfer
from Clinton High School.

142
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,309
Mr. Conroy, have you
ever had chemistry before?

143
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,059
Conroy.

144
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,567
Well, speak up.
Are you tongue-tied?

145
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,435
I--I--

146
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,479
He s-s-stutters.

147
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:25,638
[Laughing]

148
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,238
Quiet.

149
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:33,146
I apologize, Mr. Conroy.

150
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,450
You may sit down.

151
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:48,164
All right, Conroy,
repeat slowly after me,

152
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:52,196
hope is the mother
of all men.

153
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:58,235
Hope...is the mother...
of all men.

154
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,544
Uh, h-h-hope
is t-t-the--

155
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,549
Now, wait a minute.

156
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,882
Read that top line,
will ya?

157
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,853
The top one.

158
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:18,729
Uh...
S-S-September...

159
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,736
23rd...

160
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,738
1 940.

161
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:24,773
There you are.
You see?

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,239
You don't stutter as much
when you read.

163
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:28,538
No, not--
not much.

164
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,408
Now, Stuart,
listen to me.

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,574
Stuttering is a matter
of conflict and fear.

166
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,675
Maybe in your case,
fear of failure.

167
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,186
Now we may not be able
to cure all of it,

168
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,085
but I'm sure we'll be able
to fix that stuttering.

169
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,590
After all, we've got
a whole year to try.

170
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,957
So let's get started.

171
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,929
Now, close your eyes and
pretend that you're all alone,

172
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,295
and you see words
in your mind--

173
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:57,236
The words, hope is
the mother of all men.

174
00:10:57,306 --> 00:11:00,764
Now, close your eyes
and read what you see.

175
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,909
Uh...

176
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,379
hope...

177
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:10,885
is...the...

178
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,581
mother...

179
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:18,991
of...all...

180
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,494
men.

181
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:23,429
It worked.

182
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,728
Good. Now,
let's try it again.

183
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:30,966
Uh, hope...
is the mother...

184
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,472
of all men.

185
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,735
Swell.

186
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,841
Mr. Principal,

187
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:42,179
members of the faculty,

188
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,583
honored guests...

189
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:03,168
fellow graduates of
the class of 1 941 --

190
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:04,933
Hope...

191
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:09,706
Hope is the mother
of all men.

192
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,713
And as we leave
these hallowed halls,

193
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:14,715
we must, each one of us,

194
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,478
fearlessly hold on
to the belief

195
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,950
in the promise
of the future.

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,716
There is no limit
to our achievement.

197
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,724
What are you thinking,
Lieutenant, that I'm a coward?

198
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,726
Is that
what you're thinking?!

199
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,713
Thinking of
dear old school days.

200
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,748
That's a laugh!

201
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,682
No! I was thinking
you handled fear once,

202
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,584
you can
handle it again.

203
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:56,283
Mr. Conroy, have you
ever had chemistry before?

204
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,620
Boatswain:
now hear this.

205
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,320
Now hear this.

206
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:02,261
All hands go to
debarkation stations.

207
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,698
All hands go to
debarkation stations.

208
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,741
Okay, Lieutenant.

209
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:18,837
Let's walk.

210
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,044
I want to tell you men

211
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,745
who've never been
in combat before

212
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,253
that it's okay to be scared.
We're all scared.

213
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:05,089
But if anybody feels
like vomiting, do it now.

214
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,165
What's holdin' us up?
Let's get rollin'.

215
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,034
How many landings
you gotta make to learn

216
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:47,630
we circle out here until
they're ready for us?

217
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,903
I'm in a hurry to get home,
that's all.

218
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,912
You and Pretty Boy
buddies, are ya?

219
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,814
Sure. We kinda
look after each other.

220
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,681
He's tough.

221
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,879
He's a nice fellow,
but he is tough.

222
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,898
Something the matter,
Lieutenant?

223
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,799
Get out of here.

224
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,638
Hey, Doc, you better
talk to Anderson.

225
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,643
He's in some kind
of pain.

226
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,372
Did he ask for me?

227
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,379
No.

228
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,380
Then let me alone.

229
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,381
But, Doc, I--

230
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,439
If he needs me,
he'll ask for me.

231
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:31,643
Now, look, Doc,
I'm an old friend of his.

232
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,846
Let me alone,
I told you.

233
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:43,991
Doc: I'd do anything
for Anderson,

234
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,225
but it ain't up to me.

235
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,461
I ought to be on my farm
where I belong,

236
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:50,560
working with cows.

237
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:54,233
It's easy to figure
right and wrong with cows.

238
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,948
That's a honey of a pipe,
Lieutenant.

239
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,643
Say, thanks a lot.

240
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,116
Forget it, Doc.

241
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,346
The principal of
my old school sent it to me.

242
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,616
I don't smoke pipes.

243
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,715
Hey, uh...

244
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:15,159
you did a fine job getting
that plasma into me at Tarawa.

245
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:16,457
Forget it, sir.

246
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,795
The medical brass say I'll
be out of here pretty soon.

247
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,129
Hey, that's fine,
Lieutenant.

248
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,634
Yeah.

249
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:23,795
Sit down.

250
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,806
Go ahead,
it's all right.

251
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,275
There's an old witch
of a nurse out there

252
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:33,313
with an ear like radar and
a tongue like a fire bell.

253
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,972
Heh heh.

254
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:42,651
You know what
psychological migraine is?

255
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:43,655
A lot of pain
in the head,

256
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,986
no functional
disorder.

257
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,152
Heh heh, for a guy
who was a manure spreader

258
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,923
in South Dakota 3 years ago,
you're pretty hep.

259
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:51,692
Well, I always wanted
to be a doctor.

260
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,392
You know where
a migraine comes from?

261
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,733
I ain't that hep,
Lieutenant.

262
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,795
It comes from being scared
too many times

263
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,669
and wanting to run away...

264
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,868
and not running away.

265
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:04,376
I got it.

266
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,379
What do the doctors say?

267
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,109
I haven't told them.
I'm not going to.

268
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,946
I want you to see
that I'm supplied

269
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,820
with enough of these
to keep me going.

270
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,223
If the lieutenant will
excuse the expression,

271
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,895
the lieutenant
is a 5-star fool.

272
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,699
You have a chance to
go back to the states,

273
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:33,797
don't you want to live?

274
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,933
The gentleman on
the middle aisle says no.

275
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,567
Oh...

276
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,475
that's
no explanation.

277
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:40,478
What about
the future?

278
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:41,479
What about
your teaching?

279
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,606
Heh.

280
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,548
Yeah, I used to get
a bang standing up there,

281
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,552
pretending to know
all the answers.

282
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,453
But now?
Teach high school boys

283
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:53,015
the bright new world
of science after this?

284
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,152
Oh, Doc, you can have
the future for peanuts.

285
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,161
Listen, if you think
the future--

286
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,162
I had 44 men
in my platoon

287
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,664
when I started out
on the Canal.

288
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,962
Now I've got
37 replacements.

289
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,002
I believe in nothing
but the survivors.

290
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,059
Listen,
about the future, you--

291
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,628
Pigeon Lane, Slattery,
Pretty Boy, Coffman,

292
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:06,900
Conroy, Zelenko,
and you,

293
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:09,408
you're all I've got left
in the world.

294
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,467
I want to stay out here
till I'm dead...

295
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,877
or till we're all dead.

296
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,953
Now, how about
these painkillers?

297
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,614
It ain't gonna
help you very much.

298
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,850
They're only temporary.

299
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,187
Ha, so am I.

300
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,854
Listen, about this
psychological migraine,

301
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,157
I know
that it's something

302
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,197
you've got to
beat down by yourself

303
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:32,197
without medicine.

304
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,198
Yes or no, Doc?

305
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,199
If you don't solve
your own problems,

306
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,235
you're gonna be like
a full-grown man

307
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,530
hangin' on to your
mama's apron strings.

308
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:38,730
Yes or no?

309
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:39,898
Is that an order?

310
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,974
No.

311
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,101
Okay, I'll do it.

312
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,080
Thanks.

313
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:49,809
Yeah, but you're wrong
about the future.

314
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:52,776
Well, I was a farmer.

315
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:53,820
If we didn't believe
in the future,

316
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,320
we'd never grow wheat
to make the bread.

317
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,357
Oh, beat it, Doc.
I'm tired.

318
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,654
Oh, sorry. I--

319
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:02,990
So long.

320
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,133
Oh, hello, Doc.

321
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,499
What's the matter,
you sick?

322
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,764
No, I came to see
the lieutenant.

323
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,830
Anderson: Hi, Coffman.
Come on in.

324
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,202
Coffman: Lieutenant, I--
I brought you a book.

325
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,370
Oh, thanks.

326
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:21,437
Thanks very much.

327
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:22,812
Uh, Lieutenant, I--

328
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,248
I just dropped by
to thank you.

329
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:25,307
For what?

330
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,649
For pullin' me out of
the drink at Tarawa.

331
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,618
I pulled no one out
of the drink at Tarawa.

332
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,659
[Buzz]

333
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:33,624
But, Lieutenant,
they told me that you--

334
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:34,626
Forget it, Coffman,
in this war,

335
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,356
everybody's
a lifesaver.

336
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,057
But, Lieutenant,
a man saves your life,

337
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,120
it's only decent
to thank him.

338
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,860
Forget it.

339
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,631
What is this,
a clambake?

340
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,940
The old witch, huh?

341
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:50,306
Heh.

342
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:52,477
I see
the lieutenant's

343
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,945
been complaining
about me again.

344
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,379
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

345
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,679
He spoke
very highly of you.

346
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,946
You're a liar. Oh!

347
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,952
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,215
Oh.

349
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,431
What's the matter,
Doc?

350
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,527
You nervous?
You dropped your pipe.

351
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:20,095
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

352
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,338
Doc: did I do
the right thing?

353
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:27,675
Shouldn't I have told
the doctors?

354
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,010
How can he go on
fighting this war

355
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,947
with his head in a vise?

356
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,010

In January 1 942...

444
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,335
and a marine colonel
asked me

445
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,895
if I'd put on
an exhibition for them.

446
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,167
So I did.

447
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,802
I was walking around camp,
the general comes up to me,

448
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:05,281
and he says, "" Hey, you know,
we can use a fighter like you

449
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,976
to teach our fellas
how to box.""

450
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,519
I said, "" Me?""

451
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,851
He said, ""Sure.""

452
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,792
He says, ""You can box,
get all the fighting you want.""

453
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,797
So I joined.

454
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,856

but...

I'm gonna be a nobody.

say it again.

the kid alone?

516
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,666
He gets on my nerves.
Big talk. Big wind.

517
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:07,731
He saved my life.

518
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,710
His life's
worth saving, too.

519
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:11,973
Pretends he's something
he's not.

520
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:14,140
I know that.
You all know that.

521
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:15,945
What you don't know
is why.

522
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:19,283
It's because
he hates what he is.

523
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:24,954
How you doing, kid?

524
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:28,695
Oh, look, now,

525
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:30,664
I didn't mean
to hit you like that,

526
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:33,360
but I can't
let you get killed.

I'll get it for you
in the morning, okay?

531
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,485
Oh, leave me alone.

00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:46,258
See that nice range
of juicy hills?

534
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:50,272
Well, what's so special
about them?

535
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,272
They've ordered us

536
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,139
to take them
before lunch.

537
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,075
Oh.

[Rockets Firing]

539
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:33,439
Let's go.
Get outta there.

540
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:34,574
Come on,
get outta there.

541
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:38,354
Move.

542
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:39,353
What are they
throwing at us?

543
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:41,253
Just get going,
that's all. Move it.

544
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,257
Move it, move it!

545
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:46,260
What is it,
Lieutenant?

546
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,126
Move it, that's all.
Move it!

547
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:24,030
Hurry up.
Get yourselves in here.

548
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:40,606
Lieutenant,
company passed word

549
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:42,776
for us to pull back
to the ridge and dig in.

550
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,022
Zelenko, pull your squad
back to the ridge

551
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:55,257
and dig in pronto.

552
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,075
Anderson:
get back of that ridge!

553
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:13,513
You don't need a special
invite for this one.

554
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,244
Whitney, move out!

555
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:57,488
Anderson:
come on. Take cover.

556
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:15,940
Doc.

557
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,583
How many got it?

558
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:23,914
Enough.

559
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:25,283
How many
of the old bunch?

560
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:26,878
None.

561
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,728
Come on. Come on, Doc.
Give me some.

562
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:33,727
I gave you some
this morning.

563
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:34,728
I've still got my
head on, haven't I?

564
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:35,855
Yeah, you got it,
but you won't--

565
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:36,921
I want to run like crazy,
and I'm still here.

566
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:40,093
Give 'em to me.

567
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:42,330
Don't worry about
the apron strings, Doc.

568
00:42:42,405 --> 00:42:45,067
I told you
I'm not going home.

569
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:46,199
Lieutenant,

570
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,264
the company passed
the word down

571
00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:48,275
for us to dig in.

572
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:49,811
The navy's gonna
plaster the hills

573
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:51,107
with everything
they've got.

574
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,082
We're convinced that's where
the rockets are coming from.

575
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:56,778
What's the matter, Doc?

576
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:57,979
Nothing's
the matter.

577
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:01,788
Dickerman asked
for this pencil.

578
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:03,450
Here,
give it to him.

579
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,926
Come on, scram!

580
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:07,292
Doc, let's have them.

581
00:43:07,363 --> 00:43:08,523
Let's have them.

582
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:09,530
Here.

00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:16,935
There's the navy.

585
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:19,201
They'll wipe us out
before the navy gets it.

586
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,503
I gotta get the C.P.

587
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:28,949
You think this stuffll

588
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:29,985
really do the trick,
Lieutenant?

589
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:31,246
Oh, the Nips
don't have rockets.

590
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,810
They're just
kidding around.

591
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:44,228
If we don't get out of here,
we're gonna get ki--

592
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,734

593
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:48,326
Coffman?

594
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:49,462
Coffman!

595
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:52,372
Doc! Doc! It's Coffman!

596
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:53,908
I was
just talking to him.

597
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:54,908
I was just--
shut up.

598
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:55,909
Talking to him
a minute--

599
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:09,824
He kept
pestering everybody.

600
00:44:09,892 --> 00:44:10,950
All he wanted to know

601
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:13,359
was who pulled him
out of the drink at Tarawa.

602
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:14,919
You should have told him,
Lieutenant.

603
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:16,760
You know how to work
that radio?

604
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:17,764
Yes, sir.

605
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:18,765
Then get back
and work it

606
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,665
and connect me
with the C.P.

607
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:30,139
Cover him up.

608
00:44:37,186 --> 00:44:38,517
It's Coffman.

609
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,021
Give Whitney a hand,
will you?

610
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:47,159
[Crying]

611
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,663
Okay, okay.

612
00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:54,633
I don't understand it.

613
00:44:54,704 --> 00:44:58,299
I was talking to him just
a couple of minutes ago.

614
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:00,535
I was getting
to know him real well.

615
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:03,844
Give me his bayonet.

616
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,517

617
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:17,030
Well, you're now a member

618
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,361
Well, you're now a member

619
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:20,831
of a great universal
fraternity.

620
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:25,100
Congratulations.

Pansy baker 2.

623
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:39,548
Come in. Come in.

624
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:45,520
So I pulled him
out of the drink.

625
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:46,786
I gave him--

626
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,829
I gave him
6 more months to live.

627
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:53,798
For what?

628
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,767
This is Andy!

629
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,395
Was it you who said the Nips
don't have any rockets?

630
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:09,081
All right, we learned
that the hard way.

631
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,709
Don't waste time saying
we should have known.

632
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,184
Question is,
where are the rockets?

633
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:16,017
Where?

634
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,320
Sir, if my memory
serves me right,

635
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:22,418
the rocket is
a high-angle fire weapon

636
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:25,953
designed primarily to fire
over mountains and ridges.

637
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:28,626
Therefore, my guess
is that the rockets

638
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,670
are located on the reverse
slopes of the hill.

639
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:33,001
Sergeant Dickerman,
for your private information,

640
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,200
I'm well aware of what
the rocket is designed for.

641
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,775
For hours we've been pounding
those reverse slopes

642
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,284
with everything we've got.

643
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:48,253
So far we haven't
touched them.

644
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,881
Why? Where are they?!

645
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:52,891
Does the colonel
have a theory?

646
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:59,228
I sent out a patrol
instructed to take prisoners.

647
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,233
They killed Nips
and no prisoners.

648
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:03,269
When are these men
going to understand

649
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:04,598
the importance
of liveJaps?

650
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,003
You can't teach men
to hate and kill, Colonel,

651
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:08,802
then suddenly
teach them not to kill.

652
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,399
We teach them
to follow orders.

653
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:11,910
Colonel, may I suggest

654
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:13,445
that with the right kind
of indoctrination--

655
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:14,912
Sergeant Dickerman,
you're what's known

656
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:17,779
as a combat
correspondent.

657
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:18,943
Yes, sir.

658
00:47:19,018 --> 00:47:20,417
And since this is
your first combat,

659
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:21,954
I suggest you
correspond.

660
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,181
Don't worry yourself
about things

661
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:24,587
that don't concern you.

662
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:26,648
Sir, I'm concerned
about everything.

663
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:29,957
This war is as much
mine as yours.

664
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,291
We did get one Nip,
Colonel.

665
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:32,524
Charlie company found him

666
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,725
wandering around
about an hour ago.

667
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,767
What's the scoop on him?

668
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:36,324
I passed the word on
to regiment, sir,

669
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:37,995
and they said for us
to work him over.

670
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,096
SergeantJohnson's outside
questioning him now.

671
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:41,765
See what he's found out.

672
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:52,776
Now, rockets
or no rockets,

673
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,116
we've been ordered
to secure these hills.

674
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:57,952
It's 025 5 now.

675
00:47:58,024 --> 00:48:00,015
We jump off at 1 200.

676
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:02,493
That's exactly 9 hours
and 5 minutes from now.

677
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:05,622
Any comments?

678
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:07,825
If we try to take
those hills, Colonel,

679
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:09,766
the whole battalion
will be wiped out.

680
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:12,771
Unless we find a way to
wipe out the rockets first.

681
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,101
The general made this
our baby,

682
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:15,505
and we're gonna see
that it's well-diapered,

683
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,564
or you--

684
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,907
He'll be right in,
sir.

685
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,210
Johnson.

686
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:26,217
Yes, sir.

687
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,257
Well, any resemblance
of your present attire

688
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:38,889
to a marine uniform is--

689
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,125
You're impossible!

690
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,167
Yes, sir.

691
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:42,326
The colonel knows
it's a mistake

692
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:44,233
to let war interfere
with one's personal comfort.

693
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:46,272
Get rid of that
cigarette holder.

694
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:49,797
The colonel knows it's
the only way I enjoy smoking.

695
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,036
What about the Nip?

696
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,134
The Nip was in a cave

697
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:54,544
cut off by our artillery
from his own forces,

698
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:57,674
bypassed by us.
Rather unpopular, I think.

699
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,241
Last night he tried to make
contact with his blokes,

700
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,117
but ran into
Charlie Company.

701
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:04,418
He says the men he left
behind--1 0 of them--

702
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:06,857
Have been commanded to hold on
and fight to the death,

703
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,154
but they're
pretty well gone now,

704
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:11,197
and he rather guesses they'll
be willing to surrender.

705
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,231
Where's the cave?

706
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:14,289
The approximate position--
may I, sir?--

707
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,165
Is-- Is here.

708
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:18,704
What about the rockets?

709
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,068
He knows nothing
about them,

710
00:49:20,139 --> 00:49:21,572
but he thinks

01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:37,098
Samurai swords are worth
a very pretty drop.

890
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,379
<i>Tomare!</i>

891
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:54,046
I've persuaded
3 out of 5 to come out.

892
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:55,952
[Gunshot]

893
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:59,083
Number 4 has decided to join
the 47 heavenly warriors.

894
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,320
[Gunshot]

895
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:02,191
So has number 5,

896
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:03,958
and there's a wounded
officer down here

897
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:05,123
who wants some help.

898
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:07,064
<i>Iko</i>.

899
01:01:09,236 --> 01:01:10,828
Keep 'em covered.

900
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:16,603
If you just keep pointing me
in the right direction,

901
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,871
I'll be able to make it--

902
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,742
Sit down
and stay down.

903
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:27,147
Good boy.

904
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,121
Doc, come with me.

905
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,748
I want you to check
that wounded Nip,

906
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:32,349
see if we can
get him back alive.

907
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,724
Dickerman, watch Zelenko.

908
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,430
Lane, you and Slattery
frisk the Nips for grenades.

909
01:01:45,506 --> 01:01:46,438
On the double.

910
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:47,872
We want to
get out of here quick.

911
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:53,037
Good goin',Johnson.

912
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:54,513
See that the men
search 'em, will ya?

913
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:55,674
Yes, sir.

914
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,559
Please, tobacco,
give me.

915
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:09,653
Oh, no tobacco,
give me.

916
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:13,489
Always treat a human being
like a human being, old pal.

917
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,000
You'll be surprised
what happens.

918
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:34,519
What do you
think, Doc?

919
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:35,520
We don't
have much time.

920
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,318
I don't know.

921
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:38,881
I speak
English.

922
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,190
My name is Captain
Ishio Makino.

923
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:45,790
It is my misfortune
that I'm still alive.

924
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:46,798
Well, that's
all right, Captain.

925
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,232
We don't mind.
You understand

926
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:49,929
you'll be
treated decently?

927
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:51,767
I wish only to die.

928
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:52,771
I know you do,
but first

929
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,171
we'd like to ask you
a few questions.

930
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,208
I only know
that I've--

931
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,244
I have disgraced
my family.

932
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,336
To them I'm now dead.

933
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:00,573
Now look, Captain,

934
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:01,637
you're
an educated man.

935
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:03,615
I was never educated
to become a prisoner,

936
01:03:03,684 --> 01:03:05,709
and I will speak
to you no more.

937
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:07,786
If I give him
some plasma,

938
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,947
I think
he can make it.

939
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,490
Well, we haven't
got the time.

940
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:11,855
[Artillery Fire]

941
01:03:11,926 --> 01:03:13,860
[Explosion]

942
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:17,224
In the cave, quick!

943
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:20,392
Run those Nips
back up here!

944
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:21,560
Get him inside.

945
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,309
Look at that,
our own artillery.

946
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:33,641
What are they trying
to do, kill us?

947
01:03:33,714 --> 01:03:35,306
Those areJap
90 mm mortars.

948
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:36,349
Probably got an observer

949
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,578
up on one
of those ridges.

950
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,244
Come on. Better give him
the plasma, Doc.

951
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,811
We're stuck here
for a while anyway.

952
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,050
How am I gonna see?

953
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:47,458
I want to take
a look around.

954
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:49,689
Oh.

955
01:03:57,404 --> 01:03:58,962
Someone tell me
where we are now.

956
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,597
We're up
in the Nip cave.

957
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,642
Boy, we'll never
get out of here.

958
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,740
<i>Omae no namae wa nanda?</i>

959
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,350
Why don't you
spit in it, Doc?

960
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,445
Knock it off.

961
01:04:17,525 --> 01:04:20,016
[Explosions]

962
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:25,327
Hey, where's
the lieutenant?

963
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:27,898
Johnson.

964
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:31,727
Talk to him, will ya?

965
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:32,863
The old duffer's scared.

966
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,908
The captain must have
talked the whole family

967
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:35,907
into ""hari-kiri,""

968
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:36,965
but this one was
too shell-shocked

969
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:37,976
to have gone
through with it.

970
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:38,977
Whitney.

971
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,310
<i>Omae wa dare da?</i>

972
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:42,474
Oh, you're right.

973
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,847
He's too frightened
to know anything.

974
01:04:43,918 --> 01:04:44,850
Yeah.

975
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:46,750
Have Doc
take a look at him.

976
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:51,716
Well, we've got 5,
maybe 1 0 minutes

977
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,225
so start working
on the Nips.

978
01:04:53,294 --> 01:04:54,818
If we get any dope
on the rockets,

979
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:55,862
we can radio back.

980
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,490
Oh. Here's a map
I took off the captain.

981
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:00,659
Okay.

982
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,929
Duncanon,
search the dead.

983
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:05,062
Lane, you can
give him a hand.

984
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,333
I want all diaries
and maps.

985
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:07,533
Step on it. Let's go.

986
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,972
How's he doin'?

987
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,278
I don't know.

988
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,749
Whitney,
you set up here.

989
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,317
We're going to have to wait
till those mortars lift,

990
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:29,987
if they don't
take too long.

991
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,265
Picked up
your carbine

992
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:34,494
and your radio,
Lieutenant.

993
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:35,660
Mm-hmm.

994
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:36,964
And that's not all.

995
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:41,136
Now find a spot
where that radio will work...

996
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:46,044
without getting
your head blown off.

997
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,877
Johnson: Lieutenant,
I think I got something.

998
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,576
Slattery:
Pansy baker. Pansy baker.

999
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,583
What's up?

1000
01:05:51,652 --> 01:05:53,051
Take a look at this map.

1001
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,678
Now, according
to Colonel Gilfillan,

1002
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,188
the rockets are coming
from the general direction

1003
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:57,588
of these hills.

1004
01:05:57,658 --> 01:06:00,024
Here's a sugar cane field
next to them.

1005
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,425
Fukado.

1006
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:02,985
This man was in
an infantry company

1007
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:05,174
ticked off
to defend that field.

1008
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:06,331
He didn't see any rockets,

1009
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:08,775
but he did see a couple
of hundred coolie carts,

1010
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:10,505
and they all had
grooved wheels.

1011
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,911
So what?

1012
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:15,007
Coolie carts seldom have
grooved wheels.

1013
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:16,881
What does that suggest
to you, Lieutenant?

1014
01:06:16,952 --> 01:06:18,783
I don't know.
A railroad, I suppose.

1015
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:21,015
Well, what would a railroad
be doing in this wilderness?

1016
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,853
Look, if you've got
any ideas, spill them.

1017
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,620
We've no time
for guessing games.

1018
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:27,594
Well, it could be a railroad
carrying rocket shells.

1019
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:31,190
Mm-hmm...
or sugar cane.

1020
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:32,495
Slattery: I've got
the company, Lieutenant.

1021
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:34,502
Hold them.

1022
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,537
All right.

1023
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:37,071
See if you can get
some confirmation

1024
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,401
on your wacky idea

1025
01:06:38,474 --> 01:06:40,032
while I pass
the word on.

1026
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,382
This is Andy.

1027
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:56,186
Find target area 2-7-4,
Love and Mike.

1028
01:06:56,258 --> 01:06:59,489
West of hills.
Sugar cane field.

1029
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:04,294
<i>Oi, honto</i>
<i>no koto ie</i>.

1030
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:05,333
Tobacco, sir.

1031
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,392
I tell very good truth
for tobacco.

1032
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,664
Oh, you speak
English, huh?

1033
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,295
Oh, very good English,
sir.

1034
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:11,498
You see, before war,

1035
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,202
I am Tokyo guide
for American.

1036
01:07:14,276 --> 01:07:15,641
I am called Romeo.

1037
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:17,679
I buy everything
for Americans:

1038
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:20,078
kimono, painting, girl.

1039
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,343
I am very good man.

1040
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,384
Well, Romeo,
how long have you

1041
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:23,440
been on this island?

1042
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,079
Maybe a year
before you come.

1043
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:27,122
What's your work?

1044
01:07:27,189 --> 01:07:30,488
I tell truth.
I am truck driver.

1045
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,187
This is a big
sugar cane field here.

1046
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,696
Did you ever truck
things up there?

1047
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:37,891
What things?

1048
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,663
Maybe I have tobacco
for later, huh, sir?

1049
01:07:40,736 --> 01:07:42,829
Yeah.

1050
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:44,998
A whole pack.

1051
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:47,065
Oh, I be very good
to American.

1052
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:48,700
I buy kimono,
painting--

1053
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:50,802
Yeah. What did you
carry in the trucks?

1054
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,677
Concrete.

1055
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:56,184
Small rail. Big rail.
Little rail.

1056
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,049
Little engine also.

1057
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,109
What did they do
with them?

1058
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:00,849
I no know.

1059
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:04,022
The mortars have lifted.
Let's get out of here,

1060
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:05,025
on the double.

1061
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:06,391
Slattery, take the point.

1062
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:08,453
Whitney, you cover
the left flank.

1063
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,294
Dickerman,
stick with Zelenko.

1064
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,095
Doc, you nursemaid grandpa.

1065
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,429
Conroy, go with Slattery.

1066
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:17,433
Lane, you bring up
the rear.

1067
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:19,406
Duncanon, you cover
the right flank.

1068
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:20,772
Johnson, get those
Nips of yours

1069
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:22,071
to make a litter
for the officer.

1070
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:23,111
- Hurry it up.
- What did they say

1071
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:24,167
about the sugar cane field,
Lieutenant?

1072
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,178
Wrong spot.

1073
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:26,179
They say they've
blasted that field

1074
01:08:26,248 --> 01:08:27,272
from beer
to breakfast.

1075
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,577
The rockets
are still coming in.

1076
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:30,346
Okay.
We'll start back

1077
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:32,444
on a first leg
of 67 degrees

1078
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:34,682
till we hit
Susana Creek.

1079
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:36,156
6 hours left.

1080
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:38,716
We got to get back
in 3.

1081
01:08:38,794 --> 01:08:39,818
Where you going?

1082
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:40,827
I forgot my sword
and pistol.

1083
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:42,363
There's no time
for souvenirs.

1084
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:44,023
You've got your orders.
Get going!

1085
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,031
Yes, sir.

1086
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,533
All right,
let's walk.

1087
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:50,095
Would have brought
a pretty drop.

1088
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:43,752
This looks like
the best place to cross.

1089
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:44,815
Conroy,
you get over first.

1090
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:45,951
Look around.
We'll cover you.

1091
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:47,996
Slattery, you get the B.A.R.s
into position.

1092
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:49,724
Have the rest stand fast.
Hurry it up.

1093
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:55,136
Conroy's going across.
Cover him.

1094
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:57,536
Hold fast.

1095
01:09:57,606 --> 01:10:01,201
Conroy's going across.
Cover him.

1096
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:02,208
Hold fast.

1097
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,541
Okay, now.

1098
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:11,645
You're rear guard...

1099
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:13,238
and don't cross
till I signal.

1100
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:48,450
Anderson:
hold it up.

1101
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:49,643
Hold it up.
Hold it up.

1102
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,530
Anderson:
Snipers! Take cover!

1103
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:13,841
All right, into that gully.
Let's go!

1104
01:12:36,598 --> 01:12:39,965
Lane. Lane, you stay here
with the prisoners.

1105
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,469
Doc, Dickerman,
up on the road.

1106
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:43,698
Keep your eye out
for the flank.

1107
01:12:43,772 --> 01:12:46,332
The rest of us'll get after
those snipers. Let's go.

1108
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,519
Zelenko, you nuts?

1109
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:16,491
Lane, watch Zelenko.
Keep him with you.

1110
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,192
Aah!

1111
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:29,489
Hyah!

1112
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,105
Hyah!

1113
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:46,506
Aah!

1114
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,580
Water.

1115
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,953
Water,
please.

1116
01:14:54,024 --> 01:14:56,424
Water.

1117
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,482
Water.

1118
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,051
Give him some water,
Pidge.

1119
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,563
Fresh out.

1120
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,064
Well,
go get him some.

1121
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:20,741
Who is it?

1122
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:32,858
Pidge?

1123
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,590
They all gotta die.

1124
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:37,565
Pretty Boy,
are you nuts?

1125
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:38,601
After all we've
gone through

1126
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:39,794
to get
these prisoners?

1127
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,496
They all gotta die!

1128
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,436
Get back. Pidge!

1129
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:47,202
Okay, Tojo.

1130
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:48,471
You're first!

1131
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,103
No, Pretty Boy.

1132
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,875
Don't make me
shoot you.

1133
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,006
Pidge!

1134
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,278
Bugs and lice!

1135
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,751
They'll save the lives
of our own men, you fool!

1136
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:59,755
Pidge!

1137
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:00,790
They all gotta die!

1138
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:02,484
What are you trying
to do, Pretty Boy?

1139
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:06,188
He wants to kill
the prisoners, Pidge.

1140
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:07,991
Oh, don't, Pretty Boy.
Don't.

1141
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,033
I can't let you
do that.

1142
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:13,433
They stink.
They crawl.

1143
01:16:13,503 --> 01:16:14,902
They all
gotta die.

1144
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:16,734
Now, don't do it,
Pretty Boy.

1145
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,171
I don't like them
any more than you do,

1146
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,209
but we've got
to follow orders.

1147
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,335
Come on.
Drop your gun.

1148
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,184
Sit down over there.

1149
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,896
What'd you do,
you crazy punk?

1150
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,400
What'd you do?

1151
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,772
You dope! Why did you
pull the rifle?

1152
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,673
Pretty Boy.

1153
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,939
Kill 'em for me,
will ya?

1154
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:04,683
Doc!

1155
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:07,655
They ain't gonna
drive me out of town.

1156
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,022
I'll-- I'll cut
their tongues out.

1157
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,355
I didn't mean it,
Pretty Boy.

1158
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:12,451
You--you pulled
the rifle.

1159
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:14,224
It-it-it
was an accident.

1160
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,060
Kill them for me,
Pidge.

1161
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,827
You're my friend.

1162
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:19,892
I-I'm a big shot
in my town.

1163
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,233
Don't you forget it.

1164
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:26,833
You shouldn't have
pulled the rifle!

1165
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:27,842
Pidge.

1166
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:32,608
I don't want to die.

1167
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,116
I don't want to die.

1168
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,875
Come on, men.
Hurry it up.

1169
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:12,854
Conroy, you and Whitney
pull in Doc and that writer.

1170
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,048
They're down on the road.

1171
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,818
And snap it up. We're late.

1172
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:16,824
Come on.

1173
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:41,644
Who else got it?

1174
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,618
I killed him.

1175
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:45,449
What?

1176
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:46,579
I murdered him.

1177
01:18:46,656 --> 01:18:49,147
No. He didn't do it,
Lieutenant.

1178
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,590
I heard it.

1179
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,094
Pretty Boy
blew his top.

1180
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,891
He wanted to kill
the prisoners.

1181
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,626
Pidge did it
in the line of duty.

1182
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,031
I'm a murderer.

1183
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:00,899
He pulled
my rifle.

1184
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,267
All right! Shut up!

1185
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:09,436
Is that the way
it happened?

1186
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:10,945
Yes, sir.

1187
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,444
Sir, he was just
a mixed-up kid. I...

1188
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:20,847
I could've
straightened him out

1189
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:25,224
if I'd only had
a little more time.

1190
01:19:25,295 --> 01:19:27,627
He was gonna be
my fight manager.

1191
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:31,898
For a bunch
of crummyJaps.

1192
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:33,959
Take it easy.
I liked Pretty Boy, too,

1193
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:36,801
but he disobeyed orders.

1194
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:39,603
It happens sometimes.

1195
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,769
Not often,
but it happens.

1196
01:19:45,682 --> 01:19:49,948
Slattery,
you and Johnson bury him.

1197
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:51,247
I'm sorry to hurry, Lane,

1198
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:52,879
but we gotta get
out of here fast.

1199
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:55,550
I'll bury him myself.

1200
01:19:57,694 --> 01:19:59,915
You won't lose any time,
Lieutenant.

1201
01:20:22,604 --> 01:20:25,471
Doc: Now I can go back
to being a farmer.

1202
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:27,441
Dickerman:
sure you can.

1203
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:29,272
Fine corpsman I am.

1204
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:33,140
Hey, I-I ain't
supposed to be

1205
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:34,273
on the receiving end.

1206
01:20:34,349 --> 01:20:35,941
Take it easy,
Doc. Don't talk.

1207
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,817
You like Anderson?

1208
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:41,651
Yeah.

1209
01:20:41,723 --> 01:20:44,886
I've known him
from the beginning.

1210
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,190
He is the best.

1211
01:20:47,262 --> 01:20:48,627
I'll take your
word for it,

1212
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:50,324
but relax now,
will ya?

1213
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,425
Okay. I'm okay.

1214
01:20:56,905 --> 01:21:01,069
Men like Anderson
gotta live and go home,

1215
01:21:01,143 --> 01:21:02,974
tell them what it's like.

1216
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:04,706
Please, Doc, huh?

1217
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,840
I am a corpsman, right?

1218
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,679
Right. Then I know
my condition.

1219
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,611
Well, will you talk
to him about it,

1220
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,714
sometime?

1221
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,960
You speak his language,
being a writer.

1222
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,791
Sure. Yeah.

1223
01:21:21,863 --> 01:21:23,455
I...

1224
01:21:23,532 --> 01:21:25,557
I put down on paper

1225
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:29,331
something I've been trying
to tell the lieutenant.

1226
01:21:29,404 --> 01:21:30,530
It ain't finished,

1227
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:33,234
but will you
take a look at it?

1228
01:21:33,308 --> 01:21:35,299
Maybe fix it up?

1229
01:21:35,377 --> 01:21:37,402
You know what I mean.
Being a writer, you know.

1230
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:40,505
Okay, but pipe down
now, huh?

1231
01:21:40,582 --> 01:21:42,413
Pipe.

1232
01:21:42,484 --> 01:21:44,111
Pipe.

1233
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:49,889
It's Doc.

1234
01:22:02,337 --> 01:22:04,134
How bad is it?

1235
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:06,071
He'll be okay, I think.

1236
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:12,680
Hold it.

1237
01:22:15,817 --> 01:22:18,377
Doc, what are you
trying to pull?

1238
01:22:18,453 --> 01:22:19,818
You can't--

1239
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,152
Dead?

1240
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:30,823
Yeah. Why not?

1241
01:22:32,901 --> 01:22:33,833
Bury him quick.

1242
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:35,836
We gotta get out
of here fast.

1243
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,574
What happened?

1244
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:46,273
Will someone tell me
what happened?

1245
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:47,975
It's poor old Doc.

1246
01:23:03,598 --> 01:23:05,532
What's the matter
with you guys?

1247
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,467
Get on with it!
We gotta walk.

1248
01:23:08,537 --> 01:23:11,836
Someone get the dead men's
personal effects.

1249
01:23:11,907 --> 01:23:14,467
Someone take a compass
reading of this place.

1250
01:23:14,543 --> 01:23:17,171
We'll have to notify
the graves registration.

1251
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:19,406
And someone take
their weapons and ammo.

1252
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,768
My patrol has just been
reported in, sir.

1253
01:24:14,836 --> 01:24:16,963
[Explosions]

1254
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,238
Yes, Colonel.
I know what time it is.

1255
01:24:24,746 --> 01:24:26,475
Aye, aye, sir.

1256
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:34,088
[Explosions]

1257
01:24:35,424 --> 01:24:39,292
Between this stinking cold
and those stinking rockets,

1258
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:42,091
I'm gonna end up
a mental case!

1259
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,495
Well, where's that patrol?

1260
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:45,829
It was reported in
1 0 minutes ago.

1261
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,114
Anderson,
what's the scoop?

1262
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:08,952
We got 4 prisoners
for you

1263
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:10,457
and a shell-shocked
old man.

1264
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:12,550
These are their
effects.

1265
01:25:12,627 --> 01:25:15,027
I lost 2 men.

1266
01:25:15,096 --> 01:25:17,963
One of them
was a corpsman...

1267
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:20,627
C.E. "" Doc"" Jones.

1268
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:27,572
Anything
on the rockets?

1269
01:25:27,642 --> 01:25:29,132
No, sir.

1270
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:31,804
We've bombed and shelled

1271
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,871
every inch of those
reverse slopes,

1272
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:35,541
and they're still
comin'.

1273
01:25:40,622 --> 01:25:42,749
McCreavy, start
interrogating thoseJaps.

1274
01:25:42,824 --> 01:25:44,587
And don't forget time, time,
time is the essence.

1275
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:46,593
All we got
are 90 minutes.

1276
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:49,425
All right, sir.
Paskowicz. Davis.

1277
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:51,591
Colonel,
I'd like to get back

1278
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:53,600
to my men
as soon as possible.

1279
01:25:53,668 --> 01:25:55,602
No. Work with Mac
and that fantasticJohnson.

1280
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,967
You know the prisoners.

1281
01:25:57,038 --> 01:25:59,233
Yes, sir.Johnson's
already at work.

1282
01:26:02,777 --> 01:26:03,937
Anderson.

1283
01:26:04,012 --> 01:26:05,206
Yes, sir?

1284
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:10,812
Thanks.
That was a good job.

1285
01:26:10,886 --> 01:26:12,080
Thank you, sir.

1286
01:26:19,194 --> 01:26:19,628
Johnson:
You must put your mind

1287
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:21,118
Johnson:
You must put your mind

1288
01:26:21,196 --> 01:26:22,629
on different thoughts,
captain.

1289
01:26:22,697 --> 01:26:24,130
When the war's over,

1290
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:26,133
you can go back
and rebuild your country.

1291
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:28,999
You've much to live for.
You'll live well.

1292
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:31,834
Sergeant, you seem
to have forgotten

1293
01:26:31,907 --> 01:26:34,000
that for generations

1294
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:36,134
my people think
not of living well

1295
01:26:36,211 --> 01:26:37,974
but of dying well.

1296
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:40,640
Have you not studied
our philosophy,

1297
01:26:40,715 --> 01:26:43,047
military science,

1298
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:45,313
our judo wrestling?

1299
01:26:45,387 --> 01:26:47,014
Do you not remember

1300
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:49,318
that we always
take the obvious

1301
01:26:49,391 --> 01:26:51,256
and reverse it?

1302
01:26:51,326 --> 01:26:54,159
So, reverse
the role of life.

1303
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:58,325
To us, it is death
that is desirable.

1304
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,369
It is the source
of our strength.

1305
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:03,028
Do not say to me

1306
01:27:03,104 --> 01:27:05,766
that I have
anything to live for.

1307
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,432
And now, Sergeant,

1308
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:10,137
I believe I know what
information you are seeking.

1309
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:11,906
Will you help us?

1310
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,948
Go... bring
commissioned officer.

1311
01:27:14,015 --> 01:27:15,778
Well,
I'm the expert here,

1312
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:18,466
but this is no time
to stand on pride.

1313
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:21,894
How's it going,
Johnson?

1314
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:22,901
Oh, pretty good, sir.

1315
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,562
Lieutenant,
the captain just told me

1316
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,402
he's willing to talk...
but to an officer.

1317
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:27,406
Good.

1318
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,303
[Coughing]

1319
01:27:36,984 --> 01:27:38,918
Take care
of this mess.

1320
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:40,749
The boys
are aiming better.

1321
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,119
What's happened
to him?

1322
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,859
He's committed hara-kiri.

1323
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,691
And with your knife,
SergeantJohnson.

1324
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,196
I thought I'd lost it.

1325
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:52,198
It never occurred to me
someone had taken it.

1326
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:54,200
Makino:
Sir, is custom to finish hara-kiri

1327
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:55,735
with gun. Please.

1328
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,395
Sorry. The situation
doesn't allow

1329
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,564
for peacetime
customs.

1330
01:27:58,639 --> 01:27:59,571
Get a corpsman.

1331
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,073
I'm afraid
it's too late.

1332
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,742
He's dead.

1333
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,870
Take his body outside.

1334
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,549
Your negligence
cost us a prisoner.

1335
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,887
Take it easy, Mac.

1336
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,952
It could have happened
to any one of us.

1337
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:22,961
Forget it.

1338
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,554
Lieutenant.
Yeah.

1339
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,896
I have Pretty Boy's and
Doc's personal effects here.

1340
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,663
What should I do
with them?

1341
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,203
Go through them.

1342
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,278
Hey, uh, put this on
for me, will you?

1343
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:42,748
Sure.

1344
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,751
Well, I guess
it's up to us

1345
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,753
to pay off
this stinkin' business.

1346
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,085
You're the big brain.
What do we do first?

1347
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,590
Well, let's start
working on Romeo.

1348
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,592
He's one of those
know-it-all types

1349
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,628
that if we flatter
the wig off him,

1350
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:55,627
he'll chatter

1351
01:28:55,696 --> 01:28:57,391
like a gooney bird
at mating time.

1352
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:58,796
Okay. Here,
I'll finish it.

1353
01:28:58,866 --> 01:28:59,798
Say, Lieutenant.

1354
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,095
Yeah?

1355
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,602
What do I do
about this stuff?

1356
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,602
What's that?

1357
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,603
Doc's and Pretty Boy's--

1358
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,105
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Well, check it

1359
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,608
and see if there's anything
embarrassing to their families,

1360
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:09,608
and we'll send it on.

1361
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,110
Okay,Johnson.
Let's get rolling.

1362
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:20,115
Nomura:
<i>Watanabe, kiotsukero</i>.

1363
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:30,463
Romeo.
Yes, sir.

1364
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,964
We're looking
for a man

1365
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,660
who can handle
important matters.

1366
01:29:33,734 --> 01:29:35,668
Yes, sir. In Tokyo I buy--

1367
01:29:35,736 --> 01:29:37,670
One who can speak
English well.

1368
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:39,171
Oh, make speak
greatly.

1369
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,174
A man who'd be
in charge

1370
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,506
of a big Japanese
prisoner of war camp.

1371
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,102
I a good man.

1372
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,079
Yeah. But we've
got to trust you,

1373
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,410
understand?

1374
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:49,414
Yes, sir. You trust me.

1375
01:29:49,483 --> 01:29:51,246
You see, if we can
trust you, we can--

1376
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,251
Lieutenant,
I found something

1377
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,582
in Pretty Boy's stuff
that I--

1378
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,417
I told you what you're
supposed to do with it.

1379
01:29:55,489 --> 01:29:56,581
- Yes, sir, but--
- Later.

1380
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,420
Lieutenant, you've got
to look at what I found.

1381
01:29:58,492 --> 01:30:00,392
Look, Dickerman, will you
please not interrupt?

1382
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:02,429
Will you just take
a look at it, sir?

1383
01:30:02,496 --> 01:30:03,929
Hold it
till I get back.

1384
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:05,192
Okay.

1385
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:08,995
All right.
What've you got?

1386
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,769
CallJohnson.

1387
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,273
Dickerman:
Johnson.

1388
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:24,749
Take over, will you?

1389
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,650
This is a Jap overlay.

1390
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:28,780
It shows one of their
positions in the hills.

1391
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,323
What's this symbol
mean?

1392
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,959
It means fire.
Where did you get this?

1393
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,122
In this case. I found it
in Pretty Boy's stuff.

1394
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:38,290
The question is,

1395
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,129
did Pretty Boy
find it in the cave?

1396
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,135
He might have had it
for months.

1397
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:42,999
I'll find out.

1398
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,231
Andy, the colonel sent me
to take over the interrogation,

1399
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,069
but he said if you're
doing all right

1400
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:48,073
just to keep going.

1401
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,166
No, I'll stick with it.

1402
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,210
All right.

1403
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,711
[Rocket Whistling]

1404
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,582
Ha. Need a torch
to keep them lit

1405
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,083
out here.

1406
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,085
Yeah, it is
from the cave.

1407
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:01,087
Belonged
to his sergeant.

1408
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:03,589
Okay. Butterfield, fit
this overlay to the map

1409
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,558
I took off Makino,
will you?

1410
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,594
That's a good idea,
but it'll take hours.

1411
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,653
Well, give it a whirl
anyway, huh?

1412
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:13,231
5 5 minutes to go.

1413
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:16,734
Oh, yakky doc,
yakky doc.

1414
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,271
Come on, baby.

1415
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:20,807
Start pouring,
yakky doc.

1416
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,673
Oh, give with that
first pretty drop, huh?

1417
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:26,508
I ain't got all day.
Oh, sweetheart,

1418
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:29,208
oh, make old Slattery
happy.

1419
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:31,513
Come on, let's see some
of that angel juice.

1420
01:31:31,585 --> 01:31:33,246
[Incoming Rocket]

1421
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,123
Andy...

1422
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,791
Andy...

1423
01:31:46,867 --> 01:31:48,835
Don't be scared.

1424
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,700
Don't be scared.

1425
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,744
I'm not frightened.

1426
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:59,837
You know it, Andy.

1427
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:03,406
[Panting]
It doesn't hurt me,

1428
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:04,951
you know.

1429
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,218
Boy,
that was close!

1430
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,423
You don't count
the close ones.

1431
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,601
Aw, come on, baby,
start pourin'!

1432
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:23,603
That thing's
never gonna pour.

1433
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,639
You've done everything
but sing to it.

1434
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,373
Sitting
in O'Reilly's bar

1435
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:31,308
Listening to the tales
of blood and thunder

1436
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,210
Came a thought
into my mind

1437
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,612
Why not love
O'Reilly's daughter?

1438
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,446
Fiddly-I-e,
fiddly-I-o

1439
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:39,611
Fiddly-I-e
for the one-eyed Reilly

1440
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:41,882
Rub a dub dub,
kiss and hug

1441
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:43,617
Rub a dub dub,
love on

1442
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,955
I grabbed that sea witch
by the hair--

1443
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:49,888
Corpsman!
Corpsman!

1444
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:52,228
I think I got it.

1445
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:55,530
Andy.

1446
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:56,763
Andy.

1447
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,101
Oh, where is he?

1448
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,107
Get him for me,
will you, Pigeon?

1449
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:02,608
He's gotta know.

1450
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,840
Hope...

1451
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,681
is the mother...
of all men.

1452
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:16,522
We must...

1453
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:20,117
hold... on
to that belief.

1454
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:24,062
Andy!

1455
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:41,114
It's too late,
Mac.

1456
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:42,615
He got the count.

1457
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:09,274
Come on, Bill.
What's holding you up?

1458
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,072
Andy, all I got
on this overlay

1459
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,578
is 3 little wiggles.

1460
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,240
And there's 3 little wiggles
just like them on this map.

1461
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:16,248
Mm-hmm.

1462
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,251
Now all I got to do
is find them.

1463
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,752
Would y'all
like to try it?

1464
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,912
Okay. Go ahead.

1465
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,752
Now if we only knew
where to start with it.

1466
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,088
Forward slope,
reverse slope,

1467
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,094
east flank,
west flank...

1468
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,754
well, here's
where we were

1469
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,127
when the rockets
first hit us.

1470
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:32,790
The Nips probably
stuck them

1471
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:34,767
on the reverse slope,
so try it in there, huh?

1472
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,102
Reverse slope.
Check.

1473
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:45,344
Man, what a job. I'll be
here the rest of the war.

1474
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:46,901
Well,
just keep pushin'.

1475
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:49,243
Johnson, you better get
back to friend Romeo.

1476
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:50,339
Okay.

1477
01:34:56,689 --> 01:34:59,021
Come on, come on.

1478
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,422
[Spanish Accent]
Lieutenant Anderson?

1479
01:35:00,493 --> 01:35:01,425
Yeah?

1480
01:35:01,494 --> 01:35:02,961
You got
an old Nip to go?

1481
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:04,428
Yeah, he's in there.
First door.

1482
01:35:04,497 --> 01:35:05,464
Yes, sir.

1483
01:35:05,531 --> 01:35:06,657
Texas?

1484
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:08,325
Yes.
How did you know?

1485
01:35:08,401 --> 01:35:09,425
How could I miss?

1486
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:11,436
My uncle's got a big
business in El Paso.

1487
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:13,267
Yeah. Well,
that explains it.

1488
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:19,210
I come for
the old Nip.

1489
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:21,575
Come on, old sport.

1490
01:35:21,647 --> 01:35:24,411
I'm gonna take you
to a nice, quiet place.

1491
01:35:24,484 --> 01:35:27,282
Hey, come on, pops.
I ain't got all day.

1492
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:34,483
[Speaking Japanese]

1493
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,857
Matsuoda-san.

1494
01:35:35,928 --> 01:35:37,452
[Both Speaking Japanese]

1495
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:39,020
Get over there.

1496
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:41,157
[To Himself]
Matsuoda-san.

1497
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,234
Hold it, chum.

1498
01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:50,570
Lieutenant.

1499
01:35:50,643 --> 01:35:52,076
Did he get it?

1500
01:35:52,145 --> 01:35:53,737
No, sir.
Just knocked cold.

1501
01:35:53,813 --> 01:35:54,745
Lieutenant,
it's important

1502
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:56,714
that we keep
the old man with us.

1503
01:35:56,783 --> 01:35:58,683
Okay. Take him
to the aid station.

1504
01:35:58,751 --> 01:36:00,742
Let me know as soon
as he comes around.

1505
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:05,485
[Coughing]

1506
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:08,426
What's the story
on it?

1507
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:09,927
The old man
didn't want to be

1508
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:11,258
taken away
from Nomura.

1509
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:12,592
He begged him
to interfere.

1510
01:36:12,665 --> 01:36:14,189
Nomura kicked him
to shut him up.

1511
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,098
Did he say anything
of value to us?

1512
01:36:16,169 --> 01:36:17,932
Yes, sir. He called
Nomura Matsuoda,

1513
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:19,403
which must be
his real name.

1514
01:36:19,472 --> 01:36:20,530
Nomura is Matsuoda.

1515
01:36:20,606 --> 01:36:21,937
Ah, good for grandpa.

1516
01:36:22,008 --> 01:36:24,442
Okay, now let's get
acquainted with Matsuoda.

1517
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:26,444
Let's first find out
from Romeo

1518
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:27,774
why Matsuoda's
lying, sir.

1519
01:36:27,847 --> 01:36:28,779
Right.

1520
01:36:35,822 --> 01:36:37,380
Nomura!

1521
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:40,017
Romeo...
who is this man?

1522
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:43,459
Oh, yes, sir.

1523
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:44,723
He is Nomura.

1524
01:36:44,797 --> 01:36:46,059
Private
in naval battalion,

1525
01:36:46,132 --> 01:36:47,224
like me.

1526
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,392
What was his job?

1527
01:36:48,468 --> 01:36:49,560
He do many things.

1528
01:36:49,635 --> 01:36:50,567
Did he mix
cement?

1529
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:51,660
Oh, yes.

1530
01:36:51,737 --> 01:36:53,261
Tell him to hold
out his hands.

1531
01:36:53,339 --> 01:36:54,772
<i>Te o dase</i>.

1532
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:56,570
His hands are soft.
You're lying!

1533
01:36:56,642 --> 01:36:58,507
Now stand up
and tell us the truth!

1534
01:36:58,578 --> 01:36:59,772
<i>Kiotsuke!</i>

1535
01:36:59,846 --> 01:37:01,905
We know that his name
is Matsuoda.

1536
01:37:01,981 --> 01:37:03,642
Now, who is he?

1537
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,380
He is officer.

1538
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,752
He are a big man.

1539
01:37:10,823 --> 01:37:12,415
Very big
in allJapan.

1540
01:37:12,492 --> 01:37:14,585
Of course.
Big general maybe, huh?

1541
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,594
Navy captain?

1542
01:37:16,662 --> 01:37:18,152
Air force colonel?

1543
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:21,098
Oh, no. He are
a major in army.

1544
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,761
But in Japan,
I know his name.

1545
01:37:23,836 --> 01:37:25,929
I make gamble
money on him.

1546
01:37:26,005 --> 01:37:28,439
He is big... very big
baseball player.

1547
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:29,770
What team?

1548
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:31,366
Meiji University.

1549
01:37:31,444 --> 01:37:34,413
But surely you're not
interested in baseball.

1550
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,209
I am.

1551
01:37:36,282 --> 01:37:38,113
Come on,Johnson.
Let's go.

1552
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:44,019
Oh, Lieutenant
Anderson.

1553
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,022
Yeah.

1554
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:46,422
We brought
the old man around.

1555
01:37:46,492 --> 01:37:47,925
Good. You get
back to him.

1556
01:37:47,994 --> 01:37:48,926
Yes, sir.

1557
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:50,519
Talk to him.
I'll handle our major.

1558
01:37:50,596 --> 01:37:52,564
Right. But, Lieutenant,
if I may make a suggestion:

1559
01:37:52,632 --> 01:37:54,725
tear down his ego. He's
rolling in pride and vanity.

1560
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,028
Okay.

1561
01:38:16,589 --> 01:38:18,420
Meiji University
teaches engineering,

1562
01:38:18,491 --> 01:38:20,482
doesn't it?

1563
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,528
Japanese universities
teach everything.

1564
01:38:22,595 --> 01:38:24,756
What kind of
an engineer are you?

1565
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,922
Railroad.

1566
01:38:25,998 --> 01:38:27,431
I have 3 university
degrees.

1567
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,933
Uh-huh. And in spite

1568
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:30,935
of your 3 university
degrees,

1569
01:38:31,003 --> 01:38:33,028
your rank and your name,
you're a coward.

1570
01:38:33,105 --> 01:38:35,938
You hide
in a private's uniform.

1571
01:38:36,008 --> 01:38:37,942
Lieutenant,
you're a fool.

1572
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:39,443
All right.
What's your story?

1573
01:38:39,512 --> 01:38:41,446
You'll know the story
when you see

1574
01:38:41,514 --> 01:38:43,448
the number of dead you have
through my efforts.

1575
01:38:43,516 --> 01:38:45,279
You're a liar!
You probably got to be

1576
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:47,285
a major because your
family had influence!

1577
01:38:47,353 --> 01:38:49,981
I became a major
because I planned a big--

1578
01:38:52,525 --> 01:38:53,787
Lieutenant...

1579
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:56,453
you seem to know
Japanese psychology.

1580
01:38:56,529 --> 01:38:58,861
But I'm smart, too.

1581
01:38:58,931 --> 01:39:00,796
I know you know.

1582
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:02,800
I say no more.

1583
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:06,929
The rule of war states
I give only my name and rank.

1584
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:09,304
Major Kenji Matsuoda.

1585
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,501
No more.

1586
01:39:10,576 --> 01:39:12,237
This is important,
Lieutenant.

1587
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,748
Dickerman, tell the colonel
we stumbled onto something.

1588
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:23,152
One of the Nip privates
is a major. Hurry it up.

1589
01:39:23,222 --> 01:39:24,154
Yes, sir.

1590
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:25,315
What did you
find out?

1591
01:39:25,391 --> 01:39:27,154
The old man told me that
Matsuoda lived with him

1592
01:39:27,226 --> 01:39:28,989
and his son a year ago
on their plantation.

1593
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,824
He treated them well,
but after a while

1594
01:39:30,896 --> 01:39:32,830
he moved them out, and
the army built a tunnel

1595
01:39:32,898 --> 01:39:34,160
from the house
for wolf-tails.

1596
01:39:34,233 --> 01:39:35,495
What are wolf-tails?

1597
01:39:35,568 --> 01:39:37,502
Rockets. Lieutenant,
don't you remember

1598
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:39,834
what I said to you in the
cave about grooved wheels?

1599
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:42,305
They're using that tunnel
to transport rockets.

1600
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:43,706
Yeah, you're right.

1601
01:39:43,776 --> 01:39:45,971
That's why we couldn't
see the rail line from the air.

1602
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:47,103
Where's the house?

1603
01:39:47,179 --> 01:39:48,942
He said it's on
a sugar plantation.

1604
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:50,949
Wait a minute. There was
that sugar cane field

1605
01:39:51,017 --> 01:39:52,678
you found
on Captain Makino's map.

1606
01:39:52,752 --> 01:39:53,946
That's right.

1607
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,954
Where are they? Let me
take a look at this, Bill.

1608
01:39:56,022 --> 01:39:56,954
Let's see.

1609
01:39:57,023 --> 01:39:58,786
There it is,
and there's the house.

1610
01:39:58,858 --> 01:40:00,792
But how can we be sure
it's his house?

1611
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:03,294
He says that when he stands
in front of his house,

1612
01:40:03,362 --> 01:40:04,294
there's water on his left.

1613
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:06,297
Here we are...water.
It's a lake.

1614
01:40:06,365 --> 01:40:08,299
It's in front of and to one
side of the ranch house.

1615
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:10,301
And on the right
some hills and woods.

1616
01:40:10,369 --> 01:40:12,030
Here we are. Hills
and woods to the right.

1617
01:40:12,104 --> 01:40:14,163
And he says that in front
of his house there's a hill

1618
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,140
some distance away with a road
on the other side.

1619
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,869
There's the hill.
There's the road. Right.

1620
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:18,967
Bill, those rockets
are somewhere near

1621
01:40:19,045 --> 01:40:20,239
that ranch house.

1622
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,177
Now work the overlay
around there, quick!

1623
01:40:22,248 --> 01:40:23,442
Right.

1624
01:40:23,516 --> 01:40:25,950
Boy, this climate is sure
death on a man's pleasures.

1625
01:40:26,018 --> 01:40:28,486
All right, Anderson.
Let's have a look at that Nip.

1626
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:30,488
It's no use, Colonel.
I've been at him.

1627
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:31,648
He won't talk.

1628
01:40:31,724 --> 01:40:33,157
What have we got
here?

1629
01:40:33,225 --> 01:40:35,125
Found a Jap overlay.
If we match it right,

1630
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:36,422
the rockets'll
be pinpointed.

1631
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:39,020
That'll take all day.
We've got 45 minutes.

1632
01:40:42,168 --> 01:40:44,068
Will you wipe
my forehead?

1633
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,438
Wasn't there
a General Sherman or somebody

1634
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:49,440
who once made
a vulgar comment on war?

1635
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:52,272
Yeah. He said ""war is hell.""
And what did he know about it?

1636
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:54,312
That eight-ball
never left the states.

1637
01:40:55,881 --> 01:40:57,974
Colonel, if we don't
get it in time,

1638
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,779
can't we postpone
h-hour?

1639
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:02,685
With 20,000 men
jumping off in 41 minutes?

1640
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,290
Anderson, I want
a crack at that Nip.

1641
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:08,292
- Get him out here.
- Aye, sir.

1642
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,452
Butterfield:
still not

1643
01:41:09,528 --> 01:41:10,552
gettin'
anywhere.

1644
01:41:10,629 --> 01:41:12,529
You're doing your best.
Stay with it.

1645
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:17,828
[Coughing]

1646
01:41:20,272 --> 01:41:21,864
Major Matsuoda.

1647
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:31,149
If you didn't want
to live,

1648
01:41:31,217 --> 01:41:33,481
you wouldn't be wearing
that disguise.

1649
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:38,990
Now, you're gonna answer
my questions, Major Matsuoda.

1650
01:41:41,227 --> 01:41:43,161
You will not find
rockets.

1651
01:41:43,229 --> 01:41:45,754
They will fall on you
like rain.

1652
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:49,062
You Americans do not learn
very good from Japan.

1653
01:41:49,135 --> 01:41:51,399
You should learn
to accept your fate

1654
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:52,937
to die well.

1655
01:41:53,005 --> 01:41:54,939
We die well.

1656
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:57,271
As Captain Makino said,
we all die well.

1657
01:41:57,309 --> 01:41:58,404
Wait a minute.

1658
01:41:58,537 --> 01:42:00,300
He's told us
something.

1659
01:42:00,373 --> 01:42:02,307
Die well...

1660
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:04,309
while I was talking
to Captain Makino,

1661
01:42:04,377 --> 01:42:05,810
there was something
he said.

1662
01:42:05,878 --> 01:42:07,812
I wish I could remember
his exact words.

1663
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,211
Dickerman,
you were there.

1664
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:11,306
Yeah. I got it right here.
Where do you want me to start?

1665
01:42:11,384 --> 01:42:13,045
Where he talked
about judo.

1666
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,053
"" Have you not studied
our philosophy,

1667
01:42:15,121 --> 01:42:17,646
""our military science,
our judo wrestling?

1668
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:20,658
"" Do you not remember
that we always take the obvious

1669
01:42:20,726 --> 01:42:22,990
and reverse it, so we reverse
the role of life--""

1670
01:42:23,062 --> 01:42:24,654
That's right. They
reverse the obvious.

1671
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,322
Don't you see,
theJaps thought

1672
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:28,333
that we'd figure
they'd put the rockets

1673
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:29,834
on the reverse slope.
So instead,

1674
01:42:29,902 --> 01:42:32,097
they dug a tunnel
to the forward slope.

1675
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:33,570
It's that easy.

1676
01:42:33,639 --> 01:42:35,072
Get him outta here.

1677
01:42:38,678 --> 01:42:39,667
Will it work?

1678
01:42:39,745 --> 01:42:41,474
I'll find out
in a hurry.

1679
01:42:50,856 --> 01:42:51,982
I've got it!

1680
01:42:52,058 --> 01:42:53,650
There are your
rockets, Colonel.

1681
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:56,627
Seal the mouth of the tunnel
on the forward slope,

1682
01:42:56,696 --> 01:42:58,254
and there'll be
no more rockets.

1683
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,298
Butterfield, get that stuff
over to my map.

1684
01:43:00,366 --> 01:43:02,425
Locate the exact position.
Get the air liaison officer

1685
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,799
and find out what planes
he's got to shellack those hills

1686
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,201
in the next 30 minutes.

1687
01:43:06,272 --> 01:43:08,832
Any planes at all-- Piper Cubs,
kiddy cars, slow boats to China.

1688
01:43:08,908 --> 01:43:10,535
The stinkin' time!

1689
01:43:19,752 --> 01:43:21,982
Dickerman. Anderson.

1690
01:43:22,054 --> 01:43:23,043
Yes, sir.

1691
01:43:23,122 --> 01:43:26,614
You people
have done...

1692
01:43:26,692 --> 01:43:28,091
Thanks.

1693
01:43:31,263 --> 01:43:34,164
Johnson, I told you
to get rid of that--

1694
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:37,668
Yeah, I remember.

1695
01:43:37,737 --> 01:43:39,932
That's the only way
you enjoy smoking.

1696
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:44,601
You see? Give him time.
He'll learn.

1697
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,110
Try and contact
second platoon,

1698
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,110
Baker Company.

1699
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,271
Yes, sir.

1700
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:50,281
Hey, uh,Johnson,
tell me something, will you?

1701
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,281
Yeah.

1702
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,784
How'd you ever get
to be a sergeant?

1703
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:55,787
Oh, straight from
civilian life, sir.

1704
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:58,289
Yeah, but how in the name
of green apples

1705
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,291
did they ever pass you
through boot camp?

1706
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:02,350
Pass me, sir?
I taught there.

1707
01:44:04,663 --> 01:44:06,790
[Coughing]

1708
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:11,469
Maybe you got an in
with the angels, too.

1709
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:13,801
So start prayin' those rockets
are stopped in time.

1710
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:14,805
Good luck,
Lieutenant.

1711
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:15,806
Right.

1712
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:16,807
Good luck, Dickerman.

1713
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:17,808
Good-bye.

1714
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:19,640
Oh, by the way,
for your book...

1715
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,236
it's, uh,
Randolph Johnson.

1716
01:44:21,313 --> 01:44:23,304
Second Platoon,
Baker Company ready, sir.

1717
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:24,314
Okay. Thank you.

1718
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:25,816
Lieutenant,
I'd like to go back

1719
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:27,318
to your platoon with
you for a while.

1720
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,479
Well, it's your book,
your neck. Hello, who's this?

1721
01:44:29,555 --> 01:44:32,456
Oh, Slattery, tell the men
we found the rockets.

1722
01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:35,426
Pass the word along they won't
have to start without me.

1723
01:44:35,494 --> 01:44:36,825
I'll be right there.
Let's go.

1724
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:37,885
Yes, sir.

1725
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:47,168
Why do you writers
take such chances?

1726
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:49,264
You could hang around
the officers' bars

1727
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:51,775
and pick up the greatest
stories of the war.

1728
01:44:51,844 --> 01:44:53,835
I got something that
Doc asked me to show--

1729
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,278
Lay off.

1730
01:44:55,347 --> 01:44:57,247
I don't want to talk
about Doc.

1731
01:44:57,316 --> 01:44:58,783
Lieutenant, I--

1732
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:00,785
Did you and Conroy
take care of Zelenko?

1733
01:45:00,853 --> 01:45:03,287
Yes, sir. They're going to fly
him out tonight. But, sir--

1734
01:45:03,355 --> 01:45:05,983
Okay. I want you to take
his place.

1735
01:45:06,058 --> 01:45:07,457
From now on,
you're a squad leader.

1736
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:09,460
And you will be as long
as you stay sober.

1737
01:45:09,528 --> 01:45:10,790
Yes, sir.

1738
01:45:10,863 --> 01:45:12,797
You take over the squad.
Conroy'll be your assistant.

1739
01:45:12,865 --> 01:45:14,799
You'll have to get me
another assistant.

1740
01:45:14,867 --> 01:45:16,835
Why, what's the matter?
Don't you like con--

1741
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:21,139
What's the matter?

1742
01:45:21,207 --> 01:45:22,538
What is it?

1743
01:45:23,843 --> 01:45:25,902
All the way, Lieutenant.
It's Conroy.

1744
01:45:32,651 --> 01:45:33,583
Conroy?

1745
01:45:34,753 --> 01:45:35,913
[Whispers]
Conroy?

1746
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:43,461
That hit him
6 feet deep.

1747
01:45:43,529 --> 01:45:44,723
I'll talk to him.

1748
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:45,821
Aw, let him alone.

1749
01:45:50,836 --> 01:45:52,064
Lieutenant?

1750
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:53,069
Beat it.

1751
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:55,231
I have a paper
addressed to you, sir.

1752
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:56,638
Tear it up.

1753
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:58,609
It's from Doc.

1754
01:45:58,677 --> 01:46:00,304
Yeah, Doc.

1755
01:46:00,379 --> 01:46:04,577
I told Doc I believed
in nothing but 7 guys.

1756
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:07,619
Now one's blind.
4 are dead.

1757
01:46:07,686 --> 01:46:10,655
And the rest of us
are gonna get it, too.

1758
01:46:10,723 --> 01:46:14,489
TheJaps have got
the right idea...

1759
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,120
kill yourself.

1760
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:19,096
His last words
to me were...

1761
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:20,927
""I put down on paper
something I've been

1762
