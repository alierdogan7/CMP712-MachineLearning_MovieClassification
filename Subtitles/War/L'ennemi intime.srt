1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,435
On November 1, 1954,
After 130 years of French presence,

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,839
the National Liberation Front (FLN)
launched an insurgency in Algeria.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,794
Faced with the FLN's resolve
to negotiate independence,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,879
France responded by sending
in 500,000 young conscripts.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,152
In 1959, despite UN criticism,

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,558
France stepped up military operations
in Algeria.

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,316
INTIMATE ENEMIES

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,309
ALGERlA: July 1959.
Somewhere in Kabylia...

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,752
Sparrowhawk, this is Chamois.

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,155
Do you read me?

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,433
Chamois, this is Sparrowhawk.
Read you loud and clear.

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,391
We'll be at 18-35 in 10 minutes.
Over.

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,870
Read you five-by-five, Sparrowhawk.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,234
We'll cover you from behind
at 17-35 in 30 minutes. Out.

15
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,916
Roger. Over and out.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,112
Constantin wants
a pincer movement here.

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,550
No good here, sergeant.

18
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,876
Fire!

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,470
Fuck! I'm hit.

20
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,633
It's nothing. Put this on
and return to your position!

21
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,636
Sergeant!

22
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,270
Sparrowhawk, this is Chamois.
We've engaged enemy at 18-25.

23
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,789
I repeat: Enemy at 18-25.

24
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,356
Watch out! They're falling back
in your direction!

25
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,155
They're already here!
They're hitting us with machine guns!

26
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,114
A wounded man!

27
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,314
Tillois's been hit!

28
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,438
Cease fire! It's Dougnac.

29
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,114
Cease fire. They're ours!

30
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,196
Cease fire!

31
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,232
It's Dougnac. They're ours.

32
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,193
They're ours!

33
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,595
Why the fuck aren't you at 17-35?

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,076
Lt. Constantin positioned us.
Major's orders.

35
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,072
He's way off.
Where's the moron?

36
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,679
Up there.

37
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,030
Constantin!

38
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,236
Shit!

39
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,760
Mazel Outpost.

40
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,559
Attention!

41
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,554
Present arms!

42
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,639
Lt. Constantin,

43
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,434
in the name of the President

44
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,470
and by virtue of the powers
vested in me,

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,831
I name you knight
in the Legion of Honor.

46
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,909
We award you
the Cross of Military Valor.

47
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,629
You volunteered.

48
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,149
Congratulations.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,150
You could've had a desk job
in Algiers.

50
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,916
- What do you do in civilian life?
- Industrial designer.

51
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,352
For a first assignment,

52
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,915
you're starting off
in a tough situation.

53
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,429
You're replacing a dead man.

54
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,397
What rotten luck Constantin had.

55
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,838
It was his last mission.

56
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,156
He was supposed to go home today.

57
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,590
You have the remotest sector.

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,276
A unit of 100 fellaghas
is giving us a hard time there.

59
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,712
It's led by an ex-WWII sergeant
in De Lattre's army. Name's Slimane.

60
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,676
He's hiding somewhere
in these mountains.

61
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,279
You're to track him down.

62
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,199
Locate his unit
so we can destroy it.

63
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,833
How'd they ambush Constantin?

64
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,316
His time had come, that's all.

65
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,676
Get yourself cleaned up, lieutenant.

66
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,319
Sgt. Dougnac will take you
to your quarters.

67
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,675
I'm returning to CP.

68
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,319
Tomorrow you yomp to Taïda.

69
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,829
Fellaghas were sighted there
last night.

70
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,234
Yes, sir.

71
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Mission to Taïda.
Edge of Forbidden Zone.

72
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,430
Down there...

73
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,876
With the boy, by the sheep.

74
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,676
That's Zarah, my cousin.
Next to her is Amar,

75
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,035
her son.

76
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,708
- That your village?
- Taïda...

77
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,633
We control it by day,

78
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,315
the fellaghas control it by night.

79
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,193
A collector comes for
the revolutionary tax every 2 weeks.

80
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,636
They pay it?

81
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,116
If they don't...

82
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,875
See that old man

83
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,151
sitting on the rock?

84
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,593
He's the lookout.

85
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,396
The fellaghas cut off
his nose and lips for smoking.

86
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,993
Smoking is forbidden.

87
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,914
So you see, sir, everyone pays.

88
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,753
They have no choice.

89
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,072
Chief! Chief!

90
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,510
So, Meziane...

91
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,954
Nothing to report?

92
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,434
They came last night.

93
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,878
They took the food...
bread, beans, everything.

94
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,479
You're too generous.

95
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,194
- They didn't take guns?
- Guns, here? No, chief.

96
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,836
No bullshit. I know the fellaghas
have a stash here.

97
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,030
Question everyone.
Search all the houses!

98
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,872
Lefranc, Lacroix at 10 o'clock.
Maheu, Zunino at 12 o'clock.

99
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,952
No one knows anything here.

100
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,749
Fuck off!

101
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,949
So, cousin,

102
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,515
has Slimane been here?

103
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,951
- Where are the guns?
- We saw nothing.

104
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,670
Amar, was your brother with Slimane?

105
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,030
He didn't see anything.

106
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,671
I'm talking to your son.

107
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,439
My brother... he'll kill you.

108
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,837
That's enough!

109
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,035
He's bullshitting us, sir.

110
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,714
Not my son. Leave him alone.

111
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,277
He's not hurting anyone.
He didn't see anything.

112
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,589
Sir!

113
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,119
Tell them, Rashid.

114
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,677
The boy was away.
His brother's a fellagha.

115
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,074
He must've seen him.

116
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,599
Bring him.
I'll make him talk.

117
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,592
Leave him to me.

118
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,756
No, a boy stays with his mother.

119
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,952
Fall in. We're moving out.

120
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,636
Move out!

121
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,158
We'll be back, Meziane.

122
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,155
Next time, tell the truth.
Or you know what'll happen...

123
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,155
- 40 on Rougier.
- I bet 20.

124
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,999
Shit!

125
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,917
- Give me a light?
- Hold on.

126
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,028
Watch this.

127
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,231
Give it to her in the tits!

128
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,312
Bull's eye!

129
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,430
So who's the ace of spades?
Yours truly.

130
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,750
Attention!

131
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,555
Skip it.

132
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,518
No saluting in the canteen.

133
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,675
Carry on, gentlemen.

134
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,235
Got any lemonade?

135
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,075
This isn't kindergarten, sir.
But let me check.

136
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,991
You know: "A non-drinking officer
is no soldier"?

137
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,238
In that case... Drinks all around.

138
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,273
The lieutenant's buying.

139
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,518
Let's hear it for the lieutenant...

140
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,357
You shouldn't wear your bars.

141
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,838
Gold draws lead out there.

142
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,674
I propose a toast to Lt. Constantin.

143
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,871
To Lt. Constantin!

144
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,516
Second mission to Taïda.

145
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,399
Wait, wait.

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,399
Forward. Single file.

147
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,993
This way's longer
but no one'll see us coming.

148
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,119
You sure of your information?

149
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,599
Tell the lieutenant
what your cousin told you.

150
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,553
She said the collector comes today.

151
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,077
Go check things out.
Take Lounès.

152
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,033
Rashid's a good soldier.

153
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,915
Like all ex-fellaghas,
he knows the terrain.

154
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,508
He rallied to our side?

155
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,994
We rallied him.

156
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,869
- And you trust him?
- Don't worry.

157
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,238
He's in up to his eyeballs.

158
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,275
We missed the collector.
Everyone's gone.

159
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,316
The village looks empty.

160
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,515
Rashid...

161
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,119
It happened last night.

162
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,436
The fellaghas must have expected us.

163
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,476
It's not random savagery.

164
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,719
They wanted to make an example
for the other villages. Understand?

165
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,275
You'll be okay.

166
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,318
It's over. It's over.

167
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,269
You'll be fine.

168
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,839
Attention!

169
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,829
At ease.

170
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,559
Men...

171
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,919
It's hard for me...

172
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,396
I can't find the words to...

173
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,717
What the lieutenant means...

174
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,755
is that what you saw at Taïda...

175
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,438
you must never forget.

176
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,274
Fall out.

177
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,194
Mission in the Forbidden Zone.

178
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,434
Sir...

179
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,875
At 12 o'clock.

180
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,395
Lefranc...

181
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,716
Radio contact with Chamois!

182
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,999
Chamois, this is Authority.

183
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,315
Authority, this is Chamois.

184
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,590
Don't shoot. They're women.

185
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,673
Negative.

186
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,231
In the Zone, orders are :
if it moves, shoot it.

187
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,948
You don't fire on unarmed women...

188
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,794
Goddammit, Dougnac!

189
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,793
I gave you an order!
What got into you?

190
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,836
Women here go barefoot.

191
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,189
You couldn't know.

192
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,915
Nice work, sergeant.

193
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,193
Fall in. We continue the mission.
Objective: Meshta Rehki.

194
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,070
Why are you in the Forbidden Zone?

195
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,549
Where's Slimane?

196
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,271
What'd he say?

197
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,238
- That he saw no one.
- He's lying.

198
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,949
He's a fellagha.
We fought together.

199
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,998
Me not fellagha.

200
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,474
Long live De Gaulle!

201
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,797
You lying bastard fellagha!

202
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,719
None of that with me.

203
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,392
You heard the lieutenant!

204
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,789
Search the area!

205
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,316
- Maheu, first aid kit!
- Yes, sir.

206
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,152
Inform CP
we have a prisoner.

207
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,951
Got my cigarettes?

208
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,832
And the bubbly?

209
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,275
'Evening, sir.

210
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,277
Major Vesoul sent me
for the prisoner.

211
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,590
Fine.
He got hit on the head.

212
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,831
- Have a medic examine him.
- We'll handle him.

213
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,116
Thank you.

214
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,949
Have a good evening.

215
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,788
You're really drunk, sergeant.

216
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,513
I'll take you back.

217
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,558
Who's the ace of spades?

218
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,429
Yours truly.

219
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,595
Go on, cut the deck!

220
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,638
You'll see what I cut.

221
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,314
Lacroix, come here!

222
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,035
"Darling, all's well here.

223
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,229
"The people are friendly.

224
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,033
"Our presence reassures them."

225
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,114
Where's Slimane?

226
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,193
He was gonna talk, sir.

227
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,389
Get the fuck out of my sector.

228
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,273
Got that?

229
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,830
You bring my coffee now?

230
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,077
- Your son draw those?
- Yes.

231
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,955
He's six years old.

232
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,030
Thanks for everything, lieutenant.

233
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,912
It'll be all right.

234
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,109
We'll take care of you.

235
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,154
Hey, Lacroix...

236
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,438
Lefranc!

237
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,756
Wanna swap?

238
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,758
Hard to find meat in that muck,
isn't it, sir?

239
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,275
Sayeed!

240
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,153
Your sardines good?

241
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,953
Sardines are Muslim rations.

242
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,435
I'm a convert.

243
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,596
Smile, sir. A souvenir for when
I get out of this shithole.

244
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,633
Leave him alone.
Film Sayeed's scar instead.

245
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,231
Show the lieutenant your scar.

246
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,390
Monte Cassino. May 18, 1943.

247
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,669
Let's see it.

248
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,076
It took the Allies four assaults
to take Monte Cassino.

249
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,919
The Yanks, Brits,
Kiwis and Poles failed.

250
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,519
Not the Free French.

251
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,871
We fought the German commandos
hand-to-hand. A bloodbath.

252
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,673
Thanks to guys like Sayeed
the Rome road was opened.

253
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,155
Major Berne said:
"My greatest pride...

254
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,436
"...was to command such men."

255
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,476
A helluva battle, Monte Cassino.

256
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,314
- You were lucky to come out alive.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,833
A bayonet cut,
74 stitches and a medal!

258
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,798
Fuck death, right, Sayeed?

259
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,999
- You're a real warrior.
- Yes, a good soldier.

260
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,998
So good the fellaghas wanted
to force me to join them.

261
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,711
They butchered my wife...

262
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,952
and three children.

263
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,628
Got family back in France?

264
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,193
Not really.

265
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,116
A wife in Indochina for two years.

266
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,193
I send her money once in a while.
And you?

267
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,798
A wife and a little boy.

268
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,593
You must miss them.

269
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,036
You should go home to them.

270
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,798
Every morning, he'd write his girl,

271
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,036
starting his letter with:

272
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,198
"I'm writing
in the flow of racing bullets."

273
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,638
- "The flow of racing bullets"?
- Yep. Racing bullets!

274
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,150
- "Glow" of "tracer" bullets, dope!
- Right...

275
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,668
Sarge, hold my gun and give me a pen.

276
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,438
You shoot, I write.

277
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,908
Move it, dummy.

278
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,194
Attention!

279
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,636
Fall them out.

280
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,995
Fall out.

281
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,228
To your tents.
Don't just stand there.

282
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,954
Your prisoner talked, lieutenant.
He just confessed.

283
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,034
We'll nab Slimane.

284
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,357
We know which day he comes.

285
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,073
We'll mount an operation.

286
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,594
Come with me, Terrien.

287
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,556
I'd like you to meet
Capt. Berthaut, intelligence.

288
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,116
At ease.

289
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,909
I'll let you two get acquainted.

290
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,750
How goes it with good old Dougnac?

291
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,555
You know we fought
in Indochina together?

292
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,554
A drink, lieutenant?

293
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,991
You should. It's refreshing.

294
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,714
I hear you've been having qualms?

295
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,595
I made your prisoner come clean.

296
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,318
I don't like it either.

297
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,835
But I obey orders.

298
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,635
If an order is morally unacceptable,
you should refuse it, sir.

299
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,194
And this...

300
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,153
is it morally acceptable?

301
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,400
I'll spare you these,
so you don't puke.

302
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,515
Bodies of mutilated Frenchmen.

303
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,680
Throats cut,
their balls in their mouth.

304
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,155
When I have doubts, I take a look.

305
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,150
The FLN may use vile methods,
but yours are no better, sir.

306
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,999
It's like Indochina.
This is no conventional war.

307
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,509
This is psychological warfare.

308
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,233
The FLN is a minority.

309
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,199
It's undermining the country.
It must be eliminated.

310
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,393
Can we speak openly?

311
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,676
Go ahead.

312
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,398
You think it's normal

313
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,398
to grant independence
to Tunisia and Morocco

314
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,797
but not Algeria?
- There's no comparison.

315
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,439
Algeria is France.

316
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,398
If Algeria is France,

317
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,238
we should start by giving
everyone equal rights.

318
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,874
Treat the Algerians
like French citizens,

319
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,310
not like colonial subjects.

320
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,237
If you think about it,
the FLN has reason to fight.

321
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,156
Someday, we'll have to negotiate.

322
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,271
You can't fight barbarism
with barbarism, sir.

323
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,551
This may come as a surprise.

324
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,759
15 years ago,
I was in the French Underground.

325
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,914
I set up ambushes.

326
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,197
I was arrested and tortured
by the Gestapo. Somehow I survived.

327
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,073
But I Iost these.

328
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,429
I spit out my real teeth
in the bathtub.

329
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,359
You just got here.

330
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,517
You'll see. You'll come around.

331
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,952
Like we all have.

332
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,359
I doubt it.

333
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,039
Operation Slimane at Meshta Rehki.

334
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,792
Don't leave my side.

335
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,951
Sun, this is Rock.
Nothing to report.

336
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,991
Roger. Remain in place. Out.

337
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,276
I hope the old man didn't lie.

338
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,834
At 110 volts,
the truth always comes out.

339
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,797
They'll come at nightfall.

340
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,398
That's what I'd do.

341
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,351
What the hell...

342
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,516
Shit!

343
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,512
Where the fuck are they?

344
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,709
Théron, PRC6!

345
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,350
Sun, this is Rock.

346
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,028
Enemy 100 meters Above!

347
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,196
They're hitting us with MG-42s.

348
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,116
Roger.

349
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,912
Go after them.

350
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,110
They need help.

351
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,589
I wouldn't.

352
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,073
The lieutenant can handle it.

353
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,589
Dougnac's covering us.

354
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,950
Get ready.

355
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,911
Platoon, forward!

356
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,033
Go! Go! Go!

357
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,950
Rougier!

358
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,391
Allah is great...

359
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,635
and Muhammad is his prophet.

360
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,035
Go get 'em, Dougnac.

361
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,633
Like in Indochina.

362
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,115
He was the scout.

363
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,476
The rest are up there.

364
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,312
They were here before us.

365
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,791
Someone tipped them off.

366
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,514
Tell the major to move it.

367
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,709
This is Rock...

368
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,236
We're pinned down!

369
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,314
Take them from behind at 18-35.

370
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,832
I repeat: request support!

371
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,713
He's right. We have to do it now!

372
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,950
Requesting Channel 16.
Sending in the special drums.

373
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,952
- But, major...
- Negative.

374
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,628
Would you rather lose the company?

375
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,869
Not the drums!

376
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,718
Not the drums, sir.

377
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,469
Don't move.
Air support in 2 minutes.

378
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,995
- Read me, Rock?
- Roger.

379
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,836
Kerchiefs!

380
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,359
Kerchiefs, everyone!

381
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,959
Kerchief, Lefranc.

382
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,994
Your kerchief, lieutenant.

383
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,635
Mission accomplished.
Request permission to return to base.

384
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,918
Well done. You can go home. Out.

385
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,037
Rock, this is Sun.

386
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,153
Go check it out.

387
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,872
Allah is great
and Muhammad is his prophet.

388
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,349
For the ace of spades.

389
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,118
And for Rougier.

390
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,355
For Delmas.

391
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,838
They're sending
the bodies home tomorrow.

392
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,157
I have to write the families.

393
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,516
I thought napalm was only
in the event of war.

394
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,674
What do you mean, war?
Officially we're maintaining order.

395
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,316
Same with the napalm. See any napalm?
Just "special drums".

396
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,398
A goddamn beer, Amar!

397
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,190
A beer!

398
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,753
I bet he was the rat.

399
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,155
For me, too.
Don't fuck with me!

400
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,318
You're paranoid.

401
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,078
Mission in Forbidden Zone.

402
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,636
No fellaghas tonight, sergeant.

403
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,069
You're right.

404
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,039
They won't come now.

405
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,797
We'll rest here, then head back.

406
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,629
Platoon!

407
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,670
Sir,

408
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,359
come see something.

409
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,196
Beautiful, isn't it?

410
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,588
It's a hideout.

411
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,229
I used to come here
when I was little.

412
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,153
With your brother.

413
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,230
Here...

414
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,799
For you.

415
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,029
Take it.

416
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,270
Vigier and Attia, this way!

417
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,637
Search the perimeter.
Every bush. Every rock!

418
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,076
Lefranc at 12 o'clock with four men.
Go, go, go!

419
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,033
What's the problem?

420
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,195
Rashid's gone.

421
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,755
Lacroix, your machine gun up there!

422
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,029
Fucking traitor Rashid.

423
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,674
Deploy on the crest.

424
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,232
Major Vesoul wants us to report
to him on Rashid's disappearance.

425
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,514
I can't believe he went back over
to the fellaghas.

426
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,991
For now, he's just missing.

427
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,997
"In the end, the strength
of the innocent is broken

428
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,199
"Had I known the outcome
of accursed fate

429
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,197
"I would have attacked first

430
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,432
"For they will cut my throat

431
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,710
"Or banish me from this land."

432
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,433
It's a Kabyle poem.

433
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,829
In French it means...

434
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,759
It means,
"Get the hell out, Frenchmen.

435
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,349
"Or we'll kill
every last one of you."

436
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,516
For the fellaghas,
the French in Algeria

437
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,149
are like the Germans for you
during the war.

438
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,994
They think they're like
the French freedom fighters.

439
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,590
What about you?

440
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,515
Me, chief, I'm a soldier.

441
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,833
I fought the Germans with the French.

442
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,191
Now I fight the FLN
with the French.

443
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,039
That's how it is.

444
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,315
And Rashid?

445
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,789
Rashid is a good soldier.

446
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,790
And he's become my friend.

447
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,556
But I'd shoot him on the spot
if he were a traitor.

448
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,672
Track to company CP.

449
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,519
Poor Rashid.

450
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,279
He no longer knew
whose side he was on.

451
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,469
Hello, Dougnac.

452
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,749
Berthaut.

453
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,632
I brought you a gift, Terrien.

454
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,399
No use to us at CP.

455
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,512
Take him out somewhere.

456
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,310
- Like a walk in the woods.
- Negative.

457
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,749
Get rid of him. Orders.

458
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,632
I refuse to obey.

459
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,592
You're starting to piss me off.

460
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,315
Do as you're told.

461
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,839
And if I don't, sir?

462
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,469
Very well.

463
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,154
I'll report you.

464
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,593
Maheu, Zunino!

465
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,990
Mail's here!

466
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,039
It's the mail!

467
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,434
So, Berthaut?

468
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,629
- Still on a lucky streak?
- Still.

469
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,595
I'll handle the prisoner.
Lay off Terrien.
