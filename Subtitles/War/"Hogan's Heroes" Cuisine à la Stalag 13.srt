1
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:17,601
( <i>theme song playing</i> )

2
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,924
* *

3
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,219
Ah... ah, here's
our fine chef.

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,595
Corporal...
do you know

5
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,430
for whom you
have the honor

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,974
of cooking
tonight, huh?

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,143
General Wexler and his aide,
Captain Richter.

8
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,064
I'm so thrilled I may cry
into the <i>champignons.</i>

9
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>Champignon--</i>
"mushroom," of course.

10
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,859
These French are
so emotional.

11
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,986
Now, Corporal, what is

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,362
the <i>pièce de résistance</i>
tonight, huh?

13
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>Tournedos Rossini et</i>
<i>les pommes de terre frites.</i>

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,701
Meat and
French-fried potatoes.

15
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,997
It loses a little something
in the translation.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,332
WEXLER:
The sergeant eats first?

17
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,792
Some local tradition?

18
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,043
Uh, no, no.

19
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,712
You see,
our very fine chef

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,422
is also
a very dangerous prisoner,

21
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,798
and I think it is wise

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,467
to have a food taster
around just in case.

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,803
I risk my life
for the Fatherland.

24
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,055
And gain a few
pounds on the way.

25
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,976
<i>Mmm, wunderbar,</i>
<i>Kommandant, wunderbar.</i>

26
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,228
Not a sign of poison.

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,438
Excellent!

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,690
You see, whenever Schultz
does not fall down,

29
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,024
it is safe.

30
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,777
CARTER:
Providing he falls
in the other direction.

31
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,237
Proceed, proceed,
Herr General, please sit down.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,697
<i>Danke schön.</i>
<i>Danke.</i>

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,948
A food taster--

34
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,491
no detail
escapes you, Colonel.

35
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,034
You have
command thinking.

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,661
Thank you, Captain,
thank you.

37
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,496
Commandant?

38
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,373
Yes, please.

39
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,624
Thank you, Sergeant.
thank you.

40
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,209
Everything under
control, Captain?

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,629
<i>Danke.</i>

42
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,141
Cor blimey, you scared
me half to death.

43
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,726
Sorry.

44
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,229
Richter's very, very
messy with his papers.

45
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,314
Well, just find them.

46
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,356
I'm looking.

47
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,567
Having a proper bash
out there, are they?

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,569
Klink's still bucking
for promotion.

49
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,654
Good luck to him,
the silly old sod.

50
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,449
Oh, here we are--
these look interesting.

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,992
Yeah...

52
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah, that's great.

53
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,913
Okay, I'll see you.

54
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,914
What do
you mean?

55
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,915
Get back
here quickly--

56
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,082
I got to replace these.

57
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,918
I know.

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,759
KLINK:
Ah, I think a little bit
more wine might be in order.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,760
Thank you.

60
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,220
You have another
dinner party

61
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,554
going on
in the camp?

62
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,764
Oh, no, Herr General.

63
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,100
I send a little of the food
to our senior POW officer.

64
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:08,104
A little bribe
for permitting us
to use his, uh, chef.

65
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,272
Oh, very good, yeah.

66
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,698
Anything,
Colonel?

67
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,451
Yeah, mostly low-grade stuff.

68
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,079
A new ball-bearing
factory,

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,248
locations of two
ack-ack units--

70
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,624
all this
we've already seen.

71
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,042
Well, I don't
understand it.

72
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,877
Richter gave us the signal
to go ahead.

73
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,380
He's given us good
intelligence before.

74
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,132
I guess even traitors
have their bad days.

75
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,425
BAKER:
Colonel...

76
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,053
there's a note
on this one.

77
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,638
Hmm...

78
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,183
"Next dinner,
same procedure.

79
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:52,274
Plans... for West Wall
underwater obstacles."

80
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,525
That could be
interesting.

81
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,236
Hmm, if
he delivers.

82
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,198
Yeah, well,
let's pay him for
this stuff anyway.

83
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,158
How are things going
over at the festival?

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,953
Boy, is Klink working
for that promotion.

85
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,788
Can you imagine him
making general?

86
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,164
Yeah, how
would Klink look

87
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,000
with a red stripe
on his pants?

88
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,126
Like a bald-headed Kraut

89
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,460
with a red stripe
on his pants.

90
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,342
* *

91
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,164
* *

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,227
HOGAN:
Not the greatest
information we ever had,

93
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,270
but pass it along.

94
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>Oui, colonel.</i>

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,982
A courier will meet me
tomorrow or the next day.

96
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,400
We have a pretty
hot contact,

97
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,693
General Wexler's aide.

98
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
He promised us something
important next time.

99
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,571
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

100
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,449
Oh, one moment, Colonel,
there is one more thing.

101
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
It concerns
Louis and myself.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
Me?
Mm-hmm.

103
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,415
Would you two
like to be alone?

104
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,502
General De Gaulle has broadcast
an important message

105
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,420
to Frenchmen
all over the world.

106
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,797
He's ordered
that we pass it on.

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,756
What did he say?

108
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:39,923
I wrote part of it down.

109
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,099
"We have reached
a crisis

110
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,144
"in the fight to regain
our precious homeland.

111
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,438
"I now call upon
Frenchmen everywhere.

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,024
"Rally to the <i>tricolore.</i>

113
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,651
"Come to England,

114
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,445
"and together
as free Frenchmen

115
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,406
"we will liberate our homeland.

116
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,784
France and I await you."

117
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,206
<i>Vive la France.</i>

118
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>Vive la liberté.</i>

119
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,126
<i>Vive la France.</i>

120
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,086
<i>Vive De Gaulle.</i>

121
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,298
Old Charlie sure knows
how to get people home.

122
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,841
You off to England
then, Marie?

123
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,302
No, my work is here;
I will stay.

124
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,096
De Gaulle does
not need women.

125
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,472
That's new kind
of Frenchman.

126
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,975
<i>Mon colonel?</i>

127
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,102
Yes, Louis.

128
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:39,107
Marie stays, but I,
Louis LeBeau, am going.

129
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:39,899
<i>Vive LeBeau.</i>

130
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>Vive la France.</i>

131
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,158
You can't take off
just like that;

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,159
it isn't done.

133
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,328
Watch me.

134
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,622
Oh, come on, Louis,
you know you'll miss us

135
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,667
and the Krauts and the lice
and the stinking food

136
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,168
and the bloody awful weather.

137
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,920
What about all that?

138
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,005
What about it?

139
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,717
Need a man to carry
your chafing dish?

140
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,306
Hey, come on,
look, buddy,

141
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,849
you don't seem
to realize,

142
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,350
you've been fighting
for France

143
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,893
right here, right
along with us.

144
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,062
True, I have done
my duty here--

145
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,107
I have killed the enemy,
sabotaged him,

146
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,776
blown up his guns,
been captured by the Gestapo,

147
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,112
risked my life
to defeat the Boche.

148
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,698
Now my own
people ask for me.

149
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,033
<i>Et voilà,</i>
it's time to go.

150
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,619
Louis, I don't blame
you one little bit.

151
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:39,584
He has a point,
Colonel.

152
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,720
Point is, you are
fighting, Louis.

153
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,472
And what happens
<i>après la guerre?</i>

154
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,514
What?

155
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,849
After the war.

156
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,226
I find a girl, get
married, we have a child

157
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,561
and the baby says to me,

158
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,521
"Hey, what did you do
in the war, Papa?"

159
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,357
And I must answer,
"I made <i>crêpes Suzette."</i>

160
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,776
Lie to the kid.

161
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,696
LeBeau, if you go,

162
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,239
we'll have to tell
Klink you've escaped.

163
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,824
Then his record
is ruined.

164
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,201
The Krauts
might replace him

165
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,911
and really give us
a hard commandant;

166
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,079
then we're
out of business.

167
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,663
Very simple, Colonel,
replace me.

168
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,999
Find another Frenchman
your size who can cook?

169
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,375
That would be
a problem.

170
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,418
Good luck with it.

171
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,420
Aw, come on, LeBeau,
be reasonable.

172
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,922
We got this thing
going with Richter.

173
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,173
So?

174
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,925
The next time he comes
to dinner with Wexler,

175
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,051
he's going to bring us

176
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,260
the West Wall
underwater obstacle plans.

177
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,261
<i>Oh là là...</i>

178
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,262
You don't care?

179
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,514
Of course I do.

180
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,932
Write me all about it

181
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,809
in care of
the Free French, London.

182
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,310
I could order you
to stay, LeBeau.

183
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:39,435
With all due
respect, sir,

184
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,856
you are a colonel,
De Gaulle is a general.

185
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,399
He's also taller.

186
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,235
Don't you care anything
about this place?

187
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:47,443
Nothing.

188
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,071
All the fun we've had,
all the laughs.

189
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,531
Ha!
It's been hilarious.

190
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,865
Especially that time
when the Gestapo

191
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,158
had me strung up
by my thumbs

192
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,993
and was ready
to torture me.

193
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,411
Everybody has
bad days.

194
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,247
LeBeau, I'm
really shocked
by your attitude.

195
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,165
You're making
it very difficult
for me, Colonel.

196
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm trying.

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,878
I realize that cooking for this
Kraut general is important.

198
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,922
Without you,
we haven't got a chance.

199
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,549
<i>Voilà,</i> I can solve the problem:

200
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,468
Before I leave, I will teach
one of the others to cook.

201
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,719
Are you kidding,
LeBeau?

202
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,305
You seem to miss the
whole idea of the war.

203
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,099
We're fighting the
Germans, not each other.

204
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,734
LeBEAU:
All right.

205
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,819
<i>Attention, écoutez-moi.</i>

206
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,904
Come here, Peter...
listen to me.

207
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,324
We are going to cook steak
with <i>sauce bordelaise.</i>

208
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,410
Louis, I'll never learn
about French cooking.

209
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,536
I don't even like it.

210
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,454
You can learn.

211
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,498
I get heartburn
watching Maurice Chevalier.

212
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,834
Come on, let's give
the little fellow a chance.

213
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,835
<i>Merci, Carter.</i>

214
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,670
Now, put some
seasoning on it.

215
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,672
Let me see what kind
of touch you have.

216
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,175
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is wrong.

217
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,595
You have to use
the seasoning

218
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,346
with a delicate touch.

219
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,265
Now, in
a case like this...

220
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,183
a little salt...

221
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,436
pepper...

222
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,187
And when you are ready,

223
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,108
your butter and parsley
should actually dance

224
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,401
across the meat.

225
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,238
And when you are finished,
your meat will lie there

226
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,740
like a sleeping beauty,

227
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
waiting for the sauce
to bring it to life.

228
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:18,534
Cockroach!

229
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Oui?</i>

230
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,580
Will you marry me?

231
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,590
Are you joking
with that?

232
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,555
Well, all right.

233
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,100
So then he'll
stay with me

234
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,352
until it's safe
to move him.

235
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,561
Good.

236
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,771
The sub's been alerted.

237
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,814
Contact them by radio,
usual procedure.

238
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,024
Oui, Colonel,
I understand.

239
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,735
Aah, this is one escape
I don't feel good about.

240
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,236
<i>C'est la guerre.</i>

241
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,363
Right.

242
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,531
Another rotten thing
to charge to the war.

243
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,037
I'm ready, <i>mon colonel.</i>

244
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,705
Marvelous job,
isn't it, sir?

245
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,957
He looks
just like a Kraut
traveling salesman.

246
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,626
Yeah, in small appliances.

247
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,170
( <i>chuckling</i> )

248
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,089
Well, this is
it, LeBeau.

249
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>Au revoir,</i>
<i>mon colonel.</i>

250
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,675
It's been an honor
to serve in your command.

251
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,427
Yeah, yeah, thanks,

252
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,930
and, uh, take good
care of yourself, huh?

253
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,015
Maybe we'll see each other
again after the war.

254
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,563
Well, Andrew, I know
you'll be a great cook.

255
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,566
Take it easy, buddy.

256
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,905
Good luck, Louis.

257
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,698
Hope to see you
sometime.

258
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,450
LeBEAU:
I hope so, too.

259
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,076
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

260
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,539
Peter...

261
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,543
We're really
going to miss you
around here, you know.

262
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,838
<i>Au revoir, mon pote.</i>

263
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,547
Take care, huh?

264
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>Au revoir,</i>
<i>mes amis.</i>

265
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,096
Don't forget to write...
in code.

266
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>Au revoir.</i>

267
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,939
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

268
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>Bon appétit,</i>
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

269
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,007
Ah, thank you,
Schultz, thank you.

270
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,842
Mmm... ( <i>gasps</i> )

271
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,635
It looks
fantastic, huh?

272
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,345
A little
parsley garnish...

273
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,597
lemon, pimento...
Mmm...

274
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,682
and the capers nestled
in the lemon, huh?

275
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,766
Mmm!

276
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,436
<i>Alles in Ordnung.</i>

277
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,941
You won't believe it.

278
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,196
This is terrible.

279
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,240
The man who cooked
this should get

280
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,533
30 days
in the cooler.

281
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,078
60 is not enough,
Herr Kommandant!

282
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,747
Get the little
Frenchman out here!

283
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,998
Hey, Cockroach,
come out here!

284
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,169
You called,
Monsieur Commandant?

285
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,337
You prepared this?

286
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,130
<i>Oui, Monsieur</i>
<i>Commandant.</i>

287
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:21,383
Uh, it's called
chicken à la princess-ee.

288
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,886
But how
could you've...

289
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,055
Wait a minute, you're not
the little Frenchman.

290
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,097
No, sir.

291
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,642
But in high school,
I took one year of...

292
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,642
Schultz!

293
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,894
Get Hogan
in here at once.

294
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:32,895
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>

295
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,731
And you,
take this away...

296
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,482
and bury it.

297
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,282
Just as I said,
Herr Kommandant, he's gone.

298
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,909
Escaped?!

299
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,619
Impossible-- nobody
escapes from here.

300
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,206
My guess is he went out hidden
in one of the garbage trucks.

301
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,499
Schultz, it is
your duty

302
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,958
to inspect
the garbage.

303
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,502
Herr Kommandant,
the cockroach...

304
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,420
I mean, Corporal LeBeau--
he is so small,

305
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,838
he can hide in a potato peel.

306
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,382
Idiot, I have
invited General Wexler

307
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,259
to have dinner here next
week and I have no chef.

308
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,928
Sergeant Carter could
cook the meal for you.

309
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,262
He's coming along nicely.

310
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,432
I want to entertain the general,
not poison him.

311
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,975
Schultz, sound
the general alarm!

312
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,019
Alert the troops--
shoot on sight.

313
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,438
That will be the end
of our wandering Frenchman.

314
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,773
Also the end
of your promotion.

315
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,233
They can bury LeBeau

316
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,610
and the red stripe
for your pants at
the same time.

317
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,820
Nobody escapes
from Stalag 13.

318
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,321
Red stripe?

319
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,697
Cancel the shoot-on-sight order.

320
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,991
But I want
a maximum search effort!

321
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,493
We'll capture him.

322
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,370
Schultz, don't just stand
there-- get on with it.

323
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,579
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>

324
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,747
Oh, Schultz,
before you start,

325
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,082
uh, bring me back
two poached eggs.

326
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,083
<i>Jawohl,</i>
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

327
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,292
And an order
of toast.

328
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,335
And an order
of toa...

329
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,002
Out, Hogan!

330
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,973
Oh, that Boche!

331
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,100
I am to leave for England
day after tomorrow,

332
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,393
Marie arranged it.

333
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,520
You're safe unless the
Krauts search the area.

334
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,147
Why did this
have to happen?

335
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,815
Carter should have learned
to cook by now.

336
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,983
You kidding?

337
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,276
He can't tell
the difference

338
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,318
between caviar
and K rations.

339
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,862
I will have to move
from here.

340
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,113
When Marie comes back,

341
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,573
I'll find out if there's
another safe place.

342
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,657
A shame.

343
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,784
The two of you are
nice and cozy here.

344
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,952
She's been good to me.

345
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,246
Huh, a little romance
developing?

346
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,748
You can tell me,
I'm a full colonel.

347
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:21,503
She's a beautiful,
warmhearted woman.

348
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,341
She cooks for me, stands guard,
worries about me.

349
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,844
You don't need a colonel;
you need a chaplain.

350
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,346
Ah, I better get back
to the mother ship.

351
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,931
Thanks for
the warning, Colonel.

352
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,434
( <i>coded knock at door</i> )

353
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,351
Marie.

354
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,355
Karl, what
are you doing?

355
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,607
Oh, Colonel Hogan.

356
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,649
Oh, bad news, Louis.

357
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,151
The Gestapo
has picked up Marie.

358
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,152
What?!

359
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,070
Well, she was coming
out of a store,

360
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,280
a Gestapo patrol
was checking papers

361
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,364
and they stopped her.

362
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,616
Where'd
they take her?

363
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,783
Gestapo
headquarters.

364
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,410
They have called
the Vichy Security Police

365
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,411
for identification.

366
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:55,704
Karl, get a car,

367
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,539
park it around the corner
from the headquarters.

368
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
Wait a minute,
hold it.

369
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,917
I'll get her out of there

370
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,835
if I have to kill every
Gestapo animal in the place.

371
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,003
Clever way
to commit suicide.

372
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,171
Now, take it
easy, Louis.

373
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Oh, the Colonel's
right, Louis.

374
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,256
You can't
swing this alone.

375
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,341
Go in there
like gangbusters,

376
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:08,383
knock off
a few goons,

377
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,801
and they take it
out on her.

378
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,553
I'll take that chance.

379
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,847
Will you calm down
a little, Louis?

380
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,558
Maybe we can work out something.

381
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,561
They called Vichy
for identification.

382
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,482
They probably won't work on her.

383
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,567
Gives us a little time,
a day or two.

384
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,861
Gives <i>us</i> a little time?

385
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,071
Right.

386
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,198
If you're ever in trouble,
call Stalag 13--

387
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,824
open 24 hours, we never sleep.

388
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,077
How can I ask you
to take such a risk?

389
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,244
Because I'm going
to ask you something.

390
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,537
Anything.

391
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,415
Come back to camp
and cook the meal for Klink.

392
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,250
And give myself up?

393
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,877
You said "anything."

394
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,671
You have my word
you can go to England

395
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,506
<i>after</i> we get
the West Wall plans.

396
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,590
A deal?

397
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:52,678
Deal.

398
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,560
MAN:
Marie Bizet?

399
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
We're holding her here.

400
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:03,897
Her papers, <i>bitte.</i>

401
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,277
Sergeant Duclos,
Vichy Security Police.

402
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,612
And that is the order

403
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,947
for the release
of the prisoner.

404
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,493
We cannot release her
without proper authorization.

405
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,537
We had no word from Berlin
on this case.

406
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,039
Marie Bizet is wanted
for sabotage

407
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,582
against
the Vichy government.

408
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,459
We are very anxious
to question her.

409
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,503
I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

410
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,255
( <i>door rattling</i> )

411
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,798
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

412
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>Heil.</i>

413
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,885
Major Hoganburger,
Berlin, Section 8.

414
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,846
We were on our way
to Düsseldorf

415
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,514
and had some
engine trouble and...

416
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,307
Wait...

417
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,101
Have we met before?

418
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,229
Sergeant Maurice Duclos,
Vichy Security Police.

419
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:46,898
Liaison officer
in the Marceau case.

420
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,609
It's a pleasure to see
you again, Major.

421
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,278
<i>Heil.</i>

422
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,655
Steiner, you remember
Sergeant Duclos?

423
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:55,323
Yes, his face is
vaguely familiar.

424
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,616
<i>Abend.</i>
<i>Bonjour.</i>

425
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,618
What are you doing
so far from home, Sergeant?

426
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,329
Orders to transfer a prisoner
from here to Vichy.

427
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,123
Rotten work.

428
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,584
Perhaps we can have
a drink together later?

429
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,880
I would enjoy that, Major, but
I can't leave for the moment.

430
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,506
I'm caught in red tape.

431
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,258
His authorization papers

432
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,093
have not been properly
countersigned, Herr Major.

433
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,429
What can we do
about this?

434
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,598
Perhaps I should
call Berlin.

435
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,018
No, I don't like to get
Himmler out of bed.

436
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,770
He needs his sleep
and I need my job.

437
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,772
( <i>chuckling</i> )

438
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,902
I'll vouch for
Sergeant Duclos.

439
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,029
But, Herr Major,
I'm afraid I can't.

440
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,489
The only thing you have
to be afraid of, Captain,

441
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,158
is a transfer eastward.

442
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,705
There's your
counterauthorization.

443
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,707
Release the prisoner
to Sergeant Duclos.

444
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,712
Unless you enjoy winter sports.

445
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,446
And how did you get
out of the camp?

446
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,239
That is what you're
going to tell me-- how.

447
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,659
Is it true you hid out
in one of the garbage trucks?

448
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,910
<i>Oui,</i> one of
the garbage trucks.

449
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>Merci, mon colonel.</i>

450
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,912
Hogan,
you were right.

451
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,871
Now, tell me,

452
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,956
why did you decide
to honor us

453
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,082
with your return, hmm?

454
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,043
I escaped on an impulse.

455
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,214
I had no money, no food,
no place to go, no help.

456
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,508
You are breaking
my heart.

457
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,303
All right, ten days in the
cooler for attempted escape,

458
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,431
sentence to start
immediately after you cook

459
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,183
a fabulous dinner
for General Wexler.

460
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,269
When you want a favor,
Commandant, you're irresistible.

461
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,771
That is an order!

462
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,357
There will be a guard in the
kitchen with you every moment.

463
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,776
Nobody stands guard
over me when I cook.

464
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:55,944
You dare to defy me?

465
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,821
20 days in the cooler
on bread and water.

466
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,489
I cook alone
or not at all!

467
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,865
All right,
dinner is off,

468
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,783
sentence
to start now.

469
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:01,950
Schultz!

470
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,744
And so we say farewell, aloha,

471
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,454
to the red stripe
on Colonel Klink's pants.

472
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,417
Herr Kommandant.

473
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,545
Schultz, take this man
to the kitchen...

474
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,463
and leave him alone.

475
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,888
WEXLER:
<i>Fabelhaft!</i>

476
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,848
Another perfect
dinner, Klink.

477
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,183
Ah, thank you,
Herr General.

478
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,518
I am so pleased
you're pleased.

479
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,729
Well, now I'm ready
for a cigar.

480
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,981
Ah, have one of these,
Herr General.

481
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,066
<i>Danke--</i> I prefer
one of my own.

482
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,484
Uh, did you bring them, Hans?

483
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:21,654
<i>Ja, Herr General,</i> they
are in my briefcase.

484
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,655
I will get it.

485
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,324
No, sir, please,
allow me.

486
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,035
Stay seated, please,
I need the exercise.

487
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,162
Could I help the general
find his cigars?

488
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,455
Out of my
way, solider.

489
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,165
I said I'd get
them myself.

490
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,547
He said they were
in his briefcase, sir.

491
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,174
WEXLER:
I don't see it.

492
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,970
Here we are, sir.

493
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,099
Ah, yes-- young eyes
are always the keenest.

494
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,602
Thank you, sir.

495
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:53,811
Ah.

496
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,155
Psst... Kraut's gone.

497
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,115
I'll be back in a minute
for the papers.

498
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,408
Oh, great.

499
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,868
By that time I should be
conscious again.

500
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,132
HOGAN:
Locations of underwater mines,
anti-sub nets, obstacles,

501
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,384
West Wall fortifications,
the whole bag.

502
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:25,468
Richter really came through.

503
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:26,552
Ah, that's
great, Colonel.

504
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:27,762
You guys did
a great job, too.

505
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,055
BOTH:
Thank you, sir.

506
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,557
We'll see that it gets
to London, Colonel.

507
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,059
Well, these are important enough

508
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,103
to ask London
for a courier plane.

509
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:36,604
Baker, make radio contact.

510
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,689
Will do.

511
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,190
Tell them that they'll have

512
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:41,526
a passenger on the return trip,
General De Gaulle's new cook.

513
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,319
No, Baker, wait.

514
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,946
I've changed my mind, Colonel.

515
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,947
I'm not going.

516
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,240
What?!
What do you mean?

517
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,908
Well, I have
a responsibility here.

518
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,535
Without me,
you'll all wind up

519
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,787
in a Gestapo jail
in about two weeks.

520
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,497
He's a cheeky devil.

521
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,500
He's right, this
stuff proves it.

522
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,710
The way to
a Kraut's briefcase

523
00:22:58,793 --> 00:22:59,794
is through
his stomach.

524
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,796
But I don't want
to be just a chef.

525
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,797
Oh, I promise, LeBeau.

526
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,465
We won't ask you
to cook anymore

527
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,508
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

528
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,592
<i>Merci, mon colonel.</i>

529
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,844
<i>Vive LeBeau!</i>

530
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:08,970
OTHERS:
<i>Vive LeBeau!</i>

531
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:09,971
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

532
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:11,973
What's our next job,
Colonel?

533
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:14,016
Well, how about whipping
up some hors d'oeuvres

534
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,309
to go with
the champagne?

535
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,979
Would you do that
for your old mates,
would you?

536
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,689
Oh, you guys...

537
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,238
Done nothing about it?

538
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:28,406
Not even the possible list?

539
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,950
I understand.

540
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,202
<i>Danke,</i> Major.

541
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,830
Sir, LeBeau's been in
the cooler two days now.

542
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,999
Wexler has done nothing
about my promotion.

543
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,625
I just don't understand
what happened.

544
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,960
All that food,
the wine...

545
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,295
You picked
the wrong man.

546
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,172
Obviously Wexler has
no muscle in Berlin.

547
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,507
But he's on the promotions
advisory committee.

548
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,842
About LeBeau, sir.

549
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,928
Maybe I should reach
a little higher the next time.

550
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,014
Possibly Colonel General Flamm.

551
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,016
How about Göring?

552
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,517
Old fatso appreciates
good food,

553
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,852
when he's not
killing people.

554
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,520
Excellent idea, Hogan.

555
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:02,273
I'll put an invitation
through channels immediately.

556
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:03,733
Tell the little Frenchman
to start planning.

557
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,693
The little Frenchman is not
about to start planning

558
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,028
while he's in
the cooler, sir.

559
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,530
Hogan, I'm still
the commandant here,

560
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,699
and LeBeau will plan
the Reichsmarschall's meals

561
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,117
anywhere I tell him to.

562
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,869
All right... when
Göring wakes up

563
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,996
in the middle of the
night with heartburn,

564
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,123
you'll be the worst
insurance risk in Germany.

565
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,002
I'll see to it that
LeBeau is released at once.

566
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,467
Colonel Klink...
you're too kind.
