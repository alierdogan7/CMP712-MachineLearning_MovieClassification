01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,723
He took pleasure in the good things,
and endured the bad things cheerfully.

1069
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,564
And his little dog.

1070
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,365
How he loved her.

1071
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,722
"She knows how to ask for love,"
he'd say,

1072
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,086
"and she knows how to give it."

1073
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,491
What else can you ask?

1074
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,641
And he was right, I think.

1075
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,411
So now I'm trying to live like him,
is that ridiculous?

1076
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,767
No. No, it's not ridiculous at all.

1077
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,881
Tell us more about him,
tell us all about him.

1078
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,886
I should go.
I've kept you up far too late.

1079
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,248
But might I call again? Soon?

1080
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,561
Of course, you'll always be welcome.

1081
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,567
NATASHA: Oh, he's such a dear friend.

1082
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,728
But now it's as if...

1083
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,289
I don't know what it is, it's...

1084
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,243
It's as if he's fresh
from the bathhouse, all pure and clean.

1085
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,967
Not just on the outside,
but on the inside, too.

1086
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,725
Well, I knew he had a true heart
the first time I met him.

Princess, help me.
I haven't slept a wink.

1090
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,251
What am Ito do?
Has she said anything?

1091
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,765
<i>May 1 “We?</i>

1092
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,729
I know I'm not worthy of her, but...

1093
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,165
I've loved her so long.

1094
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,086
Tell me what to do and I will do it.

1095
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,242
Well, I think
you should ask her yourself.

1096
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,170
I'll go and fetch her.

1097
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,964
(CLEARING THROAT)

1098
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,805
Dearest Natasha.

1099
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,887
I know I've been a clown
and wasted my life,

1100
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,530
but I have to ask you.

1101
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,850
Say no, and I'll go to Petersburg,
and never bother you again.

1102
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,766
But...

1103
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,809
Do you think you could love me?

1104
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,442
Yes. Yes, I could.

1105
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,005
Yes, I do.

1106
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,925
Do you, Pierre?

How tall you've grown!

1110
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,809
I think you're going
to be taller than your father.

1111
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,690
I hope not. I'd like to be exactly
the same height as he was.

Pierre!

Will you read this,
so we can argue about it?

1119
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,486
Will do.
