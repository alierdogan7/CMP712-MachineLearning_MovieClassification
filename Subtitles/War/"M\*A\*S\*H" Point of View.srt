00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:58,182
This hickey ain't enough to get me
into the lobby of an evac hospital.

163
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,982
But I'm playin' it up. Anytime a nurse
or doc comes by, I'm in first-class agony.

164
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,683
You watch. I'll spend the rest
of the war lyin' right here.

165
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,626
Oh, by the way, I don't think
I ever introduced myself.

166
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,822
Hey, what'd I say?

167
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,559
He's just sleeping off
the anesthetic.

168
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,901
Well, men,you played a great first half,
but if you really expect to score...

169
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,941
you gotta throw a pass.

170
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,738
Let me show you. Nurse,
meet me in the showers after the game?

171
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,177
- Aw, get off it, Hawkeye.
- See what I mean?

172
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,977
[ Chuckles ] Penalty.
Fifteen yards for acting like an idiot.

173
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:35,952
- Did you hear about Colonel Potter and Radar?
- No. Are they an item now?

174
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:40,115
The colonel chewed him out in the Mess Tent
about the daily report or something.

175
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,159
Poor Radar just had to
sit there and take it.

176
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,424
Somebody ought to get Potter into O.R.
and remove that thorn from his paw.

177
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:50,093
I'd love to know what's bothering him,
but I'm afraid to get within 20 feet.

178
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:52,295
- I know what the problem is.
- Hmm?

179
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,269
- Senility.
- Senility?

180
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,933
Well, look at the symptoms:
chronic irritability...

181
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,205
difficulty relating to others,
uh, self-absorption--

182
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,212
That's not Potter.
That's you.

183
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,339
The only thing wrong with the colonel
is every so often...

184
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,747
he gets sick of the madness,
just like the rest of us.

185
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,686
You'll see, Pierce.
Wait'll he forgets how to tie his shoes.

186
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,482
Boy, am I glad
you're here, Doc.

187
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:17,892
This thing's killin' me.
The pain's shootin' through my body.

188
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,896
You think you could've
missed something?

- Private, I do not miss things.
- [ Groans ]

190

You have a superficial
laceration of the trapezius.

Or, put into words
that you could understand...

192
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,206
you've got a boo-boo
on your shoulder.

193
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:33,745
You can put it back down now.
If there is any pain, it will subside.

194
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,836
By the way...

195
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,849
that was the worst performance
I've ever seen in here.

196
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,044
It lacked sincerity, depth.

197
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:44,554
You're lucky I stayed
through the whole show. [ Chuckles ]

198

00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,738
I was just eavesdropping
on your condition.

200
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:06,333
These charts come in handy, you know?
Everybody ought to have one.

201
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:10,040
Anybody asks you how you're doing, you don't
have to answer.Just show him your chart.

202
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:14,016
So how ya doin'?
Oh, a wise guy, huh?

203
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,644
All right, look. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna block off your tube for a second.

204
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,155
I want to see how you're breathing.
No, no, no. It's not gonna hurt.

All right. That's enough.

Yeah, I know. I know.
But it's still a little swollen.

210
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,431
Give it a chance
to come down a little.

211

Good morning.

219
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:08,138
I came by
to change your dressing.

220

There.

221
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,208
As long as I'm here,
how about a nice sponge bath?

222
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,337
First we'll loosen your top.

223
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,816
Just relax, Private.

224
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,045
I've done this
hundreds of times...

225
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,646
and no one's ever
died of embarrassment.

226
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:28,282
You see, the technique
in giving a sponge bath...

227
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:32,193
is never to let the ""bathe-ee'' know
that he's being bathed at all.

228
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:36,996
You just keep looking at him straight in
the eye and talking to him at the same time.

229
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:39,002
Doesn't matter about what...

230
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,664
just so long as he doesn't notice
that he's being sponged...

231
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:44,207
and soaped and rinsed off.

232
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,834
And pretty soon,
before he's even aware of it...

233
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,812
he's had his
very first sponge bath.

234
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,117

now was it?

321
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:10,224
- You need illustrations.
- I've had it with you, Pierce.

322

- It's two-by-fours at dawn.
- [ Gagging ]

323

Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Rich.
Take it easy.

- Something's irritating his airway.

325
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:22,068
Kellye, give me
that suction here.

326
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,740
Not doing too well, huh?

327
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,679
Still not getting
any air around the tube.

328
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,247
- Fractured larynx?
- I don't know. It didn't show up before.

329
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,259
- We better take some more pictures, huh?
- Mmm.

330
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,261
Kellye, you want to call
for a litter?

331
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,197
- How are you around the larynx?
- Tricky spot. I wouldn't trust it to anyone but me.

332
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,030
We'll do it together.
And I want credit in your diary.

333
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:47,036
You still with me, kid?

334
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,940
Let's get him into X-ray.

335
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,844
Doctor?

336
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,080
Colonel.

337
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:00,345
- Rich, welcome back.
- You gave us quite a scare, son.

338
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,443
But fortunately for you,
there was me.

339
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,045
You were on the table for two hours,
minus his curtain calls.

340
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,216
- How is his airway?
- So far, okay.

341
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,295
Rich, you had a fractured larynx.
That's what the problem was.

342
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,457
I'm gonna plug your tube, and I want you
to talk very quietly and carefully.

343
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,695
Just a few words now.
Okay, talk.

344
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:21,966
[ Weak Whisper ]
Don't know what to say.

345
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,303
- You just spoke volumes.
- Loud and clear.

346
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,707
As if there were
any doubt.

347
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:30,212
Good work, Pierce, although
you never could have done it without me.

348
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:32,875
Congratulations, kid.
You're the talk of the town.

349
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:35,179
Uh, Colonel Potter, there's a very
important phone call for you.

350
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:40,053
- Tell 'em to hold on, Radar.
- Uh, it's Mrs. Colonel Potter, Colonel.

351
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,854
- Mildred calling me?
- Uh, no, sir. You called her.

352
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,293
- What?
- It's okay, sir. She understands.

353
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:49,355
I explained this is the first time in a week
you had a chance to talk to her, so talk to her.

354
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,903
Colonel, wish her a belated
happy anniversary for all of us, okay?

355
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:57,464
I appreciate it, boys.
Remind me to make it up to everybody.

356
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:01,568
Nope.
This I won't forget.

357
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,204
- A gold star, Radar.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,647
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Better.

359
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,719
I told ya.

360
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:16,656
Rich, I want to
tell you something.

361
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:20,527
That operation we had to perform
on you was tricky, and, uh...

362
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,897
I was a little worried.

363
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:27,438
When we were carrying you
on that litter...

364
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,499
you-you gave me a look
of confidence, and that, uh--

365
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,942
I just want you to know
that helped a lot.

Ah, Private Rich. Been nothing but trouble
from the minute he came in here.

Hey, hey.
What did I tell you?

376
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,588
No unnecessary talking
unless you meet a good-looking nurse.

- Take care, son.
- Let us know how everything turns out.
