1
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,800
Freely based on actual events

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Do you remember when they came?

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Do you remember April 9?

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
I believe you do.
Everybody does.

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
They were suddenly everywhere.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,120
Gestapo, Wehrmacht, Abwehr, SS.

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,280
All the German units.

8
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,440
German Nazis.

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
Danish Nazis.

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
They all came out of the darkness.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,880
They had just been waiting for this day.

12
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,680
Did you go out to look at it?

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,920
What did you think?

14
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
You must be deliberate.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
Execute your plan.

16
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
If you're calm,
nobody will discover anything.

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,880
People look at the dead.

18
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,320
Not at anything else.

19
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,200
They don't see you disappearing.

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,200
They cannot remember
that you have been there...

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,240
...at all.

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,560
I know I'm doing the right thing.

23
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,640
There is nothing else to do.

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Do you understand?

25
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,840
Yes.

26
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Yes?

27
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Flowers from Dagmarhus.
A birthday bouquet, I think.

28
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,200
- Östergaard Petersen?
- That is correct.

29
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,120
Should I sign?

30
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
No.

31
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,560
You often asked why.

32
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Why we do this.

33
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,960
Why?

34
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,520
- Don't provoke them.
- Yes, yes.

35
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,320
One good reason:

36
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,360
The Schalburg Corps.

37
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,960
Good morning.

38
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,200
Papers.

39
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,400
No, I don't think so.
Have you seen the paper?

40
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,960
Danes in German uniforms.
Traitors.

41
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,240
Some are trained soldiers
from the Eastern Front.

42
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Brutal pigs.

43
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Impossible to get close to them.

44
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
Always in groups.

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,680
They are... pests.

46
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
Drive!

47
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,800
The ambulance crews help.

48
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,920
The police help.

49
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Anyone who dares helps.

50
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,520
They have raised the reward to
10,000 kroner.

51
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,600
- For both of of us?
- Only for you.

52
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,160
- What do they know?
- They know that you have red hair.

53
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Get the hair dyed, Bent.

54
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,160
Or put a hat on.

55
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,440
- Hat?
- Yes, or a cap.

56
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
It's him.

57
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840
Another good reason:

58
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,880
Nazi editors who spread
their propaganda in the newspapers.

59
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,800
Editor Gaust?

60
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Everybody has their reasons.

61
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,600
On April 9 Jürgen watches
the Germans march into the city.

62
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,600
The endless ranks of soldiers
make him throw up.

63
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,680
He is nauseous.

64
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
He keeps on being nauseous.

65
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Until the day last summer when he
goes into a store to buy a radio for his wife.

66
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,480
In the back room they
are printing illegal newspapers.

67
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,320
Jürgen finally finds somebody
who feels like him.

68
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,400
Before long, they start illegal actions.

69
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,560
Jürgen and a few others are the
only ones left from that group.

70
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,160
All others have either fled to Sweden,
or they're dead.

71
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Executed.

72
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,560
But Jürgen...
Jürgen keeps going on.

73
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,880
Smuggles English pilots over the sound at night.
Helps with explosives.

74
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,440
Taking pills to stay awake.

75
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
Organizes weapons.
Everything.

76
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,440
And then he drives with me.

77
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,080
Time?

78
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,120
11:25.
Shoot in the neck.

79
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Aksel Winther. Police lawyer.
The most important of us.

80
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,280
He has access to virtually all
confidential channels at the Police House.

81
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,720
He has his own contacts with the English.
Receives orders directly.

82
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,560
Last autumn he organized
the escape of the Jews.

83
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,320
Without him, there was nothing.

84
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
As far as I know,
we have a clear chain of command.

85
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,920
- I had not approved the execution of Gaust today.
- We decided that it was safe.

86
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,840
- And we were just nearby.
- Oh, really.

87
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,960
A signature for the gentlemen in Stockholm.

88
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,360
There are some things coming up.

89
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,520
It requires discretion...

90
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,800
...and the strictest discipline.

91
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,160
- You'll like it.
- When it's Winther,...

92
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
- It's big.
- ...everything is big.

93
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,400
Fatherland.

94
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,840
Who else would celebrate three assassinations
in a liquor store with the Germans.

95
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
Then you're cool.

96
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,840
We are not many.
It is difficult to say who does what.

97
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Sometimes we work together.
Other times we work separately.

98
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
That is Bob,
veteran of the winter war in Finland.

99
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,960
The teacher, the Wise, an expert in
finding information on everything and everyone.

100
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,080
Big Bear, an expert in women,
Always ready to party.

101
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,960
And Little Bear,
good with weapons.

102
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Rumors say that when they must shoot a
man, they also shoot his woman.

103
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,720
The wine merchant exchange information.
Sells them to us and the Germans.

104
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,840
Banana, a former boxer joins
in all the actions he can get.

105
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Carl, a nervous guy,
but hard when it matters.

106
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,320
Heinrich and Teddy,
students, the youngest.

107
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,200
Smalle, he talks and talks,
never shuts up, especially about food.

108
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Cap, a former nun in Belgium.
Has her own group in Kastrup.

109
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Banana protects her.

110
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,480
And Jürgen, my friend.

111
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,840
We have talked about that.
You stay away from him.

112
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,800
Karl Heinz Hoffmann.
The Gestapo chief.

113
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,400
It is he who chases us.

114
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Hoffman wants to talk to you.

115
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Make no mistake.

116
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,920
Denmark has never had
a greater mass murderer than him.

117
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,880
But you know about already.

118
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,640
May I offer you a glass?

119
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Sorry.
Svend Christensen, detective.

120
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,760
- What's your name?
- Ketty... Ketty Selmer.

121
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,520
- Cheers, Svend Christensen.
- Cheers.

122
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,640
It's excellent.

123
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Are you married?

124
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes.

125
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,880
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I travel a lot.

126
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,920
- Exciting. What do you do?
- I am a fashion designer.

127
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,600
Photographer. I just made
a series for Women of Today.

128
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,240
- Who are you?
- Thank you for the wine.

129
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,720
I asked you about something.

130
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You ask too much.
Goodbye, Bent.

131
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,360
"Goodbye, Bent."

132
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,240
It may be one of the boys,
who have talked too much.

133
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,480
They would never give her my name.

134
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,160
There she is.

135
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,000
Bent, it is a German hotel.
It is packed with them in there.

136
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,200
- I'll just go in there.
- Here?

137
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,520
If you're not back in half an hour,
I'll go in there.

138
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,560
Criminal Investigation.
Ketty Selmer?

139
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,360
What do you want?

140
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,680
May I come in?

141
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,040
Who do you know?

142
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,120
I design fashion
and do fashion photography.

143
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
- I see.
- Why did you call me Bent?

144
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,920
I thought that was your name.

145
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,040
What do you really do?

146
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,600
- I cannot say.
- You must.

147
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,440
I am a courier. Stockholm - Copenhagen.
I deliver messages.

148
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,480
- I know the wine merchant.
- He just passes on information.

149
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
He is a middle man.
Nobody works for a middle man.

150
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,080
I also know Winther.

151
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,960
What do you do for Winther?

152
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
I cannot say.
You know that, too.

153
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,720
- That's not why you came.
- Isn't it?

154
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,400
It is something else you have come for.

155
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,360
I don't sleep with married women.

156
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,400
My husband is gay.
My marriage is a sham.

157
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,520
He is Swedish,
so I can travel back and forth.

158
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,480
Are you attracted to me?

159
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
Yes.

160
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
Why?

161
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
Because you're beautiful.

162
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
How old are you?

163
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,280
23. Why?

164
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,680
You're young.

165
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,520
Age means something.

166
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,840
Now go.

167
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
- Selmer, is it your real name?
- Yes.

168
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Go.

169
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,640
This is my landlady, Lis.

170
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,440
And her husband, Helmer.

171
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,560
This is where I live.

172
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
I live in their basement.

173
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,280
It's a good place.

174
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,680
It's good to wait.
That's the way it is.

175
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Most of the time is spent waiting.

176
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,320
This is Horst Ernst Gilbert, editor
the Scandinavian Telegrambureau.

177
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,920
He spits out German propaganda.

178
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,640
Political refugee from 1934.
He is a spy and colonel in the Abwehr.

179
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,800
Closest collaborator is
Hermann Seibold.

180
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,040
SS-Obersturmbannführer.
Chief of Espionage in Scandinavia.

181
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
The last one is
Mrs Elisabeth Lorentzen.

182
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,160
From Schleswig-Holstein. Author.
Highly placed in Abwehr and Gilbert's secretary.

183
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
Have some cake.

184
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
This is real coffee.

185
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
- They're Germans?
- Yes, they're German spies.

186
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Yes, but still Germans.

187
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,880
Doesn't the Freedom Council ban us
from liquidating Germans?

188
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,240
It is rather a recommendation.
That we don't follow.

189
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,520
- London wants to eradicate Abwehr.
- Have I misunderstood something?

190
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,280
Are we not trying to get rid of
Danish informers and Nazis?

191
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Yes, but you're now assigned to Special Forces.
You do as you're told.

192
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
Fine.

193
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,840
- What do you say, Bent?
- Perfect.

194
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,960
- But I don't shoot women.
- You don't?

195
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,920
Then you do it, Citronen.

196
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Or do you also have
a problem with women?

197
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,760
No, I don't.

198
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,240
If we're going to shoot senior German officers.

199
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,800
Then I think we should take Hoffmann.
Then we can paralyze the entire Gestapo.

200
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,600
- There is no order for that.
- You can give that order.

201
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I will not!

202
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,640
You stay away from Hoffmann.
Both of you.

203
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Bent, you must not engage
in a conversation with Gilbert.

204
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,720
He has a great personality and has a...
significant intellectual potential.

205
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,280
- You knock on the door and shoot him.
- Yes.

206
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,760
Good evening, Mr Nielsen.

207
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,840
I met a woman yesterday.
Ketty Selmer.

208
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Did you?

209
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,520
She's not someone
you should get mixed up with.

210
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,920
- Are you waiting for me?
- Yes.

211
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,120
- What do you want?
- How do you know my name?

212
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,880
- Someone has talked too much.
- Yes. The only question is who.

213
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Don't be afraid.
We're on the same team.

214
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,320
Are we?

215
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,040
Is it Winther?

216
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,840
You must not ask me.
And don't ask me to do anything for you.

217
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,400
And don't come here.
That is the last thing I need.

218
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,680
Good night.

219
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,720
I was going to shoot this woman.
She who betrayed Finn.

220
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,000
I come up the stairs.

221
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,400
I knock on the door. She opens the door.
I am going to pull the trigger...

222
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,600
She manages to tell me
that she's not really an informer.

223
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
She informed on him,
because he has betrayed her.

224
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,880
He had promised to marry her,
but he was already married.

225
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,440
She was a lonely, abandoned woman.

226
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,200
She stood there and stared at me.

227
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,280
I couldn't pull the trigger.

228
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,280
She wept and wept.

229
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,760
I couldn't.

230
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,480
I peed in my pants and ran.

231
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,840
The next week she informed on two more.

232
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,080
I have sworn,
it must not happen again.

233
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,400
Why couldn't you?

234
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,240
I forgot that it's not people we shoot.
It is Nazis.

235
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,160
She is yours, Jürgen.

236
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,720
We must go.

237
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,040
If you don't come back within
five minutes, I come up. Ready?

238
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,360
I couldn't.

239
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,280
I only hit her in the shoulder.

240
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I have never killed anyone before, Bent.
Sorry.

241
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,600
- Who are you?
- I come from Winther.

242
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,880
I'm here to deliver
some legal documents.

243
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,720
- May I see your badge?
- Yes, of course.

244
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,160
You have to be careful.
My husband is resting.

245
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,080
Do you want a cup of tea?

246
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,160
"Thanks, Bud Jonny."

247
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,840
The famous Soviet general.
I trained him myself, Mr...?

248
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Christensen.
Svend Christensen.

249
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,360
After the First World War many German
officers tried their luck in the Red Army.

250
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Germany was poor and lay in ruins.

251
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,760
The Russian officers who
are now fighting against the German army...

252
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,000
...were trained by us.

253
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,240
But you know that already.

254
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,000
You come from my friend Winther?

255
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes. I was asked to deliver
these documents to you.

256
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,720
Thank you.
Is there something wrong with your hand?

257
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,920
You speak excellent German,
Mr Christensen.

258
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,160
Thank you.
I have lived in Germany.

259
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,560
My father sent me there.

260
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,920
You are in the resistance movement.

261
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,560
I mean you come from Winther.
You can relax.

262
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,840
I have no particular sympathy
for Hitler or National Socialism.

263
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,280
But you have taken an oath to Hitler.
- That I will decide with my conscience.

264
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
You are a partisan.

265
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,440
That's very interesting.

266
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,920
A soldier without a front.

267
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,640
Are you also a good soldier?

268
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,320
Are you prepared to pay the price?

269
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,240
- What price?
- What do you think?

270
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,200
Life.

271
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,880
You see, there are only three reasons
to fight in a war.

272
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,720
The first is career.

273
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,880
It is very common, but it
doesn't make for a good soldier.

274
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,640
People are scared of dying
and only think about the time afterwards.

275
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,080
The second reason is ideology.
Love of the fatherland.

276
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,280
It is more interesting,
but the dreamer cracks up.

277
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,280
He is not strong enough.
He is too superficial.

278
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,760
Youthful irresponsibility,
youthful arrogance.

279
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,280
Unless he is burning.
Fanatic, if you like.

280
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Then he will be a good soldier.

281
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,320
- And the third reason?
- Hatred of the enemy.

282
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,000
Hatred seduces you,
get you to do things...

283
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,680
...you never would have thought,
you were able to.

284
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,640
Something else is hatred
caused by a personal neurosis.

285
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,400
What do you mean?

286
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,600
The neurotic is intelligent,
and he is a doubter.

287
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,680
If he is betrayed,
his hatred fades.

288
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,200
An the doubt wins.

289
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,520
War does not cater to
the neurotic.

290
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,520
The gentle, good father
is not found in war.

291
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,880
Your struggle, Christensen,
is warranted.

292
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,800
Now just be a good soldier.

293
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,360
Are you leaving already?

294
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,520
It had to come to this.

295
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,280
You make a serious mistake.

296
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,320
Our Father, which art in heaven...

297
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
hallowed be thy name...

298
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,240
There is something wrong.

299
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,680
- What happened?
- Drive.

300
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,840
Stop it.

301
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,760
Quiet. Breathe.

302
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,280
Bent, we will take you to
a private clinic.

303
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,640
An order must be followed. Do you understand?
It is not for discussion.

304
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,760
- Seibold was a hard nut.
- He is a trained soldier.

305
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,000
Mrs Lorentzen is dead
and Seibold is seriously injured.

306
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
One out of three,
it's not good enough.

307
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Then you must do it yourself next time.

308
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,480
I choose to ignore that.

309
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,800
You shouldn't have engaged
in a conversation with Gilbert.

310
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,600
- He's not a Nazi. He admires our struggle.
- You think so?

311
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,160
He will say anything.
Gilbert is incredibly gifted, isn't he?

312
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,160
He knew who you were,
and why you came. He played you.

313
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,080
He has been laughing with his wife
since you left. He and Hoffman have laughed.

314
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,880
It must not happen again.

315
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,800
Sorry. Sorry.

316
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,000
Just make sure you survive.

317
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,200
I'm meeting Hoffmann in half an hour.
Bent left the papers with Gilbert.

318
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,800
Now Hoffman would
like an explanation.

319
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,000
Jürgen... You have visitors.

320
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,640
- Where is Anne?
- She is waiting outside.

321
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,560
We've been looking for you. You promised,
you would come and fetch us.

322
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,600
It is from you.
It is a book she wanted.

323
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,360
- It is only on Monday.
- No, it is today.

324
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Should we have a party?
We usually have a small celebration.

325
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,800
We can't afford it.

326
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,640
You don't come with anything...

327
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
...and my dad will not help,
as long as I'm married to you.

328
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Wait a moment.

329
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,520
I must borrow some money.
Now. Come on.

330
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,000
Cough up.

331
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,840
It's my daughter's birthday.
Come on.

332
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,640
There is a merchant out of Runddelen.
He is a Nazi pig. Swims in cash.

333
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
I'm not a criminal.

334
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,880
Stay away from him.
Even you, Little Bear.

335
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,080
Run out and play with the yoyo
your father gave you.

336
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,280
Sorry.

337
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,200
She has learned to whistle?

338
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,080
Much has happened.

339
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,720
I don't know how long I can
handle this. Do you understand?

340
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,600
- Bodil, I'd like...
- I don't want to go to Sweden.

341
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,080
- It is safer.
- It is safe here.

342
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,920
I can't visit you here.
I can visit you in Sweden.

343
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
I love you.
You know that.

344
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,720
It's just war.

345
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,560
It has nothing to do with war.
Before the war you were not at home either.

346
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,000
I sat and waited.

347
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,960
It has nothing to do with the war.

348
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,120
You're just not able to do it.

349
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,680
You're not such a man.

350
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,600
- Are they coming?
- I suppose so.

351
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,920
- You should know if they come.
- I should know, but I don't know.

352
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,760
Finally.

353
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,120
Spex from the secret service.
Flammen and Citronen.

354
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,200
- Welcome to Stockholm.
- Thank you.

355
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,560
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

356
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,920
Three days ago Gestapo took revenge
for some attacks on German officers.

357
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,320
They stopped a tram and threw
grenades at the 29 passengers.

358
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,800
You can imagine the consequences.
If not, look inside the folder in front of you.

359
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,360
Gestapo threatens more attacks
if the assassinations continue.

360
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,600
It is pure terror.

361
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,960
Terror, which could have been avoided
if you had not attacked the Germans.

362
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,400
What are you talking about?

363
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,960
You may make Hoffmann
believe you're innocent...

364
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,520
...but we know that you ordered
the attacks on Gilbert...

365
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
...Mrs Lorentzen and Seibold.

366
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

367
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,000
- I am subject to English command...
- English command?

368
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
...and not accountable to either
the Freedom Council or the army.

369
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,200
What the hell are you talking about?

370
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,320
- Are you giving me crap?
- What is all this about?

371
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:12,320
This is an order: Any reaction
to the tram attack is ruled out.

372
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,240
All the killings, all the sabotage
must cease immediately.

373
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,200
Communist cells
have received the same order.

374
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,280
At least 50,000 armed men
are ready to fall the Germans in the back...

375
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,960
...if the allies land troops
on the West Coast. This is big.

376
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,120
We need absolute peace
to form these secret groups.

377
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,960
I need to listen to
the 29 victims. They say only one thing:

378
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,920
Revenge.

379
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,960
From your national service in the fleet
and the army, Mr Faurschou-Hviid...

380
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,480
Yes, please.

381
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,520
...you may be aware of
the consequences of refusing orders.

382
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,280
- Is that a threat?
- You could interpret it as you will.

383
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,960
We are doing a great military effort.
Neither we...

384
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,480
...or England are interested in it being
destroyed by resistance groups.

385
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,080
Our goal is to win the peace,
not to escalate the war.

386
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
I am bound by issued orders.

387
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,960
- Which was to execute Gilbert?
- Among others.

388
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,440
I will contact London and
find out who you work for.

389
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,920
Until then follow the orders
issued from here. Understood?

390
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,840
- Fatherland.
- Fatherland.

391
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,640
- Yes?
- It's Winther.

392
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,840
Spex doesn't get it. He thinks he can
sit in Stockholm and determine everything.

393
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,240
Is it us, they're watching?

394
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,560
- Yes.
- Spex's team from the army?

395
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,480
No. Spex is an idiot. It is the Swedish
security police. They're afraid of you.

396
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,520
- What are they afraid of?
- That you will shoot someone in Sweden.

397
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,160
They don't want trouble with their
German friends. You're famous here.

398
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,520
It will be difficult
to come close to Gilbert.

399
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,960
Gestapo have put bodyguards on him.

400
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,080
I can be ready in two weeks.
I will do what you come up with.

401
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,480
- London wants action now.
- Now?

402
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,600
Gilbert expands his operations.
He has become a big threat.

403
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
- Can the Bears do?
- They're too noisy.

404
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,880
This requires precision,
discretion and a little brain.

405
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,560
I might hit him from the car.
If we can get close enough.

406
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,560
- It's too risky.
- I'll do it.

407
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,840
Shut up, Jürgen.

408
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,160
- Cheers for Jürgen.
- Cheers!

409
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,840
I have closed.

410
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,760
I have closed.

411
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,480
All right... what do you want?

412
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,880
Would you like to live?
You Nazi pig.

413
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,200
Fill it up.

414
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,720
Eggs, flour, yeast, sugar...

415
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,000
Everything.

416
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,640
I see you have real coffee
for your friends in the party.

417
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,440
The apples look good.

418
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,040
- Is it real chocolate?
- Yes.

419
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,000
What the hell is that?

420
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,640
Who the hell do you think I am?
Do you think I have come to steal money?

421
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,320
Do you think I am a thief?

422
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,400
- Are you saying I am a thief?!
- Sorry.

423
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,640
Thank you...

424
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,280
- Good evening, Jürgen.
- Good evening.

425
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,520
- You come home late.
- Yes.

426
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,800
Hello, darling.

427
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,600
Now see what Daddy bought for you.

428
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,240
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Thank you.

429
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,520
And there're some dresses
you can just put on.

430
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,560
And this is for you.
That should last for a couple of days.

431
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,240
Thank you.

432
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,240
Anne, go in and get ready for bed.

433
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,320
I will come and put you in bed
in a moment.

434
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,120
Jürgen, there is something
I must tell you.

435
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,080
I have met somebody else.

436
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,080
You hear what I say?

437
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,640
It shouldn't have happened.
But it did.

438
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,720
I'm sorry.

439
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,480
Jürgen.

440
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,960
Don't.

441
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,720
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter who it is.

442
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,600
- Who is it?
- You don't know him.

443
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,680
Who is it?!

444
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,640
God damn it, answer me.
Who is it?

445
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,040
Are you afraid of me?
Why the hell are you afraid of me?

446
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,200
I've never done you any harm.
Have I done you any harm ever?

447
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,800
You'll kill him.

448
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,240
If I tell you, you'll kill him.
It's the only thing you know how to do.

449
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,720
Why do you say that?
Why do you say that? What?

450
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,160
It's not true.
Why do you say that?

451
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,280
I love you.

452
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,640
Where did you go?

453
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,440
I was...

454
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,720
I was...

455
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,640
- Can I try this one?
- Yes. Of course.

456
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,560
You get more out of it
if you use single shots.

457
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,240
Aksel asks
if you want a trip to Sweden.

458
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,680
- To calm the nerves.
- Does he?

459
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,760
- Tell him my nerves are doing well.
- Keep it. It's a gift, Jürgen.

460
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,600
I'll get another.

461
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

462
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:07,000
We can take it to Japan.
When we're done with the Germans.

463
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,440
We can go with the Americans to Japan.

464
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,880
- Flammen and Citronen in Japan?
- Precisely.

465
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,520
- And then?
- There is no "afterwards".

466
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,840
Not here. Not for us.

467
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,280
I think we should proceed.

468
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,640
Up! Come on!

469
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,800
Up!

470
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,440
Up!

471
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,800
Fatherland!

472
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,600
A short while ago Gestapo executed
three of our comrades.

473
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,280
Bob, Carl and the teacher;
were gunned down in front of Dagmarhus.

474
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,680
There is a traitor
very close to us.

475
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,120
They were betrayed.
There's no doubt about that.

476
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,040
An hour ago there were
eight executions in Ryvangen.

477
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,640
My contact says,
there will be eight more tonight.

478
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,880
Hoffman strikes back hard
after the assassination of Gilbert.

479
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,040
The Communists have
sabotaged Riffelsyndikatet.

480
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,760
And an hour ago The Schalburg Corps
bombed Tivoli in retaliation.

481
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:26,680
Everything suggests several attacks,
more retaliations and more executions.

482
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,960
I will ask for a minute's silence
for our fallen comrades.

483
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,520
Sören, are you a bigamist?

484
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,960
What?

485
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,760
Do you sleep with others?

486
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,280
No. No, damn it.

487
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,360
I could never.

488
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,360
They were my friends.
We were in Finland together.

489
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,040
- Friends betray friends.
- Should I shoot him?

490
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,200
- I don't know yet.
- It wasn't me, damn it.

491
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,760
What actually happened
at Lauritz Betjent?

492
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,640
We were out to celebrate
the invasion of France.

493
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,360
We stand by the bar.

494
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,280
Me and Little Bear and Big Bear.

495
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,400
We turn to see
that Bob and Carl and the Wise...

496
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,320
...have been surrounded
by the Gestapo.

497
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,040
There was nothing
else to do than...

498
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,320
...to just sneak out, right?

499
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,720
What do the Bears say?

500
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,080
It is true what he says.

501
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,040
About being at Lauritz Betjent.
It is right.

502
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,520
All right, Sören. Sorry.
But you know how it is.

503
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,880
Yes. You know how it is.

504
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,120
I need more time, but I will find the traitor.
Keep a low profile.

505
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,040
There's an uprising in Vesterbro.

506
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,760
Where were you?

507
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,160
Where were you,
when the popular uprising broke out?

508
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,920
Where were you on 26 June...

509
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,320
...when Copenhagen rose?

510
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,560
Finally the people had had enough.

511
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,240
Finally, they did something.

512
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,200
Now we are close.

513
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
War.

514
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,120
There are 32 dead...

515
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,840
...and it has just begun.

516
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,640
The Communists are fighting.

517
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,640
We just wait.

518
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,320
Hello, Ketty.

519
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,920
How did you come in?

520
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,880
- It's my birthday today.
- Should I sing for you?

521
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,720
No.
I would like to invite you to dinner.

522
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,160
- Who sent you?
- No one.

523
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,160
Hoffman has just declared you to
to be the German's enemy number 1.

524
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,160
The reward is 20,000 kroner,
and you break into my room?

525
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,240
There is trouble and insurrection out in the street,
and you want to eat.

526
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,120
- Are you crazy?
- All right. Sorry. I will come.

527
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,400
You must be careful.
We have to cover your hair.

528
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,120
Here.

529
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,520
- What did you do before the war?
- All kinds of things.

530
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,800
- I danced at a time.
- You danced?

531
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,560
Where?

532
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,920
At the Apollo Theater.

533
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,360
It was fun.

534
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,400
It was not pretty,
but it was fun.

535
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:26,920
And I met many people.
It was there, I met Winther.

536
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:38,400
Winther has helped me.
He got me a place to live and work.

537
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,880
He is a great man.

538
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,400
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

539
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,640
- Why do you do it?
- Do what?

540
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,000
Kill so many.

541
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,360
- Someone has to do it.
- Yes, but why kill?

542
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,360
What can we do?

543
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,840
I was sent to Germany
in 1940 by my father...

544
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,760
...to learn to
serve and cook.

545
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,360
The director of the place
where I worked, was a Nazi.

546
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,080
The chef was a Nazi.

547
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,760
Several of the servants were Nazis.

548
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,840
Each day I served them.
Everywhere.

549
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,160
A girl who worked at the hotel,
she was a Jew. Nobody knew it.

550
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,760
She kept it secret.

551
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,000
The chef found out.

552
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,400
He informed on her.

553
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,440
She was beaten to pulp by the time
the police came to fetch her.

554
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,640
It must not happen here.

555
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,000
Sabotage means nothing.

556
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,160
The only thing to do
it is to remove them. One by one.

557
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,600
Until there is no one left.

558
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,160
Was she your girlfriend?

559
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,080
What happened to her?

560
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,600
- What about you?
- I don't know.

561
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,320
I was very happy when the war came.
It was a relief.

562
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,880
Because finally one
could do something right.

563
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,800
I worked for Winther.

564
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,080
Delivered letters and got
information and passed it on.

565
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,640
It was fun in the beginning.

566
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,800
But now it's different.

567
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,720
Everything is gray.

568
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,720
I just want to survive.

569
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,040
Do you know what I think?

570
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,320
I think we should leave quietly.

571
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,040
There is one thing you must promise me.

572
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,680
You should never use me to
to obtain information.

573
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,600
You should never ask me about that.
It should not come between us.

574
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,280
- Promise me?
- Yes.

575
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,040
I wish that the war would stop soon.

576
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,920
Why can't I get out of this?

577
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,880
I wish I could just go away.

578
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,720
Where would you go?

579
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,200
To Stockholm.

580
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,760
The war doesn't stop.

581
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,800
- Don't be afraid.
- Should I not?

582
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,720
I will look after you.

583
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,400
- Will you?
- Yes.

584
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,840
My name is Jürgen.

585
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,920
Do you have time to talk to me?

586
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,400
What is your name?

587
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,920
Morten.

588
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,800
You must take good care
of my wife and my daughter.

589
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,000
- Yes.
- Do you have a job?

590
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,640
- Do you make money?
- Yes.

591
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,240
Morten,
you must be good to my daughter.

592
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,680
If I ever hear anything else...

593
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,800
...then I will return.

594
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,640
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

595
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,320
Here is coffee.

596
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,840
You have gotten a hat.

597
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,680
That's good.

598
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:29,120
- The reward for you is 20,000.
- I know.

599
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,960
It may tempt many.
A wise move by Hoffmann.

600
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,200
- Give me the order to shoot him.
- No.

601
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,600
I have something else for you.
The traitor.

602
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,880
Unfortunately it is from our own ranks.
Madam Ketty Selmer Sjöberg.

603
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,800
She must be liquidated.

604
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,520
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

605
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,880
I know her.

606
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,040
She is a courier.

607
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:09,000
- Former dancing girl.
- Yes. I know all about Ketty.

608
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,360
She is my courier.
She knows everything there is to know.

609
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,080
We must strike now.

610
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,480
Why has she not betrayed Bent?

611
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,640
Why betray Carl and the Wise,
when she could get 20,000 for Bent?

612
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,960
You should ask Bent about that.

613
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,680
She is a double agent
and feels no loyalty.

614
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,400
Hoffman has caught her,
and then she has given him information.

615
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,360
She has gone too far.

616
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,120
Should I do it?

617
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,240
No.

618
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,240
Bent?
What are you doing here?

619
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,200
It's nice to see you.

620
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,880
Sit down.

621
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,200
Who do you work for?

622
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,920
- Winther, of course.
- Try again.

623
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,480
- Who asked you to draw me?
- Nobody.

624
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,520
Why this?

625
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,080
I sat and thought of you.

626
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,080
- Why do you go to Dagmarhus?
- I must have my passport stamped.

627
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240
So I can travel.

628
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,640
See here.

629
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,880
- There. Visa.
- Who are you working for?

630
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,920
- I can't say.
- Who are you working for?

631
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,640
I work for
the army's intelligence service.

632
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,160
And Winther.

633
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,400
I bring documents back and forth.

634
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,120
I solve tasks for them.
I am under orders.

635
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,880
You betrayed them.
Didn't you?

636
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,080
Why did you betray them?

637
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,840
- Why did you betray them?
- What's this?

638
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,280
- How much did you get for it?
- Who says so?

639
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,640
Is it Winther?

640
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,840
He is a trickster.
He is a swindler.

641
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,320
Be careful what you say.
He is subject to London.

642
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,920
- London? They don't want him.
- It's not true.

643
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,200
- He receives orders...
- Yes, but not from the English.

644
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,400
Let me show you something.

645
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,400
These are copies of contracts
Winther made with Gilbert.

646
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,720
I also have copies of them
in Stockholm.

647
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,680
Winther was Gilbert's
legal adviser for years.

648
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,400
They did business together
and earned a lot of money.

649
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,720
A lot of money, Bent.
Winther must have realized that...

650
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,800
...his business with Gilbert
would be considered treason.

651
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,280
Gilbert was a senior German officer.

652
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,800
When the war ends, Winther would
be accused of profiteering.

653
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,800
His relationship with Seibold
would also be examined.

654
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:10,200
He would go to prison. He
had to get them out of the way.

655
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,080
Both Gilbert and Seibold.

656
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,800
And he used you for that.

657
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,560
- These are forgeries.
- No, the papers are genuine enough.

658
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,200
Winther is a gangster.
I know too much.

659
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,960
- Now, I must also be eliminated.
- They were German spies.

660
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,680
German spies? No.

661
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,680
Gilbert and Mrs Lorentzen
were German resistance fighters.

662
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,920
Seibold was a spy.
But you never got him, did you?

663
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,440
Gilbert was an expert at fooling people.
He had bodyguards from the Gestapo...

664
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,960
It wasn't bodyguards.

665
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,280
Gilbert was under house arrest,
suspected of anti-Nazi activities.

666
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,280
If Hoffman wanted to protect Gilbert,
you would not have come near him.

667
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,280
Is Hoffman sorry for Gilbert's death?

668
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,560
- No. you have done him a favor.
- And Mrs Lorentzen?

669
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,040
She was Gilbert's secretary and knows
about his business with Winther.

670
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,360
She was committed
to the resistance against Hitler.

671
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,360
But most of all, she was just a sweet,
little lady who got caught between two men.

672
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,800
And Winther...?

673
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,840
Does Winther work for the Gestapo?

674
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,040
No.
He just cleans up his tracks.

675
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,080
- Is Winther here?
- Go away!

676
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,680
Winther has fled to Stockholm.
They have exposed everything.

677
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,200
Go away, damn it!

678
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,080
He was right. Winther is gone.
He has bolted.

679
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,160
We have shot innocent people.

680
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,920
Aksel never worked
for the English.

681
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:11,560
Anyone who knew anything, they should
be executed. He lacked only Ketty.

682
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:15,080
- We have shot innocent...
- Shut up!

683
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,240
Shut up.

684
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,720
I have not killed innocent people.

685
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:32,080
I've shot a German officer,
and a German officer is not innocent.

686
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,720
You tell me that he was a
resistance man? Are you an idiot?

687
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,800
Winther! What did you expect?
That's the way rich people are.

688
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,320
In a nutshell. They grab and
are full of crap.

689
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,520
You should have killed her
when you first met her.

690
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,200
What are you talking about?

691
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,520
- She messes up your head.
- Beware!

692
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,760
A slut knows the real names,
and you're completely lost.

693
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,280
You fuck her, and she turns into
the Oracle of Vesterbro.

694
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,240
- Shut up.
- I say what I want to say.

695
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,720
And I have not killed any
innocent people. Do you understand that?

696
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,640
Why didn't I see it?

697
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,080
Why didn't I see it happen?

698
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,600
Now he sits in Stockholm...

699
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,120
...while we're being chased
throughout the city by the Gestapo.

700
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,760
Is that fair?

701
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,200
There is nothing that is fair or unfair.
This is war.

702
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,240
We find the ones we want to go after,
and then we go after them.

703
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,440
- Hoffmann.
- Yes.

704
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,920
Come. Come!

705
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,440
Come on, boys.

706
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,120
- Quiet.
- Where is he?

707
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,600
- Where is he?
- Back room.

708
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,160
Flammen?

709
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,760
I have an offer for you.

710
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,160
You leave this place,
so do I.

711
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,920
I stop the hunt for you
for 24 hours.

712
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:09,000
You go to Sweden and remain there till
the war is over, and this conversation...

713
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,320
...has never taken place.

714
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,480
Have you thought about
the consequences?

715
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,360
If you liquidate the Gestapo chief.

716
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,200
Do you want to survive the war?
- I will survive.

717
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,680
That would surprise me.
Survival is not part of your character.

718
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,600
You are a fanatic and a terrorist.
They always die.

719
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,920
Tell me...

720
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,440
...do you really believe that you can
change anything with all your shooting?

721
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,720
Can't you see, you are just a tool
for others with not so noble motives?

722
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:09,080
I thought you were the brain
behind all these heroic actions.

723
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,360
But no, it was Winther!

724
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,360
How could you take him seriously?
He is completely untrustworthy.

725
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,160
And now you will take over.

726
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:25,720
You were betrayed, and now
the Gestapo chief must suffer for it. Why?

727
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,760
What would it change?

728
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,120
We two are alike.

729
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,480
I love Denmark.

730
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,080
You love Denmark.

731
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,440
The beautiful landscape
in the North of Zealand.

732
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,840
Why don't we collaborate?

733
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,640
You are right. The National Socialist
idea was nice, but impossible.

734
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,640
Too many emotions.
Like an infatuation.

735
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,760
See what the idea
has done to the world.

736
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,880
But consider me as a possibility.

737
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,400
I have abandoned my ideals.
I must survive.

738
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,200
And I also want you to survive.

739
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,520
What do you say?

740
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,200
I understand you.

741
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,080
Excellent.

742
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,160
I count to three.

743
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,240
One.

744
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,040
Two.

745
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,440
Now comes the police...

746
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,320
...or what is worse for you,
German soldiers.

747
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,800
Will you wait
till you are surrounded?

748
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,200
What happened?

749
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,120
What happened?

750
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,400
- You got my message?
- Yes.

751
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,240
- You have brought people.
- So have you.

752
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,640
Yes. It is Spex.
He doesn't trust you.

753
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,960
I have a message.
I need an answer back.

754
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,880
There's a meeting in Stockholm
the day after tomorrow at 10 a.m.

755
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,640
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

756
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,800
Who is coming?

757
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,160
Spex and a representative
from the Freedom Council...

758
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,040
...and Winther.

759
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,160
- Aksel?
- Yes.

760
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,200
His problems have been sorted out.

761
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,520
I'm not coming.

762
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,000
You will, Bent.

763
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:28,480
You must go and talk to them
and hear what they have to say.

764
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,040
It is important. Do you understand?

765
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,040
I asked for permission to
give you this message.

766
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,640
Because I wanted to see you.

767
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,560
- I wanted to see that you're doing well.
- I'm fine.

768
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,960
I will tell them you're coming.

769
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,720
- Good evening.
- You're back with Winther, Bears?

770
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,080
No, we're in the army now.
They pay well.

771
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:17,080
We must unfortunately
confiscate your equipment.

772
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,760
It's an honor.

773
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:30,600
I represent the Freedom Council.
You can call me Raven.

774
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,720
You know Spex
and Aksel Winther.

775
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,320
The police lawyer is representing
the U.S. armed forces.

776
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,360
Interesting.

777
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,280
I will begin with something pleasant.

778
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,480
We are close to a breakthrough
in negotiations with the Germans...

779
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:58,000
...for a termination
of the popular uprising.

780
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,520
It will be a major victory for the people.
The curfew will be repealed.

781
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:07,040
- The Schalburg Corps will be pulled out...
- If law and order is maintained.

782
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,120
Are you listening?

783
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:16,560
Is everyone here aware of
what police lawyer has done?

784
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,600
He has ordered us to liquidate
innocent people. Old friends.

785
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,520
- They got in his way.
- What are you talking about?

786
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,320
I have worked hard to get the
nation on the Allied side.

787
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,640
- Old friends, Flammen?
- Gilbert, German resistance man.

788
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,560
- Ketty Selmer, Danish courier.
- A German opposition man?

789
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,640
Bent, my boy. The allies do not recognize
any German resistance movement.

790
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,960
It doesn't exist.

791
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:53,920
Madam Selmer was a regrettable error,
as the police lawyer explained.

792
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,040
A simple misunderstanding...

793
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,520
A misunderstanding... Excuse me.
A misunderstanding?

794
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,360
So when I shoot you in the head
in a minute...

795
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,280
...it will be a regrettable error.

796
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,440
Do we agree on that?

797
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,440
I...

798
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,880
...admire you, Flammen.

799
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:27,040
But the war can be confusing,
as you may have discovered.

800
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,080
It's filled with rumors.

801
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,360
The only sensible...

802
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,520
...is to keep a cool head.

803
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,720
The Freedom Council knows nothing
about the killing of innocents...

804
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,440
...so if you allow...

805
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,720
...can we continue the meeting.

806
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,000
- Are you a Communist, Faurschou?
- No.

807
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:56,120
We can offer you
an officer's commission.

808
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,200
You can get command of
the Copenhagen resistance unit.

809
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,160
- And the rank of captain.
- Captain.

810
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,760
Exactly, Bent. Think about it.

811
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,960
You will either fight
side by side with the English...

812
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,480
...or you will fight against
the Red Army, if they comes first.

813
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:18,840
Democracy must survive.
We would like to make use of your name.

814
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,520
- My name? How?
- We'll need heroes.

815
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,240
Lectures in schools and associations.

816
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,720
Public speaking
to crowds of thousands...

817
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,560
...to understand the
unselfish sacrifice during the occupation.

818
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,200
Which both of you are
outstanding exponents of.

819
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,560
- What about Jürgen?
- Deputy Commander. Lieutenant?

820
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:53,280
- What were you going to be?
- Captain.

821
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,760
Then I would also like to be a captain.

822
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,720
No, thanks.

823
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,000
We will no longer tolerate the disruptive
violence that the two of you engage in.

824
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,240
When there is war,
you kill your opponents.

825
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,280
I want Hoffmann. Then we can
talk about an officer's commission.

826
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,400
- Impossible.
- I respect your position.

827
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,280
But Hoffman...

828
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,080
- That won't do any good.
- We will see.

829
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:27,000
We have the means and powers to
stop you in other ways.

830
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:33,440
I apologize on Spex's behalf.
That was inappropriate.

831
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:39,640
The file contains the name
of an informer in your organization.

832
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,800
- How far are we going?
- Asserbo.

833
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,480
Consider it an expression
of our good will.

834
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,520
- Do you have a picture?
- No. We have his name and address.

835
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,800
- I must pee.
- Yes, me too.

836
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,640
Sorry.

837
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,280
What will happen now?

838
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,080
I will speak with my father.

839
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,920
- When were you here last time?
- Three years.

840
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,040
Just wait here.

841
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,200
Hello, Dad.

842
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,800
A glass of wine?

843
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:11,440
- What are you here for?
- To visit my father.

844
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,360
Let's not exaggerate.
What do you want?

845
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,160
You have many German guests.

846
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,960
Guests choose the hotel.
Not vice versa.

847
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,680
- We heard Hoffman comes here.
- The Gestapo chief?

848
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,960
- I can't tell.
- I want to talk to him.

849
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,560
He is said to be very nice...

850
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:43,160
- And a murderer for an occupying power.
- Yes, that, too.

851
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,480
- You like them?
- Them?

852
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:54,360
German culture and everything wonderful,
it has generated, I admire.

853
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,960
But "them"? No.

854
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,760
It must disappoint you,
that the war is turning.

855
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,760
Don't you listen to what I say?
I'm just trying to scrape through.

856
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,680
You are too young to understand.

857
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,920
With your background and your head...

858
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,600
...you could have gone further
than shooting people down.

859
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,120
But then you became a hero.

860
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,880
Listen.

861
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,760
If you talk nicely about me
to your Communist friends...

862
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:40,680
...and don't shoot Hoffmann here,
then I will tell you what I know.

863
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,120
Is that a deal?

864
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,480
Hoffmann comes here with his family
and his mistresses.

865
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,400
There are always four bodyguards,
who keep watch at the room.

866
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,840
I don't know in advance
when he arrives.

867
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,640
Army Intelligence
asked me to get close to him.

868
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,080
I just follow orders.

869
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:25,360
My dear Ketty. Thank you for yesterday.
You were lovely.

870
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,680
Your laughter makes me so happy.

871
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:34,320
Your Karl Heinz.

872
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,480
You're on first names.

873
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,280
This is not about you and me.

874
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,920
This is bigger. My work requires
sacrifices. They ask for something. I'll do it.

875
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,360
Did they ask you
to go to bed with me?

876
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:56,160
No.
Of course they didn't.

877
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,920
- You and me just happened.
- Did it?

878
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,800
Bent, listen here.
Hoffmann means nothing.

879
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,840
It is you that matters.

880
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,200
Do you understand that?

881
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:37,080
Now tell me which car he
drives and the route he follows.

882
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,200
- And the car's license plate.
- You must not ask me.

883
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,880
You promised you would not
ask me about anything.

884
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,880
You promised me.

885
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,280
Bent...

886
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,960
I love you.
Do you understand that?

887
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,920
No one has an interest in this.

888
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,200
If I tell you...

889
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:13,760
...will you take me with
you to Stockholm?

890
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:19,120
We go to Stockholm,
and we never return.

891
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,120
Promise me?

892
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,920
Promise me that.

893
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:35,400
He drives a small, black
Opel Cadet. In odd weeks.

894
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,720
23345.

895
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:44,360
In even weeks, it is a big Mercedes.
44193.

896
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,040
The route changes.

897
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,280
Sometimes Roskildevej...

898
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,160
...and sometimes Vigerslevvej.

899
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,680
It's not Hoffmann.

900
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,600
Oh, no!

901
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,640
You'll be fine.

902
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,680
You'll be fine.
Don't be afraid.

903
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,560
You'll be fine.

904
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,400
Dear Bent,

905
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,920
Hoffman has exposed me.

906
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,880
I'm going to Stockholm now.

907
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:40,840
I hope and believe
that you will come to me.

908
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,480
He is dead.

909
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,000
He looked at me all the time.

910
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:20,160
He looked at me,
while I ran with him.

911
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,320
I could see,
he wanted to say something, but...

912
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,560
...he could not.

913
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,200
I didn't even get there
before he died.

914
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,040
Do you still have the police uniforms?

915
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:14,720
We go to Dagmarhus
and ask for a meeting with Hoffman.

916
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,360
We must.

917
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:21,000
We will never get in.
If we get in, we will never come out again.

918
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:23,360
Come, come, come.

919
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,480
Thank you. Go on. Come.

920
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,840
Damn it.

921
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,800
I thought they had
been pulled out of the city.

922
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,520
Stop! Stop!

923
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,360
Out of the car!

924
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,520
Come on out. Can't you hear?
On the ground. Come on!

925
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,760
On the ground!

926
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,680
Up in the cart.

927
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,960
Turn around.

928
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,680
Come on.
Get up.

929
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,120
Come on!

930
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,440
Come on, damn it.
Move on!

931
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,560
Put these two down at the end.
Get up against the wall.

932
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,760
Look at the wall. Everyone should have
a meter between your feet.

933
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:40,200
- What's going on?
- They have taken the entire corps.

934
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:44,040
We going to the concentration camps.
It's the goddamn thanks.

935
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,960
- Do you still have your baby Browning?
- In the boots.

936
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,600
- And you?
- Yes.

937
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,160
In a while I will jump over
the fence, and then you run.

938
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,120
See you, Bent.

939
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,920
Back in line down there!

940
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,520
Get an ambulance!

941
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:41,600
Get him out of here!

942
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,440
Water.

943
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:07,080
- Water.
- Shut up.

944
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,600
- Water.
- Give him some water, for Heaven's sake.

945
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,920
It's in the back.

946
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,320
How are you?

947
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,840
Fine.

948
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:02,560
Damn, I have to be shot in the lung
to be cared for by you.

949
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,080
So...

950
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,080
- I'm going to prison, Marie.
- In prison?

951
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,360
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

952
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,080
I must go to prison for the things
I have done.

953
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,760
When this is over...

954
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:49,800
Do you know what I have done?

955
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,520
No.

956
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,560
You'll be fine.

957
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,560
I'll be back tomorrow.

958
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Take care of yourself, Jürgen.

959
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,120
No, no, no.

960
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,720
Down in the basement. Hurry up!

961
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,360
Hurry up.

962
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:15,760
Open up now.
Get out!

963
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,160
Open up!
Can't you hear?

964
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,880
Open up!

965
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:31,000
You must open the door!

966
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,600
Flammen?

967
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:34,680
Is it Flammen? Speak!

968
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,920
Get some milk.

969
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,800
Stop!

970
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,720
What are you doing?

971
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:39,680
Have you no shame in life?

972
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:44,960
Cover them.
- Yes!

973
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,320
Here's the money order
for the 20,000 kroner.

974
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,720
You can cash it tomorrow.

975
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,880
We also found a letter on him.

976
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:48,680
It's for you.

977
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:09,280
Do you remember when they came?

978
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:13,800
Do you remember April 9?

979
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:17,120
I think you can.

980
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,480
We all can.

981
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,760
I've thought and thought...

982
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:29,200
Whatever they say,
I don't believe it was you.

983
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,840
That's not how you are.

984
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,360
Where will we be afterwards?
When this is over.

985
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:46,880
I don't know.

986
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,760
Is there a way back?

987
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,120
Is there a way forward?

988
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,560
Maybe.

989
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,640
Maybe not.

990
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,720
Right now there is only Flammen.

991
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:50,480
After the liberation Flammen
and Citronen were buried in Copenhagen.

992
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:55,440
After the funeral their coffins stood
side by side in Holmen's Church.

993
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,480
A few months later Flammen's father passed away.

994
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,960
Citronen was in 1951 awarded the U.S. president's
distinction for heroism in war: The Medal of Freedom.

995
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:11,960
Citronen's mother received the Medal
on behalf of her son.

996
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,960
Flammen later received the same honor.

997
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:23,960
Bodil fled to Sweden,
where she gave birth to her daughter Lene.

998
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,960
After the liberation she lived in a house outside Copenhagen,
where she for many years lived alone with her daughters.

999
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,960
Citronen's fate marked the family forever.

1000
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:40,480
After Flammen's death
Ketty Selmer moved to Stockholm.

1001
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:45,440
She later settled on Mallorca,
where she lived until her death in the mid-1990s.

1002
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:50,480
She never talked about Flammen.
