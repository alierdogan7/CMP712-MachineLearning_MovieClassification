00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,991
(Birdsong and insects buzzing)

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,589
(Men chatting and laughing)

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,710
- Hey!
- All right, ease up!

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,591
WOMAN: Easy, now. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,437
BOY: On your way. Come on!

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,471
- Come on, girls, come on. Come on.
- Come on.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,476
DRIVER: Get a move on!

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,632
(Horn blares)

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,113
(Cows mooing)

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,751
BOY: Come on.
- (Horn tooting)

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,756
- Come on.
DRIVER: Are you bloody deaf?

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,155
- (Horn blares)
BOY: On your way. Come on.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,678
Keep the girls moving, Stan.
Slow as they want.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,073
All right, Mum.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,316
What's she playing at?

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,471
♪ I can see them talking
but I only hear the voices in my head

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,115
♪ Waiting for the moment
they'll be calling to me

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,789
♪ And if I try
I'll remember that the words were never said

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,308
♪ Only now the others hold no meaning for me

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,112
♪ And I'll see

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,118
♪ With wide-open eyes

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,639
♪ Of blindness

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,238
♪ I'll leave

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,033
♪ The ever-calling cries

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,354
♪ In silence

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,789

♪ Broken for now...

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,709
Morning.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,830
(Interweaving voices repeat song)

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,031
How do you do?

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,832
- Well, all I can advise is don't get complacent.
- I won't.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,668
Asthma's a condition that
can lie low for years,

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,430
then out of the blue something triggers an
attack and then suddenly you're in trouble.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,550
Thanks for the all clear, Doctor.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,195
- Give my regards to your mother, David.
- Will do, Mrs Campbell.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,391
Thank you.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,355
Have you given any more thought
to what I've asked - about enlisting?

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,631
I just want to know whether or not
they'd take me. That's all.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,399
But if they say "yes",
then that <i>won't</i> be all, will it?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,513
Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash.
I just want to know my options.

51
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,077
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me
wanting you to stay with us

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,509
would be the only option you'd need.

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,915
The appointment's at 3.30.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,713
I'll be back in time for evening surgery.

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,031
(Chatter)

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,154
- David's turning into a fine young man.
- Mm. He is.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,879
Best enjoy this while we can.

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,356
Hitler's got enough on his plate
without picking a fight with us.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,678
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,154
- If I can get away.
- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,589
Turning out in force
to oppose Joyce's proposition

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,631
is the only way to get it thrown out.

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,478
- Will you be there, Alison?
- Of course. Boxing gloves on.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,876
- Granite chin at the ready.
- Excellent. You may well need it.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,956
I suspect it could get rather bloody.

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,236
How was the check-up?

67
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,395
Fine.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,158
Good.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,556
- What can I get you, Alison?
- Some tongue would be lovely.

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,148
Oh, I was expecting you back
half an hour ago, Claire.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,192
I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron.
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,552
And then, in the grocer's, a few of us
were talking about tonight's meeting.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,556
As my employee,

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,037
you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote
in favour of my proposition tonight.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,155
Staff loyalty is a quality
that I hold in very high regard.

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,839
It's essential for a harmonious household.

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,791
Yes, Mrs Cameron.

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,354
There's a list of chores
on the kitchen table.

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,119
I'd like them completed by the time I return.

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,235
I'll be out all afternoon.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,271
Yes, Mrs Cameron.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,311
(Telephone ringing)

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,316
(Typing in background)

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,351
MAN: Mr Taylor, please.

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,311
SECOND MAN: Dr Campbell?

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,551
This way, please.

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,313
(Clock ticking)

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,231
(Bird cawing)

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,995
Waiting for inspiration, Mr Simms?

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,508
(Laughs)
Well, it has to come from somewhere.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,596
We all assumed Pat was your muse.

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,710
Doesn't quite work like that.

93
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,716
- See you at the meeting tonight?
- Yes.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,318
Thought you might like a sandwich.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,151
Another coffee would be more useful.

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,316
How did it go?

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,475
Will?

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,318
You'll be pleased to know
I didn't pass the medical.

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,272
What do you mean "didn't pass"?
You're the fittest man I know.

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,709
They found a little something
during the examination.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,875
What?

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,833
- Well, a slight irregularity with my breathing.
- How slight?

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,759
I'm sure it's nothing significant
but I need to get it looked at.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,918
Well, then let's hope it's just enough
to prevent you from going back in.

105
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,235
- Be careful what you wish for.
- Mm-hm.

106
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,597
MRS CAMERON: Ladies,
none of us should be under any illusion

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,155
about the prospect of imminent war
with Germany.

108
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,794
If and when hostilities break out,

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,115
there will be much to be done

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,789
to ensure that our homes
and families are protected

111
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,389
from the trials and tribulations
the war will inevitably bring.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,715
And it is for this reason

113
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,673
that your committee proposes
the Institute closes its doors

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,396
until we can raise our flag again
in a time of peace.

115
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,919
(Muttering)

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,674
Oi! Argh!

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,270
It needn't be for long.

118
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,790
The government assures us,
if and when they begin,

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,276
hostilities could be over by Christmas.

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,673
Madam President.

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,633
Few who lived through the last conflict
will set much store by government assurances

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,592
that any war against Germany
will be over swiftly.

123
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,200
- Mrs Barden...
- When war <i>does</i> begin,

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,358
it will hurl us all into a
period of great change.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,518
Something you, Madam President,
have proven steadfastly resistant to

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,755
over the course of your term in office.

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,632
Mrs Collingborne,
would you kindly control your sister?

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,753
As you know, Madam President,
that isn't as straightforward as you imply.

129
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,028
(Giggling)

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,351
(Groaning)

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,916
Ooh. Can you help me up?

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,032
Blimey... what happened to you?

133
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,071
Army lorry.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,917
- Ow.
- Ooh.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,556
- Ohh...
- Oh!

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,874
Sorry.

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,514
- Are you all right?
- I'm late.

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,393
Where are you going?

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,955
I am more than willing
to put my proposition to the vote.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,069
(Murmuring)

141
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,190
Any objections to that, Mrs Barden?

142
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,789
Only that the membership has been
so tightly managed over the years

143
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,276
it will almost certainly deliver
whatever you ask of it.

144
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,272
Shame on you for not sharing my faith
in our colleagues' independence of mind.

145
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,039
Shame... on... you.

146
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,798
If we walk slower,
it might not hurt so much.

147
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,152
I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson. I'm late.

148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,159
Well, why don't we leave your bike here...

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,913
...and I'll get you to where you need to be
double quick on the back of mine?

150
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,718
- Sure you can carry me?
- You're no heavier than a bag of mail.

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,875
Charming.

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,151
- A small, light, bag of mail.
- Mm.

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,475
Uncommonly pretty eyes.

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,397
Oh.

155
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,670
- Ow. Ooh.
- Are you all right?

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,711
Ow. Ow.

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,397
- 13.
- (Low chatter)

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,352
WOMAN: Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?

159
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,908
Ladies...

160
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,758
it is with some surprise...

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,711
I announce the vote to be...

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,115
- a tie.
- (Excited chatter)

163
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,879
This means that, as President,
I have the casting...

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,319
So sorry I'm late!

165
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,789
Uh...

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,316
...bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs...

167
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,354
...Madam President.

168
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,992
You haven't voted yet, have you?

169
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,758
Indeed we have, Claire.

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,918
The vote was a tie
which means that I have the casting vote.

171
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,030
With all due respect, Madam President...

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,957
And I cast my vote...

173
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,670
...in favour of closing the Institute
for the duration of the hostilities.

174
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,517
But...

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,551
But I'm here now.

176
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,079
And it's lovely to see you.

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,509
But, alas, I'm afraid too
late for you to vote.

178
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,838
I respect what you said about loyalty
this morning, Mrs Cameron...

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,834
...Madam President.

180
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,759
If I were you, I would think very carefully
about what you're about to say, young lady.

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,950
Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman.

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,632
You're among friends here.

183
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,517
I'm not ashamed to say
the thought of war scares me.

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,510
It terrifies me, if I'm honest.

185
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,635
But that's why I need this.

186
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,992
You.

187
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,435
I feel very strongly the
Institute should stay open.

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,471
(Whispering)

189
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,112
So that's how I would've voted.

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,472
That's all very well, Miss Hillman.
But I'm afraid the vote is closed.

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,875
A President's casting
vote should only be used

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,956
when there is a genuine deadlock.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,991
If Miss Hillman hadn't been waylaid,

194
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,031
then she would have been present to vote.

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,911
Yes, but she <i>was</i> waylaid.

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,952
And the vote <i>was</i> taken.
And it <i>was</i> a tie.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,515
And, consequently, I had the deciding vote.

198
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,028
If you don't allow Miss
Hillman's vote to count,

199
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,153
I shall have little choice but to call
a vote of no confidence in the President.

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,192
This could have far-reaching consequences,
Mrs Barden.

201
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,119
The President is, after all,
elected by the members,

202
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,390
and I urge you to think very carefully...

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,908
I demand a vote of no confidence
in the President!

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,155
(Low chatter)

205
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,000
I have served this branch to the best
of my ability for six long years...

206
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,271
I'm sorry, but I absolutely demand it.

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,910
...and I categorically refuse
to be subjected to this indignity,

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,837
and hereby...

209
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,395
offer my immediate resignation.

210
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,908
(Muttering)

211
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,554
- They'll come back.
- I don't think they will.

212
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,352
Well done, Frances.

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,154
Well, one way or another you've handed Joyce
exactly what she wanted.

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,831
(Thunder rumbling)

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,314
- What's up with your arm?
- Sh.

216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,676
- It's fine.
- Steph.

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,711
(Thunder rumbling)

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,991
Show me.

219
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,950
- Agh!
- Bloody hell, love.

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,718
- It's nothing.
- That's a cow-kick.

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,239
It's my own fault.

222
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,670
I was in a hurry to finish milking
so I could get in and dry off.

223
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,837
That's a bad one. If it's no easier
by morning, I'll call Dr Campbell.

224
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,996
Don't be such an old woman.

225
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,151
WIRELESS: <i>Now a special announcement</i>.

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,718
<i>The German government announced tonight
their response to a British communication</i>

227
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,673
<i>and gave their proposals
for a settlement of the Polish problem. It...</i>

228
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,711
(Gate shuts)

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,671
(Keys rattle)

230
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,438
(Door closes)

231
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,915
- Where's Dad?
- In front of the fire.

232
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,756
- Kettle done?
- Not for an hour or so.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,392
Right.

234
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,312
I've come to a decision, Ma.

235
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,799
What about?

236
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,314
Enlisting.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,230
- What?
- All the lads are talking about it.

238
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,396
Well, <i>you</i> can't enlist.

239
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,557
- You can't stop me when I'm 17.
- You're forgetting one thing...

240
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,636
- Neither can Dad.
- I'm not talking about him.

241
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,477
I'm talking about your condition.

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,273
If Doc Campbell gave me the all clear,
so will the Navy.

243
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,396
- The Navy?
- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the Navy.

244
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,952
Have you told your dad any of this?

245
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,991
No, he fell asleep before I could.

246
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,675
My mind's made up, Ma.

247
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,836
It's what I want.

248
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,790
I'll see you in the morning.

249
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,511
(Sobbing)

250
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,391
(Ticking)

251
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,150
We need to order a new stethoscope.
I suspected it was on the way out.

252
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,636
Just tried it on myself
and it appears I'm already dead.

253
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,636
I'll do it first thing.

254
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,877
I might order a couple,
before they all get requisitioned by the Army.

255
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,673
- No need to rub it in.
- Not meaning to.

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,836
Just pleased on an ongoing basis.

257
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,189
- (Door shuts)
- You're back early.

258
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,151
We were thrown out of the cinema.

259
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,033
This old chap was constantly sneezing,
disturbing everyone,

260
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,877
so Laura had a quiet word.

261
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,311
I politely suggested that if he was so unwell,
the cinema wasn't the best place for him.

262
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,396
Sound medical advice. Good for you.

263
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,954
He spluttered off to the manager,
who threw us out.

264
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,911
Though I told him that if we <i>did</i> go to war,

265
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,350
I hoped the first German bomb
dropped on England would land on his cinema.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,870
- That's a terrible thing to have said.
- Not with anyone in it!

267
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,434
- So you're banned from the cinema now?
BOTH: For life!

268
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,590
- Come on.
- I'm starving.

269
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,396
Aren't you pleased to be able to stay at home

270
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,671
to see those two banned
from every cinema in Cheshire?

271
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,870
What every father dreams of.

272
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,351
(Sheep bleating)

273
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,151
(Low drone of aeroplane engines)

274
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,990
(Clucking)

275
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
How is it?

276
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,669
We need to keep the arm in this position
for a couple of days.

277
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,950
After that, you can take the sling off,

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,072
but you must look after it
until the pain has completely gone.

279
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,396
- She's lucky it's not broken.
- "She"? I'm not one of the bloody cows.

280
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,589
- My apologies.
- Dad?

281
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,349
Bad enough Stan being in two minds
whether to call out you or the vet.

282
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,234
No point in telling you
to take a few days off work, I suppose?

283
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,319
I like a man who can answer his own questions.
Saves me from stating the obvious.

284
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,794
- Look after her.
- Mm. Fresh straw and everything.

285
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,035
You think he's joking.

286
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,553
- Have you spoken to him?
- If this is what he wants we can't stop him.

287
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,319
- You forgotten how old he is?
- I was a year younger.

288
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,157
If you were my son I'd have stopped you.

289
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,236
You wouldn't have had the option.

290
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,158
Young men are drawn to war
like moths to flame, Mim.

291
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,476
- It's their chance to prove themselves.
- Or be blown to pieces trying.

292
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,432
From a bullet or regret -
more than one way to die.

293
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,153
Spare me the "glory of the battlefield", Bryn.

294
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,876
It took us years to get through it.

295
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,877
You still can't pour a jug with a steady hand.

296
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,596
That said, I'd sooner have gone than not.

297
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,200
- David isn't ready.
- No-one is. You're not listening.

298
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,516
It's not a choice. Not for most.

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,158
(Sizzling)

300
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,879
Well, now your precious Institute's closed,
perhaps I'll have your full attention.

301
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,354
- You've always had my full attention, Bob.
- No, no.

302
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,595
Your mind is frequently elsewhere

303
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,551
when it should be focused on ensuring

304
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,114
that the only breadwinner in the house
is looked after.

305
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,358
But if you'd allow me to work, I could help
alleviate some of the financial worry.

306
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,879
We've had this conversation.

307
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,196
- But...
- Yeah, but we've had this conversation. Yes?

308
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,071
Mm.

309
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,750
Why aren't you having any?

310
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,796
There's only enough bacon for one.

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,156
(Clattering)

312
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,992
You have it.

313
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,431
Hands and knees, Pat.

314
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,751
I'm waiting.

315
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,634
(Birdsong)

316
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,477
MIRIAM: I'm begging you to help me.

317
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,317
After you gave David the all clear,

318
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,477
he went down the recruitment office
to find out about signing up.

319
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,750
When the time comes,
they'll give him a medical

320
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,110
and if they find anything relating to asthma,
they won't take him.

321
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,878
Tell them he's got it.

322
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,878
- David is a young man...
- He's not a young man!

323
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,357
- He's a boy! A 16-year-old child.
- I understand how you must be feeling.

324
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,315
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.

325
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,759
All I'm asking
is you write to the recruitment office

326
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,394
and tell them that David
has a history of chronic asthma.

327
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,590
But, Miriam, he doesn't.

328
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,269
It's acute at best and has, thankfully,
been on the wane for a number of years.

329
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,959
- They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!

330
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,595
With all due respect, Erica,
this is between me and Dr Campbell.

331
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,835
Will has looked after your
family for many years.

332
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,110
He has great affection for you all,

333
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,549
but you're asking him to
commit a malpractice.

334
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,397
He can't possibly do that.

335
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,236
I sympathise. I really do.

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,280
But you'll do nothing.

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,635
- I can't do what you're asking.
- If they take him, my son will die.

338
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,875
Miriam, I think you should leave now.

339
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,237
Save my child.

340
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,599
(Outer door slams)

341
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,350
She won't be the last.

342
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,630
The County Organiser thought
we had little choice but to close

343
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,797
due to catastrophic loss of membership.

344
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,558
She had been in touch with Joyce

345
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,151
but Joyce has refused to return,
which means none of her supporters will either.

346
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,513
She suggested we join our nearest Institute
for the duration.

347
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,836
Did she explain how we're meant to cover
16 miles there and back on bicycle?

348
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,350
At night, with military vehicles
charging all over the place?

349
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,879
She did not.

350
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,912
So that's it.

351
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,428
Either way, Joyce has got what she wanted.

352
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,599
The closure of the WI.

353
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,757
Well, then, not if we attract more members.

354
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,995
How are we going to do that?

355
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,876
In all honesty, I've no idea.

356
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,630
But that doesn't mean we give up.

357
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,114

But I am thinking about
how we might resurrect the Institute.

399
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,997
Might not mothballing be for the best
for the time being?

War can be very isolating.

She works all the hours God gives.

410
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,192
Without the WI to get her out of the house
once a month,

411
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,949
her life would almost entirely
consist of accounts and that dog.

412

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,677
What an absolutely brilliant man you are.

418
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,199
In four days, Alison will commemorate
the loss of her George

419
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,153
in a North Atlantic convoy 23 years ago...

420
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,350
...his name carved for ever
onto the village war memorial.

421
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,790
The very first fatality of the Great War
was a merchant seaman.

422
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,434
In all likelihood, the very first
fatality of this war will be one too,

423
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,153
sailing the same route for the same reason -

424
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,634
to keep this nation supplied with food.

425
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,151
Which is why every pound of fruit
we preserve as jam

426
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,352
is a pound that won't need to be shipped here
through treacherous waters.

427
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,313
To that end, I've made a
survey of the local area

428
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,839
and put together this map

429
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,111
of all the blackberry hedgerows
in and around the village boundary.

430
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,879
Our aim must be to collect it all.

431
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,629
- Frances...
- We never made jam under Joyce Cameron.

432
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,433
She thought it was too downmarket for her WI.

433
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,074
By making it now, it would serve as a signal

434
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,557
to all the women of Great Paxford
who felt excluded by Joyce and her crowd.

435
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,276
It would be a line in the sand
between the old Institute and the new.

436
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,788
A line in the sand made of jam!

437

(Laughter)

438
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,708
- There's miles of it.
- And very few of us.

439
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,320
We can't be daunted at the first hurdle.

440
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,948
Others will answer the call. I'm sure of it.

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,353
When?

442
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,436
Why, have faith, ladies.

443
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,191
Hold fast.

444
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,478
Look at this. It's for the Women's Institute.

445

of blackberries for the purpose of making jam."

450
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,957
"For the purpose of making jam."
Why not just say, "to make jam"?

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,309
- They know how to make it sound better.
- Bollocks.

- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?

- It's not for me.
- This doesn't mention cakes or flowers.

00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,269
I can't imagine how it must feel
to think of your child going off to fight.

516
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,311
(Vehicle engine droning)

517
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,314
(Ambulance bell ringing)

518
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,794
- What?
- It's heading for the village.

519
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,638
If Will doesn't need me,
I'll be straight back.

520
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,671
(Low chatter)

521
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,311
(Vehicle approaching)

522
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,717
Do you want a lift?

523
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,318
Thank you!

524
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,273
- What happened?
- I heard Bob shouting for help.

525
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,992
I found him being violently sick

526
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,190
and doubled up in pain on the hall floor.

527
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,708
- We need to go, Doc!
- Tell Pat.

528
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,391
(Birdsong)

529
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,755
(Buzzing)

530
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,631
(Birds twittering outside)

531
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,352
Ah...

532
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,597
- (Knocking)
- Pat?

533
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,676
Come in.

534
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,511
Will asked me to let you know

535
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,996
Bob won't be discharged
until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.

536
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,759
Whatever it is, it's really
knocked him for six.

537
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,670
- I think I know what it was.
- Really?

538
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,674
Pilchards.

539
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,113
- What?
- They must have been on the turn.

540
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,116
Well, don't look so worried.
Anyone can make a mistake.

541
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,959
(Lively chatter)

542
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,678
Why won't you take my money?

543
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,076
If you hadn't allowed us to pick your fruit,
we'd never have made all this.

544
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,353
I'm not going until you let me pay for it.
Not for the WI and not for you. For the fleet.

545
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,073
It would be lovely to see you
at our meeting this evening.

546
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,031
Busy, I'm afraid.

547
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,799
All the more reason.
Everyone gets so much from it.

548
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,435
Without it, I sometimes think
I'd curl up in bed and never get up.

549
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,551
Hello.

550
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,834
- Thank you, driver.
- That's all right, miss.

551
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,429
Excuse me... (Voice fades)

552
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,195
Oh, Mr Wilson. Er, Spencer.

553
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,915
Hi.

554
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,190
Would you like to try some of our jam?

555
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,356
Why not?

556
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,516
I helped make it.

557
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,078
Try that.

558
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,797
Mm. Delicious!

559
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,319
What did <i>you</i> do?

560
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,509
I...

561
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,958
...added the delicious.

562
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,236
- Spencer!
- Jenny!

563
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,589
Are you taking me for that drink, or what?

564
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,753
- Would you like to try our jam?
- No, thanks. Looks awful.

565
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,392
I helped make it.

566
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,317
Probably riddled with bits of wasp.

567
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,955
Each pot includes an invitation
to join our new Women's Institute.

568
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,835
Do I look like someone who'd join the WI?

569
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,190
Well, possibly not the old one,
but the new one might entice even you.

570
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,276
Come on, Spence. I'm parched.

571
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,869
I didn't have him down as a wolf.

572
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,992
Welcome home, Bob.

573
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

574
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,590
I have him now, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.

575
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,631
Quite all right.

576
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,911
Go steady.

577
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,511
How are you feeling?

578
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,630
You mean, after you poisoned me?

579
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,035
I didn't realise the fish was on the turn.

580
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,188
Because you were too busy
with your damned Institute.

581
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,719
No.

582
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,476
Why are you all dressed up?

583
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,756
- It's the first meeting of the new...
- You're not going.

584
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,998
- But...
- I need you to look after me, yes?

585
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,869
Yes.

586
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,070
That's all you have to do, Patricia.

587
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,189
Look... after... me.

588
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,591
(Cup and saucer gently rattling)

589
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,910
No-one else is coming, are they?

590
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,716
At least we sold all the jam.

591
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,479
Proves people's sense of patriotism
is alive and well.

592
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,750
- True.
- (Door opens)

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,440
- Am I late?
- No. Not at all.

594
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,155
Everyone... This is Miss Fenchurch,
our school's new teacher.

595
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,952
- Hello.
- How do you do?

596
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,228
Hello.

597
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,989
- Can she not speak?
- Oh, on the contrary...

598
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,553
(Whispers) Behind you.

599
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,071
Only you.

600
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,599
I thought as much.

601
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,029
Hardly the making of a new Institute.

602
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,670
Oh, excuse me!

603
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,476
I thought I'd come and have a look.

604
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,558
- Is the meeting still on?
- Not noticeably.

605
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,239
It is... inasmuch as <i>we're</i> here.

606
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,555
I'll just get the girls off the trailer.

607
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,749
The girls?

608
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,671
It's on, girls!

609
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,950
- Right, that's us!
- Ooh!

610
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,560
Come on, girls, park yourselves.

611
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,955
I hope you don't mind.
I mentioned it to some women.

612
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,434
No, of course not.
The more the merrier.

613
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,631
You say that now.
Come on, ladies, quick as you like.

614
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,954
(Chatter)

615
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,948
Are you staying or leaving, Mrs Cameron?

616
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,638
This will fail, Mrs Collingborne.

617
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,830
Lowering standards never works.

618
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,359
The only thing that's failed

619
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,392
is your determined attempt
to keep this Institute

620
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,557
at the preserve of
your favoured snobs and sycophants.

621
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,559
But then that, like so much else,
is about to change.

622
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,388
Now, if you're willing to change with us,
then you are very welcome to stay...

623
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,352
When I want a homily
on the "joys of transformation",

624
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,676
I'll listen to the organ grinder
in church on Sunday...

625
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,432
...not his monkey at the village hall midweek.

626
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,153
Enjoy the company of your new friends
while you can.

627
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,555
This - whatever this purports to be -
can't survive.

628
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,318
It doesn't purport to be anything.

629
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,751
It <i>is</i> Great Paxford's new Women's Institute.

630
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,109
If you say so, Mrs Collingborne.

631
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,599
Good evening.

632
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,108
FRANCES: You are most welcome!

633
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,678
Good jam, by the way.

634
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,631
Too sweet for me, but my two loved it.

635
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,639
I prefer damson.

636
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,148
There'll be plenty on the
trees in a week and...

637
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,873
We've got a spare shed
if you need to store anything.

638
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,512
That would be utterly fantastic.

639
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,028
I've got some other ideas
if you'd like to hear them.

640
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,072
Like to? We'd love to!

641
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,512
Ladies! Please come in.

642
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,835
You're most welcome.

643
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,911
(Clock ticking)

644
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,471
(Door bangs)

645
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,192
ERICA: I'm back!

646
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,836
At the beginning of the evening, it looked like
no-one was going to come, but by the end...

647
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,828
I had a call from the consultant an hour ago.

648
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,076
Good doctor. Nice man.

649
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,109
And?

650
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,190
I have lung cancer, Erica.

651
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,631
What?

652
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,276
Apparently, I have lung cancer.

653
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,030
- But... But that's... that's not possible.
- They've caught it early.

654
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,594
- You haven't got cancer, Will.
- Erica.

655
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,036
I'm afraid I have.

656
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,030
But what... What do we tell the girls?

657
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,316
Until there's something they really need
to know, can't we leave them as they are?

658
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,430
The whole country's in a state of
jumping the gun. Let's not follow suit.

659
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,118
We can't just continue as normal.

660
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,673
Yes. As normal.

661
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,711
Precisely that.

662
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,796
For as long as possible.

663
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,279
Please.

664
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,196
