Batteries release, kill target with guns!

548
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,003
Shot over!

549
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:23,704
Shot out!

550
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:25,138
Hang on!

551
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,175
[Screaming]

552
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:35,413
[Helicopter blades whirring]

553
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,715
[Tom coughing]

554
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,288
You all right?

555
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,791
[Groans] Yeah.

556
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:51,329
Mike. Mike!

557
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,531
You okay?

558
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:58,169
- Never better.
- Come on.

559
00:34:58,171 --> 00:34:59,937
[Grunting]

560
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:03,307
We're all good here, sir.

561
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,210
[Panting]

562
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:08,045
It's quiet.

563
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,314
Kilo is clear!

564
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,216
Target confirmed.

565
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:15,253
<i>Enemy appears to be neutralized.</i>

566
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:18,689
<i>Nice shooting, Nathan James!</i>

567
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,825
Green, Taylor... secure the camp,

568
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,827
find Miller and Rios.

569
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,463
We're going after Takehaya.

570
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:28,065
Yes, sir.

571
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:34,572
At the last point of contact,
Nathan James was here.

572
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,174
There are at least a dozen reasons

573
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,009
why we might not have heard from them.

574
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,477
Most likely, they went to Emcon.

575
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,145
Without telling us?

576
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:44,215
It's protocol, in the
case of imminent threat.

577
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:51,656
[Chatter]

578
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,533
[Groans]

579
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,968
[Speaking Japanese]

580
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,642
Aah! [Groans]

581
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,144
- [Gun cocks]
- Stop!

582
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:19,116
I don't care how
much she needs your blood.

583
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:22,787
I will kill you if you
make one more stupid move.

584
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,191
[Groaning]

585
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:35,199
[Groaning stops]

586
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,703
You okay, doc?

587
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:42,039
I'm fine.

588
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:50,014
Miller! Miller!

589
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,182
Miller!

590
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:53,684
Whoa! Hold!

591
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:56,254
Leave! Now!

592
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,555
Let him go

593
00:36:57,557 --> 00:36:58,856
It's over, Takehaya.

594
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,958
What was it you said?

595
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,095
"It's not over till I'm dead."

596
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,796
That can be arranged.

597
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,165
Take him down! Don't worry about
me, just take the shot!

598
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,076
You don't want to die now.

599
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:22,162
You have too much to live for.

600
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:19,637
Lieutenant, where are we?

601
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,274
Based on the trajectory of
the missile before it hit the UAV,

602
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,110
we believe the Chinese
ship is loitering here...

603
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,878
on the northeast side of the island.

604
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,180
Probably one of their destroyers.

605
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,182
You pick up any signals on SLICK 32?

606
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,651
No, sir. So far, they've been quiet.

607
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,653
Should we call St. Louis?

608
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:37,121
We can't break Emcon.

609
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:38,656
Not until we're out
of their engagement zone.

610
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,926
Tell the bridge to head South
for open water at flank speed.

611
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,661
Aye, sir.

612
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:46,731
Good job today, Lieutenant.

613
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:49,033
Thank you, sir.

614
00:39:57,736 --> 00:40:00,037
Master Chief...

615
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:04,008
Hi. I'm Sasha Cooper.

616
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,509
How you doing?

617
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,623
[Groaning]

618
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:31,902
How many we lose looking for us?

619
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,638
Kudelski in the minefield.

620
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,341
On the island...

621
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:41,979
Wallace, Butler, Cruz.

622
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:46,183
All my fault.

623
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:47,852
Never should have
gone in that nightclub.

624
00:40:47,854 --> 00:40:50,588
There were coming for us,
Mike, no matter what we did.

625
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,956
Who?

626
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:56,093
The Chinese, Vietnamese, Takehaya?

627
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,262
What the hell's going on, Tom?

628
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:04,201
That's what we're going to find out.

629
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,406
Get some rest.

630
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,543
When you're ready, ship's yours.

631
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,481
[Sniffs]
