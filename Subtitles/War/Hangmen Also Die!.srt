1
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,120
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
will arrive shortly.

2
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,880
What progress have you made,
General Votruba...

3
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,340
in your recruiting your Czech
anti-Soviet battalion?

4
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,680
- You know the Fuhrer counts on you.
- Yes, but it's extremely difficult...

5
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,760
our peasants and workers are,
unfortunately very sympathetic...

6
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,100
to the Russians.

7
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,150
Perhaps our production would increase
if our Skoda workers were allowed higher pay...

8
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,770
since our food allowance is very low...

9
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,480
frequently resulting in exhaustion.

10
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,780
Admittedly, your workers may be
under paid as workers...

11
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,780
but as an inferior race, as slaves,
they are highly over paid.

12
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,040
Give them higher wages, you say?

13
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,330
So they can print more of this underground propaganda?

14
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,800
They distribute this criminal material
everyday in the Skoda plant.

15
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,800
Every department is contaminated!

16
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,440
Herr Excellence, the Reich Protector!

17
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,500
[Speaking German]

18
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,840
His Excellency, the Reich Protector,
wishes to say...

19
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,470
that the reports from Skoda
are a putrid mess.

20
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,760
The stinking swine at Skoda
refuse to work.

21
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,140
[In German]
In Skoda, there are 37,000 workers there.

22
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,400
And the sabotage is out of control ...

23
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,730
yet only 50 were executed.

24
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,230
Why not 500?

25
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,900
What did he say?

26
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,780
He said "Shooting only 50 out of 37,000 is ridiculous"...

27
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,120
he demands at least 500 lives.
The restrictions mean nothing at all.

28
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,450
Silence!

29
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,710
The munitions factory in Czechoslovakia ...

30
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,130
will be put in the hands of the Gestapo.

31
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,090
I personally, will be responsible for Skoda.

32
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,510
If I may, your Excellence...

33
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,850
isn't there some better way,
something not so drastic...

34
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,640
Is this man crazy ...

35
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,270
talking to me in this language?

36
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,980
I insist that all Czech only speak
in German. You got that?

37
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,400
German! German! German! German!

38
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,780
I'll teach these sheep
at the Skoda factory to obey...

39
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,200
not to turn to listen to
or obey traitors ever again.

40
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,160
My car!

41
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,230
For those who failed to understand
his Excellence's last remarks...

42
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,270
the entire Czech armament production ...

43
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,190
is now transferred to my authority,
under the Gestapo.

44
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,570
The Reich Protector himself
will supervise personally...

45
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,870
<i>the necessary executions at the Skoda plant.</i>

46
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,120
To Skoda!

47
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Mrs. Dvorak!

48
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,400
- Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.
- Good morning.

49
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,730
I hope I can have 2 lbs. of potatoes.

50
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,030
I'm sorry, Mrs. Novotny,
perhaps tomorrow.

51
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,030
The turnips are nice.

52
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,450
Well, I guess it will have to be turnips
again, and a nice head of cabbage.

53
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,960
- Why is your motor running?
- Just waiting for my fare.

54
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,540
You know that gasoline is
ordered not to waste?

55
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
Yeah, but my battery is run down,
it won't start up again.

56
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,510
Stop the motor!
Stop the motor!

57
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,680
Now, start it up again.

58
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,470
[Car starts right up]

59
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,560
I... I guess it must have charged up.

60
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,690
So, you carry on this sabotage trick
to use up our fuel supply.

61
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,940
- Continue and do not stop.
- I do not know, don't understand it.

62
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,110
- I had to crank it up this morning.
- Drive to the police precinct.

63
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,200
- Yeah, but it never charged up...
- Forward! Forward!

64
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,250
Vanya was arrested.
Get going, quick.

65
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,760
Haya.

66
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,340
Pardon me Miss, but did you see
a taxi cab waiting?

67
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,050
Yes, a few minutes ago...

68
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,050
he seemed to had some trouble
with the Occupational Police.

69
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,680
They drove off with him.

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,340
Thank you.

71
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,340
[Police whistle blows]

72
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,940
[Speaking German]
Go over there.

73
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,410
You, look over there.

74
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,910
Hey, Miss..

75
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,750
A man running out from that alley.
Did you see him?

76
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,830
Yes.

77
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,830
[Whistles blows again]

78
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,640
In which direction did he run?

79
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,100
This way!

80
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,030
You better go home, now.

81
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,700
And put it on the books.

82
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,790
Thank you, Mrs. Dvorak.

83
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,530
Identification cards.

84
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,460
One, please.

85

Heydrich shot!

Heydrich been shot!

89

Stop the film!

90

Lights on!

91

Stop the film!

92
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,360
Who started this applause?

93
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,320
Who started it?

94
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,820
Answer me.

95
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,410
No one here applauded.

96
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,700
I demand who started this applause.

97
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,120
The unknown soldier.

98
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,540
Get out your identification cards.

- But I'm to stay here.
- No you can't.

112
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,550
But why?
Because of the taxi drivers arrest?

113
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,090
I don't know, orders.

114
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,680
But I can't go home. Someone
may have recognized me.

115

- Go to a hotel.
- But they'll check all the hotels

116

- Where shall I go?
- I can't take you?

117
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,750
I always dreamed of giving a my
little girl the most beautiful trousseau...

118
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,250
But with these Germans, all the shops have been scrapped bare.

119
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,260
But mother, I can't imagine anything
prettier. And it was yours.

120
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,720
- All it needs is a little cutting down.
- Cutting down?

121
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,060
Now look, Aunt Millie, I suggested it
3 months ago and everyday since.

122

- Now there is only 2 weeks left.
- Hello, girls.

123
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,400
- Hello father.
- Hello, Stepan.

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,060
Helene.

125
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,770
Nothing wrong, Stepan, is there?

126
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,690
No, no, nothing at all.

127
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,700
- Someone shot Heydrich.
- Shot Heydrich? When?

128
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,320
- Where?
- At noon on Kladno Avenue...

129
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,620
what we now must call "Ludendorf Street".

130
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,250
It's all in the paper there.

131
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,870
Father.

132
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,670
Yes?

133
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,880
I think I must have seen him.
The man who shot...

134
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,260
Close the door.

135
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,720
- I'm sure I saw him.
- You haven't seen anyone.

136
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,560
- I'm certain I have.
- You haven't seen anyone!

137
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,900
Father, you don't have any connection...

138
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,780
No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically
disconnected for over 15 years now.

139
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,950
It's best in such matters, one doesn't talk.

140
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,950
Example: You tell it to A...

141
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,450
A entrust it to B,
B confines in C...

142
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,790
C reposes the secret to D and it's
not very far from E or F.

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,170
F reports it G
and G stands for Gestapo.

144
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,220
Yes, I understand. But to you father...

145
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,220
Listen, come here, come here. Look.

146
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,480
Here.

147
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,480
Definition of "No one"...

148
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,650
"not any, not one, not a single one, none!"

149
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,690
Not to me, not to your mother
not to your little brother...

150
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,740
not even to your fiance, Jan.
No one is "no one"!

151
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,580
Look, I've had that old battery for 5 years.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

152
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,870
It's full of quarks!

153
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,580
There is some quarks to the tags, also.

154
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,340
According to the Gestapo, they belong to a car that was burned...

155
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,590
last October.

156
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,680
- Is that the late paper?
- Yep.

157
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,390
Can I look at it?

158
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,310
Yep.

159
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,990
Your cab was the getaway car!.

160
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,950
I don't know nothing about it.

161
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,080
You will talk to the Gestapo.

162
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,770
Attention!

163
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,770

- There are no borders anymore.

- You bet.

Thank you, sir.

174

There must be some other way than assassination.

175
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,950
What will be the result?
More terror, more bloodshed.

176
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,080
It will be like the student massacre
at the university

177
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,040
But Jan, those 120 boys gave their
lives to tell the world...

178
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,380
that we are still Czech.
That we will always be Czech.

179
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,380
- Yes, I agree on that...
- At least

180
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,590
Shush, Beda.

181
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,050
Say, what is the specific gravity
of phosphorus, future brother-in-law?

182
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,680
I haven't the faintest idea.

183
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,510
You've got me there, Beda,
I don't know.

184
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,140
But you're a chemists, you ought
to know it by heart.

185
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,140
Well, Jan?

186
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,560
Yes, let me see now...

187
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,440
specific...

188
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,150
Uh ah, as a chemists, I only have to
know where to look it up.

189
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,820
You have to know it by heart,
future brother-in-law.

190
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,320
Jan, you have to hurry if you're
to be home before curfew.

191
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,910
Beda, go to the kitchen and tell Auntie
to wrap something up for Jan to eat.

192
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,410
With all the restaurants closed tonight,
you'll simply starve.

193
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,410
Well, thank you very much Mrs. Novotny.

194
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,290
- I'll say good night then.
- Good night, Jan.

195
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,960
Come.

196
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,670
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

197
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,470
Good night, darling.

198
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,680
Good night.

199
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,680
[Door bell buzzes]

200
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,700
I got your name from the florist
across the street.

201
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,990
<i>Mascha, is someone there?</i>

202
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,410
Perhaps, I should go?

203
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,960
<i>- Mascha.</i>
- Yes, Auntie.

204
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,750
No, no, there's no one.

205
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,290
You helped me once before,
Miss Novotny.

206
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,800
- Yes, but...
<i>- Mascha!</i>

207
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,340
Coming, Auntie.

208
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,590
Come in quick.

209
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,430
In here.

210
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,000
Put your book away, Beda,
it's almost dinner time.

211
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,230
<i>Yes, mother.</i>

212
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,650
Hello.

213
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,950
What beautiful roses!

214
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,530
Mascha, aren't you going
to introduce me?

215
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,200
Yes, of course. Mister...

216
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,500
- Karel Vanek.
- Won't you please come in, Mr. Vanek?

217
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,210
Come.

218
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
Stepan...

219
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,340
Father, I want you to met a friend,
Mr. Vanek.

220
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,720
- Your daughter and I met...
- At the symphony.

221
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,640
My father, Professor Novotny.

222
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,100
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

223
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,850
I had the honor of being introduced
to your daughter at intermission.

224
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,900
I had the score of the symphony with me.

225
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,980
Oh, are you a musician, Mr. Vanek?

226
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,150
No, only a amateur.

227
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,490
I happen to be an architect.

228
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,410
I almost went along with
Mascha that evening...

229
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,660
only at the last minute,
I don't feel too well.

230
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,330
Oh, that's too bad,
but than again...

231
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,330
I wouldn't have had the pleasure of
escorting your daughter home.

232
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,880
Oh, then you live in this district,
Mr. Vanek?

233
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,340
No... no, I just happen to be
in the neighborhood.

234
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,110
Thought I would drop by
and pay my respects.

235
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,540
Young man, did you realize
it was already after 7 o'clock?

236
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,890
I have 6:30.

237
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,140
The correct time is 7:15. Your watch
must be slow, Mr. Vanek...

238
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,810
And tonight,
that might be dangerous.

239
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,980
Yes, I suppose I better run along.

240
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,070
If you're on the street after 7 o'clock,
they shoot you on sight.

241
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,240
Right, father...

242
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,950
Dinner is ready, lady.

243
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,040
You mustn't think of leaving.

244
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,540
- Millie, set another place, please.
- Yes.

245
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,870
Luckily Mr. Vanek, we prepared
for another guest this evening.

246
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,710
You will join us for dinner,
won't you?

247
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,630
I hardly know what to say...

248
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,890
Don't say anything, Mr. Vanek,
it's quite unnecessary.

249
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,430
Isn't it, Mascha?

250
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,230
Don't be deceived by this china,
Mr. Vanek.

251
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,990
- Turnips again.
- And cabbage.

252
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,160
My husband likes for me
to use this service...

253
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,740
just to retain the memory
of the good old days.

254
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,200
Let me correct you, Helene.

255
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,120
Not in memory of the good old days...

256
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,500
but of the bad new ones.

257
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,000
That is a meat platter.

258
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,460
It contains cabbage.
It should contain meat.

259
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,210
That's why I insist it should be
on the table before us.

260
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,380
I agree with you,
Professor Novotny.

261
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,550
What do you think of the shooting
of Heydrich, Mr. Vanek?

262
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,100
It was completely unexpected,
wasn't it?

263
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,270
It was rather inevitable,
don't you think, Mr. Vanek?

264
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,850
Yes.

265
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,230
Well, we're all very glad that
he managed to escape.

266
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,400
[Door bell buzzes]

267
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,650
I'll see who it is.

268
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,750
- It was Mrs. Sacha.
- Our janitor.

269
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,380
All males over the age of 13...

270
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,170
must register with the police
before tomorrow night.

271
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,180
Anyone without a police card
will be shot.

272
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,800
That leaves you out, Beda.

273
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,350
Apparently they don't think much
of Czech boys over 11.

274
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,140
Alright. Let them think that.

275
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,060
There may be some news on the radio.

276
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,270
Possibly.

277
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,360
Beda, you can take a recess from that
cabbage and turn on the radio.

278
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,990
Yes, sir.
Thanks.

279
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,410
Beda, you have hardly touched your food.

280
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,740
I prefer bread.

281
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,080
Careful, that's an ersatz,
it mustn't be...

282
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,880
- Oh, I knew it.
- Poor Beda.

283
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,710

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,010
It's nothing, I'm all right.
I'll be alright mother.

286
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,720
- I think it will need stitches.
- May I see it, Beda?

287
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,810
- Let's go and, put it under the faucet.
- No, Auntie.

288
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,310
I don't think it will need stitches,
Mrs. Novotny.

289
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,020
If you have a bit of bandage, a little
cotton, and some iodine...

290
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,110
- It's bleeding though.
- I think we can stop that.

291
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,700
Alright, Beda.

292
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,160

with public warnings, dopes.

305
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,030
They will need something more concrete
to surrender their beloved assassin.

306
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,910
Something to make them jump.

307
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,920
- Czaka!
- What?

308
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,670
Are you listening to me at all?

309
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,000
I beg your pardon?

310
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,170
What are you doing there?

311
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,470
Nothing.

312
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,180
File C. Yes, that's right.

313
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,480
Czaka is spelled with a "C".

314
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,560
Curious, aren't you?

315
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,520
Curious on what the Gestapo
may have ...

316
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,320
on file on the honorable brewer Czaka.

317
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,650
I will tell you: "His beer is good."
Salute!

318
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
But he, himself, rather stinks.

319
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,580
[In German]: Right. I hope you're
at home this weekend.

320
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,380
- You're a smart ass.
- Don't talk German to me.

321
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,960
If I'm going to police your
fascinating people properly...

322
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,880
I have to learn your crazy
language to perfection.

323
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,630
Here is the first list, Herr Inspector.

324
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,320
Editor...

325
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,230
Railway worker...

326
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,940
Clergyman.

327
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,030
That's good.
Priest are always good.

328
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,740
They do more harm than anyone else...

329
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,950
offending in every sermon.

330
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,040
Listen, I have a good suggestion.

331
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,710
Nykvar, the poet.

332
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,420
Nykvar?

333
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,840
What for?
He is not political.

334
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,800
He only writes folklore,
children ballets, fables.

335
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,550
Herr Gruber, if it's your intention to
Germanize the protectorate...

336
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,350
that is exactly where you should begin,
with the children.

337
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,230
You're an extraordinary patriot, Czaka.

338
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,830
I'm sorry, professor...

339
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,290
do you think I might ask the janitoress if
there is an available room here...

340
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,710
in the house where I might stay over?

341
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,550
I happen to know there's nothing.

342
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,470
There is an available couch in my study...

343
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,800
That I can personally assure you
is not uncomfortable.

344
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,680
It has already been made up.
You're welcomed to it.

345
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,560
Very kind of you,
but...

346
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,230
There is hardly an alternative,
is there Mr. Vanek?

347
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,070
I hope those chimes
don't keep you awake.

348
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,950
Wenceslas hymn?

349
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,370
I should be use to it.
I hear it every morning.

350
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,580
What funny times. A man meets my
daughter at a symphony concert once ...

351
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,700
and the next week he moves in.

352
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,500
Do you think the neighbors might gossip?
What of Jan?

353
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,630
- I don't see why the neighbors should hear of it at all.
- Well, the janitoress knows.

354
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,340
She does?

355
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,630
Yes.

356
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,260
Who told her?

357
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,680
We have our breakfast quite early,
Mr. Vanek.

358
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,730
Since it's forbidden to lecture
at the university any longer...

359
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,520
some of my former students come here
to continue their studies.

360
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,690
-  Good night, monkey.
- Professor, I must speak with you.

361
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,570
You have to excuse me.

362
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,740
and a old fellow like me can't
keep up with you younger men.

363
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,330
Good night, Mr. Vanek,
I hope you rest well.

364
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,160
Good night, monkey.

365
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Good night, father.

366
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,710
You don't need to tell him anything,
he knows.

367
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,880
You told him?

368
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,470
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't let me.

369
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,850
Father is an old revolutionary.

370
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,930
He was in exiled with the
founders of the Republic.

371
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,450
<i>British broadcasting...</i>

372
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,080
<i>The Czech government in exile here
informs that the daring execution...</i>

373
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,830
<i>of the hangman Heydrich is expected to
be followed by a nationwide bloodbath...</i>

374
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,800
<i>as savage as only the
Nazi barbarians can be.</i>

375
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,620
This woman who lead our men
the wrong way...

376
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,670
must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

377
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Maybe, but I don't know her name.

378
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,150
Pick it up, again.

379
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,750
There, put it back in place.

380
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,910
Good.

381
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,330
You say you never learned
where the girl lives?

382
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,090
- No.
- Here is the coffee, Herr Ritter.

383
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,260
[In German]
Thank you very much.

384
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,050
Real coffee.

385
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,600
Now, Mrs. Dvorak,
let's start from the beginning.

386
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,480
Now, don't be nervous, Mrs. Dvorak.

387
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,190
I am prepared to devote to you
all of tonight...

388
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,360
even longer, if necessary.

389
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,900
Well?

390
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,660
That's the girl.

391
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,340
I want you to listen to me very closely,
Mrs. Dvorak.

392
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,880
Do you realize where you are?

393
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,760
Yes.

394
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,180
And exactly,
where are you?

395
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,720
Gestapo.

396
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,020
And you actually believe you will walk
out of here without telling us the truth?

397
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,910
Now.

398
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,660
This girl...

399
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,250
who sent our men the wrong way...

400
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,380
she must have brought vegetables at
your place many times before.

401
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
<i>It is now 8 a.m.
Last night the Fuhrer's own physician...</i>

402
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,800
<i>performed an extremely delicate
operation on the spinal cord...</i>

403
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,430
<i>on his excellency the Reich Protector...</i>

404
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,270
<i>removing 3 pistol bullets.</i>

405
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,940
- Anything?
- No. Nothing yet.

406
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,230
Here.

407
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,400
Several people have been arrested.

408
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,620
It is reliably reported that the
Gestapo have a definite clue...

409
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,620
- that will lead directly to the assassin.
- The taxi driver.

410
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,910
- No, no.
- But, who else?

411
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,210
I don't know.

412
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,460
I must leave at once.

413
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,630
<i>An important announcement from
the Occupational Authorities.</i>

414
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,130
<i>Taking personal charge...</i>

415
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,760
<i>the chief of the Gestapo from Prague...</i>

416
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,550
<i>Kurt Haas, has ordered instant retaliation...</i>

417
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,550
<i>for the insufficient cooperation of the civilian population.</i>

418
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,470
<i>Most severe methods are to be expected.</i>

419
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,730
They know nothing.

420
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,190
If they did, they would not threaten.

421
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,730
Miss Novotny.

422
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,570
Loud pounding on door]
Open up!

423
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,620
[In German]
Come with me. You, stay here.

424
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,210
Who are you?
What's your name?

425
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,130
- Karel Vanek.
- You live in this house?

426
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,670
Who are you?

427
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,010
I am Professor Novotny.
Whom are you looking for?

428
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,100
- For you?
- No!

429
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,020
Quiet, no interference!

430
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,600
On what grounds?

431
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,230
For the loathsome abominable
crime committed  against..

432
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,900
[German]the person of the
Reich Protector. And the refusal...

433
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,740
of Czechs who resist
to cooperate with us.

434
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,030
Who shall be held hostage until the killer...

435
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,120
is delivered to the authority.

436
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,000
And what if he is not surrendered?

437
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,040
This response is from the Occupation Authority.

438
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,760
If I understand you correctly, and for the
benefit of my family and students...

439
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,880
the loathsome abominable crime...

440
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,470
against his excellency,
the Reich Protector...

441
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,180
or more correctly, the unheard of...

442
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,850
traitorous behavior of my countrymen...

443
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,810
in failing wholeheartedly to fall in line with their "German" protectors...

444
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,070
compels you to hold me hostage...

445
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,070
together with others in whom, I presume,
until the assassin is surrendered..

446
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,950
our lives becoming forfeit for his?

447
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,740
- I believe that is correct?
- Correct

448
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,370
- Father, no. They can't...
- Oh yes, they can.

449
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,870
They can arrest me,
they can arrest a hundred more.

450
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,960
Indeed, they can arrest as many hundreds
as they have on their lists.

451
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,050
But I don't believe they will find
one single traitor among us.

452
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,300
- Or in all of the Czech nation.
- Who are you and all these others?

453
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,970
Some of my former students.
I give them private tutoring.

454
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Or is that forbidden too?

455
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,440
Keep your mouth shut, or you'll get some
real tutoring. Make yourself ready.

456
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,690
How can you take my husband for
something he knows nothing about?

457
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,610
No interruptions!

458
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,030
- Ludmilla.
- Yes?

459
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,320
Will you get some of my things ready?
Just a few for tonight.

460
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,570
Yes.

461
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,160
No razors are permitted.

462
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,450
I trust you will all continue
with your studies?

463
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,380
Don't let yourself be snowed
under at Valley Forge.

464
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,550
Father!

465
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,590
Good luck.

466
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,340
- Thank you.
- Now please go.

467
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,560
All of you.

468
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,310
- Stepan, I'm frighten.
- I know, I know

469
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,560
Monkey.

470
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,230
Thank you, sister.

471
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,070
Goodbye, son.

472
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,530
Remember all this, well.

473
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,660
I will.

474
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm ready.

475
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,630
Vystyd, Priest

476
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Votruba, General.

477
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,770
Pravotka, Jew.

478
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,020
Necval, Writer.

479
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,150
Schyler, Clerk.

480
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,030
Matouseck, Worker.

481
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,290
Attention!

482
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,170
Who is the oldest?

483
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,460
All men over 50 raise your arms.

484
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,970
You, your name.

485
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,100
Professor Stepan Novotny.

486
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,720
Stand at attention when you address me!

487
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,560
Novotny, you're in charge
of this barracks.

488
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,440
Will be completely responsible for
compliance with camp regulations.

489
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,440
Base cleanliness must be maintained.

490
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,240
No spit or dirt on the floor.

491
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,490
All shoe laces, suspenders,
neck ties, and belts...

492
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,250
must be turned into to the
commandant's office within one hour.

493
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,790
Understood?

494
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,370
Don't shake your head, speak!

495
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,300
Father should have dressed more warmly.
Because it is damp and cold out there.

496
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,010
The assassin must give himself up,
or he's a monster.

497
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,930
If I knew who he was,
I'd go out and tell the police.

498
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,930
- Anyone in Prague should.
- Aunt Millie, it's not as simple as that.

499
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,230
- Why not?
- Whoever help him...

500
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,810
can't go to the Gestapo
after last nights broadcast

501
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,900
It would be like signing his own death
warrant. Him and his whole family.

502
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,860
Any one who knows...

503
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,650
and helps him,
is as guilty as the assassin.

504
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,820
Mascha!

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,540
Jan, look after Mascha.

506
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,200
Mascha, is there something I can do?

507
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,500
There is only one hope...

508
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,290
that he gives himself up.

509
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,750
Yes, I'm afraid so.

510
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,380
Oh darling, I'm sorry, but ...

511
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,430
I have to get back to the lab.

512
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,140
Yes.

513
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,260
Funny, when I left you last night...

514
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,850
I met a chap coming up the stairs
with some red roses.

515
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,110
Oh yes, the florist sent
them to my mother.

516
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,940
She is one of his old customers.

517
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,900
[Door bell buzzes]

518
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,910
I'll see who it is.

519
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,830
- Beda!
- They called off the school for the whole week.

520
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,500
They said on account of Heydrich...

521
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,170
But I heard they are using the rooms for
the wounded from Russian battles.

522
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,630
- How about father?
- Nothing yet.

523
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,510
Mascha, if you hear anything be sure
to let me know.

524
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,880
- I will, Jan, and goodbye darling.
- Good bye.

525
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,800
- Good bye, Jan.
- Good bye, Beda.

526
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,970
- Beda, your bandage is all filthy.
- It isn't filthy, it's just a little tangled.

527
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,350
- I'll fix it.
- No, I better do it. Come with me.

528
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,150
You ought to take lessons from Mr. Vanek.
He's an expert at bandaging.

529
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,900
You're next, Mr. Dedic.

530
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,740
Good afternoon, doctor.

531
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,910
Good afternoon.

532
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,210
His case history, doctor.

533
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,090
How's everything going?

534
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,090
Yesterday I was afraid of complications,
but today it's been pretty good.

535
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,810
- Here are the bandages, doctor.
- Thank you. That's all.

536
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,450
I took two sedatives.
Look at that

537
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,490
Naturally anyone who has been
through your last 24 hrs

538
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,120
Yesterday, when Vanya was arrested,
it looked pretty serious

539
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,670
So we had to leave you on your own.

540
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,130
- I understood.
- You did a great job, Svoboda.

541
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
Now they let lose their
horrible bloodbath.

542
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,800
Yes.

543
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,550
They've already sized over 400 hostages.

544
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,470
We anticipated hostages.

545
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,060
Yes.

546
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,440
Yes, we did,
didn't we?

547
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:29,030
I spent last night with the family
of Professor Novotny, the historian.

548
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,030
No...

549
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
No previous acquaintance.

550
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,280
His daughter helped me.

551
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,410
She directed the black shirts the wrong way.

552
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,160
This morning...

553
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,670
Dedic...

554
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,460
I've decided to give myself up.

555
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,170
- Svoboda!
- Oh, I'm not trying to make any noble gestures.

556
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,430
Or become a heroic martyr...

557
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,220
But 400 lives...

558
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,640
Four hundred?

559
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,060
Dedic, I'm only one, only one.

560
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,520
Have you thought about what must be
done to drive the Germans out?

561
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,270
You'll be needed, Svoboda.
You have no right to surrender.

562
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,940
Don't worry...

563
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,870
They won't torture any information
out of me.

564
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,160
All they'll get is my dead body...

565
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,080
a written confession and the evidence.

566
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,830
The bullets they remove from Heydrich
will give them that.

567
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,920
The gun will be absolute proof.

568
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,670
No...

569
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,260
the underground has nothing to fear.

570
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,880
But it has, Svoboda.

571
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,220
Listen, you're an physician.

572
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,550
If a man showing your symptoms
came into your clinic...

573
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,100
wouldn't you diagnose his case
as nerves shot to pieces...

574
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,730
hysteria cause by exhaustion?

575
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,350
Would you advise a patient in that state...

576
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,060
to make an irrevocable decision?
You would not!

577
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,240
Svoboda, you were chosen to act as
a representative of the Czech people.

578
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,490
The Czech people have executed "the Hangman".

579
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,290
400 lives! Yes, Svoboda,
What is 400 lives?

580
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,450
This is a war of millions...

581
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,000
and the execution of Heydrich is only one battle in that war.

582
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,960
But a most important one.

583
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,750
And if you surrender yourself,
alive or dead...

584
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,260
The Czech people will have lost that battle.

585
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,220
Every Czech person will say to themselves:
"We dare not resist!"

586
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,180
"The Nazi terrorist is too much for us!"

587
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,220
Svoboda...

588
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,020
three years ago we lost our army.

589
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,650
We stood on the streets crying like
children and watched it surrender.

590
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,610
So we built a new one...

591
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,860
A ghost army that will haunt them
until their blood runs cold!

592
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,910
Now, you would have this
army surrender too?

593
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,680
What about this Novotny family?
I take it you were sufficiently cautious?

594
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,600
They know nothing of me.

595
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,230
I used the name of Vanek,
told them I was an architect.

596
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,350
You're sure you didn't leave no clues
to your real identity...

597
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,690
- positive connecting link?
- None, I'm sure.

598
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,030
Dedic...

599
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,530
what about the taxi driver?

600
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,370
Jumped out of the window at the
Gestapo. They got nothing from him

601
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,670
I never met the man.

602
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,540
I wish I had.

603
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,920
You better let me have that gun.

604
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,260
You have a fool proof alibi...

605
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,140
but with that gun and those bullets there,
they would chew that apart.

606
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,200
One moment.

607
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,820
You forgot your prescription.

608
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,010
Miss Novotny.

609
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,640
Dr. Svoboda,
may I talk to you alone?

610
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,610
Nurse, please.

611
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,280
What are you going to do?

612
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,820
How did you happen to find me?

613
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
That's not important.

614
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,370
It was Beda, it was your bandage that gave me the idea you were a physician.

615
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,870
You said you hear the
Wenceslau hymn every morning.

616
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,040
So, when I noticed this hospital
across from the church...

617
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,760
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

618
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,550
Nothing?

619
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,180
Last night you spoke differently...

620
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,050
when it was your life in danger.
Now you think you're safe.

621
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,220
So now it's nothing,
nothing to be done?

622
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,850
Dr. Svoboda, you're the only one
who can save my father.

623
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,770
What are you going to do?

624
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,230
I can not surrender to the Germans,
if that is what you mean.

625
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,190
But they will kill him for what you did!

626
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,570
- Let me explain.
- Alright, explain.

627
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,990
Explain why the man who helped you
was taken away to his death...

628
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
while you stood there silent.

629
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,540
But don't think I will be silent,
I tell you, I won't!

630
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,950
I won't let you kill my father,
because I won't!

631
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,000
Miss Novotny, consider what possible benefit...

632
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,250
it could do your father,
for whom I have the deepest admiration...

633
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,840
if you denounce me.

634
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,010
- You would involve your entire family.
- You were counting on that, weren't you?

635
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,390
You think you have control over me
because we helped you.

636
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,850
This is not a threat, but a simple fact.
One you must not forget.

637
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,850
You have it all nicely worked out.

638
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,020
If I tell them, then all my
family will be shot.

639
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,570
If I keep silent,
only my father will be shot.

640
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,570
In other words,
you simple statement of fact is...

641
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,030
we are lost in any case because we were
generous enough to save your life.

642
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,000
You're just a cold blooded coward.
You are no better than Heydrich, himself.

643
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,500
Even the Gestapo couldn't be as
inhuman as you are!

644
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,850
- Petschek Bank.
- Gestapo headquarters?

645
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,440
- Yes, quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.

646
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,650
Hurry, please.

647
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,170
Driver!

648
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,680
Driver!
Driver!

649
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,760
Driver! Can't you hear me?

650
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,390
You're going the wrong way.
Stop!

651
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,400
- Who are you?
- Miss Novotny, you must be out of your mind.

652
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,150
- Do you know what you're doing at all?
- Stop, driver.

653
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,320
I have no time now to give you a
lecture on political principles.

654
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,990
Haven't you any idea what is
going on here?

655
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,660
- This is war, and you're in it.
- Who are you, and where are you taking me too?

656
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,490
Don't be frightened,
we aren't taking you anywhere.

657
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,740
We just want to explain to you...

658
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:38,210
<i>- Help, let me out please!
- What going on here?</i>

659
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,630
This driver took me the wrong way here, but I told him...

660
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,340
- Where do you want to go, Miss?
- To the Gestapo.

661
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,340
<i>Gestapo?</i>

662
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,390
But he drove the other way...

663
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,600
then this strange man...

664
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,220
<i>Strange man?</i>

665
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,560
- Where is he?
- I don't know what
she is talking about, so help me.

666
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,230
I didn't hear the little lady at all.
I'm hard of hearing...

667
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,360
getting pushed around by the tweezers.

668
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,780
Alright, you're blocking traffic,
you better keep moving.

669
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,330
Why did you want to go to the Gestapo?
Did they send for you?

670
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,000
- Com'on baby, tell us.
- Com'on, out with it.

671
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,920
No, No...

672
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,010
Well, if they didn't send for you, what
business have you got with those butchers?

673
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,720
What does a decent Czech girl want
with the Gestapo anyway?

674
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,600
Who are you squealing on you
little Judas? That poor driver?

675
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,890
What did he do to you, huh?

676
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,770
The Gestapo!

677
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,200
- No, don't let them.
- You needn't be afraid, Miss

678
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,200
- You wanted to be taken to the Gestapo?
- Yes.

679
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,620
Have you received a summons, or do
you wish to make a statement?

680
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,290
I haven't received any summons.

681
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,420
Alright miss, you will be taken to
the headquarters safely.

682
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,230
Mascha Novotny,
for Inspector Ritter.

683
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,690
Here is your pass, Miss Novotny.
Heil, Hitler.

684
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,240
Miss Novotny,
it will be a few minutes.

685
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,740
Perhaps I might go to the washroom?

686
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,660
My cheek is bleeding again.

687
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,620
Right across the corridor,
first door to the left.

688
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,890
Your pass, miss??

689
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,440
Over there.

690
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,110
Your pass?

691
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,360
You've been to Herr Ritter's office?

692
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,200
- Yes.
- And you have already made your statement?

693
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,070
Yes.

694
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,740
That's strange.

695
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,540
That pass should be
signed and stamped.

696
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,670
- There must have been should kind of mistake.
- We don't make mistakes here!

697
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,710
My father had nothing to do
with the shooting yesterday.

698
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,510
He was doing research at the library
all day.

699
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,470
You can easily get proof.

700
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,810
- And this is the statement you came to make?
- Yes.

701
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,560
But I understood only a few minutes ago...

702
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,900
you wanted to leave...

703
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,650
without the benefit of this
extremely valuable testimony.

704
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,530
We are very grateful to you...

705
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,040
for not leaving us.

706
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,370
Just wait a minute.

707
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,130
First she tried to break out
without seeing me.

708
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,960
Now she would have us believe she came
only to have her father released.

709
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,920
- Bunk!
- What does she look like?

710
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,260
Young, quite attractive...

711
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,930
brown eyes, about 22, I would say.

712
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,010
Burnett, 5ft 4?

713
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,560
Yes!

714
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,990
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long,
Miss Novotny.

715
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,370
It's too bad for us,
you see.

716
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,790
Before you explained about your father...

717
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,210
I honestly hoped you came ...

718
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,170
because of the one million marks reward.

719
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,420
Can you appreciate my disappointment?
[Intercom buzzer]

720
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,450
Come here, Mrs. Dvorak.
Come, come, come.

721
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,240
Wait over here

722
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,660
Is this the girl who sent the our
men the wrong way?

723
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,590
You don't know her at all?

724
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,880
Yes, I know her.

725
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:44,720
- She is Miss Novotny.
- Did she come to your shop at noon yesterday?

726
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,060
No.

727
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,860
You know what will happen
to you if you lie?

728
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,110
Yes.

729
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,610
[German]
Take her!

730
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,080
Marvelous people,
these Czechs.

731
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,330
Stubborn to the end.

732
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,920
To the bitter end...

733
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,090
Miss Novotny.

734
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,640
Get me Inspector Gruber.

735
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,310
I'm glad you're not involved in
this beastly crime.

736
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,980
Hello?
No, Herr Gruber.

737
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:35,060
Don't question her anymore.
Make her feel safe.

738
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,310
She is our only good lead, so far.

739
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,110
Tell her you'll let her go...

740
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,150
but hold her here, some excuse...

741
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,990
typing the record or something.

742
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,570
Long enough for us to work.

743
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,570
[Clock chimes]

744
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,140
Attention!

745
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,980
Attention!

746
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,270
Barrack leader
Novotny. 42 men.

747
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,820
Form into straight lines.

748
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,860
Stand up, all of you!

749
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,910
Form up! Faster!

750
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:29,200
As you stand!

751
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

752
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,460
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

753
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,670
What's your name?

754
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,420
Vasily.

755
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,300
Vasily.

756
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

757
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,760
What does this mean?

758
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,010
<i>- Name?
- Santroch.</i>

759
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,690
No, Herr Inspector.

760
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,400
Nothing.

761
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,610
Here is your report.

762
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,280
Your statement and incident
on the streets.

763
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,410
Sign it.

764
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,660
5:30.

765
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,040
In exactly 30 minutes...

766
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,340
the first 40 hostages will be executed.

767
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,470
Sign all four copies.

768
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,680
By the way, your father is
not among the 40...

769
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,850
this morning.

770
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,160
You are free to leave now,
Miss Novotny.

771
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,000
Heil, Hitler.

772
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,560
Mascha, I didn't lose my head at all...

773
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:07,060
even when they found out about your
friend sleeping here the night before last

774
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,270
Aunt Millie!

775
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,320
Don't worry, I stopped
all chance of gossip.

776
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:18,330
Nip it in the bud. I told them it was
your fiance who stayed over, Jan.

777
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,870
Jan!

778
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,630
- Jan, darling I must talk to you.
- I must talk to you too.

779
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,340
- Where have you been?
- We better go inside.

780
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,220
I'll tell you where I've been:
at the Gestapo since 6:00 this morning.

781
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,390
What did they ask you about, Jan?

782
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
They wanted to know where
I spent last night.

783
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,690
- And?
- I told them I was here, of course!

784
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,310
- Of course.
- Mascha, what is this all about? Who is this man?

785
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,730
- What did they ask about him?
- O Inspector Gruber questioned me...

786
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,400
wanted to know if I knew him.

787
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,950
How did he happen to
come to your house?

788
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,580
- He dropped in just after you left.
- To see your Father?

789
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,380
- Was it something political?
- No, nothing political.

790
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,500
He came to see me.

791
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,550
You?

792
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,970
You see, we met at the
symphony last week...

793
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,010
yesterday he...

794
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,890
- dropped in quite unexpectedly.
- And stayed for the night.

795
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,850
It was curfew hour.
He had to stay over.

796
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,440
Charming coincidence.

797
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,570
He was the man who brought you
those roses, wasn't he?

798
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,780
Yes.

799
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,200
"The florist sent them to my mother".
That was a lie too.

800
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,370
Jan, You don't think I...

801
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,170
had anything to do with that man?

802
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,790
Mascha, I always thought that everything between us would be above board...

803
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,550
Open, clean.

804
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,010
Darling, you know I love you.

805
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,930
Please try to believe in me, Jan.

806
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,100
Mascha, why didn't you tell me?

807
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,560
Don't ask me why.

808
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,480
If you love me, Jan,
you must believe in me.

809
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,060
You're all I have to believe in.

810
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,610
You know that.
Don't let me down.

811
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,700
Jan, I'll never forget that
you believed in me.

812
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,500
Miss Novotny?

813
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,670
Gestapo. You're under arrest

814
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,510
We checked your story,
Miss Novotny...

815
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,600
In all of Prague,
no architect called Vanek exists

816
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,230
You're lying.

817
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,980
Where did you say you met him first?

818
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,690
At symphony hall.

819
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,400
You said you met him
during the intermission?

820
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,900
No, he had the seat next to mine.

821
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,700
And he told you his name was Vanek?

822
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,990
Yes, Karel Vanek.

823
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,330
- What's his real name?
- I don't know.

824
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,080
What illegal organizations does
your daughter belong too?

825
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,120
None at all. Mascha is a music student.

826
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,210
This Karel Vanek...

827
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,420
Isn't he one of your husbands former
colleagues from the university? A fellow teacher?

828
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,050
- Professor Novotny had never met him before.
- Where does this man live?

829
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,350
How shall I know?
He didn't tell me.

830
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,310
Is it usual for your niece to entertain
strange gentlemen at night?

831
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,350
No.

832
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,270
How many times did he sleep over
at your apartment?

833
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,440
Only that night.
And on the account of curfew.

834
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,320
Why did he come that particular night?

835
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,860
- I don't know.
- Answer properly!

836
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,030
You know we have means
to make you talk.

837
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,450
Maybe you have heard about
the rooms below.

838
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,160
What was his exact reason for coming?

839
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,210
A former call, to pay respects
to my daughter is all.

840
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,880
Why did you sister-in-law say it was your daughters fiance?

841
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,630
Because I was afraid the neighbors
would gossip about a stranger.

842
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,680
What was this "strangers" real name?

843
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,760
- Mr. Vanek.
- You're lying!

844
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,020
- I'm not lying.
- No?

845
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,770
We'll soon find out.

846
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,150
Do you know where your sister is
right at this moment?

847
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,820
She is where everybody ends up
who doesn't tell us the truth!

848
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,440
Mrs. Dvorak!

849
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,580
The whole family sticks to the same story...

850
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,750
But I don't believe this man,
Karel Vanek, exists

851
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,130
This letter arrived at the Novotny
apartment an hour ago...

852
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,930
by special messenger with a bouquet of roses...

853
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,140
from a  "Mr. Karel Vanek".

854
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,180
Vanek!

855
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,430
Interesting.

856
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,900
Why, this is ridicules!

857
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,440
You told me that this man doesn't exists

858
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,440
Curios.

859
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,450
Doesn't exist, yet here he is.

860
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,450
You're not going to tell me we went through
all this trouble for a silly love affair?

861
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,330
Looks that way.

862
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,330
What do you suggest, Gruber?

863
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,710
That we release the girl.

864
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,510
- What?
- What else can we do?

865
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,170
Are we suppose to interfere with lovers?

866
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,760
Or are we?

867
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,190
Miss Mascha, I had to come and offer
sympathy to you and your mother ...

868
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,230
for your fathers arrest

869
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,150
I have been unable to get that
tragic scene out of my mind.

870
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,870
ever since yesterday, I've been in the
depths of despair trying to quiet my conscience.

871
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,120
- I came to offer my help.
- Help!

872
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,830
You're talking of help!

873
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,120
The one responsible for all
we have been through!

874
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,670
<i>You spent the night with your conscience brother you?</i>

875
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,590
<i>We spent it with the Gestapo!</i>

876
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,050
<i>My whole family is still there.</i>

877
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,170
<i>You're the one the Gestapo wants!</i>

878
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,260
<i>You killed...</i>

879
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,810
<i>any feelings I...</i>

880
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,430
<i>ever had for you.</i>

881
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,520
<i>The things we've been through merrily
because you spent the night here...</i>

882
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,400
<i>- Mr. Vanek.
- Mascha...</i>

883
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,400
I can't tell you how sorry I am...

884
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,240
that my thoughtlessness has
brought to you.

885
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,450
Whatever you think of me,
I deserve and more.

886
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,210
Tell me the truth!

887
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,080
Alright, Mascha, I will.

888
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,920
<i>I gave you a false name.</i>

889
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,460
<i>My name is not Karel Vanek,
and I'm not an architect.</i>

890
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,630
<i>I am Dr. Franticek Svoboda...</i>

891
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,340
<i>resident surgeon
at St. Pancrazio hospital .</i>

892
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,930
<i>Why didn't you tell me that right away?</i>

893
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,350
<i>Maybe we ought to go into
the living room.</i>

894
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,690
<i>- Out here we might be overheard..</i>

895
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,320
<i>Mascha, I must make an confession.</i>

896
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,780
<i>I love you.</i>

897
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,740
I did take advantage of the curfew law
to stay over night...

898
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,120
But now it seems my silly little
escapade has boomeranged...

899
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,170
And I have fallen head over heels
with you Mascha.

900
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,960
And that is my only excuse for the
trouble I've made you.

901
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,010
I think I understand you much better now,
Dr. Svoboda.

902
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,600
And you do forgive me?

903
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,560
<i>I really ought to blame myself. After all...</i>

904
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,890
- Shut it down!
- Well...

905
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,560
This puts us back to where we started.

906
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,480
There is something fishy about all of this.

907
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,690
Why can't we admit when we are through?

908
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,360
You've have wasted all our time over
a cheap romance.

909
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,120
Release the family, start from scratch...

910
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,870
before Berlin comes down on our necks.

911
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,040
They're lovers.

912
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,210
I remember exactly, because it was the
same day his Excellency was shot.

913
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,670
- You're sure of the time?
- I have the operation reports right here.

914
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,260
Dr. Svoboda assisted me while I
performed the Cholecystectomy.

915
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,390
During the operation he was in charge
of the suction pump apparatus as usual.

916
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:34,010
Dr. Kesselbach, I understand you
also function as physician ...

917
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,770
for storm troop 34.

918
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,390
Yes, sir.

919
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,980
And Dr. Svoboda was there that day,
throughout the operation?

920
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,020
Yes, for 42 hours.

921
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,360
He stood only a few feet away from me.

922
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,400
You understand, Herr Inspector,
these intestinal operations...

923
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,860
-
require constant control...
- I understand, Dr. Kesselbach, Thank you.

924
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,200
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you, professor.

925
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,500
Heil, Hitler!

926
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,040
Heil, Hitler!

927
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,760
Frankly, I dislike being beaten.

928
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,470
Even by our most distinguish poet.

929
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,510
You know, Mr. Necval, I always wanted
to met your personally...

930
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,720
- and now at last..
- I had always hoped to met you, Professor Novotny.

931
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,470
- and now at last..
- Excuse me, Mr. Necval...

932
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,600
- I wonder if I could bother you?
- Yes?

933
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,650
I happen to just scribble something
down today just to...

934
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,570
a few lines for a song maybe.

935
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,480
You being such a big writer,
I thought if you have the time...

936
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,650
please look it over. Fix it up a bit?

937
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,820
May friend, I have all the time
in the world here...

938
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,660
until these who'eses...

939
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,080
Well, this is a scribble.

940
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,080
Here, you better read it to me.

941
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,760
"Fellow patriots,
the time has come.

942
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,840
Fellow patriots,
there is work to be done.

943
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:57,470
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

944
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,190
Keep it burning, keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.

945
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,650
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

946
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,610
but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.

947
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,650
Ever onward,
never returning...

948
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,780
the senseless butcher will be learning...

949
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,660
this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.

950
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,950
Carry on,
when we are gone.

951
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,540
No surrender!"

952
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,790
Of course you could made
that a lot better.

953
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,050
No, my friend...

954
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,010
let's have it just as it stands.

955
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,180
How does it go again?
"Fellow patriots..." Let me see that please?

956
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,930
"The time has come.

957
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,850
Fellow patriots,
there's work to be done.

958
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,190
Raise the invisible torch
and pass it along...

959
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,020
Keep it burning...

960
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,690
Keep it burning, keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.

961
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,660
Die if you must,
for a cause that's just..

962
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:58,120
but shout to the end:...

963
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,910
'No surrender!'."

964
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,580
<i>So their answer to terror...</i>

965
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,620
<i>is the murder of hostages...</i>

966
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,380
<i>Ours is the slowing down of
the German war machine.</i>

967
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,340
By the end of the week
all war production...

968
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,800
be lowered by a full 25%.

969
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,680
I work in the office of a
former hardware factory.

970
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,180
Now making parts for heavy tanks.

971
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,430
A few days ago, a telegram
came in from Berlin...

972
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,230
to stop immediately the manufacture
of 5 special tank parts.

973
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,020
Because of the new model tanks they have
started making for the Russian front.

974
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,150
Luckily, I saw the telegram
before anyone else saw it.

975
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,360
So I tore it up and threw it in the stove.

976
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,700
But what will happen?

977
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,320
They'll go on making the same 5 parts.

978
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,700
But when we send them to Germany...

979
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,290
they won't fit the new tanks.

980
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,670
Emil?

981
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,380
I think you all know sufficiently...

982
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,470
by my work with this group
from the past..

983
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,100
that no sacrifice has been
too great for me.

984
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,440
Yet I tremble before the bloodshed...

985
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,650
that threaten so many victims.

986
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,780
850 hostages have been arrested by now.

987
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:17,700
<i>More than 250 are already dead.</i>

988
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,950
<i>The very flower of our Czech nation...</i>

989
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,280
<i>faces systematic annihilation.</i>

990
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,410
Scientists, leaders of commerce, and industry, artists...

991
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,630
even priests of God!

992
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,420
So I ask, regardless of sentiment...

993
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:37,130
Can our nation afford the loss of
these outstanding citizens?

994
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,890
I say to myself, again, and again...

995
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,470
this man, whoever he is...

996
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,680
whoever executed "the Hangman",
is a great patriot...

997
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,480
a hero!

998
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,860
But still, I can't help myself...

999
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:56,440
I keep thinking: "If this man would
surrender himself...

1000
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,530
If he would say: 'Here I am, do with me
what you will, but spare the innocent'"...

1001
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,240
Wouldn't that be better for our beloved country?

1002
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,830
So I ask our group here,
if it should agree with me...

1003
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,800
to move to submit this proposal
to the Central Committee.

1004
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,410
Already people are saying...

1005
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:25,040
it is sheer lunacy to sacrifice
hundreds of lives for one.

1006
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,380
Emil, where did you hear such people
saying such things?

1007
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:29,960
All over Prague.

1008
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,170
I've even heard people blaming
the underground...

1009
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,760
for this new wave of German terror.

1010
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,050
Not where I work,
and I keep my ears open.

1011
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,510
- Right.
- I've listened to many women...

1012
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,020
some of them wives and
daughters of hostages.

1013
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,480
- Not one spoke a single word against it.
- I'm absolutely against the motion.

1014
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:52,480
I must ask to be excused on
voting on this matter.

1015
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,900
My brother was one of the hostages
executed this morning

1016
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,070
All those in favor,
raise their hands.

1017
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,000
Now the "nays"?

1018
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,000
I think the "nays" have it.

1019
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,670
We have to adjourn now,
it's getting near curfew.

1020
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,760
Leave one by one at irregular intervals.

1021
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,740
Dr. Pillar, is any one in your group...

1022
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,250
know anything about you
except your first name?

1023
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,830
Only the leader, Bartos.

1024
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,420
Anyway, you better not attend
any farther meetings.

1025
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:54,380
You're the only one in this group
involved in the Heydrich affair.

1026
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,420
Anyone who was involved should have
severed connection with this group.

1027
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:01,720
I understand.

1028
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,720
[Knocks on door]

1029
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,820
Bartos, I just told the doctor here
not to attend ...

1030
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,740
any meetings of your group
until farther notice.

1031
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,740
Dr. Pillar, use the stairs, please.

1032
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,210
I think this group will have to be
dissolved immediately.

1033
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:36,540
I know exactly what you're thinking.
That peculiar motion.

1034
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,760
- You know this man well?
- Certainly.

1035
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,340
He's been with us 2 years,
contribute a lot of money.

1036
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,430
How does he function in your group?

1037
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,010
He uses our beer wagons to
distribute our leaflets.

1038
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,770
He's the big brewer, Czaka, Emil Czaka.

1039
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:53,520
Remember 2 years ago when that group
in Pilsen, was betray to the Gestapo...

1040
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,860
- and 12 were executed?
- The Pilsen raid.

1041
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:59,530
Yes, I know.
Czaka was suspected...

1042
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:02,740
for a while. But it was determined that
the traitor spoke perfect German...

1043
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,070
and a very thorough investigation
proved Czaka...

1044
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,120
doesn't speak a bit of German.

1045
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:10,040
You think I put myself in danger?

1046
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,750
In all probability you talked yourself
into kingdom come.

1047
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,380
But you suggested it.

1048
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,460
I suggested you feel out the grounds,
test their morale.

1049
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,970
I didn't suggest you crawl out on a limb
and saw yourself off.

1050
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:29,390
- Take some cheese, it's good.
- No I have no more appetite.

1051
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,310
Maybe...

1052
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,350
maybe it would be safer if I left town?

1053
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,070
Sorry sir, once you work for the Gestapo...

1054
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,230
you work for the Gestapo.

1055
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,360
Then I insist you give me
a special body guard.

1056
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,410
I will not do anything without it.

1057
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,530
You'll do everything,
... and like it.

1058
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,250
Herr Gruber,
how can you treat me like this?

1059
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,910
I've done so much for you all these years,
and for Germany!

1060
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,830
And why did you do so much for us,
Czaka?

1061
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,960
Because as a real Czech patriot
I realize our entire future...

1062
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:05,090
depends on unconditional collaboration
with greater Germany.

1063
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,680
And I thought you did it
for business reasons.

1064
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,140
For certain favors...

1065
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,680
for certain valuable military contracts.

1066
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,560
May I?

1067
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:22,190
- Nice gold lighter.
- You like it?

1068
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,700
You wouldn't think of bribing me...

1069
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,200
with a gold lighter.

1070
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:31,330
Czaka, Czaka, Czaka...

1071
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,620
Suppose I pay you for police protection?

1072
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,920
Oh, just like life insurance?

1073
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:42,630
How much of a premium would you
be willing to pay?

1074
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,550
How much do you want?

1075
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,470
2,000 marks.

1076
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,340
2,000 marks per week?

1077
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,800
Per day.

1078
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,850
2,000 marks per day?

1079
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,930
Only a few days until we
round up your friends...

1080
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,440
then you just drop the insurance.

1081
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:02,570
Say 5 days,
10,000 marks.

1082
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,280
Suppose it lasts a month?

1083
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,070
So what? Another 50,000 marks.

1084
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:12,580
Why Czaka, you are a big beer magnet.

1085
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,620
Just another drop in the barrel.

1086
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:32,260
Make that check payable to the treasurer
of the Occupational Police Fund.

1087
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:42,270
That's it, Czaka.

1088
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,070
I am the treasurer.

1089
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,240
I know.

1090
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,240
[Telephone rings]

1091
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,520
- Yes?
- Your Father will be executed...

1092
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:09,860
at 6:00 this morning. You will be allowed
to see him before he is taken away.

1093
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:14,280
In a half an hour the police car will take
you to the camp. That's all.

1094
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,830
You have ten minutes,
no more.

1095
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,630
Monkey.

1096
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,890
Yesterday I was questioned about that
gentleman who visited us.

1097
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,020
Me too, but everything turned out all right.

1098
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:48,100
He came back to apologize...

1099
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,900
and offered me any help we might need.

1100
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,780
That's good.

1101
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,740
How is mother and Ludmilla?
and Beda, how is he?

1102
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,370
Mother tried to see you.

1103
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,040
I was permitted to write her a letter.

1104
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,960
I think the censor will let it through.

1105
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,830
It was only personal.

1106
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,550
I also started a letter to Beda...

1107
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,300
I was sure it would not pass.

1108
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,930
I'll tell it to you, Mascha,
and you repeat it to him.

1109
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:29,850
What I now want to say to you my son...

1110
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,610
is meant for you when you
are a grown man...

1111
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,820
the now mighty invaders...

1112
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:40,700
will now have been thrown off our land
for quite some time.

1113
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,780
"Quite some time."

1114
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,490
I hope you will be living in a free land...

1115
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,040
where the people are truly govern
by themselves and for themselves.

1116
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,500
Those will be great days to live.

1117
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,710
"Those will be great days to live."

1118
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,050
In a land where all the men, women, and
children will have enough food to eat.

1119
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,680
And time to read, and think...

1120
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:09,480
and to talk things over
for their own good.

1121
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:14,230
When such great days do come...

1122
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,950
don't forget that freedom is not
something one possesses...

1123
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,110
like a hat or piece of candy.

1124
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,330
The real thing is fighting for freedom.

1125
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,000
And you might remember me...

1126
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,670
not because I've been your Father...

1127
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,750
but because...

1128
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,920
I also died in this great fight.

1129
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,840
"Because I also died...

1130
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,050
in this great fight."

1131
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,050
[Truck approaching]

1132
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:05,050
[The sound of marching feet]

1133
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,410
Time is up, Novotny!

1134
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,970
<i>Attention.</i>

1135
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,970
[German]
<i>Let's go!</i>

1136
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,270
He still has his life in your hands.

1137
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,610
Who was the man you helped escape...

1138
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,950
when you sent our men the wrong way?

1139
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,570
I tell you I sat on that
investigating committee myself...

1140
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,860
and Czaka was entirely clear
of that raid in Pilsen.

1141
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,780
Because the traitor spoke German and Czaka doesn't...?

1142
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,990
Yes.

1143
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,580
Yet when he came to Prague and brought his brewery...

1144
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,210
he paid with a Deutsche check
from the Bank of Berlin...

1145
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:13,380
according to a little research of my own.

1146
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,000
Maybe Czaka does understand German.

1147
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,510
Listen, I've got an idea.

1148
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,840
It might work now after these 2 years.

1149
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,390
I don't know, but we can try.

1150
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,060
What?

1151
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:35,480
We can use Rudy
for this.

1152
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,070
Hello, Beda.

1153
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,610
Father was shot this morning.

1154
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,450
Shot?
But I...

1155
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,910
- Mascha!
- Jan, will you come with me please?

1156
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,540
I'm going to the camp to claim his body.

1157
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,290
But Mascha here is a list of all those
who were executed this morning.

1158
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,210
Your father's name is not among them.
See here, under the N's.

1159
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,680
Only 4, Navitol,
Napitol, Naavi and Nimocek.

1160
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,890
But I saw him on the truck this morning ...

1161
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,430
Yes, Miss Novotny?

1162
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,230
Oh, your Father.

1163
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,230
No, that list is correct.

1164
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,270
No. Just a little mistake.

1165
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,940
You were right, Jan.

1166
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,400
Mother! Mother!

1167
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:25,030
They play with human beings
like a cat with a mouse.

1168
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,830
I don't care.
I don't care!

1169
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,620
As long as he is alive.

1170
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,480
- Yes?
- Bartos just called me to met him for lunch.

1171
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,940
A sort of informal meeting.
What shall I do?

1172
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,950
Go!

1173
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,070
What?

1174
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,740
Listen, I'll arrest him when I see fit,
not before.

1175
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,500
What about these two that you still
only know by their first names?

1176
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,790
<i>But they will kill me!</i>

1177
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,630
Alright, you'll have your police guard.
Where do you want them, and when?

1178
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,920
Back room...

1179
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,010
Cafe Kramer.

1180
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,050
Mr. Emil.

1181
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,310
- Well, Emil.
- Emil!

1182
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:35,100
I want you to met my Uncle,
Mr. Dedic, just in from Kladno.

1183
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,770
- You're having lunch with us?
- Yes, I only have time for a quick bite...

1184
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,020
before I catch my train to Karlsbad.

1185
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,900
Passing through I thought I would
say hello to my nephew.

1186
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,400
Well, my pleasure, sir.

1187
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,700
Won't you be seated?

1188
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,620
Uncle.
Matushka.

1189
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,990
Emil.

1190
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
just between ourselves...

1191
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:06,510
I don't recommend the goulash,
but the paprica liver...

1192
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,930
simply prewar!

1193
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,350
And speaking of food,
or rather "No food"...

1194
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,140
I heard the most wonderful Hitler story
yesterday. You understand German?

1195
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

1196
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,730
You have to excuse me, I can only tell it in
German or I'll ruin the whole joke.

1197
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,240
Well, I know a little school book German.
That is if you want me to hear it!

1198
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,780
- Of course.
- Sure you'll translate for us, Matushka.

1199
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,540
Goebbels comes to Hitler...

1200
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:40,500
[German]
"Adolf, we have food for 5 years."

1201
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,790
"Five years? Really?" Said the Fuhrer.

1202
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,340
"Yes, five years," Goebbels said.
And the Fuhrer said...

1203
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,590
"I must tell Herman Goring"

1204
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,300
"No, by God,"
replies Goebbels.

1205
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,350
"Do not tell the Herman.
It's just the two of us, you and me."

1206
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,910
I happen to remember another Hitler joke.

1207
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,290
Hitler said to one of his elite guards...

1208
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,250
I forget how it goes.

1209
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,130
Yesterday you showed a very good memory...

1210
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,210
of the teachings of your Gestapo friends...

1211
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,650
when you tried to convince us to we turn
in the man who shot Heydrich.

1212
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,260
So, you don't understand German,
you slimy scum?

1213
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,760
No, I don't. I swear!

1214
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:49,780
Drag him back,
 keep him quiet.

1215
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,820
<i>Here, help me, police!</i>

1216
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,790
Get out! Through the window!

1217
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,210
Help, police!

1218
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:04,500
- Let's get out of the kitchen.
- Go ahead, we'll cover you!

1219
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,820
Halt! Put your hands up!

1220
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:39,870
Friends, I am Jan Pestuca,
editor of the "Prague Evening News"...

1221
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,750
<i>and I have been requested to
speak to each barracks.</i>

1222
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,330
<i>At 5 O'clock, we hostages...</i>

1223
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:50,380
<i>will be given the opportunity to
address all of Czechoslovakia...</i>

1224
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,510
<i>for a full hours broadcast</i>

1225
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,720
<i>Each barracks will be represented
by 2 or 3 volunteers...</i>

1226
01:25:56,930 --> 01:26:01,520
Will speak of the necessary of the
immediate surrender of the assassin.

1227
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,900
Volunteer speakers must be
ready at 4:30 sharp.

1228
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,900
Attention!

1229
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:20,660
It's clear as daylight...

1230
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:24,160
they're trying to use us as a cats paw
to get the assassin for them.

1231
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,540
I say, let the Czech people decide.

1232
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,130
Our lives,
or the assassins.

1233
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,760
I hope there will be no such
volunteering in here.

1234
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,590
What else is there to do?

1235
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,890
It's not only a question of saving
the 300 of us still alive.

1236
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,180
But after we're shot, what then?...

1237
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:42,600
there will be another 300, then 3,000.

1238
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,930
There will be no end until
they get the assassin.

1239
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,650
There will be no end anyway,
and they never needed a beginning.

1240
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:50,190
They slaughtered thousands
long before Heydrich.

1241
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,690
Just for breathing Czech air.

1242
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,570
Has it ever occurred to you professor
that the assassin is letting us pay for his act...

1243
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,700
While he goes scot free?
He, and his underground pals.

1244
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,900
I don't intent to wast my
time with you here.

1245
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:17,440
What we want is the identity
of this man, Dedic.

1246
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,650
Aldrich Krapke, the engineer?

1247
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,700
- Yes.
- As an educated man...

1248
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:28,870
you are intelligent enough to see the
unpleasant experiences ahead of you.

1249
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,870
You understand, Aldrich...

1250
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,960
when Herr Gruber
says "unpleasant"...

1251
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,790
he's merely being polite.

1252
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,800
What's he doing here?

1253
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,630
He belongs here, Gestapo informer.

1254
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,130
I don't get it.

1255
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,050
You'll get it soon enough...

1256
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,300
right through your head just
before we knock it off.

1257
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,020
Why, you stinking fat crawling scum, you!

1258
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,890
You shut your mouth you
filthy Bolshevik traitor!

1259
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,980
- Sabotador...
- Chega!

1260
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,900
You don't have to prove to us
you're not one of them.

1261
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,740
Katerina Honiga,
private secretary.

1262
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:08,240
You sabotaged your factory very cleverly.

1263
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,660
Perhaps you are...

1264
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,660
clever enough not to want to
visit our vault downstairs?

1265
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,420
Perhaps you prefer to talk to me...

1266
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,630
in private.

1267
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,340
No, I can tell you right here
what I think of you.

1268
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:24,010
- You pig.
Yes, you better not see her alone...

1269
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:27,800
you stool pigeon, or she'll scratch your
eyes out, you fascist blood hound.

1270
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:32,850
Big talk. Ten minutes below and
you'll beg them to kill you.

1271
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,650
Your mothers use to lay with rats!

1272
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,440
their milk was sewage.

1273
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,190
Take them to the vaults.
All of them!

1274
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,030
Tell them I want to know
about this Dedic.

1275
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,740
- Down there!
- Take them!

1276
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,750
Are these all the volunteer
speakers you have?

1277
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,790
Commandant, barracks 2 and 3 failed to
produce anyone who volunteered.

1278
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,630
Herr Commandant, in our barrack #5,
they also tired to prevent us...

1279
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,180
Quiet. Be ready to began your
speeches in 2 minutes

1280
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:10,260
Yes sir, I just have another idea
to jot down for my speech.

1281
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,350
That is not necessary.
Here are your speeches.

1282
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,270
<i>We must climb the path to loyal collaboration...</i>

1283
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,110
<i>and our very first step must be
to surrender the assassin.</i>

1284
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,110
Just plain common sense.

1285
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,240
I was always against using force.

1286
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,950
<i>Not one of us would fail to die
for the true welfare of our nation.</i>

1287
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,740
But people of Prague,
I ask you...

1288
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:38,920
shall we perish for the vicious act
of a murdering manic?

1289
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,960
Stop that immediately!

1290
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,630
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not gonna be shot!.

1291
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,340
- Everyone sit down!
- Be quiet!

1292
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,520
The Germans have succeeded, in part
shattering the unity of the city.

1293
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,190
Many people are now using
the word "assassin"...

1294
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,190
whereas before they only spoke
of him as the "executor".

1295
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:02,110
If I may suggest, perhaps you should all
know what Dedic wants you to do.

1296
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,160
He's at my apartment now.

1297
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:07,200
His condition is serious.
Shot through the lung

1298
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,700
But why did he go,
of all places, to you?

1299
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:13,580
- It was a terrible risk to expose you.
- He took every possible precaution.

1300
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:17,380
He changed taxi's a number of times.
Went through buildings and back yards...

1301
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:19,300
until he was dead certain no one had followed him.

1302
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,920
He could have come here just as well.

1303
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:24,010
And we would have called in another
doctor without involving you.

1304
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:27,050
He did not just come to me
just for me to treat his wound.

1305
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:30,270
- What else?
- To give me in detail my instructions.

1306
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,100
- Instructions?
- Where do you come into this?

1307
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:36,190
As Dedic sees it, we are faced
with two vital problems...

1308
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,360
each depended upon the other.

1309
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:41,940
If we could find a way of saving
the remaining hostages...

1310
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,990
or as many as possible...

1311
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,030
we would at the same time restore
the unity of the city.

1312
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,580
it would be a tremendous victory...

1313
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,170
But in the end, it's either the hostages
or you. We can't save both.

1314
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:59,880
I don't see any possible chance of us
getting these 2 birds with one stone.

1315
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:02,970
As Dedic sees it,
there is a chance.

1316
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,930
What about those bloodstains
in your cab?

1317
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,140
I never would have put 2 and 2 together...

1318
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:11,520
the car washer here calls me tonight...

1319
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,020
and tells me he found blood drops
on the backseat of my cab.

1320
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:17,940
- Just then I was home eating my soup...
- I'm not interested in your soup.

1321
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:21,070
What makes you think I'm
interested in a cab...

1322
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,650
where some passenger maybe
had a nose bleed?

1323
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,660
Herr Gruber, he recognized the description
of Dedic from tonight's newspapers...

1324
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,490
as one of his passengers.

1325
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:33,370
- Where did you drop this passenger?
- Well... that's the trouble...

1326
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,410
I don't remember.

1327
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:40,040
Maybe he was the one I took
to Czerny St, but, maybe not.

1328
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,340
[German]
This is crap!

1329
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:44,340
We have a list of his runs today.

1330
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,800
We could send someone to
everyone of these places.

1331
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:51,600
Listen, you tell me at 11:30 at night...

1332
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,310
that this man went to one of 15
different houses this afternoon...

1333
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,400
And you really think this Dedic, if it was he...

1334
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,310
will kindly wait for us...

1335
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,280
until we come to call on him
to pay our respects?

1336
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,320
Get them out of here!
Go home and finish your soup.

1337
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,620
Querida?

1338
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:21,130
Arnold...

1339
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,170
Come here.

1340
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:30,760
Hey! 
Hey, you with the soup!

1341
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,020
What was that address you think
you dropped him at?

1342
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,810
<i>Czerny St,
61 Czerny St.</i>

1343
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:39,100
Czerny St. Czerny St.

1344
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,730
Czerny St, 61.

1345
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:45,860
Czerny St.
Czerny St.

1346
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,650
Czerny St!

1347
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,070
Czerny St.

1348
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,830
Czerny St.

1349
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,500
"Czerny St, 21."

1350
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:09,090
From 21 to 61,
is 20 houses.

1351
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:12,760
- Dr. Svoboda?
- Yes.

1352
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,890
Gestapo.

1353
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,350
- You live here alone?
- Yes.

1354
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:23,270
You didn't per chance receive a visit
from a man with a bullet wound?

1355
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,570
No.

1356
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:38,830
- You can't go in there!
- Stop this non-sense!

1357
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,250
Men!

1358
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,670
Open!

1359
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,670
[A woman screams]

1360
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:59,600
Well, the situation here would tend
to exclude the presences...

1361
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:02,520
of any third person.

1362
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:15,700
Sorry...

1363
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:20,290
but you see, we are looking for
the uncle of a certain Mr. Bartos...

1364
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:23,370
Who asked me to deliver his last farewell.

1365
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,580
In person.

1366
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,650
Muller, check the whole building
from cellar to roof.

1367
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:48,940
Every room and closet.

1368
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,690
Yes, sir.
Attention.

1369
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:56,070
Come in doctor, come in. No, no, no,
Miss Novotny, please remain as you are.

1370
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,910
I'm only staying a little while.

1371
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,500
Catch my breath, and smoke a cigarette.
If I may, doctor?

1372
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,500
[Inaudible dialog]

1373
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,180
Well, well, my young friend...

1374
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:17,760
I don't mind admitting I'm surprised.

1375
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:21,140
You see doctor, personally,
I have never been fully convinced...

1376
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:23,930
Of your marvelous quick success of Miss Novotny.

1377
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,850
And you, Miss Novotny,
you surprise me even more.

1378
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,020
After all, you're engaged to be
married in a few weeks...

1379
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,030
but I suppose that in wartime
life moves a lot faster.

1380
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,780
Inspector, there is a limit to these insults.

1381
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:39,580
Of course, doctor,
my humble apologies mademoiselle.

1382
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:43,540
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- Just a few more puffs.

1383
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,460
You see...

1384
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:48,290
I had no idea I would find you here...

1385
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,170
at least not tonight.

1386
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:55,680
In my stupid way, I thought I would
find a certain gentleman...

1387
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,970
who in turn, would help me find
that other gentleman.

1388
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:03,100
You remember,
whom you helped Kladno Av..

1389
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:05,810
That's all very interesting,
Inspector...

1390
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:09,190
But if you insist on keeping us company...

1391
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,020
Perhaps you would like a glass of wine
to go with your cigarette.

1392
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:15,700
Well, well, doctor,
I would be delighted.

1393
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,860
You have no beer?

1394
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:20,950
Of course you have no "beer".

1395
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,450
Beer wouldn't be the thing in such
a romantic atmosphere.

1396
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:34,800
Sorry, Inspector,
the rug.

1397
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:38,430
But better be careful when you
stumble near me again, doctor...

1398
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:43,100
my boys here got just a little nervous just then.

1399
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,860
[German]
We have fulfill your orders.

1400
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,260
Horak, I thought you might
be curious to met...

1401
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:28,640
Dr. Franticek Svoboda,
surgeon at St. Pancrazio hospital.

1402
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:35,650
The same gentleman who visited your fiance the other night...

1403
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,490
under the name "Karel Vanek".

1404
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:43,160
Inspector,
why did you have me brought here?

1405
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,790
Horak, I thought we both had the
right to the whole truth.

1406
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,000
You ought to know what
your fiance is up too.

1407
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:55,710
Well, I guess this all becomes a
personal matter between you three.

1408
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,470
[German] Let's go.
I think I'll leave you alone.

1409
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,890
Good night.

1410
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,680
Jan, you mustn't...

1411
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:11,560
Well, what are you staring at?
You think you own me?

1412
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,400
You were lying to me all along.

1413
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,480
Yes I was. I just fell in love with him ...

1414
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,780
<i>That's all there was to it.
Can't you understand that?</i>

1415
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,610
<i>Yes.</i>

1416
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,370
<i>I'm sorry Franticek, for all that's happened...</i>

1417
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,530
Horak!

1418
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:33,000
It looks like both of us
had delusions tonight.

1419
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,510
- Find something, Mueller?
- Not at all, Herr Inspector.

1420
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,430
- Am I free to leave now?
- Not yet.

1421
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,800
What do you say to having a drink on me?
That is an order. Muller!

1422
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:48,850
I want you to watch this house, closely.

1423
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,020
If those two try to leave,
find out where they go.

1424
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:54,900
- As you order, Herr Inspector.
- Schirmer will re leave you in the morning.

1425
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,120
The small leather case on the desk.
The hypodermic.

1426
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,100
Come on sweetheart, get it off your chest.

1427
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:30,730
Take it from me. No woman
should be trusted to long.

1428
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,190
Ain't it the truth?

1429
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:37,860
Don't be a sucker, big boy.
There are more fish to come.

1430
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:42,490
Well, 6:00 already. What do you say
we go over to his place? .

1431
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,790
That is an order too.

1432
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,500
You shouldn't talk.
This wound is serious.

1433
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:50,420
I haven't much time.
I must finish telling you.

1434
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,170
Miss Novotny, all our thanks...

1435
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,510
you're a good fighter.

1436
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:03,310
Almost everything in this plan
depends on you.

1437
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,810
It will be very difficult...

1438
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:12,230
I believe the people of Prague...

1439
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,320
will come to help us.

1440
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,470
- Gruber come in yet?
- No.

1441
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:42,470
No, and his office can't seem to get in
touch with him. He was out all last night.

1442
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,360
That must be the little cutie who
let him down so hard.

1443
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,900
The German offered 20 marks if we could
get info about her cheating before.

1444
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,200
It was like pulling teeth.

1445
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,700
Couldn't even get him to talk about her.

1446
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,450
Why does this flatfoot have to know
so much about this dames life?

1447
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:11,540
All he told me was he caught
her cheating last night.

1448
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:15,380
Myself, I figured it must had something to do with...

1449

politics.

1451
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:22,680
Because Gruber says, how could a
nice girl like that run around like that...

1452
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:26,350
her father is one of the hostages
going to be killed any minute.

1453
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,350
Come on, fatty,
wake up.

1454
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,480
Let me sleep...

1455
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,690
you'll get your money tonight.

1456
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,020
I'll be waiting.

1457
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:43,700
So long, big boy.
Just pretend you never knew her.

1458
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,910
Too-da-lu!

[Clock chimes begin ringing all over town]

1460
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,490
Is it possible now,
to tell his real name?

1461
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,120
No, but his name will not be forgotten.

1462
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:57,500
One day the school children will honor it.

1463

"In retaliation for the cowardly
murder of the Reich Protector...

it is ordered that commencing at 2:00 today...

every 2 hrs instead of 24...

unless the assassin is surrendered."

1467
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,060
Pardon me.

01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:25,360

- This is absurd.
- But I tell you I'm sure.

1471
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:09,040
- You've mistaken me for somebody else.
- No, I'm sure of it.

1472

Miss please,
everyone is looking at us.

1473
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,260
- I tell you, you're absolutely wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1474
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:15,090
Please, miss, please.

1475
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,510
You must met me,
I have to talk to you alone.

1476
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,560
Miss, what do you want
with this gentleman?

1477
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,890
It is nothing,
absolutely nothing.

1478
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:26,600
What do you mean by that?
Such impertinence.

1479
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,820
Gestapo. Inspector Schirmer.

1480
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:33,190
Of course.
Naturally that's different then.

1481
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,530
I don't know this person.
I've never seen her before.

1482

Miss Novotny, we will clear up
this matter somewhere else.

1483
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:45,080
I think you better take this gentleman
along to headquarters.

1484
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:48,750
But this is absurd. I will report you
to the proper authorities

1485
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,840
Alright, alright.

1486
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,050

I will see that you are
properly cared for also.

Miss Novotny,
this time you're going to talk.

01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,170
You recognize Mr. Czaka as whom?

1496
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,380
What did you want to say to him
alone that was so important, huh?

1497
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:40,510
Let me tell you, Herr Ritter,
it's very simple.

She says she recognizes me as someone she helped escaped...

from Karls Ave. From the Black shirts

1500
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:52,690
The lady insists that I am the man
who shot Heydrich.

1501

Me, of all people!

1502
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,870
That is perfectly ridiculous
of course, Mr. Czaka...

1503
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,910

forward march!

1518

Miss Novotny, perhaps you are afraid
because you lied to us before...

1519
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:19,620
But if you tell the truth now,
I promise to overlook that.

Remember, we won't stop the executions
until we have the assassin.

01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,740
You saw the assassin run from the alley?

1528
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:57,200
Yes, it was the man I saw in the restaurant.

1529
01:48:57,410 --> 01:48:59,580
- The brewer, Czaka?
- Yes.

1530
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:02,370
In what direction did he escape from?

1531
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:05,920
Just around the corner from Dresden St,
just where I told the officer.

1532
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:08,630
Did you see him running until
he was out of sight?

1533
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,970
No, there was a passing cab,
and it drove off with him.

1534
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:17,260
For your sake, Miss Novotny,
I'm glad you added that detail.

1535
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:22,640
It confirms with a voluntary statement
from the same cab driver.

1536
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:25,810
Ritter, bring in Czaka.

1537
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,150
And the horse cab driver.

1538
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:31,360
That's him, alright.

1539
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,580
I've never seen this man before.

1540
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,120
You picked him up on the corner of Karls Ave and Dresden?

1541
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:42,160
Yes, sir. And he said:
"Drive as fast as you can."

1542
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:44,880
Where did he ask to be taken?

1543
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,840
Some place with furnished rooms,
with no questions asked.

1544
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:50,380
Like I told you this morning.

1545
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:55,180
It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous!

1546
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:58,140
The man has got me mixed up
with somebody else.

1547
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,310
Herr Standarten Fuhrer...

1548
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:05,850
during the time of the assassination
of his Excellency...

1549
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,320
the late Reich Protector...

1550
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:11,240
at that very time, I was having
lunch at the Golden Quail...

1551
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,070
Where I always eat,
just like today.

1552
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,780
You can check it quite easily.

1553
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:18,910
Do you remember day when
the Reich Protector was shot?

1554
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,410
Naturally, what Czech doesn't?

1555
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:24,330
- It was last Wednesday at noon.
- Exactly.

1556
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:28,250
And on that day, at that time, did
Mr. Czaka have lunch at your restaurant?

1557
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,380
- Now you'll see...
- No, your excellency.

1558
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:32,510
No, Mr. Czaka didn't come in that day.

1559
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
I remember it like my own birthday.

1560
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:37,760
I held his usual table for him,
your excellency.

1561
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:42,390
I even said to Albert here,
maybe Mr. Czaka is sick or something.

1562
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,060
- But Novak, I was there.
- No, Mr. Czaka.

1563
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,320
No, Mr. Czaka, I remember because I put
on your table your favorite Rhine wine...

1564
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,440
the old Riesling. But I had to take it off
when you didn't show up.

1565
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:55,700
No.
You're all mixed up.

1566
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,990
You, how can you make such a mistake?

1567
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,870
Please try to remember.

1568
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,370
I was there.

1569
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:10,090
Freddy, you brought me
a pack of cigarettes.

1570
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:12,760
I dropped them on the floor,
remember?

1571
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,800
No, Mr. Czaka, that was the day
before the shooting.

1572
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:22,350
Pauline, didn't you check my hat that day,
as always?

1573
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,390
Didn't I even pinch your cheek,
and you said: "No, Mr. Czaka"?

1574
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,270
Didn't I tip you nicely,
as always?

1575
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,190
You always do, Mr. Czaka,
but not that day.

1576
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,360
- You didn't come that day.
- You're crazy!

1577
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:36,150
You, all of you, crazy!

1578
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,320
What's going on here anyway?

1579
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:43,200
What is the meaning of all of this?
I demand an explanation!

1580
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:46,000
Stop shouting at me,
Mr. Czaka.

1581
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:48,710
We demand an explanation.

1582
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:51,880
Where were you at the time
of the assassination?

1583
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,670
I told you.

1584
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:59,180
I told you, in the Golden Quail, eating.
And after lunch I had a business...

1585
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:01,260
conference with Mr. Tomas Pulta,
the bearing manufacturer.

1586
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:04,600
Yes, in his own apartment until 5:30.

1587
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:07,270
How do you remember that time so well?

1588
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,690
Because at 6:00 I had another appointment right here...

1589
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,980
in the Gestapo,
with Inspector Gruber.

1590
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:17,190
I was with him until way after midnight helping him prepare the list...

1591
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:21,740
[Whispers]
the list of the hostages.

1592
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,370
Brodavka.

1593
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:29,370
Vystyd.

1594
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,790
Pescacek.

1595
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,220
Walk out!

1596
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,510
- Good bye, Pescacek.
- Good bye.

1597
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:45,970
Come on, come on.

1598
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:48,680
Sing "The Invisible Torch"!

1599
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:52,730
<i>...and pass it along...</i>

1600
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:56,820
<i>Keep it burning,
Keep it burning,</i>

1601
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:01,240
<i>keep it forward on
the road that has no turning.</i>

1602
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:04,950
<i>Die if you must,
for a cause that is just...</i>

1603
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,950
<i>but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.</i>

1604
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,710
Stop the singing!

1605
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,040
<i>- Ever onward, never returning
- Silence!</i>

1606
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:16,840
- the filthy butcher will be learning.
-Stop the singing!

1607
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:20,760
<i>this war isn't won until
the last battle is done.</i>

1608
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:24,930
<i>Carry on,when we are gone.
No surrender!"</i>

1609
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,970
<i>No surrender!</i>

1610
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:31,890
I must regret to inform you,
the bearing manufacturer, Mr. Pulta...

1611
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:35,690
was one of the hostages executed
at 2:00 this afternoon.

1612
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:38,730
Pulta?
Shot?

1613
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:42,490
How does he get on the list?
I had business with him.

1614
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,700
I didn't suggest his name.

1615
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:47,620
I suppose I ought to apologize
for neglecting to notify you?

1616
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,210
In any case, his widow Mrs. Pulta,
testifies you never appeared that day.

1617
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,750
- What?
- But, here is another lady...

1618
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,550
- who can tell us the exact reason.
- I don't know this woman.

1619
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,010
Mrs. Nimitz, last night you testified that
on the day of the assassination...

1620
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:06,010
the cab brought a certain well dressed
man to your rooming house.

1621
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:07,720
Yes, this man here.

1622
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:11,890
Will you repeat your testimony please?
Just as you gave it last night?

1623
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,520
He came exactly at half pass twelve noon.

1624
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:17,820
I showed him a room for 3 marks.

1625
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:20,900
He told me he was expecting a
lady friend, if I wouldn't mind.

1626
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:24,030
I said: "Well, if you guarantee
she's decent, who cares".

1627
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,910
- So then, he gave me 5 marks.
- Lies! All lies!

1628
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,950
How can you listen to
these traitorous Czechs?

1629
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,660
How can you take their word
against mine! I protest!

1630
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:35,870
You know I'm loyal. For years I've kept
you informed of the underground.

1631
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,550
Only yesterday you got seven through
me! Seven! Only yesterday!

1632
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,800
How can you be so unfair?

1633
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:46,390
Will you kindly permit the
witness to continue?

1634
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:50,060
Uninterrupted.

1635
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,690
Will you go on, Mrs. Nimitz,
please.

1636
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,860
Well, no lady showed up
all afternoon long.

1637
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,780
Just heard him walking up
and down the room.

1638
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:07,530
And after a while he comes out and says
he wants to telephone somebody ...

1639
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:10,120
but I said: "I wouldn't even have a phone
if I could afford one ...

1640
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:12,580
because it is more trouble than it's worth."

1641
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:17,290
Then about half past five, he comes out
wants to see the afternoon papers...

1642
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,750
all about the shooting of the "Hangman"...

1643
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,090
Reich Protector Heydrich.

1644
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,510
Then he just put on his hat and went.

1645
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:28,510
But this morning, after I was
questioned and went home...

1646
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:32,810
I remember something I found
after this gentleman left his room.

1647
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,270
Here, I brought it with me,
even though it's real gold.

1648
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,940
E. C.

1649
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,530
It has your initials,
Mr. Czaka.

1650
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:52,660
I don't understand.

1651
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,700
I had it,
this morning.

1652
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:56,750
I'm sure.

1653
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,420
I must have left in the restaurant.

1654
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:03,170
This is a frame up.
A fantastic frame up!

1655
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,050
Don't be preposterous.

1656
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,970
Are you trying to say the whole city
of Prague is conspiring against you?

1657
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:11,510
None of these people
know each other at all.

1658
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:29,030
A minute ago, you said you had
no telephone at all. Didn't you?

1659
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,030
Yes.

1660
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,870
Alright!

1661
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:38,250
Now I'll prove that everything
you said was a filthy dirty lie...

1662
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:41,790
And this whole thing nothing
but a criminal conspiracy.

1663
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,550
She said I was in her rooming house
between 12:30 and 5:30.

1664
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,760
Very well.

1665
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,930
She also says
she hasn't got a telephone.

1666
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:55,260
Then how was it at 2:30 I was talking
to somebody on the telephone?

1667
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:58,350
And who was that somebody?

1668
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:04,230
Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

1669
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,030
I demand that Inspector Gruber be
brought in immediately to confirm this.

1670
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,320
I also demand the
arrest and investigation...

1671
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:14,160
everyone of these slimy perjurers.

1672
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,410
Call Inspector Gruber.

1673
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,000
We have been unable to contact
Inspector Gruber all day.

1674
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,460
His office is still trying to locate him.

1675
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,640
Just for a pick me up.

1676
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,410
No more beer around?

1677
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:02,710
No more beer.

1678
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,710
What's so funny all of a sudden?

1679
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,420
- I like that lipstick.
- What lipstick?

1680
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,720
All over your face.

1681
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:25,020
I see!

1682
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:26,860
Yeah...

1683
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:30,280
that lipstick on the doctors face was perfect...

1684
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,360
not all smeared up.

1685
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:37,830
You're right, Jan, old boy,
you girl is still all yours.

1686
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:40,950
They staged it.
But a little to perfectly.

1687
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,410
Thanks for the assassin.

1688
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:45,620
What do you mean?

1689
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:51,000
If they staged that bedroom act, then the
uncle must have really been there...

1690
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:57,340
and your little girl put one over
on old man Gruber.

1691
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,050
And why?

1692
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:03,310
Because one or the other
must be the assassin...

1693
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,810
Dr. Svoboda or Uncle Dedic.

1694
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:12,360
And your sweetheart is an accomplice to the same assassins.

1695
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:16,240
But this time she is going to talk,
and talk fast.

1696
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:57,650
It's broken.

1697
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:01,080
Miss Novotny,
your assassin Mr. Czaka...

1698
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,160
seems to have a perfect alibi...

1699
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:05,160
No less than Gestapo Inspector Gruber.

1700
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:09,420
Yes, Miss Novotny,
Inspector Gruber.

1701
02:00:09,630 --> 02:00:11,880
You just wait till he gets here.

1702
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:14,510
But what about all the hostages
in the meantime?

1703
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:19,470
The executions will cease the minute
the case is finished. Not before.

1704
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:23,390
But, if Gruber confirms Czaka's alibi...

1705
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,060
everyone of the witnesses today...

1706
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:29,980
with you first, will go to the
wall with the hostages.

1707
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,530
Well, we will now go look into
this alibi of Dr. Svoboda.

1708
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:39,490
It's really worth looking into you know.

1709
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:42,700
Then we'll take care of you and
your faithful sweetie.

1710
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:46,250
Now if you will excuse me, Mr. Horak,
I will have to hurry.

1711
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:51,580
Just relax.

1712
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,470
Can you tell me where to find
Dr. Svoboda?

1713
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:03,760
He is in operating, assisting Professor Kubicek.

1714
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,560
Thanks.

1715
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:12,560
[Door bell buzzes]

1716
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:23,970
Close the door, Beda.

1717
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:28,510
Plenty lucky for you mother was
worried about Mascha...

1718
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,390
and sent me to ask you.

1719
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:33,190
<i>Attention!
Gestapo Inspector Gruber!</i>

1720
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:34,600
<i>- Wait!
- Attention! Attention!</i>

1721
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:37,190
<i>Gestapo Inspector Gruber!</i>

1722
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,110
<i>Inspector Gruber,
report to headquarters at once!</i>

1723
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:47,530
Beda, go over there and wait.

1724
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:50,540
See if the Gestapo goes poking around.
If she shows up, stop her.

1725
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:52,870
I won't future brother-in-law.

1726
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,840
St. Pancrazio Hospital,
and step on it!

1727
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,560
Dr. Svoboda?

1728
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:22,650
That's Dr. Svoboda.

1729
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,570
- Detective Gruber, you looking for me?
- Yes.

1730
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:30,950
Just a few questions, doctor.

1731
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,000
Where can we talk undisturbed?

1732
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,250
Here, in the locker room.

1733
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,010
Talk me doctor,
when you fellows operate...

1734
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,010
you always wear these masks?

1735
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:48,300
Naturally, against infection.

1736
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:56,600
I thought you said
we could talk here all alone?

1737
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:00,560
It's all the same.
My colleague, Dr. Pillar.

1738
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,900
Inspector Alois Gruber,
Gestapo.

1739
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:14,750
You were the other one at the operation
the day he shot Heydrich.

1740
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:18,170
Exactly, Inspector, o
Dr. Pillar as you say...

1741
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:22,170
did take my place that day,
with the mask.

1742
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:25,960
Very clever.

1743
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,180
- May I use your telephone, Dr. Svoboda?
- No.

1744
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:34,810
No, you better not use that phone.

1745
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:37,600
You better put that down, doctor.

1746
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,060
I'm gonna put it where it belongs.

1747
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:48,280
If you think you're gonna rush me from both sides...

1748
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:51,910
that I can only get to one of you in time...

1749
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:55,580
Then you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised.

1750
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:59,000
I can shoot this gun a lot quicker...

1751
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:01,790
then both of you can jump.

1752
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,060
Not bad, doctor.

1753
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:24,820
That was close.

1754
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:26,730
But stand right where you are...

1755
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,450
or you get a slug in the gut.

1756
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:11,630
I was at the doctor when I heard
the radio call for Inspector Gruber...

1757
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:13,250
of course I came immediately.

1758
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,710
You say you were with him
this morning, Mr. Horak?

1759
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:20,590
Yes, you see the Inspector and I...

1760
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,350
went to a cabaret last night.
Well, he stayed all night at my apartment

1761
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,140
When did he leave you?

1762
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:29,230
I should say about
10 o'clock this morning.

1763
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:32,690
- Did he happen to say where he was going?
- Yes, I believe he did.

1764
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,860
I think he mentioned he had an
appointment with a Mr. Czaka at his house.

1765
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:37,860
Where?

1766
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,150
Czaka's house.

1767
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,450
Ritter, bring Herr Czaka around.

1768
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,660
Thank you, Mr. Horak.

1769
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:48,700
I'm sorry, but I have to hold you
like the other witnesses...

1770
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:51,540
until all of this is settled.

1771
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:10,730
Go to Czaka's house and see if
Gruber was there this morning.

1772
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:24,870
Mr. Czaka, when did you
last see Inspector Gruber?

1773
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:29,250
Yesterday afternoon.
Here at the Gestapo.

1774
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:32,710
And where were you this morning
from 10 o'clock on?

1775
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,790
At home, until noon.

1776
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,670
And then two of Gruber's men came
to escort me to the Golden Quail.

1777
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,720
Gruber wasn't with you before then?

1778
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:46,550
No, I told you I haven't seen him at all today.

1779
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,560
Excuse me.

1780
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:53,520
Yes?

1781
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,450
Czaka...

1782
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:06,530
between 10 and 12 this morning...

1783
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:09,120
Inspector Gruber
was with you...

1784
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:11,660
at your home.

1785
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:16,170
No, Herr Haas.

1786
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,800
- Who said that?
- Your butler.

1787
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:26,300
Why, Herr Haas,
that's impossible.

1788
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:27,970
The man can't be insane.

1789
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:32,180
I demand to see him.
Face to face!

1790
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:37,230
This morning, when Inspector Gruber
arrived, I showed him into the study...

1791
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,690
then Mr. Czaka sent me down to the
railway station for a timetable.

1792
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:43,900
Josef, where do you get these hallucinations,
haven't I always paid you well?

1793
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:47,620
- Why do you tell such lies?
- Will you kindly keep quiet Mr. Czaka?

1794
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:51,620
- Go on please.
- When I had returned, the Inspector had gone.

1795
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:55,710
- Where is the study?
- Right in there, but it's locked.

1796
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,500
After Mr. Czaka left, the maid wanted
to go in to clean...

1797
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:01,420
we couldn't find the key anywhere.

1798
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:03,760
Break the lock.

1799
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,470
Can't do that, it's an genuine antique.

1800
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,990
That's Gruber's calling card.

1801
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,490
Someone put them there!

1802
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:35,410
[German]
Get the caretaker of the building!

1803
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,460
Timetable.

1804
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,420
Timetable?

1805
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:42,960
Switzerland.

1806
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:45,420
You said your housekeeper had
hallucinations, Mr. Czaka?

1807
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:47,510
Your Excellency, I assure you I...

1808
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:49,840
My desk!

1809
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:51,640
I protest!

1810
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,720
Checkbook.

1811
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,890
Czaka, this check for 10,000 marks...

1812
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,060
Whom did you give it to?

1813
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:02,820
To the Occupational Police fund.

1814
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:07,990
I'm not interested for what purpose you
gave the money, but to whom you gave it.

1815
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,950
To Inspector Gruber.

1816
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:14,080
[German]
Damned pig!

1817
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:21,290
Yours, Mr. Czaka?

1818
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,590
No,I never had a gun.

1819
02:10:23,790 --> 02:10:26,170
Herr Haas, this pistol was
made in England.

1820
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:29,550
The exact same caliber of the bullet
that killed the Reich Protector.

1821
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,760
Impossible, Herr Haas!

1822
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:33,800
All of this is false,
completely false.

1823
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:36,720
If you only got Herr Gruber here, all
these accusations would be proven false.

1824
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:38,180
The whole thing is a frame up,
an awful frame up!

1825
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:41,480
Herr Fuhrer Standarten,
there is a mimeograph in closet.

1826
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:54,490
I'm innocence. I swear I am!

1827
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:57,620
The underground planted all of this to
pin the assassination on me!

1828
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:59,500
Where is Haas?

1829
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:01,750
Herr Standarten Fuhrer!

1830
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,050
Schirmer! downstairs!

1831
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:31,360
Miss Novotny,
you are free to go.

1832
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:33,320
Czaka was the assassin.

1833
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:36,580
We even found the gun in which
he shot Heydrich.

1834
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:39,620
The remaining hostages will be
released in the morning.

1835
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:43,210
Have you anyway of telling whether my father...?

1836
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:44,500
No.

1837
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:48,050
This scum must have been working
for both sides all this time.

1838
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,840
It looks like Gruber caught on to him
but couldn't be bribed.

1839
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,300
Not Gruber.

1840
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:55,010
So, Czaka had to get rid of him.

1841
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,020
Pull around the corner.

1842
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:11,940
Czaka, get out of here.

1843
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:22,830
You're free, Czaka.

1844
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:24,790
Free?

1845
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:28,040
- Free!
- Sure. Go on.

1846
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:30,750
Schirmer, I'll never forget you for this,
never forget you!

1847
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,220
Go on! Run!

1848

[Machine gun firing]

1849
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:17,900
Heil, Hitler!

1850
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:22,660
Excellency, this is the report
in code from Berlin.

1851
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:01,660
