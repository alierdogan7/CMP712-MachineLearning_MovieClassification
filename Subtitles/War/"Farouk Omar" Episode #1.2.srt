1
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,559
- Good morning, Abu Bakr. - Good morning.

2
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,759
Will you not come with us to Dar Al-Nadwah?

3
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,240
- We have missed you. - It is all right

4
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,599
but I am busy now. You don't need me.

5
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
What is the matter with Abu Bakr?

6
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,120
He has not been showing up in our gatherings,

7
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,919
as if he is preoccupied with something serious that he is keeping to himself.

8
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,800
He had always been very sociable.

9
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,319
Ah! Umar!

10
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,760
How are you today, Umar?

11
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,719
I am well, as long as my maternal uncles are well.

12
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,760
Then come with us, or are you also busy?

13
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,319
Also?! Nothing keeps me away from my people's affairs.

14
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,879
When they will something, it is my will too.

15
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,640
- Come on - Come

16
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,000
Abu Bakr!

17
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,359
Where are you going, Uthman?

18
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,039
To the meeting place.

19
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,719
Anything new that needs to be sorted out?

20
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
No, it is the usual type of discussion.

21
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,799
Had it been anything different, you would have been the first to know.

22
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,439
You seem to be worried about something.

23
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,239
If you care to tell me about it,

24
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
I will try to give you whatever help I can.

25
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,079
What I have is something that I hope will benefit you.

26
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,759
I would not have kept it to myself without sharing it with those I love.

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
You are my best friend.

28
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,000
And so you are to me. But...

29
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Leave the gathering today and come with me.

30
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,439
What do you think of your brother?

31
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,719
Who? You?

32
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,480
Have I ever told you a lie?

33
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,040
No, indeed. You are most truthful and kindly.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,840
And the one who is more truthful is Muhammad Ibn Abdullah.

35
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,759
He is certainly as you describe: honest and truthful.

36
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,039
But what about him? Will you not speak out?

37
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,280
I will, provided you promise me that you will tell no one,

38
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,560
whether you like what I tell you or not.

39
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,119
You have certainly got me worried. I promise you,

40
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
but what you ask me to conceal must be very serious.

41
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes, it is indeed.

42
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,480
The Arabs never heard of anything similar before now.

43
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,680
Yet it sets them on the right course in this life and the next.

44
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,720
The next! What is the next?

45
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,840
How did you leave your cousin? I mean Muhammad...

46
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,600
He is fine, by the grace of his Lord.

47
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
His Lord?

48
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,639
I saw you today with him in that mountain path.

49
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
You did!

50
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,519
What were you doing?

51
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,400
You prostrated yourselves and then stood up.

52
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,640
It is not the prostration we do near our idols.

53
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,720
Then, I never saw him or you prostrating yourselves before our idols.

54
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,840
What you saw us do is prayer,

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,480
which God has ordained through His Prophet.

56
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
A Prophet? You mean...

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Your nephew, Muhammad, (peace be upon him).

58
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,839
He is indeed a Prophet

59
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,519
and revelations are given to him from on high.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,640
That is the Qur'an, God's word. I follow his faith, Islam.

61
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:26,599
Prophet... revelations... Qur'an... Islam!

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,399
You have said much, my son.

63
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Sit down and tell me all about this religion you have mentioned

64
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,079
and what it stands for.

65
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,560
Where are you going, Ammar?

66
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,360
I have some business to attend to.

67
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,759
You are often leaving me alone to stay away

68
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,000
when I know nothing about what you are doing.

69
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,479
When I ask you, you only say you are attending to some business.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,040
What business? And you, Umm Ammar?

71
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,360
I am going to Abu Al-Hakam Ibn Hisham's home.

72
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,639
His wife has sent for me concerning something.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,440
You should say, "to serve her".

74
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,359
- Is it not enough that she has a servant? - Her servant is unwell.

75
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,079
Besides, we owe a duty to the Makhzooms.

76
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
Are we not their allies?

77
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,359
Yes, their allies, but not their slaves.

78
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,719
You might have been a slave woman belonging to one of them,

79
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,159
but he set you free and gave you to my father in marriage before he died.

80
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,000
Why is it that the Makhzoom clan want you to serve them,

81
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,519
- as if you were still... - No, son.

82
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,840
Don't be rash, or you will land us all in what we cannot stand up to.

83
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
We must not deny people's favours.

84
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,279
When I came from Yemen to this city,

85
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
the Makhzoom clan welcomed me and extended protection to me,

86
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,279
making me their ally. They thus own my soul.

87
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,879
No one owns a soul other than its Creator.

88
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,399
What did he say?

89
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,599
Son, he is calling us to righteousness, so stay with him

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,040
and don't tell anyone about the two of you until God's will is revealed

91
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
Welcome, Umar. Welcome to my nephew.

92
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
Sit here.

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,400
- How did you leave Al-Khattab? - He is well

94
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,520
Have you come just to visit your uncles, or for something else?

95
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
This and that.

96
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,399
As for a social visit, you are welcome.

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,520
What other news do you have?

98
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Some talk we heard and disliked.

99
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
I don't think my uncle Abu Al-Hakam is unaware of it.

100
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,840
You mean Muhammad.

101
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,519
If what we heard be true,

102
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,039
we have nothing to hold against him until he comes out into the open.

103
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,519
We do not know his objective.

104
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,279
Nor are we sure if something is the matter with him,

105
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,480
or he is starting a call aiming to raise a force against us

106
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,479
in which case we must stop him.

107
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,439
I am certain that Muhammad is advocating his faith in secret,

108
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,919
approaching only those whom he can trust.

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Why hasn't he, then, started with us when we are the chiefs of Quraysh?

110
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,800
He has judged rightly, then.

111
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,039
By Al-Lat we will not accept anything from him.

112
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
Even before you hear what he has to say?

113
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,400
We don't need to hear

114
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
more than what we have learnt already in order to oppose him.

115
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,360
It is bad enough that he disowned our faith which our forefathers upheld.

116
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
It has ensured for us mastery over all Arabs.

117
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,919
When he claims to be a Prophet,

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,600
he is saying that we must follow and obey him if we want to obey God.

119
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,359
How can we accept that one of the Hashimites as our leader

120
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,200
and we his followers?

121
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,240
Can we let this happen

122
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,240
when we have competed with them for honor and supremacy?

123
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,639
Were we to say that we don't accept the Hashimites as our leaders,

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
he would say: I am not asking you to accept the rule of the Hashimites,

125
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,759
but to accept the rule of God

126
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,680
who has sent me as His messenger to you and to all mankind.

127
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,919
And to this one!

128
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,759
Isn't she one of the people?

129
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,439
Aren't you one of the people, Sumayyah?

130
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,120
Yes... I mean... I don't understand what you are aiming at, Sir,

131
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,160
so that I give the right answer to please you.

132
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
This is a sensible woman who wants to give a pleasing answer.

133
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,600
Do speak. Don't worry.

134
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,839
You are one of the people, aren't you?

135
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,759
Indeed, sir. I am one of the people.

136
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,720
Good! What are we, then?

137
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,719
- And you also, sir. - Also?

138
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,879
But people have different ranks, sir.

139
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,639
We are your allies and followers.

140
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Haven't I told you that Sumayyah is a sensible woman?

141
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Our late cousin, Abu Hudhayfah did well when he granted her freedom

142
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,360
and gave her in marriage to his ally Yassir Al-Ansi.

143
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,600
Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't need the milk. Thank you.

144
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,120
Do you understand me, my nephew?

145
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,879
Should Muhammad call on people to follow his faith,

146
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,360
he will be in fact asking us to accept his rule under the guise of prophethood,

147
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,240
and he will remain one of the Hashimites.

148
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,679
By Al-Lat, if he calls on us to follow his faith,

149
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,600
we will give him a very rude answer. Sumayyah.

150
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,480
For dinner today, do prepare the food and the pans for whoever comes.

151
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,120
Prepare food in plenty. Do not economise.

152
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Very well, sir.

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,159
Ikrimah, order our servants to invite people to our dinner.

154
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,360
They should invite every guest, passerby or poor person.

155
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,879
Let us be the first to invite them.

156
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,920
"The third year after the Prophet's mission"

157
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,319
Hello, women

158
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,120
What are you doing among women, you boy?

159
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,159
You have become a man.

160
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,759
Hello, old man.

161
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,840
So, the reports are true;

162
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,279
yet nothing is like seeing with your own eyes.

163
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,879
So, this is how you pray.

164
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,000
We have been hearing about Muhammad and his faith

165
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,920
as he abandoned our religion.

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
What came first in whispers has now become louder.

167
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,879
Some of us believed it; some did not.

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:12,120
How awful! I think that you are now in numbers,

169
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,640
while we were oblivious to what is happening, thinking it simple.

170
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
Abu Sufyan, we have tried our best

171
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
not to let you see what may displease you,

172
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,679
and not to face your unpleasant reaction.

173
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,080
Hence, we come to this spot to pray.

174
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,919
We do so in obedience to God's messenger (peace be upon him).

175
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,639
God's messenger?

176
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
God has willed that you see us today.

177
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,639
Leave us alone, as we have left you and go back with our good wishes.

178
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,639
You do not ask about what we do, and we will not ask about what you do,

179
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,399
Well, well. Stranger things could happen.

180
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,279
Abdullah Ibn Massoud, or rather, Ibn Umm Abd,

181
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,159
the shepherd employed by Uqbah Ibn Abi Muait,

182
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,960
speaks up to the chiefs of Quraysh.

183
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
You put yourself at our level.

184
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,839
You want us not to ask you what you do, and you don't ask us what we do.

185
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,959
And you Saad, are willing to be in company with these low people,

186
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,519
while you belong to Zuhrah, a clan of Quraysh,

187
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,079
They are better than me.

188
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,879
Nay. It is you who are worse than them.

189
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Hold it, man. Leave us alone.

190
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,319
No, by Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, we will not leave you alone

191
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,480
until we have shown you our strength

192
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,839
so that you will abandon this stupidity.

193
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,919
- Who did this to you? - It is nothing.

194
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,279
You must tell us.

195
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,879
We gave them as much as we took from them.

196
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,680
I could never care less for them.

197
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,919
Who are they?

198
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,279
Abu Sufyan and his group!

199
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,879
- Whom did you say? - Abu Sufyan and his group!

200
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,960
Abu Sufyan? The chief of the Abd Shams clan?

201
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,639
Who are you to quarrel with one of the chiefs of Quraysh,

202
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,639
giving him as much as he gives you, as you have just said?

203
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,760
Have you gone mad? Don't you remember who we are?

204
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,320
I do, indeed. We do not belong to Quraysh, but to Ans,

205
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,840
and we are allies to the Makhzoom clan.

206
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,479
My mother was a slave woman belonging to Abu Hudhayfah of Makhzoom.

207
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,799
I know all this, father. Had I ever forgotten it,

208
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,000
the chiefs of Quraysh and its younger people would have reminded me.

209
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,360
- Then how dare you... - Sit down, father. Sit down

210
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,519
And you too, mother.

211
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,879
"I seek shelter with God against Satan, the accursed."

212
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
"In the name of God, the Lord of Grace, the Ever-Merciful."

213
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,439
"By the bright morning hours, and the night when it grows still and dark,"

214
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
"Your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor does He hate you."

215
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
"Surely the life to come will be better for you than this present life."

216
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
"And, certainly, in time your Lord will be bounteous to you"

217
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,399
"and you will be well pleased."

218
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,120
"Has He not found you an orphan and given you a shelter?"

219
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,080
"And found you in error, and guided you?"

220
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,680
"And found you poor and enriched you?"

221
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,720
"Therefore do not wrong the orphan,"

222
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,000
"nor chide away the beggar,"

223
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,159
"but speak of your Lord's favours."

224
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,280
What is this news we have heard, Abu Sufyan?

225
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
Is it true that...

226
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,960
Yes, indeed. As you have heard.

227
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,759
When you saw them at the mountain path,

228
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,920
why didn't you leave them alone?

229
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,279
Father, for how long will you continue to do like an ostrich?

230
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
Don't fan the fire, Hind.

231
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,200
Then you agree that it is a fire,

232
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,800
and it starts with a spark.

233
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,519
Unless you put it out straightaway,

234
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,480
it will take off and may burn your homes.

235
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,000
They are relatives, Hind.

236
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Are we to behave like one who cuts his own nose?

237
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,679
Nay. It is like one with a decayed finger.

238
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,279
If he leaves it, the decay will spread throughout his arm,

239
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,199
then the rest of his body.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,359
Wisdom requires that he cuts it off to save himself.

241
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,840
Someone made a personal choice. What's that got to do with us?

242
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Muhammad? Had he made a personal choice, as you say,

243
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,879
he would have gone to some mountain to worship alone, that would be fine.

244
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,360
But he is advocating his faith.

245
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
People have followed him. Some of them we know, others we don't.

246
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,840
The ones we know include Abu Bakr, Uthman Ibn Affan,

247
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,560
Uthman Ibn Mazoun, Saad Ibn Abi Waqqas, Abd Al-Rahman Ibn Awf,

248
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,320
and a number of the low people.

249
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:41,000
Whoever joins him is rebelling against you.

250
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,799
They obey him in as much as they disobey you,

251
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
When Muhammad is the master,

252
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,240
then the Hashimites are masters with him.

253
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,759
We, the Abd Shams clan,

254
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,359
have been matching them like two horses in a race,

255
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,960
but we led by virtue of our wealth.

256
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,839
Now Abu Talib's foster son is claiming that he is a Prophet

257
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,279
and that your religion is worthless.

258
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,359
But he does not address himself to the Abd Shams clan only

259
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,640
Stop arguing now.

260
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,359
Here we are arguing about Muhammad

261
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
before he even speaks to us about his faith

262
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,599
or criticizes anything we do.

263
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,319
Only a small number of us have followed him.

264
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,360
We must not be the ones to sever relations with kinsfolk.

265
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,120
True, he belongs to Hashim,

266
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,960
but we and they join together as descendants from Abd Manaf.

267
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,360
They are our closest clan of Quraysh.

268
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,519
Then you intend to leave Muhammad and his companions alone

269
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,079
until they represent a serious threat.

270
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,800
No, until they have overstepped their limits.

271
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,200
Then all the Qurayshi clans will join us

272
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,039
if we find ourselves in conflict with them.

273
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,000
The Hashimite clan will have a choice:

274
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,119
Either they give him up to us, and he will be without protection,

275
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,759
or they will protect him.

276
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,319
In the latter case, they will bear the consequences,

277
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,040
as they will be abandoned by the rest of the Quraysh clans who will follow us.

278
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,640
This will give the Abd Shams clan undisputed mastery.

279
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,120
Patience! Wisdom!

280
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,039
The claim of prophethood will ultimately be for us either a gain or a loss.

281
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,519
What determines either is good management.

282
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
This is what I have to say.

283
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,160
All of you listen and obey...

284
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,519
By God, this is a fine word.

285
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,919
It is certainly not a man's word.

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,480
It is as if I was blindfolded and now I can see.

287
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,639
One God having created us all from a single soul,

288
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,200
which makes us all equal in creation, rights and duties.

289
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,360
No privilege is attached to wealth or lineage.

290
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,360
Turning to God, maintaining what is right, fair, benevolent

291
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
and good are the only criteria for reward.

292
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:29,799
But, if Abu Sufyan and his companions did what they did today

293
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,320
when Saad Ibn Abi Waqqas was with you,

294
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,759
what will they do to us

295
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,039
if we were to abandon their ways and follow the Prophet?

296
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Abu Ammar. You have committed yourself

297
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,200
when you felt the truth in what your son has said

298
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,639
and reported of God's messenger.

299
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,600
Whom should you fear: our allies, the Makhzooms

300
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,200
or God, our and their Master?

301
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes, indeed, I was a slave woman in Abu Hudhayfah's home,

302
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,720
and he was an honorable and kind man.

303
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,200
He set me free and gave me in marriage to you.

304
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,319
Yet, the women of Quraysh have always treated me as a slave.

305
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,920
When they see me, they say, "Abu Hudhayfah's slave girl."

306
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,319
If any of them calls me to go over to her,

307
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,680
she only wants me to serve her.

308
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,400
I am never allowed to sit with them.

309
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,560
Only now I learn that when I am God's servant,

310
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,560
no creature may have any authority over me,

311
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,160
Ammar, take me now to the Prophet

312
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,559
so that I embrace Islam, as you have done.

313
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
If your father prefers to stay behind,

314
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,640
fearing his allies of the Makhzoom clan, so be it.

315
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,079
I will remain dutiful to him in every way,

316
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,480
as long as I don't disobey God.

317
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,279
Bilal!

318
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,200
Show us what you can do.

319
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,559
I have no need to fight him.

320
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Who cares what you need? You do what I need. Go!

321
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,039
Your father is unfair to him.

322
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,439
What can the son of Hamamah do with such a mighty fellow!

323
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
Come on you, son of Hamamah,

324
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
show us your strength.

325
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,920
If you beat him, I will give you a prize.

326
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,879
This is Abu Dasamah. Blessed be your hand.

327
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,079
The Abyssinian has been sympathetic to his fellow Abyssinian.

328
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,160
I don't know why I pay for your food and drink.

329
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,599
You have the thickest skin and a sparrow's heart.

330
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,560
Go! Go!

331
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,240
- You! - How admirable you were today.

332
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,839
No one saw me.

333
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,759
Haven't I told you not to visit me?

334
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
Do you fear your master, or what people may say?

335
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,319
If I don't fear for myself, I fear for you.

336
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,080
Your master is very pleased with you today,

337
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,080
because you beat all your opponents.

338
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,680
People don't care when a slave meets a slave woman.

339
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,920
Just as they don't care when an animal seeks another.

340
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,000
Then fulfill your promise and speak to your master.

341
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,839
I don't think he would refuse.

342
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,600
The Arabs have always arranged marriages between their slaves

343
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,400
The time is not right yet.

344
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,079
When will it be right?

345
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,400
I don't know. I don't know... Don't keep arguing with me.

346
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,439
I thought that you would be kind to me today

347
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,680
Raihanah!

348
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
Don't you understand my feelings?

349
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,759
By God, I would love you to be my wife today, rather than tomorrow.

350
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,839
But you are doing nothing about it.

351
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
This is because I don't want to bring into the world a child

352
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,319
who will belong to someone else,

353
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,240
just like an animal fathering a cub.

354
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I want my freedom first.

355
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,720
Can an animal fall in love and get married?

356
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,679
They only take it to another animal, hoping to increase their animals.

357
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,799
Why should I increase the number of their slaves?

358
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,960
Do you really hope that Jubair Ibn Mut'im would ever set you free?

359
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,559
He may do.

360
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,680
How miserable you are, Wahshi! And alas for my misery too.

361
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,799
You can hope, but you will spend your life

362
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,800
looking for something that will never happen.

363
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,119
The Arabs say: Despair is one of two forms of comfort.

364
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,119
The other comfort is death, and to me it is the one I prefer.

365
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,279
"In the name of God, the Lord of Grace, the Ever-Merciful."

366
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,279
"Warn your nearest kindred,"

367
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,079
"and spread the wing of your tenderness over all of the believers who follow you."

368
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
Speed up.

369
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,039
Muhammad has called on his people to come over

370
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,919
only to make his call public.

371
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,119
What has so far been a report is about to become a tangible fact.

372
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,480
Such a fact is certainly unlike a mere report.

373
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,960
Such a fact is certainly unlike a mere report.

374
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,680
You Hashimites! You have heard my nephew, Muhammad,

375
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,879
whom you have known to be the most truthful of people,

376
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,039
the kindest and the best-mannered.

377
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,440
When he asked you whether you would believe him

378
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:39,119
if he were to tell you that horsemen behind the mountain were about to attack you,

379
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
you answered that you would,

380
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,839
as you never experienced him telling a lie.

381
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,960
He then called on you to believe in his faith

382
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,159
and worship none other than God,

383
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,640
and to accept that he is God's Prophet and messenger.

384
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,480
You make your own choice.

385
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,799
It is not for that I have called you today.

386
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,840
He is the one to put his argument and present his evidence.

387
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,960
However, I know that he has come up with something very serious,

388
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,079
unprecedented in Quraysh's history.

389
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,920
I have seen grim faces, and others foretelling evil.

390
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,200
It is only a question of time before they make up their minds

391
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:33,480
and devise their plot against Muhammad.

392
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,279
As for me, I will never give up my nephew.

393
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,599
You heard me when I said to him:

394
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,920
Go ahead and do what you have been bidden.

395
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,200
By God, I will continue to look after you and protect you.

396
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,199
Let me hear what you have to say.

397
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,839
This is wicked.

398
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,879
This is what I said and will say; this is wicked.

399
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,560
My Hashimite clansmen, take my view,

400
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,440
as I am also his uncle.

401
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,879
By God, I have never known anyone bringing his own people

402
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,360
a worse catastrophe than Muhammad is bringing you.

403
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,960
He is deserting the faith of his forefathers and his people,

404
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,160
and denouncing your gods.

405
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,919
What will you do when all Arabs are ranked against you?

406
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,519
Are we a match for all the Arabs?

407
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,440
It is better that his own clansmen should confine him.

408
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,720
It is much easier than letting the rest of Quraysh,

409
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
supported by other Arabs, attack us.

410
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,599
Nay! By God, we shall protect him for as long as we survive.

411
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,920
You have heard me, and heard him.

412
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,680
Who of you will uphold my position?

413
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
Abu Talib, you are our master.

414
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,160
- All of us support your position. - Yes, indeed, all of us.

415
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,039
We shall protect him with you, even if it means that we all perish.

416
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,599
Then disperse.

417
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,240
How do you feel about him?

418
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,840
Just as you should feel,

419
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,079
and as should be felt by anyone from Quraysh

420
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,759
who wants his people to remain united, closing ranks,

421
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,079
and who hates to see them severing relations with their own kindred,

422
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,839
becoming hostile to one another.

423
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,079
Should they do that, they will be overwhelmed by the rest of the Arabs.

424
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,679
You think this will happen?

425
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,160
Oh! Do you think it is merely a word to be said,

426
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,799
accepted by some and rejected by others,

427
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,679
Zaid, we are the people of the Haram.

428
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,759
The rest of the Arabs pay homage to us because of the Haram.

429
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,960
To them, obeying us is part of religion.

430
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,280
Anyone who goes against our wishes is violating the commands of his gods.

431
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,320
Trade, Umar. It is through the Haram and trade

432
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,119
that the Quraysh gained their supremacy.

433
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,199
By both indeed. No harm does Quraysh suffer

434
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,720
because God has assigned it the custody of the Haram,

435
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,600
bringing it benefits that help it to maintain and serve it,

436
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,679
and to be hospitable to its pilgrims.

437
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,079
All this is fine. It is indeed through the Haram

438
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,119
that the Quraysh people have become wealthy and strong.

439
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,639
They then use their wealth to maintain the Haram and to be hosts to its pilgrims.

440
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,919
Thus, God has given them the privileges of religion and wealth,

441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,760
By both, they gained supremacy among the Arabs and control over them.

442
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,400
How will things be if the Arabs discover that Quraysh has become divided,

443
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,879
with some people saying that Quraysh's religion has no true basis.

444
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,400
This means that they have no special sanctity.

445
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,119
We shall not follow its faith

446
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,599
or do its rituals until Quraysh itself has changed.

447
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,279
If Quraysh does not change, then we will worship God in our homes,

448
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,760
or else, we fight them over the Haram and take it away from them if we can,

449
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,880
so that we can perform our rituals according to the commands of our true faith.

450
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,240
Where will Quraysh go then? What will be left for it?

451
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,119
This is my view,

452
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,879
and I shall ensure that the Adiy people, young and old, shall enforce it.

453
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
What is the matter?

454
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,359
We must not be late for the elders of Quraysh

455
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,000
as they are meeting in Dar Al-Nadwah, discussing a serious matter.

456
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,519
As I have said; what do I have to do with the Quraysh elders?

457
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,119
How do you say this? You know that they are meeting

458
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,879
to discuss what to do about Muhammad and his religion.

459
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,839
Every clan of Quraysh is represented in the meeting.

460
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,840
Is it appropriate that the Adiy clan be absent?

461
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,119
They will not be absent when you are in the meeting.

462
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,759
You are the elder.

463
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,280
But Quraysh knows, as I do,

464
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,680
that you are the one who is more resolute, eloquent, courageous

465
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,880
and held in awe by all people.

466
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,159
Hold it, hold it. I am not taken in by what you say. I only want...

467
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,759
By God I am only saying the truth.

468
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,719
What is the harm if my brother takes a lead over me,

469
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,840
when his clear opinion gives him an edge?

470
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,679
Then, our father, Al-Khattab, chose you to replace him in the people's meetings,

471
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,799
and the Adiy clan accepted that, taking your views with respect,

472
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
and then Quraysh has been happy with that,

473
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,799
making you its ambassador who defends its case.

474
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
- I am perfectly happy with that. - But I am not happy with it.

475
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,320
Everyone is suited for the role assigned to him.

476
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:35,880
If what you are meeting for is good,

477
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,079
it is sufficient that one man from Al-Khattab's family shares in it.

478
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,920
If it is evil,

479
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,280
it is sufficient that one of us shoulders it on our behalf.

480
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,280
Are you playing and gambling,

481
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,039
when your elders are inside discussing a very serious matter,

482
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,239
thinking what they should do about Muhammad.

483
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,079
Our elders can take care of the problem.

484
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,639
They with their wise judgement and we with our swords when they wish.

485
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,319
Umar has become one of the elders, although he is younger than me.

486
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,400
He had better stay with us.

487
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,159
His father, Al-Khattab vacated his place for him, and the Adiy clan accepted him.

488
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,679
He is indeed a worthy choice, even though he has a touch of roughness.

489
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,920
Besides, he is a maternal relative of ours. So, watch what you say.

490
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,840
Khalid is right.

491
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,879
Who says that I was about to speak ill of him?

492
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,199
I can see it in your eyes, Amr.

493
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,080
I know you too well.

494
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,000
Now, Umair, place a bet for me and Safwan for two camels.

495
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,679
Two camels! Isn't one sufficient?

496
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,240
It works for both of us. If you win, your pleasure is doubled.

497
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,440
And if I lose, my disappointment is doubled.

498
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,960
Safwan Ibn Umayyah, the desert's most generous son, is worried about poverty,

499
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,239
while he slaughters camels every night for his guests!

500
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,519
I don't mind slaughtering camels for the right purpose.

501
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,920
- As to losing them... - What is the right purpose?

502
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,119
- What did you say? - You feed the people

503
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,759
so that they would call you the desert's most generous son!

504
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,039
Whoever says it is telling the truth.

505
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,480
What do people say about Amr Ibn Al-Aas?

506
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,400
When everyone is confused and cannot find the right way,

507
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,559
all resort to Amr.

508
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,880
I am not sure whether they praise you for cleverness,

509
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,720
or condemn you for dodginess. It is confusing.

510
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,560
No confusion. If it is in our favour, it is valuable cleverness,

511
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,960
and if it is against us, it is low behavior.

512
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,240
What do you say: shall he draw the lots for two camels?

513
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,639
It is two, then.

514
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,679
- With whom do I start? - With Safwan.

515
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,039
With Safwan.

516
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,080
He has lost consciousness!

517
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,440
Al-Gharim, cousin!

518
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,440
Is this what you do to your cousin and friend?

519
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,639
What can I do when I only administer the game?

520
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,159
It's all right, Safwan. You are wealthy, and so is your father.

521
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,439
If you lose some of it, he will help you.

522
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,639
Neither my wealth, nor my father's,

523
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:36,959
is greater than your father's wealth, Al-Waleed Ibn Al-Mugheerah.

524
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,960
He has subdued many people

525
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,759
in Makkah and Taif by means of his wealth.

526
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,280
I prayed to Al-Lat and Al-Uzza. Yes, indeed I did.

527
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,680
I even walked around them before coming to join you.

528
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,640
I continue to slaughter my sacrifice for them and feed people.

529
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,319
Perhaps they didn't hear you as you did not raise your voice.

530
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,760
Or probably because you do not sacrifice the best of your camels for them.

531
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,800
Would you like to have a game, Amr?

532
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,240
If your friend, Safwan, visited Al-Lat and Al-Uzza before joining us,

533
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,519
and he continues to sacrifice his money and camels for them,

534
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,679
yet they did not answer his prayers.

535
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,960
What will they do to little Amr Ibn Al-Aas

536
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,480
who did not pass by them for a month

537
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:28,400
and only sacrificed a sickly sheep for them?

538
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,360
- What about you, Abu Jandal? - Huh?

539
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,400
Abu Jandal is more interested in the elders' discussions.

540
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,880
When he has made all the gods into one God

541
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,519
and disowned our deities and idols,

542
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,279
how can it be said that he did nothing we dislike?

543
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,280
Why should we care, if we persevere with our gods?

544
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
Or do you fear that Muhammad

545
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,200
might turn you away from your fathers' religion.

546
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,880
If so, then you are unsure of it.

547
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,880
Abu Al-Waleed, people are not the same in such a matter.

548
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,800
Some of us are no longer with us.

549
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:16,240
Where are Abu Bakr, Uthman, Abu Ubaidah or Abd Al-Rahman Ibn Awf?

550
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,480
We only know of his followers those who belong to clans that protect them.

551
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,719
Hence, they were prepared to declare their faith.
