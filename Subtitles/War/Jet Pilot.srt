41

Twenty-one minutes. I caught him
just as he was coming in to land.

42

He's crossing the field to go back up

<i>Well, why don't you turn on
the cold faucet? Where is it?</i>

168
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,973
<i>Right next to the other one.
Can't you see it? No.</i>

169
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,012
Why not?
What's the matter with your eyes?

170
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:45,704
<i>They got soap in them.
Uh-oh.</i>

171
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:50,115
Well, I'll fix that.
Come on over to the door.

172
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:53,766
<i>Here I am.
Now put your hand on the knob.</i>

173
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:57,610
<i>All right.
Now reach right above it.</i>

174
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:01,471
That's a towel rack.
There's a towel on it.

175
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:06,149
Oh, thank you!
Oh.

176
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,519
Looks like I'm gonna have
a very interesting trip.

177
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,973
Oh, no, you're not.

178
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,476
<i>(PHONE WINDING)</i>

179
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:20,805
Sergeant? See that Captain Carlson
has my gear packed.

180
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,350
Where are you going? I think I'd better
take her down to Palmer Field myself.

181
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,683
But you told the general I was gonna do it.
I think I'd better.

182
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,302
Who's gonna look after the outfit?
You're second in command.

183
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,576
But you were right in the middle
of those night interception tests.

184
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,212
I said you were second in command.
Besides, you're a married man.

185
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:36,448
What's that got to do with it?

186
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:40,061
I don't want you exposed to temptation. Now
wait a minute. Maybe you got her all wrong.

187
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,097
She really might've gotten soap in her
eyes. It's happened to me lots of times.

188
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,136
<i>I know. That's why I'm gonna take her.
(DOOR OPENS)</i>

189
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,760
I hope you don't mind, gentlemen,
but it's much too cold in there.

190
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,686
Make yourself at home.

191
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>(DOOR CLOSES)</i>

192
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,577
It's so nice and warm in here.

193
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,766
Wonder what I did
with the lady's lighter.

194
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,900
Did you see it? I didn't know she had one.
What'd you do with it?

195
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,977
Well, if I knew,
I wouldn't ask you.

196
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,310
It isn't possible you were
thinking of something else.

197
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:01,294
This is just a shot in the dark,

198
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:04,711
but her eyes don't look like
they had soap in 'em.

199
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:14,314
This might be some new form
of Russian propaganda.

200
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:24,009
Maybe they are actually trying to
make friends and influence people.

201
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,986
Could be.

202
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,192
Could be.

203
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,756
I wonder if you fully understand
your position, Lieutenant.

204
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:54,021
As a refugee?
You came here to avoid being shot.

205
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:55,942
<i>That is correct.</i>

206
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,821
You want us to give you sanctuary,
yet you don't wanna do anything in return.

207
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,236
I'm not going to tell you anything
that will hurt my country.

208
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,049
I'm a
refugee, not a traitor.

209
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:08,353
In other words,
you want something for nothing.

210
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,640
Your precious freedom...
it has to be bought?

211
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:16,416
Why not?
We paid a high price for it.

212
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,817
And it's getting
scarcer in the world all the time.

213
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:22,558
Exactly. What kind of
people do you think we are?

214
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,236
You're trying to confuse me. I won't tell
you anything, I don't care what you say.

215
00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:29,719
I can't get used to women soldiers.

216
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,731
I don't like the idea
of putting pressure on a girl like you.

217
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,480
Pressure?

218
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,883
I didn't know they did things
like that in the United States.

219
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,599
What things?
Pressure means torture, doesn't it?

220
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:51,863
I didn't hear the general say anything
about torture. Did you, Rivers?

221
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,265
I didn't even hear the general
say anything about pressure.

222
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:57,646
Did you, Major?
I didn't hear the general say anything.

223
00:19:57,722 --> 00:20:00,918
You gentlemen are making me feel
very much at home.

224
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:04,498
That's just the way
we want you to feel, Lieutenant.

225
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,318
You're a soldier.
Would you have any respect for me...

226
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:09,751
if I told you what you wanted to know
about the Russian Air Force?

227
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:11,670
Don't you think
I have a sense of honor?

228
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:14,112
Are you referring to your
honor as a Soviet soldier?

229
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,205
What else do you think
I'm talking about?

230
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,812
What's so funny about that?

231
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:24,659
It's very refreshing to hear
a commie talk about honor.

232
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,853
I honor my country above everything.

233
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:31,949
Does that mean you can have no honor,
no love, no respect for anything else?

234
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,604
Precisely.
Not even for yourself?

235
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,202
With us, the state is everything.

236
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,442
The individual has no right
to even think of himself.

237
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:42,150
Well, if we respected your feelings in
this manner, you'd have no respect for us.

238
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:44,330
Why not?

239
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,255
You'd think it was a good joke.

240
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,549
Sure, Americans are so simple
about this freedom thing.

241
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,477
They don't seem to realize they're cooking
the calf in the milk of its own mother.

242
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,681
Isn't that, uh, true?

243
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,605
I've never even thought about it
in that light.

244
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,190
I think you should.

245
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,497
Come in, Captain.

246
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:06,412
In fact, I'd advise you
to give it very careful thought.

247
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,720
<i>I will think about that too.
(DOOR OPENS)</i>

248
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,877
Shannon, you certainly
gave her the works.

249
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:31,259
Yes, sir. If anybody's gonna get anything
out of this girl, it'll be Shannon.

250
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:34,051
Me? The most perfect case
of ambivalence I ever saw.

251
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,028
Case of what?
Ambivalence?

252
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,491
Double values.

253
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,670
They both like and hate each other.

254
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:44,319
They don't know which feeling to follow.
Wonderful confusion.

255
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:47,203
Perfect sex antagonism.
This proves it.

256
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,177
Proves what?
Yeah, proves what?

257
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:50,499
Look at the doodle she made.

258
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,826
Did you make a pass at her when
you brought her down in the C-47?

259
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:53,452
I did not!

260
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:56,093
Let me look at that. You mean
these doodles would show it?

261
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,984
I don't know.

262
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,959
You'd get practically
the same effect if he didn't.

263
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,367
That's just the way it was!
I didn't! Now, Jim...

264
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:04,952
And speaking of passes, sir,
she threw one at me...

265
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,195
right in my office
almost before her hands got warm.

266
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,271
What? Then she tried it
again in the shower.

267
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:10,870
Shower?
What shower?

268
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,797
I got one in the office.
Oh, well.

269
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,717
What is she doing in a shower?
Well, after she undressed...

270
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:17,149
in the bathroom, gentlemen.

271
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:19,734
It's all in my notes, General.
I had to search her, didn't I?

272
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,910
Yes, but you didn't say
anything about this shower business.

273
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,119
She asked me if she could take one.
What else could I do?

274
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:27,254
General, I think we can spare
Colonel Shannon any further details.

275
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:30,225
The overall picture seems
to be sufficiently corroborated.

276
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,438
I think we'd be fully justified
in exploiting it.

277
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,895
Listen, General... Don't look at me.
They're absolutely right.

278
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,788
You were made for this job.

279
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,603
General Black, I'm a
jet man, not a gigolo.

280
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,259
How about that job you did for us
with that German Frau?

281
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,230
That was an accident, not in the
line of duty. Well, this is.

282
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:47,792
I'm putting you in full charge
and holding you completely responsible.

283
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:50,285
<i>But... I don't want this angle
to get into the records.</i>

284
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,990
So I'll leave it to you
to inform your people

285
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:54,000
and the F.B.I. You do the
same with the C.I.A.

286
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,565
Yes, sir.
But, General...

287
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,059
The newspapers don't know
a thing about this girl, so watch yourself.

288
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,500
Washington wants to keep it this way.
Savvy?

289
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:03,826
General, let's don't change the subject.
Colonel Shannon?

290
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:12,175
I can take a hint.
About face! Forward march.

291
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:54,056
Where ya been?
You're a day late.

292
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:57,056
Ran into some bad weather in Edmonton,
but we're all present and accounted for.

293
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,366
You're still in charge.
What's the matter?

294
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,290
Well, they couldn't get
any more out of her nibs

295
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:03,139
than we did, so they
tossed her back in my lap.

296
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,564
You better give the group
a couple of days rest.

297
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,494
Serves you right for not
letting me bring her down.

298
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,242
I wish I had.

299
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:14,746
Look, I'm gonna have to
put on an act for her,

300
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:19,872
so after we pull out, you tell that Waf
captain not to take it too seriously.

301
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,651
Never mind.
I'll tell her myself.

302
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:30,807
You remember Major Rexford.
Oh, yes. How do you do?

303
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,403
Colonel Shannon tells me
you two are going up for a flight.

304
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:35,612
I still can't believe it.
You're not serious?

305
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,016
Why not?

306
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,088
You mean I'm not going
to be confined?

307
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,910
From now on,
you're a guest of the air force.

308
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:45,080
You may go where you want
and see what you like.

309
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,249
<i>I was instructed to give you
the same treatment and hospitality...</i>

310
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,523
<i>that was given to
those other two Russian fliers,</i>

311
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:53,372
one of whom has already
returned to Russia.

312
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:55,292
How do you like that?

313
00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:57,942
Well, it's very simple.
He probably became homesick.

314
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:02,876
Do you stuff birds too?

315
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,111
Captain.

316
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:11,127
What does he mean,
do I stuff birds too?

317
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,991
Nothing.
His father was a taxidermist.

318
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,454
<i>Oh. JIM: Lieutenant?</i>

319
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,895
If you please.

320
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:27,342
What's this all about, Major?
I can't make head or tail of it.

321
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:29,870
You don't know what's behind it all?

322
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,277
Mind your own business.

323
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:39,345
There's your tailpipe heat,
your fuel pressure gauge.

324
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,267
Here's your tachometer.

325
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,666
I thought this was it.
Oh, that's right.

326
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:46,219
On this type, it's on the other side.

327
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,233
You better have a little respect
for that red handle...

Oh. The seat ejector.
So your father was a bird stuffer.

330
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:59,942
Is that why you took up flying?

331
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,733
You're pretty well-stuffed yourself.

332
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:22,049
"S" For Shannon
calling "A" For Anna.

333
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,611
This is "A" For Anna.
Go ahead.

334
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,171
Meet you over the field at 30,000.

335
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:30,558
All right. But why didn't you tell me
you were going to pull up like that?

336
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,805
I didn't think you could make it.

337
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,881
(ANNA SCOFFS)

338
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,239
"S" For Shannon
calling "A" For Anna.

339
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:44,450
Go ahead.
Where are you?

340
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,885
Can't you see me?
No!

341
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,601
I'm very close to you.
How close?

342
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,182
Well, if these guns were loaded,
you'd be minus your rudder and one wing.

343
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:56,482
Say, where are you?

344
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,403
(ANNA OVER RADIO)
Right underneath you.

345
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:02,875
Underneath me? I don't believe it.
Why don't you take a look.

346
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:05,631
Hello.
(LAUGHING)

347
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:09,179
Not bad.
I have now shot away your other wing.

348
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:12,632
(JIM LAUGHS)
I'll never hear the last of this.

349
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:37,656
Lady, you sure are the Peruvian doughnuts!
I wouldn't mind having you for a wingman.

350
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,666
I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

351
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,700
Let's see if you're as good in a
tight turn. That's my specialty.

352
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:57,617
ANNA: You're fabulous. That's the
tightest turn I've ever seen.

353
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,721
But I'll get inside of
you just the same. How?

354
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:04,173
You can't tighten it much more
without going into a spin yourself.

355
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,221
Maybe, but I'm figuring
you'll do it first.

356
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:08,204
ANNA:
Maybe.

357
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,768
<i>(ANNA SCREAMS)
You see what I mean?</i>

358
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,680
JIM:
Now the gun's on the other shoulder.

359
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,599
It's much worse than that.
What's wrong?

360
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,574
How far are we from the field?
Why?

361
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:40,517
I've got a flameout.
A flameout? Cut your throttle.

362
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:43,690
What's the procedure for a restart?
Slow down to 200.

363
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,653
Right. Now start to glide, and don't touch
anything till we get down to 15,000.

364
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,595
Right. Hello, Palmer Tower.
This is Colonel Shannon.

365
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,036
Emergency. Stand by for a dead-stick
landing of an F-86 on the long runway.

366
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:59,271
Roger, Colonel Shannon.
Crash circuit.

367
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,430
Emergency landing, F-86.
Dead stick. Runway 6.

368
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:06,215
<i>(SIREN WAILING) (MAN OVER PA)
Emergency landing, F-86.</i>

369
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:09,282
<i>(DOG BARKING)
Dead stick. Runway 6.</i>

370
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:13,346
<i>Emergency landing, F-86.
Dead stick. Runway 6.</i>

371
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,199
What's the course to the field?
Straight ahead.

372
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:18,947
But I don't think there's a chance
for a dead-stick from here.

373
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,950
You can't restart your engine,
you'll have to bail out.

374
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:24,477
Bail out?
With the seat ejector?

375
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,168
Have you ever tried it?
Not in these trousers.

376
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:30,369
They say it's pure rugged,
so you'd better try to get an air start.

377
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:33,732
I'm unlucky. I've never been able
to get one yet.

378
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:38,171
Now, just take it easy. You've only enough
juice in that battery for one stab at it.

379
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,763
Is your compressor turning over?

380
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:44,130
Yes. It's windmilling about 17%.
That's fine.

381
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,431
We're almost down to 15,000.

382
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,345
Have you got your emergency
fuel switch on? Yes.

383
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,343
Now turn on your ignition boost
and crack your throttle.

384
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,272
What next?
Say a prayer.

385
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:56,376
I don't believe in that nonsense.

386
00:29:56,448 --> 00:29:59,448
Then you'd better quit flying jets.
Why?

387
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,228
Never mind.
I'll say one for you.

388
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:06,109
Maybe you should say another one.
Why?

389
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:08,083
The temperature's beginning
to rise in my tailpipe.

390
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:12,499
You probably only have two burners going.
Open your throttle another crack.

391
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:18,996
They're all burning now. Should
I try full power? Go ahead.

392
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:26,840
You're all right.
Pour on the coal and head for home!

393
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,557
Hey, that turn of yours...
I wish you'd show me how to do it.

394
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:39,762
You can show me a few things too.

395
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:44,620
I don't think so.
You're the best I ever saw.

396
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:48,403
Then how come you got underneath me?
Just a trick.

397
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,324
How'd you do it?

398
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll tell you if you'll show me how
to do that tight turn. I can't.

399
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:57,264
Why not?
It was revealed to me in a dream.

400
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,306
Oh.

401
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:26,280
The way she flies that F-86,
the Soviets must have an equivalent type.

402
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,237
She sure is
fully operational with it.

403
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:32,807
I don't think their battery system
or burners are as good as ours. Why?

404
00:31:32,877 --> 00:31:36,040
When she had the flameout, she said
she'd never been able to relight one.

405
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:38,562
But they have some tactics
we oughta study.

406
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:41,286
You mean the way she gets inside of you
on that loop? Couldn't get rid of her.

407
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:45,860
She must be pretty good. Only thing I
could beat her at was a tight turn.

408
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,385
If we'd have been using bullets
instead of film,

409
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,457
I'd have been cold meat
long before that.

410
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,438
Well, that's fine, Jim.

411
00:31:56,712 --> 00:31:58,915
<i>What are you gonna try her on next?</i>

412
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,284
She seems to be interested
in our night interceptions.

413
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,205
Think we oughta
give her a whirl at it?

414
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,179
I don't see why not.

415
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:08,352
Washington wants us to find out
what interests her most,

416
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:11,486
which, by all processes of deduction,
should give them some idea...

417
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,531
of the things the Russians haven't got.

418
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:14,347
Go ahead.

419
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:16,637
That means she'll get a peek
at some of our new stuff.

420
00:32:16,707 --> 00:32:19,641
We'll bring out
an old night fighter from Dayton.

421
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:22,202
We'll also set up
our old method of interception.

422
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,551
Then all she'll get out
of it's a ride. How

423
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,910
are you progressing on
the sentimental side?

424
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:30,555
I'm not rushing it, Rivers.
Why not, Colonel?

425
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,941
She hasn't given me a chance, Major.

426
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:41,976
Maybe I was imagining things
up in Alaska.

427
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,934
Shannon to Pilot.
Push in the channel "C" button.

428
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:17,302
That'll put us
on fighter control frequency.

429
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:22,452
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.
I'm airborne.

430
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,479
Broken clouds and a full moon.
Request instructions. Over.

431
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,971
Red Dog to Shannon.
We have you.

432
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:31,662
Our B-36 is turning inland.

433
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:41,069
It's taking up a heading of 0-9-0.

434
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:45,393
How far out is she?
I'd say about 140 miles.

435
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,824
B-36 track, she's moved to...

436
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:53,038
<i>Baker-Queen-1-0-8-4.</i>

437
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:57,576
<i>Red Dog to Shannon. Climb to Angel-3-0
and orbit. Location. Four. Hit the gate!</i>

438
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:00,581
Shannon to Red Dog. Roger.

439
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:04,615
Shannon to Pilot. Steer 260 degrees
and climb to 30,000 feet.

440
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:06,540
Use full power.

441
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:09,322
I wanna ask you something first.
(OVER RADIO). Go ahead

442
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,428
Is this a collision course I'm flying?

443
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,118
JIM: Yes. Haven't you
ever flown one? Yes.

444
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:18,660
But for a dry run in stuff like this, well,
at jet speed, I think it's too dangerous.

445
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:21,764
Get on course. Let the fighter
control do the worrying.

446
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:24,288
Why should they worry,
sitting on the ground?

447
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:27,044
If you've got cold feet, I'll be glad
to take over the controls.

448
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,534
No, thanks.
I'll feel safer doing it myself.

449
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,667
Then get on the course and
get off the air. I'm on it.

450
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:45,667
<i>MAN 1: It's okay now.
MAN 2: Yeah, he's right on the button.</i>

451
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,587
We'd better warn Shannon.

452
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,856
He should pick it up
on his scope pretty quick.

453
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:53,436
In exactly 35 seconds.

454
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:56,441
Red Dog to Shannon.
Go ahead, Red Dog.

455
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:58,719
Watch your scope
very closely now.

456
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:00,641
You should be able
to blossom any second.

457
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:04,121
Shannon to Red Dog. Okay.

458
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,801
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.

459
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:14,425
Target contacted.

460
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:18,263
Ah! Only a fifth of a second off.

461
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:20,439
I'll have to give you some homework.

462
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,193
Roger, Shannon.
Understand you have target.

463
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:25,879
It's all yours.
Red Dog listening. Out.

464
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,337
Shannon to Pilot.
We're on our own now.

465
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:32,852
The B-36 is a little to our left
about seven miles ahead of us.

466
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:36,305
<i>Turn left 10 degrees.
Range. Six and a half miles.</i>

467
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:38,583
Increase speed 3-0 miles.

468
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,171
ANNA:
Right.

469
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:50,261
Now, watch your scope and tell me when you
see a pip on it. That is your target.

470
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,114
<i>ANNA:
I see one.</i>

471
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:01,906
No-Yes, yes, I see it!

472
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:04,428
JIM: Now center it on your
crosshairs and hold it there.

473
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:07,697
When the image spreads to those other
lines, you're in range to shoot.

474
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,580
<i>The image has now reached the outer lines.
How should I attack? Astern?</i>

475
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:17,295
JIM: No, no. From astern, they'd
shoot you down. Pull up parallel.

476
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:21,256
<i>MAN:
Hey, Paul, take a look at this, will you?</i>

477
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:27,183
I think 4-7-9's getting
a little too close for comfort.

478
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:30,216
<i>PAUL:
Yeah! Red Dog to Shannon.</i>

479
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,354
<i>What are you doing? You're supposed
to intercept, not coincide.</i>

480
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,463
JIM: Drop your dive brakes.
You're right on top of it!

481
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,568
ANNA: I saw it. JIM: Then
why don't you break it off?

482
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:41,288
Well, why should I?
I was watching it on my scope.

483
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,379
The pips have coincided.
I hope they haven't.

484
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:49,543
Boy, if they haven't,
they must be riding piggyback.

485
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,273
Now look. They're separated again.

486
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:01,957
I hope those aren't just pieces of them.
No, they'd be off there by now.

487
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,287
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.

488
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:08,996
I'm sitting on the wing off that B-36.
Any further instructions?

489
00:37:09,064 --> 00:37:13,319
Red Dog to Shannon. Brother, you
had us sittin' on something too.

490
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:17,125
Steer 2-3-0 degrees for base.
Listening out.

491
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,611
JIM:
Ah, roger.

492
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:22,882
Shannon to Target.
Good night, mama.

493
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,054
You look pretty good in there.

494
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:29,085
MAN: Good night, baby. You did
quite a bit of lookin' yourself.

495
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:39,449
How do you like it?
Like what?

496
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:43,961
Our night interception routine.
Oh, you Americans.

497
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,888
What's the matter with us?

498
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:48,636
You are utterly antagonistic to any
form of regimentation on the ground,

499
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:51,573
but in the air, you accept it
in the most abject manner.

500
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,687
Well, you've got to admit
it works pretty good.

501
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:57,817
Well, that's what puzzles me.
I can't understand it.

502
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:00,090
What'll you give me if I tell ya?

503
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:03,506
Give you?
What do you want?

504
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,653
Is this too much?

505
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:11,541
That's a habit with you.
What?

506
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:13,521
Trying to get something for nothing.

507
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:17,424
I believe in looking at
merchandise before I pay for it.

508
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:20,465
So do I. I'd really like to
know about these maneuvers.

509
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:23,319
These, or those?

510
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,589
Those.

511
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:29,202
Well, I warn ya, I won't come through
unless you improve on that last sample.

512
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,699
Very well.

513
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,921
How was that?
Very much better.

514
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:02,027
Why?
It was a perfect example of teamwork.

515
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:05,358
Just apply it to that interception routine,
and you've got the answer.

516
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,279
Teamwork?

517
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,384
Everybody works together.

518
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:12,390
Like the first time I kissed ya,
you didn't do your part.

519
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:15,364
So we didn't get anywhere.
In other words,

520
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,699
you believe the individual
must sacrifice his personal feelings...

521
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:21,285
and work with somebody else
for the benefit of the whole enterprise?

522
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:23,778
That's right. Mass production.
I see.

523
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,707
The idea's purely capitalistic.

524
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:29,067
No wonder every loyal Russian
instinctively rejects it.

525
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,651
I give up. Come on.

526
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:35,039
Get in, you silly Siberian cupcake.

527
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,961
Cupcake? What does that mean?

528
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,894
If the P.X. Is still open,
I'll buy you a couple.

529
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:43,554
First, it's baloney.
Then it's stuffed birds.

530
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,631
And now, it's cupcake.

531
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,085
ANNA:
Why are you letting down?

532
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:57,598
Well, Washington said you could go
where you want and see what you like.

533
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,579
And this, I think, you'll like.

534
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:03,362
Hello, Palm Springs Tower.
This is Air ForceJet 1-9-0.

535
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:06,777
This is Palm Springs Tower.
Go ahead, 1 -Niner-0.

536
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:11,042
JIM: Ten miles west. Request landing
instructions for two F-86's.

537
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:14,140
Roger, 1 -Niner-0.
Runway 2-4.

538
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,120
Wind: Northwest 1-4.

539
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:19,510
Altimeter: Two-niner-niner-seven.
Call on initial.

540
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,040
JIM:
Ah, roger.

541
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:29,918
ANNA:
Hey, what was that?

542
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:32,154
JIM:
I'll show you sometime.

543
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:57,363
Capitalism has certain
dangerous advantages.

544
00:40:57,433 --> 00:41:00,815
That's one thing we have in common
with the Soviet. What's that?

545
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:04,304
We both believe in uplifting
the, uh, masses.

546
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:06,896
Yes, but that's not true in
all instances. Of course.

547
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:09,782
There are some who don't require.

548
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:19,978
So that's the shape you're in.
Freddie!

549
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:25,105
Was he making fun of me?
On the contrary.

550
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:27,473
He was paying you
the highest compliment in his power.

551
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,394
You mean, he liked me?

552
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,422
That's strange.
By Russian standards of beauty,

553
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,792
I'm considered only fair.

554
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,760
They prefer a more robust type.
Mm-hmm.

555
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,516
The more, the merrier.

556
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,439
Then you agree with my countrymen?

557
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,838
No, I can't say that I do.

558
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:49,318
I'm very much interested in your
point of view, so please, be frank.

559
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:51,976
Tell me exactly what you think.
I can't.

560
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:56,518
Why not?
I haven't sufficient flow of speech.

561
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:59,174
Well, that sounds very nice.

562
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:01,154
Is it?

563
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:04,937
Well, it's, uh,
the best I can do at the moment.

564
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:07,938
In other words,
I'm attractive to you...

565
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:09,898
in every way except politically?

566
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:15,297
That's about it.
I hate your insides, and vice versa.

567
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,630
Which is more important to you?
It's a toss-up.

568
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:23,398
Can't make up my mind.

569
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:25,951
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why?

570
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,020
'Cause I feel exactly
the same way about you.

571
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:34,559
You do?
That's why I spoke to you about it.

572
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,819
Have you any solution? The more I
think about it, the worse it gets.

573
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,001
I have the same trouble.
One minute I wanna kill you,

574
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:48,028
and the next minute
I want to kiss you and...

575
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,711
kiss you and...
kiss you.

576
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,909
Same here.
What are we gonna do about it?

577
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:57,213
I don't know.
I've never met anyone before...

578
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,550
who aroused and revolted me
in the same proportion.

579
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:02,137
I'm very confused.
Something else I can do for you?

580
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,629
Maybe you could advise us.
What would you do if you knew a man...

581
00:43:04,704 --> 00:43:06,613
Try this on, Lieutenant.

582
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:11,291
What is the price of this coverall
and golden heliotrope?

583
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:20,668
This hat is perfectly silly,
and I adore it.

584
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:22,805
I wish you'd have bought the red one.
I liked it better.

585
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:26,585
I like this one. Well, you're wearing
it too far back on your head.

586
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:29,847
That's the way I like it.
Which one is my bedroom?

587
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:31,824
Take your pick.

588
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:41,134
(SQUEALS)

589
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:48,781
They're both exactly the same.
I like this one.

590
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:50,894
But, uh...
But what?

591
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:52,853
Who's gonna use this room?

592
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:55,022
Both of us.

593
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,948
Really?

594
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:59,500
Accommodations in Palm Springs
are very scarce.

595
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:03,150
This is all they had.
Anyway, I'm responsible for you.

596
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,773
Well, naturally,
but I was thinking about the waste.

597
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,785
What waste?
All this lovely space.

598
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,746
In Russia, they'd put at least
three families in it.

599
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,250
Four by dividing the room with a curtain.
Two on that side, two on this side.

600
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:18,505
Well, why don't you build
more houses?

601
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,649
Jets and bombers
are more important just now.

602
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,575
I agree with you.
You do?

603
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,334
What's the use of building
houses if somebody's

604
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:25,738
gonna blow 'em off the map?
Of course.

605
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:29,865
We go right on spending billions for
housing, and only millions for planes.

606
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:34,440
It's awful.
I think you're absolutely right.

607
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:40,545
But, uh...

608
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:47,209
But, uh...

609
00:44:47,274 --> 00:44:50,590
But...

610
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:56,704
But what?

611
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,551
You realize that you and I are
of the same mind about this matter?

612
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:05,154
Say, that's right.

613
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:07,295
What's got into us?

614
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,669
<i>(KNOCKING)</i>

615
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,536
<i>(KNOCKING CONTINUES)</i>

616
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:28,186
Shannon!

617
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,975
Oh, it's you. What are you trying to do,
break down the door?

618
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,376
Well, I didn't think you were in.
Well, then what'd you knock for?

619
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:35,863
Well, I...
Oh, hello, Georgie.

620
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:39,002
Jim. How be ya?
Fine. Uh...

621
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:43,000
Anna, this is
Major Rexford's wife, Georgie.

622
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,461
What are you doin' here?
You told me to give

623
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,773
the boys a couple of
days off, didn't you?

624
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,108
<i>(BIG BAND)</i>

625
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,890
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

626
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:02,265
What's that? That smile of yours.
Where have you been keeping it?

627
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:05,179
I'm happy tonight.

628
00:46:05,243 --> 00:46:09,715
Why don't you look where you're going? I
haven't got eyes on the back of my head.

629
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:16,111
Major Rexford and his wife
dance very well together, don't they?

630
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:19,922
I wish I could say the same for us.

631
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:23,123
What am I doing that's wrong?
You're holding me too tight.

632
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:28,555
Too tight?
I can hardly breathe.

633
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,590
You're not serious?
I was never more serious in my life.

634
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:40,465
Is that better?
What do you think?

635
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,538
I think it's divine.

636
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:46,762
What's your first name?

637
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:48,744
Jim.

638
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:54,661
Jim and Anna.

639
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,646
Anna and Jim.

640
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:15,051
Are you married?

641
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,194
That's good.

642
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,129
Are you?

643
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,049
Ever been in love?

644
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:34,244
Not in your sense of the word.

645
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,451
Oh.

646
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,237
So you feel about love...

647
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:42,271
the same way you feel about religion?

648
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:45,507
That's right.
Both are dangerous narcotics.

649
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:48,160
They make individuals forget
their duty to the state.

650
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,237
How's that?

651
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:53,211
Well, under the influence
of love or religion,

652
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:56,546
individuals are unable to sacrifice
one another for the national good.

653
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:59,197
Now, isn't that just too bad?

654
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:01,755
Why?

655
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:05,081
You were made for it.

656
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,366
Made for what?
Love.

657
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:14,360
I don't see the connection.

658
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:23,226
Why do you suppose
you're so beautiful?

659
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:27,931
Purely a biological fallacy which makes
our necessities appear pleasurable to us,

660
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:29,852
like eating, drinking...

661
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:33,528
Then you do admit
that love is a necessity.

662
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:36,443
I admit that passion is.

663
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,745
What's the difference?

664
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:42,864
Well, it's pretty hard to explain.

665
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:45,881
Why?

666
00:48:48,154 --> 00:48:50,739
I haven't sufficient flow of speech.

667
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:55,409
Have you had many of them?

668
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,138
Many what?

669
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,494
Women?

670
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:04,693
Well, I don't know.

671
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:12,527
These girls, were they
as beautiful to you as I am?

672
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:15,795
No.

673
00:49:17,716 --> 00:49:19,570
Not one?

674
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:22,984
Not lately.

675
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:27,082
<i>Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.</i>

676
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:28,976
What about you?

677
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:34,278
I'm not ignorant of passion, but I've never
had such a feeling for a man before.

678
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:37,483
I've never been so stirred by a kiss.
I can't even stop thinking about it.

679
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:41,419
You're not the only one.

680
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:46,188
We, uh, can't do it here,
of course.

681
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:49,003
No.
But it won't hurt to talk about it.

682
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,549
No.
It's almost as nice.

683
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,475
Well, go ahead.

684
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:59,620
Do you close your eyes
when you do it?

685
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:01,666
Don't you?

686
00:50:01,738 --> 00:50:04,291
Well, you know what it means
when you don't?

687
00:50:04,362 --> 00:50:07,012
You're thinking of someone else.

688
00:50:08,394 --> 00:50:10,532
What kind do you like best?

689
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,949
The slow, sweet ones like this?

690
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:15,933
<i>(SIZZLING)</i>

691
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,626
Have you ever smelled
anything more divine?

692
00:50:25,702 --> 00:50:28,287
Well, we're gonna have one
just like it in a few minutes.

693
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:31,390
Isn't this it? You mean they have
more than one like this? Sure.

694
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,915
That's all they serve here.

695
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:39,672
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?

696
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:41,787
We're lost.
Who's lost?

697
00:50:41,858 --> 00:50:46,560
How can Russia compete
with such propaganda?

698
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,527
Good night. I had such a lovely time.
So did we.

699
00:50:51,073 --> 00:50:52,927
See you tomorrow, Rex.
Oh, no, you won't.

700
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:54,847
Why not? We've gotta
drive back to the field.

701
00:50:54,912 --> 00:50:56,767
What's the rush?
We couldn't find a room.

702
00:50:56,832 --> 00:50:58,773
The town's jammed.
Oh, that's too bad.

703
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,116
What about our sitting room?
Well, what about it?

704
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,549
Why couldn't they use that?
Oh, we wouldn't wanna bother you.

705
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:07,127
I should say not. Bother? Why would
it bother us? The room is empty.

706
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,986
And the couch is one of
those wonderful American

707
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:10,546
inventions that can
be turned into a bed.

708
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:13,468
Isn't it, Jim?
Yeah. Come on.

709
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:22,223
Sorry, folks. We haven't got a thing.
All filled up. Not a place I could put you.

710
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:24,437
Well, looks like
we have to go back to I.A.

711
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:28,302
But, honey, I'm just dead.
Let's try someplace else, huh?

712
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:31,988
This is Major Rexford and his wife.
They're gonna use my sitting room tonight.

713
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,943
Care to register, Major?
With pleasure.

714
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,269
What's your name?
Oh. Mary Lou Simpson.

715
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,986
Are you married?
Why, yes!

716
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,370
Jim? Jim,
this is Mr. And Mrs. Simpson.

717
00:51:43,446 --> 00:51:45,301
How do you do?
They can use my room.

718
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:47,220
Huh?
Go on and register.

719
00:51:47,285 --> 00:51:51,147
Well, wait a minute.
Where are you gonna sleep?

720
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,522
Well, there are two beds in your
room, aren't there? Yes, but...

721
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:56,009
You can't sleep in both of them.
Well, I know, but...

722
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:58,257
Don't worry. I'm used to it.
Nobody in Russia

723
00:51:58,272 --> 00:52:00,174
has any privacy. But
how are you gonna...

724
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:03,690
It's very simple.
I merely undress in the bathroom.

725
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,342
Haven't you got that bed fixed yet?

726
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,291
Look, honey. This is the swellest
nightgown I've ever seen.

727
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,596
<i>Just as light as a spider's web.</i>

728
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:23,371
Jim picked it out for me. Honey,
the colonel picked it out for her.

729
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:32,011
Well, what are you
looking at me for?

730
00:52:32,076 --> 00:52:34,825
She asked me which one I felt was the
nicest, and I told her. That's all.

731
00:52:34,892 --> 00:52:37,347
Jim, I understand perfectly.
So do I.

732
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,266
I do too. Well, who asked you?
Let's get this thing fixed.

733
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,916
That's easy.
I've handled beds like this before.

734
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:44,960
<i>Here we go again.
(PHONE RINGING)</i>

735
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,304
Hello? Who is this?

736
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,295
Oh, hello, General.
Yes, she's here.

737
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:00,453
What did you say, sir?

738
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:03,365
Yes, sir. I understand.

739
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,423
It's, uh, five after 3:00.
We'll leave right away.

740
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:09,947
Yes, sir. Good-bye, sir.

741
00:53:12,516 --> 00:53:15,745
Looks like you're gonna have a bedroom to
yourself after all. Well, what happened?

742
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:19,127
I gotta take Anna back to Palmer Field.
Something wrong?

743
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:22,169
I'll say.
They're gonna deport her.

744
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:45,210
"A" For Anna
calling "S" For Shannon.

745
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,755
Go ahead, Anna.

746
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,576
I guess this is the last time
we'll be flying together.

747
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,575
I was just thinking the same thing.

748
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:22,740
I thought Palmer Field was that way.

749
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:26,667
SHANNON: It still is. Then why
did you change your course?

750
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,391
I think you'd be better off
if we go this way.

751
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:33,966
What are you going to do? I'm not
gonna talk about it on the air.

752
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,752
I thought Palm Springs was hot,
but this place is simply fantastic.

753
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:48,494
Yuma's always like this. It won't be bad
after the air conditioning gets to work.

754
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:51,495
You think that clerk'll be able
to locate the justice of peace?

755
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:54,153
Sure. The judge gives 24-hour service.

756
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,321
So does the license clerk. You folks
are as good as married right now.

757
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:01,645
Here ya are. That's all right, sir.
I'm an old air-force man myself.

758
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:07,398
Is that why you brought me here?
To get married?

759
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:11,242
Well, they can't deport
the wife of an American citizen.

760
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:14,470
But you'll get into trouble
if you marry me.

761
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:16,448
Sure, I will.

762
00:55:18,602 --> 00:55:20,675
Plenty of trouble.

763
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:30,564
Wait'll I take a shower, Jim.
I'm soaking wet.

764
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:32,541
So am I.

765
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:37,597
What will they do to you?
I don't know.

766
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:41,597
Probably kick me out of the service.
Is that all?

767
00:55:41,669 --> 00:55:43,971
Isn't that enough?

768
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:47,648
You love your air force
a great deal, don't you, Jim?

769
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:49,659
Well, I've been in it
quite a while, you know.

770
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:52,153
Then why are you doing this?
Wouldn't you do the same for me?

771
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,754
No.
You wouldn't?

772
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,769
Of course not.

773
00:56:07,328 --> 00:56:10,939
ANNA: Was that better?
You're still going too high.

774
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,916
Watch this.

775
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,679
ANNA:
I see.

776
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,034
ANNA:
How was that?

777
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,433
SHANNON:
Well, now you got it!

778
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:55,308
SHANNON: Hello, Palmer Tower,
this is 1-9-0 on base leg.

779
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:57,237
Gear down and in the green.

780
00:56:57,302 --> 00:57:00,051
<i>(MAN OVER RADIO) Roger, 1-Niner-0.
This is Palmer Tower.</i>

781
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,986
<i>You are number one to land.
I have a message for you.</i>

782
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:04,915
SHANNON:
Go ahead.

783
00:57:04,981 --> 00:57:08,275
<i>General Black requests that
you report to his office at once.</i>

784
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,642
Ah, roger.

785
00:57:17,362 --> 00:57:20,973
Yesterday morning at 3:00, I told you to
start back here immediately! Yes, sir.

786
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,081
You're just about 30 hours overdue.
Yes, sir.

787
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:25,541
Where have you been all this time? I've
been looking all over the country for you!

788
00:57:25,617 --> 00:57:28,072
Yuma, sir. Yuma? What
did you go there for?

789
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,118
To get married.
Married?

790
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:32,330
You married that Russian girl?
That's right.

791
00:57:32,399 --> 00:57:34,667
You married that girl after I told you
she was gonna be deported?

792
00:57:34,735 --> 00:57:37,254
Yes, sir.
That's why I did it.

793
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,642
Will that make any difference? Not
after two or three years of red tape.

794
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:44,427
An alien cannot be deported if it works
a hardship on an American citizen.

795
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:46,166
Jim Shannon, do you realize
you've cooked your

796
00:57:46,181 --> 00:57:47,940
whole career just to get
this girl out of a jam?

797
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:51,557
Yes, sir, I thought about that.
I've been thinking a lot about it.

798
00:57:51,628 --> 00:57:53,383
Apparently, you're in love with her.

799
00:57:53,451 --> 00:57:55,872
What else does it look like?

800
00:57:55,946 --> 00:57:58,084
Well, I'm sorry, Jim,
very sorry,

801
00:57:58,153 --> 00:58:00,225
but I think I've got
a pretty fast cure for it.

802
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:02,369
Cure? I don't know
that I wanna be cured.

803
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:04,929
As your wife, she can't
be deported for some time.

804
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:07,204
That part you've accomplished.
But that's only peanuts.

805
00:58:07,272 --> 00:58:10,206
Now I'll tell you the real jam you're in.
You're married to a Soviet agent.

806
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:13,824
Yes, sir, one of their best.
What?

807
00:58:13,895 --> 00:58:17,920
I understand she drove
the British Intelligence absolutely nuts.

808
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,161
Mister, you'll have to prove this to me.

809
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,268
That I think I can do.

810
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:30,875
MAN: Hello? ANNA: Hello.

811
00:58:30,947 --> 00:58:34,263
I'm calling Alhambra-93434.

812
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:37,240
<i>MAN:
I'm sorry. This is Alhambra-92424.</i>

813
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:40,248
You have the wrong number.
That's their recognition signal.

814
00:58:40,322 --> 00:58:42,558
<i>ANNA:
This is Olga.</i>

815
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,828

816
00:59:31,254 --> 00:59:33,971
Jim.

817
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:36,209
Was it bad?

818
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:38,830
Yeah.
Was it worse than you thought?

819
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:42,829
Yeah.
What are they going to do to you?

820
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:45,071
I don't know yet.

821
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,922
They haven't decided.

822
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:51,980
Well, that's terrible.
I know what it is to wait.

823
00:59:58,322 --> 01:00:00,361
MAN: Hello? ANNA: Hello.

824
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:04,556
I'm calling Alhambra-93434.
I'm sorry.

825
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:06,729
This is Alhambra-92424.

826
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,483
<i>You have the wrong number.
This is Olga.</i>

827
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:12,747
<i>When did you arrive?
On the morning of the 11 th.</i>

828
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:15,596
<i>How much fuel did you have left?
Practically none.</i>

829
01:00:15,661 --> 01:00:18,760
<i>Haven't you anything more to tell me?
Yes, but I have no time now.</i>

830
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,684
<i>Where are you talking from?</i>

831
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:24,196
<i>Apay telephone in the ladies'room
of a nightclub in Palm Springs.</i>

832
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:27,683
<i>I will mail the rest of my report.
Good-bye.</i>

833
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:34,089
Hello, Olga.

834
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:41,759
Will you listen to me a minute, Jim?
What for?

835
01:00:41,832 --> 01:00:43,741
Jim!

836
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Jim.
Jim and Anna.

837
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:50,143
Anna and Jim.

838
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:52,156
What are you going to do to me?
I don't know.

839
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,880
Things are flying around in my head
like feathers in a bag.

840
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,470
Are you going to kill me?
I don't know.

841
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,929
Whatever happens, I wish you'd
remember one thing. What's that?

842
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:02,394
I've hated myself for doing this to you.
You mean you hated being a spy?

843
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:04,541
I'm not ashamed of that.
Then what are you talkin' about?

844
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:06,618
Marrying you.
I tried to keep you from doing it.

845
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:09,309
Is that all that's worrying you?
Yes.

846
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:11,834
Well, I got somethin'
that's bothering me a lot more.

847
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:14,426
What is it?

848
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:16,865
I'm still in love with you.

849
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:20,086
Oh, Jim.

850
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,397
Then this hasn't changed everything.

851
01:01:22,464 --> 01:01:25,693
Afraid it hasn't changed anything.

852
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,410
Oh, Jim.

853
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,388
You're divine.

854
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:35,355
<i>(BIG BAND)</i>

855
01:01:37,213 --> 01:01:39,668
Oh, why didn't you think of this before?

856
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:42,774
I've been a little busy
the last few days.

857
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:46,292
Let's catch another drink.
By all means.

858
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:52,882
Shall we eat something?
Why, are you hungry?

859
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:55,855
Not particularly. But I always heard
that condemned criminals...

860
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:58,295
eat a hearty meal
the night before they're hanged.

861
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:00,662
Yeah, but there's no bar
at the jail.

862
01:02:00,728 --> 01:02:02,610
If they could have all
they want to drink, I'll

863
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,404
bet they wouldn't worry
much about the food.

864
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,959
What'll we have?
Go for some more champagne?

865
01:02:07,031 --> 01:02:10,347
Mmm! Like we did last night?
Yeah.

866
01:02:10,423 --> 01:02:12,495
That was fabulous.

867
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:20,116
But I had the most terrible dream.
You did?

868
01:02:21,748 --> 01:02:24,464
I dreamt I lost my beautiful...

869
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:29,489
Hello, Charlie. Haven't seen you
for a week or two, Colonel.

870
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:32,172
Where have you been? We've been
doing our drinking at home.

871
01:02:32,242 --> 01:02:35,537
Two Tom Collins. And instead of
club soda, make it champagne.

872
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:37,456
Oh, no wonder you stayed home.

873
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,966
That was no dream.

874
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,949
It wasn't?

875
01:02:44,912 --> 01:02:46,886
Didn't I have it on when I woke up?

876
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:51,114
When I came to, all you had on
was... my bathrobe.

877
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:53,997
Oh, yes.

878
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:58,499
I put that on for the milkman.

879
01:02:58,572 --> 01:03:00,808
Now, let's see.

880
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,851
When was the last time I wore it?

881
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,592
I seem to remember taking it out
of a hatbox.

882
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:18,721
Say, that was in Yuma.

883
01:03:20,776 --> 01:03:23,263
Mmm, Yuma.

884
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:27,201
I know where it is.

885
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,596
Where are you going?

886
01:03:34,661 --> 01:03:36,636
I washed it when we got back here, and it's
been hanging out on the line ever since...

887
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,563
along with the rest
of my nice underwear.

888
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:41,726
Oh, if anybody's taken it
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna bother it.

889
01:03:41,796 --> 01:03:43,738
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.

890
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:46,331
And what's the difference?
I can always buy you another one.

891
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:48,258
Mmm.

892
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:50,657
Not like this one.

893
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:52,925
Does it mean that much to you?

894
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:55,229
<i>(ENDS)
(APPLAUSE)</i>

895
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,185
Hello, Jim.
Oh.

896
01:03:57,249 --> 01:03:59,998
Well, everything seems to be okay
with you two. How can you tell?

897
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:03,958
The light in the lady's eyes. The light
that was never seen on land or sea.

898
01:04:04,032 --> 01:04:06,781
When did you get back?
Just a little while ago.

899
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,945
You're wanted on the phone.

900
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:12,948
Honest? Just heard 'em
paging you in the lounge.

901
01:04:13,022 --> 01:04:15,476
I'll be right back.
Will you stay with Anna?

902
01:04:15,549 --> 01:04:17,404
Certainly.

903
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,497
Please hurry.

904
01:04:22,843 --> 01:04:26,039
Do you have a call for me, Henry?
Yes, sir.

905
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:28,212
You can take it in the office.

906
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,384
Well, Jim.
General.

907
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:37,304
We got our okay from Washington.
Swell.

908
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,823
But I don't like this business.
I never have. Why?

909
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:42,035
I don't want you
to stick your neck in a noose.

910
01:04:42,104 --> 01:04:44,327
Oh, I'll be all right. I
don't see how anything

911
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,674
can go wrong the way we've
got things worked out.

912
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:48,433
Maybe.

913
01:04:48,502 --> 01:04:51,120
But I want you to know, if you have any
doubts, it isn't too late to say so.

914
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,484
Do you understand? That's why
I didn't bring Rivers and Sinclair along.

915
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:57,549
You can back out right now.
I'll take the bump. Be glad to.

916
01:04:57,621 --> 01:04:59,987
Thanks, General,
but I wouldn't miss this for anything.

917
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:02,986
No kidding.
So long, sir.

918
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:05,360
Thanks, Rex.
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

919
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:07,630
I don't mind babysitting
this kind of a baby.

920
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:09,738
Any news?

921
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:12,809
Yeah.

922
01:05:12,882 --> 01:05:15,369
See ya later.
Okay.

923
01:05:15,441 --> 01:05:17,295
Is this it?

924
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,749
Have they finally decided
what they're going to do to us?

925
01:05:19,824 --> 01:05:22,344
Yes.
What about you?

926
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:25,317
They're gonna let me off
with a reprimand.

927
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,619
Is that all?
Oh, that's fantastic.

928
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,922
They don't suspect you
of any complicity?

929
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:32,876
Why should they?

930
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:35,624
This is really an amazing country.

931
01:05:35,693 --> 01:05:37,547
Do you know what
they'd do to you in Russia?

932
01:05:37,612 --> 01:05:39,652
They'd either shoot you
or send you to the uranium mines.

933
01:05:39,724 --> 01:05:42,276
Oh, Jim, I'm so happy for you.

934
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:50,376
All right. Tell me.

935
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:53,059
As good as it is for me,
it's that bad for you.

936
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:55,016
Go on.

937
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,284
Looks like 15 years
in the penitentiary...

938
01:05:57,352 --> 01:05:59,391
the way they're tightening up
on you commies.

939
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:02,082
Five years. That's the worst they
can do to me, and a $10,000 fine.

940
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:05,631
Put 10 years on top of that
for transmitting stolen information...

941
01:06:05,703 --> 01:06:07,557
and another $10,000 fine.

942
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:12,356
Why? Well, they got that
report you tried to send out.

943
01:06:12,421 --> 01:06:14,625
Fifteen years?

944
01:06:15,717 --> 01:06:17,724
I'll be an old woman
by the time I get out.

945
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:23,385
What about us?
Where will you be?

946
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:25,434
I was thinking the same thing.

947
01:06:25,507 --> 01:06:28,026
I've never had too much fear of death,

948
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:32,407
but somehow this seems
more frightening.

949
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:34,553
Fifteen years!

950
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:36,447
I wouldn't expect you
to wait that long.

951
01:06:36,512 --> 01:06:38,367
It wouldn't do any good if I did.

952
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:41,017
They'll deport you
when you've done your time.

953
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:45,461
When are they going to arrest me?
I don't know.

954
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:49,364
Maybe not till after the dance.
It usually breaks up around 2:00 or 3:00.

955
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:52,306
Five hours.

956
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:55,515
That's a long time.

957
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:59,698
You gonna try and make a break for it?
Do you think there's a chance?

958
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:01,943
Well, there's only two of those men
from the F.B.I.

959
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:05,207
One of'em's probably out in front,
and one out in back.

960
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:07,696
Now, the ladies' room
is on the east side.

961
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,519
If you were to drop out a window...
It's no use.

962
01:07:10,586 --> 01:07:13,520
I couldn't get out of this field. It's
too well-guarded. How do you know?

963
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:17,269
I tried it night before last
after you were asleep.

964
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:22,223
Well, how'd you get by those F.B.I. Men
that were planted around our house?

965
01:07:22,295 --> 01:07:25,742
I've had a lot of experience
in that sort of work.

966
01:07:25,814 --> 01:07:31,279
And the only way you can get out of
this field is to have a gate pass.

967
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:33,259
I'm thinking of an easier way.

968
01:07:33,332 --> 01:07:35,753
What's that?
I could take you out by plane.

969
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:39,144
Are you insane?
Haven't I got you in enough trouble?

970
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,903
I won't get in any trouble over this.
Why not?

971
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:46,574
If we leave now, we'll probably be in
Siberia before this dance breaks up.

972
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:48,398
Siberia?

973
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:51,694
Let's go on in and finish our drinks.

974
01:08:04,878 --> 01:08:07,463
First call for French 75's
I've had in a long time.

975
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:10,118
They're all right
if you like a direct hit.

976
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:14,566
Well, here's one for the road.

977
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,601
Are you serious?

978
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:20,522
What else could I do?

979
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:24,481
I don't think I'd be very happy
without you.

980
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:36,476
They have anything like this
in Russia?

981
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:39,421
We can get the champagne.
I don't know about the gin.

982
01:08:39,496 --> 01:08:41,666
I can make 'em with vodka.

983
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:42,830
Are they as good?

984
01:08:42,845 --> 01:08:45,825
All right if you don't
mind the Russian breath.

985
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:47,650
What's that?

986
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:50,205
Knocks everything over within 15 feet.

987
01:08:50,277 --> 01:08:53,244
(LAUGHS, COUGHING)

988
01:08:57,828 --> 01:08:59,900
<i>(BIG BAND RESUMES)</i>

989
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:30,993
(ENGINE POWERING UP)

990
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:00,620
Where ya been?
I went back to the house.

991
01:10:00,694 --> 01:10:02,636
Back to the house?
What for?

992
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,011
You think I'm gonna go back
to Russia without that nightgown?

993
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:06,986
Oh!

994
01:10:32,497 --> 01:10:35,529
Well, he's off.

995
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:38,981
Godspeed.
Amen.

996
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:52,932
What is it, Sergeant? Oh, sir.
I'm worried about this F-94.

997
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:55,074
Number 479. It took off
from here about a half

998
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:56,997
hour ago. Colonel Shannon?
What about him?

999
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,066
<i>Well, it looks like he's heading
for Siberia instead of Palmer Field.</i>

1000
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,025
Siberia?

1001
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:10,405
Hello, Air ForceJet 479.
This is Fighter Control.

1002
01:11:10,473 --> 01:11:12,861
Fighter Control calling
Colonel Shannon in 479.

1003
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,830
This is Colonel Shannon in 479.
Go ahead, Freddie.

1004
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:19,074
Colonel Shannon,
do you know where you're going?

1005
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:21,891
According to our radar,
you're headed west over the Bering Sea.

1006
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:24,162
Yes, I know where I'm going.

1007
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,986
So long, Freddie.

1008
01:11:28,293 --> 01:11:30,780
He says he knows where he's going.

1009
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,891
Did you hear that, Anna?

1010
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:35,168
Looks like the soup has hit the fan.

1011
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:37,756
I'm surprised we got this far
before they found out.

1012
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:41,022
Every jet outfit in Alaska
is probably scrambling to head us off.

1013
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:45,562
ANNA: They'll never catch us. I'm
more afraid of our jets. Why?

1014
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:48,218
You better stop dropping down a little.
What for?

1015
01:11:48,288 --> 01:11:50,415
At this altitude, you'll
be showing up on the

1016
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,478
Soviet radar net in
less than five minutes.

1017
01:11:52,544 --> 01:11:56,285
What about it? Your radio
transmitter's on the wrong frequency.

1018
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:58,326
So I can't identify myself
if they intercept us.

1019
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,620
They won't shoot if we lower our
landing gear. Oh, yes, they will.

1020
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:05,205
Okay, I'll go down on the deck.

1021
01:12:43,574 --> 01:12:45,744
I have one of my own.

1022
01:12:45,813 --> 01:12:49,129
What am I saying?
Refusing an American cigarette.

1023
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,121
Why did you let him
destroy that plane?

1024
01:12:55,187 --> 01:12:56,937
If he hadn't, our fighter
and the flak would.

1025
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:58,448
Why didn't you shoot
our fighter down?

1026
01:12:58,514 --> 01:13:02,474
I told Shannon to, but he said
he didn't come over here to start a war.

1027
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,065
War? What war?
That's idiotic.

1028
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:08,136
Why didn't you shoot Shannon? I didn't
have anything to shoot him with.

1029
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:11,819
Nonsense. You have been taught
to kill without weapons.

1030
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,156
I thought of that.
Then why didn't you do it?

1031
01:13:15,887 --> 01:13:20,109
I couldn't make up my mind at the moment
which was the most valuable to us...

1032
01:13:20,174 --> 01:13:22,028
the plane or my husband.

1033
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:24,362
Is that why you decided in his favor?

1034
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:28,454
No. He's one of the best jet men
in the United States.

1035
01:13:28,524 --> 01:13:30,564
You couldn't ask
for a better encyclopedia.

1036
01:13:30,636 --> 01:13:32,872
And you're one of the best in this country,

1037
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,623
and I cannot believe the Americans
got much information out of you.

1038
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:38,724
Of course not.
But this is different.

1039
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:41,663
Why?
The man's in love with me.

1040
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:43,745
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

1041
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:46,948
You believe he's completely
under your domination?

1042
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,845
Haven't I proved that?

1043
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,051
Vassily, I am glad to see you again.

1044
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,006
This is my husband,
Colonel Shannon,

1045
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:58,045
late of the United States Air Force.

1046
01:13:58,118 --> 01:14:00,667
Colonel Shannon, it's a rare
privilege to welcome an American

1047
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:02,874
Air Force officer to the
Soviet Union, however late.

1048
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,916
You're the first, but I hope
you will not be the last.

1049
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,963
I hope so too.

1050
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,389
And I salute your courage...
and your judgment.

1051
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:18,589
It's quite a story.
Would you like to hear it?

1052
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,724
No, no, I've heard all about it.

1053
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:26,016
My interest in you
is going to be purely technical.

1054
01:14:29,088 --> 01:14:32,382
<i>(BUZZER SOUNDS)</i>

1055
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:35,578
You've had a long day's travel.
You must be a little tired.

1056
01:14:35,646 --> 01:14:38,679
I haven't been getting
much rest lately.

1057
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:42,715
Show this gentleman to his quarters.

1058
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,664
I'll call on you tomorrow
around 10:00.

1059
01:14:48,732 --> 01:14:50,641
Okay, sir.

1060
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:00,888
Well, go ahead.
After you, sir.

1061
01:15:00,953 --> 01:15:02,808
Go on!
You go first.

1062
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,727
We insist. What's the
matter with these guys?

1063
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,413
Well, they were told to follow us.
How can

1064
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:08,141
they follow us if you
tell them to go ahead?

1065
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,605
Oh.

1066
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,534
Pardon me.

1067
01:15:19,318 --> 01:15:21,236
Why are they following us?
I'm afraid your

1068
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,408
movements here will be
more or less restricted.

1069
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,324
Maria.
Olga.

1070
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:31,665
Who was that? Don't you remember
that famous woman sniper?

1071
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:34,665
The one who killed over a hundred Germans?
That's her.

1072
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,073
Well, is that the way
you reward your heroes?

1073
01:15:37,138 --> 01:15:41,512
Well, the trip she made to the States had
rather a strange affect on her. It did?

1074
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:44,302
When she came back,
she started shooting at Russians.

1075
01:15:48,368 --> 01:15:50,986
Right in there, sir.
The door is unlocked.

1076
01:15:51,983 --> 01:15:55,299
Not quite as nice as your place
in Palmer Field.

1077
01:15:55,374 --> 01:15:57,763
Palmer Field.

1078
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:00,139
Are you sorry you left it?

1079
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:02,310
Would it do any good if I were?

1080
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:05,282
No. Why worry about it? Come on.

1081
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:08,323
My quarters are over there.
Your quarters?

1082
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:11,690
I received very definite orders
to that effect before I left Moscow.

1083
01:16:11,755 --> 01:16:14,951
What's wrong? You're my wife, aren't you?
Yes, but orders are orders.

1084
01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:18,149
What are they up to?
Are they trying to put pressure on me?

1085
01:16:18,218 --> 01:16:20,552
Well, you haven't been
too cooperative.

1086
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,504
I've been talking my head off.
That's true.

1087
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:26,278
But so far, you haven't told us anything
we don't know. Well, it's not my fault.

1088
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:28,199
There's a lot of stuff
I seem to have forgotten.

1089
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,336
I can't make it out.

1090
01:16:30,408 --> 01:16:32,676
I usually have a pretty good memory.

1091
01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:35,044
I may see you tomorrow.
Well, wait a minute.

1092
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:38,044
Why? This is all so sudden.
I'm gonna miss you.

1093
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:40,354
Don't worry. You'll have
a batman to look after you.

1094
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:43,006
A batman?
What do I want with a batman?

1095
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:47,451
He'll come in and he'll cook for you and
clean up, do your laundry and so forth.

1096
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:51,233
And so forth? Shall I let him
wash that nightie of yours?

1097
01:16:51,299 --> 01:16:54,081
Did I put that in your suitcase?
Oh, don't let the batman touch it.

1098
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:56,001
Please hide it somewhere for me.
Hide it?

1099
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:57,921
He'll steal it.
A nightgown?

1100
01:16:57,986 --> 01:17:01,052
You can't buy anything like that in the
Soviet. I wouldn't lose it for anything.

1101
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:03,968
I'm not even going to wear it anymore.
I don't blame you.

1102
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:05,974
I'll bring it over to you after dinner.

1103
01:17:06,048 --> 01:17:08,120
You'd better not.

1104
01:17:08,192 --> 01:17:10,744
You mean I can't come
and see you if I want to?

1105
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:13,662
Not unless I receive orders to that effect.
And you can't come and see me?

1106
01:17:13,726 --> 01:17:15,799
No.
I won't stand for it.

1107
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:18,968
I don't know what else you can do.

1108
01:17:19,038 --> 01:17:21,426
I'll complain to Washington.

1109
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,434
Well, it looks like Shannon
still has everything under control.

1110
01:17:29,499 --> 01:17:31,354
Did you hear
from the State Department?

1111
01:17:31,419 --> 01:17:33,328
The Russian government says
they have no record...

1112
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:37,232
of a ColonelJames Shannon being found
in Siberia or elsewhere as yet.

1113
01:17:37,305 --> 01:17:40,501
I guess that means Shannon
hasn't reached the end of his rope.

1114
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:43,318
When are you gonna raise the ante?
Ten days, two weeks.

1115
01:17:43,385 --> 01:17:48,021
We might offer as high as half a dozen
Soviet agents in exchange forJim.

1116
01:17:48,088 --> 01:17:50,509
Well, I think it ought to
be done right away. Why?

1117
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:54,738
Well, he might run out of stuff to tell
'em. You heard what that Russian dame said.

1118
01:17:54,806 --> 01:17:57,970
To them, pressure means torture...
or worse.

1119
01:17:58,038 --> 01:18:01,452
I'd like to know what that drug is
that they use. We know what it is.

1120
01:18:01,525 --> 01:18:03,794
The same stuff they gave
Cardinal Mindszenty? Mm-hmm.

1121
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:06,195
Worst part of it,
they've improved it.

1122
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:11,561
Now it even makes you forget
that you've forgotten.

1123
01:18:11,635 --> 01:18:14,951
We've been making excellent progress
with Colonel Shannon.

1124
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:19,216
Until yesterday, I've been completely
satisfied in regard to his sincerity.

1125
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:23,655
What happened? Well, I brought up the
matter of the parasite fighters.

1126
01:18:23,728 --> 01:18:25,702
He said he had
no experience with them.

1127
01:18:25,776 --> 01:18:28,623
That's quite possible.
I don't think so.

1128
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:31,534
We know they've perfected their method
of hooking back onto the mother bomber,

1129
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:35,821
which could only have been done
by experts of his type.

1130
01:18:35,886 --> 01:18:37,741
He never mentioned
any such work to me.

1131
01:18:37,806 --> 01:18:41,602
I still think you might
be able to help us. How?

1132
01:18:41,677 --> 01:18:45,604
Perhaps you can persuade him
to show us their method.

1133
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:47,887
You mean for him to
actually fly one of our

1134
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:50,432
parasite jets and return
it to the mother bomber?

1135
01:18:50,507 --> 01:18:52,677
Do you want him to be killed?
Of course not.

1136
01:18:52,746 --> 01:18:55,364
But you know there must be something
wrong with our methods or our equipment.

1137
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:57,474
We've already lost several
of our best pilots.

1138
01:18:57,546 --> 01:19:00,414
If our equipment or our methods
are at fault,

1139
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:05,158
then Colonel Shannon will naturally
tell us what's wrong before he uses them.

1140
01:19:07,431 --> 01:19:09,886
That seems reasonable.

1141
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:12,063
Whether or not he'll see it that way,
I can't promise.

1142
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:14,338
Why not? This is a
matter of vital tactics.

1143
01:19:14,406 --> 01:19:16,958
You should have no trouble.
Why?

1144
01:19:17,029 --> 01:19:20,127
He betrayed the United States for you.
He became a deserter on your behalf.

1145
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:24,156
Compared to that,
this parasite fighter thing means nothing.

1146
01:19:24,228 --> 01:19:26,716
Well, I suppose not.

1147
01:19:26,787 --> 01:19:29,242
And then again,
it may be the last straw.

1148
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:33,089
For him, or for you? Why not for me?
What do you think I'm made of?

1149
01:19:33,154 --> 01:19:36,220
Isn't there a limit of what can be asked
of me too? I know how you feel, Olga.

1150
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,558
But you've done pretty well
with him so far. I know.

1151
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,764
But I think it's a mistake
to use me at this point.

1152
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:43,199
And I wish you'd tell Moscow so.
It's too palpable...

1153
01:19:43,264 --> 01:19:46,875
I'm sorry, Olga,
but you have no choice in the matter.

1154
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,488
I was instructed to give you this
in case you proved reluctant.

1155
01:19:55,773 --> 01:19:58,009
See ya tomorrow, boys.

01:20:14,522 --> 01:20:18,645
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Olga.

1158
01:20:24,248 --> 01:20:26,103
Why don't you come over here?

1159
01:20:27,287 --> 01:20:29,621

1161
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,612
You don't seem surprised to see me.
Why should I be?

1162
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:41,546
I've been expecting you, Olga.

1163
01:20:41,621 --> 01:20:45,842
"Olga."
You haven't called me that lately.

1164
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:48,395
Well, I always think of you
as two girls...

1165
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,833
Anna, the lovely kid
I thought was a refugee,

1166
01:20:50,898 --> 01:20:55,021
and Olga, a Soviet Tootsie Roll
that made a chump out of me.

1167
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:57,423
You still hate me for that,
don't you?

1168
01:20:57,489 --> 01:21:00,336
And you came here tonight
to do the same thing.

1169
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:04,391
They said they'd transfer me
if I didn't.

1170
01:21:04,463 --> 01:21:06,830
Where?
To Hungary.

1171
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,545
Well, what's so terrible about that?

1172
01:21:29,066 --> 01:21:32,197
Do you think I could survive
being separated from you?

1173
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:37,279
Where did I hear that before?

1174
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,982
It was true then.
It's even more true now.

1175
01:21:42,056 --> 01:21:46,113
What are you talking about?
I don't know. I...

1176
01:21:46,183 --> 01:21:48,387
I guess I've fallen in
love with you. Huh?

1177
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:51,422
I've fallen in love with you!
I thought you didn't believe in it.

1178
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:53,697
I don't.
I thought I hated you...

1179
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:56,448
as much as I hated your country
and everything it stands for.

1180
01:21:56,517 --> 01:21:58,655
And now you only hate
my country?

1181
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,820
I don't hate anything.

1182
01:22:01,892 --> 01:22:05,121
That's what makes it so strange.
I can't understand it.

1183
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:08,866
You're good, Olga.

1184
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,897
I gotta hand it to you, baby.
You're the best I've ever seen.

1185
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,391
You don't believe me?
Why should I?

1186
01:22:14,466 --> 01:22:16,320
All right. Let me go.
Why?

1187
01:22:16,385 --> 01:22:18,240
Why should I stay here?
Why shouldn't you?

1188
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:20,159
You don't believe me.
You still hate me.

1189
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:23,540
Will you stay if I show 'em
how to handle that parasite fighter?

1190
01:22:26,815 --> 01:22:28,789
Are you serious?

1191
01:22:28,863 --> 01:22:30,750
It's all you wanted,
wasn't it?

1192
01:22:30,814 --> 01:22:32,952
Well, of course.
Then they won't transfer me.

1193
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:35,028
Okay, it's a deal.

1194
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:37,337
Oh, Jim!

1195
01:22:37,405 --> 01:22:40,372
But I'm not doing it for you.

1196
01:22:40,444 --> 01:22:43,410
<i>I'm doing it for myself.
Yourself?</i>

1197
01:22:43,483 --> 01:22:47,159
Sure. There's nothing secret
about that parasite fighter stuff.

1198
01:22:47,226 --> 01:22:50,193
But I knew if I held out on it,
they'd send you over to work on me.

1199
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:52,120
Nothing secret about it?

1200
01:22:52,186 --> 01:22:54,552
All the magazines and papers
in the United States...

1201
01:22:54,617 --> 01:22:57,267
have had big spreads on it,
including diagrams.

1202
01:22:57,337 --> 01:23:01,558
And we only do that with projects
we've decided to abandon.

1203
01:23:01,624 --> 01:23:03,860
Still love me?
Oh, let me go!

1204
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:07,026
Why? You think I'd stay
here another minute?

1205
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:09,004
Why not?

Where'd you get these matches?
Out of your jacket.

If you ever hear of me holding out again,
you'll know it's on account of two things...

American cigarettes
and American coffee.

Yes, he's agreed to show us all he knows

Good. I'll tell him.

Why didn't you tell him
our people had found out

the whole business wasn't
worth the trouble?

1244
01:26:33,549 --> 01:26:37,770
He wouldn't believe it.
Why, these matches are from Yuma.

I was only kiddin' ya.

1257
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:46,746
That's just a list of the things
they've been questioning me about.

1258
01:27:46,814 --> 01:27:48,668
It's quite clear.

1259
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:53,719
I only jotted 'em down
so I wouldn't get all mixed up.

1260
01:27:53,789 --> 01:27:56,308
I told ya how I keep forgetting.

1261
01:27:56,379 --> 01:27:59,859
Perhaps. But it's also
an almost complete list...

1262
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:01,905
of every weakness
in the Soviet Air Force.

1263
01:28:01,978 --> 01:28:05,294
Well, that isn't my fault. There isn't a
thing there they haven't asked me about.

1264
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,311
You can check
with Colonel Sokolov.

1265
01:28:07,385 --> 01:28:09,751
I'm going to check with
Moscow first. Why?

1266
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:13,045
You've swindled him too.
Me? What did I do?

<i>What did you do to me?</i>

Oh, you weren't such a chump after all.
You made a chump out of me.

01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:21,195
You made chumps out of all of us, you...
you Yankee gangster.

1270
01:28:21,271 --> 01:28:25,165
And all the time, I thought it was
because you... Now you know how I felt.

1271
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:27,924
Is that why you did it?

1272
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,844
Could be.

1273
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:33,683
The idea of paying you off in rubles
was pretty hard to resist.

1274
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:37,043
You risked more than I did.
It was worth it.

One thing I can't understand.

1276
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:41,641
Now that you've gathered
all this information, how

1277
01:28:41,656 --> 01:28:43,439
did you ever plan to get
out of Russia with it?

1278
01:28:43,506 --> 01:28:46,734
Same way I got in.
What do you think I am?

1279
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:49,321
I'm not worried.
You've got too big for it.

Big for what?
Your Soviet straightjacket.

1282
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:58,668
Wait a minute, Olga.

1283
01:28:58,735 --> 01:29:01,768
If you turn me in, you'll be
turning yourself in too. Why?

1284
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:03,976
You brought me here, didn't you?

1285
01:29:04,046 --> 01:29:07,362
And if I know Moscow,
we'll both end up against the same wall.

1286
01:29:07,438 --> 01:29:10,950
Don't worry. They won't shoot you.
Why not?

1287
01:29:11,021 --> 01:29:14,882
You're 10 times more valuable as an enemy
agent than you ever were as a traitor.

What are you gonna do,
have me stuffed?

1289
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:21,732
Courage won't help you.
Your government trusts you.

they'll really make use of that.</i>

All that bunk about love last night.

I knew it wasn't on the level.

1293
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:34,246
Or was it?
Stay where you are, Jim!

1294
01:29:38,822 --> 01:29:41,059

1304
01:30:58,838 --> 01:31:00,693
Put her through.

1305
01:31:00,758 --> 01:31:02,667
I'll call you back.

1306
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:06,388
Well, Olga, what can I do for you?

1307
01:31:06,453 --> 01:31:09,196
Something has happened
that I must report, sir.

1308
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:10,130
Go ahead.

1309
01:31:10,197 --> 01:31:12,913
It's in regard to my husband,
Colonel Shannon.

1310
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,649
Well,

1311
01:31:17,907 --> 01:31:19,979
I, uh...

1312
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:22,089
I merely wanted to suggest that...

1313
01:31:22,162 --> 01:31:25,871
Colonel Sokolov be a little more discreet
when interrogating him.

1314
01:31:27,728 --> 01:31:29,833
Well, my husband has been
talking things over with me,

1315
01:31:29,904 --> 01:31:32,653
and while he doesn't seem
to realize it himself,

1316
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,416
it's quite clear to me that Colonel
Sokolov is only questioning

1317
01:31:35,431 --> 01:31:37,804
him about subjects we've made
little or no progress in.

1318
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:39,845
What's wrong with that?

1319
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:44,618
Oh, you think he should
be more subtle?

1320
01:31:45,581 --> 01:31:47,850
I'll think it over.
Perhaps you're right.

1321
01:31:47,917 --> 01:31:51,745
I had no idea Colonel Sokolov
was so well-informed,

1322
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,729
or you either for that matter.

1323
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,283
If you're gonna get
anywhere with these things,

1324
01:32:31,298 --> 01:32:32,929
you'd better breed yourselves
a race of midgets.

1325
01:32:35,011 --> 01:32:36,866
What are you doin' over here?

1326
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:38,970
I heard you were going
to make the drop in this thing today.

1327
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:42,489
They're sure in an awful rush.
No wonder you lose so many pilots.

1328
01:32:42,561 --> 01:32:45,856
If you're not ready to do it, you
don't have to do it. Who said so?

1329
01:32:45,921 --> 01:32:47,635
Colonel Sokolov. He promised me that.
But he

1330
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,532
hasn't been around for the
last couple of weeks.

1331
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,080
He was sent to Moscow. But why don't
you wait until he comes back?

1332
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,630
Oh, I'm as ready as I'll ever be, but...
But what?

1333
01:32:56,702 --> 01:33:00,444
That rocket motor's about as reliable
as a $2 coronet.

1334
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:02,364
Even with you working on it?

1335
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:06,706
We only let you people steal
our defective stuff.

1336
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,169
Yeah, I know that.

1337
01:33:09,244 --> 01:33:11,153
That's why I'm so worried about you.

1338
01:33:12,347 --> 01:33:15,063
Don't worry, baby.
I love you too.

1339
01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:19,347
You're not lying to me?
What are we gonna have for lunch?

1340
01:33:19,418 --> 01:33:21,720
Same as we had yesterday.
Blintzes!

1341
01:33:21,786 --> 01:33:24,655
We had those the day before too.
Well, what would you like?

1342
01:33:24,728 --> 01:33:27,859
How about a nice, big, juicy steak?

1343
01:33:27,928 --> 01:33:30,797
Mmm! Palm Springs.

1344
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:33,206
Haven't you anyplace
like that around here?

1345
01:33:33,271 --> 01:33:37,045
I don't think there's anyplace
like that in the whole world.

1346
01:33:43,253 --> 01:33:45,489
There's Colonel Matoff.

1347
01:33:45,557 --> 01:33:47,444
Aren't you gonna say good-bye?

1348
01:33:47,508 --> 01:33:51,020
Oh, no. Good luck.

1349
01:33:53,618 --> 01:33:57,360
Colonel Matoff!
My dear Olga, how you've changed.

1350
01:33:57,426 --> 01:33:59,695
Changed? Yes, you're more
beautiful than ever.

1351
01:33:59,762 --> 01:34:04,267
Colonel Matoff!
Oh.

1352
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:13,734
How is everything in Berlin?
Well the,

1353
01:34:13,807 --> 01:34:16,457
uh...

1354
01:34:16,526 --> 01:34:19,046
the Americans are still there.

1355
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:20,972
(CHUCKLES)

1356
01:34:21,038 --> 01:34:23,459
I must congratulate you on the way
you've handled this one of yours.

1357
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,736
Moscow is very pleased
as you shall see.

1358
01:34:25,804 --> 01:34:28,869
They've given you
another important project.

1359
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:30,849
Excuse me.

1360
01:34:37,578 --> 01:34:39,432
I must find Colonel Sokolov.

1361
01:34:39,497 --> 01:34:42,563
If you mean your superior officer,
you won't have to look very far.

1362
01:34:42,633 --> 01:34:44,836
Why?
I'm taking his place.

1363
01:34:44,904 --> 01:34:48,067
This is the passenger
mentioned in your orders.

1364
01:34:48,136 --> 01:34:50,306
Captain Orlieff,
may I present Lieutenant Diompkin.

1365
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:53,026
"Captain"?
You've been promoted.

1366
01:34:53,095 --> 01:34:55,778
Lieutenant Diompkin
is your assistant.

1367
01:34:55,847 --> 01:34:58,977
Really?
Your plane is ready, Captain.

1368
01:34:59,045 --> 01:35:01,892
I'll be with you
in a few moments.

1369
01:35:01,957 --> 01:35:05,666
Uh, Colonel Sokolov, he has
been promoted also? Oh, yes,

1370
01:35:05,732 --> 01:35:08,153
to the uranium mine.

1371
01:35:08,228 --> 01:35:10,878
<i>Colonel Sokolov?
(LAUGHING)</i>

1372
01:35:10,947 --> 01:35:15,005
You're the only one who hasn't been
contaminated by this American.

1373
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:19,007
Thank goodness I shall have
no personal contact with him.

1374
01:35:19,074 --> 01:35:20,862
Why?

1375
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:25,500
He's to be exchanged for five
very valuable countrymen of ours.

1376
01:35:25,568 --> 01:35:28,153
When?

1377
01:35:28,224 --> 01:35:32,217
Well, if he doesn't
get blown up in that thing,

1378
01:35:32,287 --> 01:35:34,293
I have orders to send him
to Moscow tomorrow...

1379
01:35:34,366 --> 01:35:38,556
<i>where, I imagine, he'll be turned over
to the American ambassador.</i>

1380
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:40,476
Tomorrow?

1381
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,091
Oh, it's time for you to leave.

1382
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:45,879
Now?
Yes, you must leave at once.

1383
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:48,849
Tomorrow?

1384
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:13,779
Why are you so concerned?

1385
01:36:13,847 --> 01:36:15,821
I think it's a great mistake.

1386
01:36:15,894 --> 01:36:18,195
To exchange this American?

1387
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:20,944
Aren't you a little tired
of him by now?

1388
01:36:21,013 --> 01:36:24,012
You know my personal feelings
are of no consequence.

1389
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:28,426
Then why do you say
it's a great mistake to exchange him?

1390
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,281
I'm afraid he knows too much.
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry.

1391
01:36:31,347 --> 01:36:33,354
General Langrad
is taking care of that.

1392
01:36:33,426 --> 01:36:35,565
General Langrad?

1393
01:36:35,634 --> 01:36:40,619
He has ordered me to see that Colonel
Shannon be given the final medication...

1394
01:36:40,689 --> 01:36:43,754
<i>before he is turned over
to the American ambassador.</i>

1395
01:36:43,824 --> 01:36:45,679
Medication?

1396
01:36:45,744 --> 01:36:48,296
Didn't you know we've been
giving it to him all along?

1397
01:36:49,967 --> 01:36:52,389
No.
Yes.

1398
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:54,469
Our new technique...

1399
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,778
just in very small doses, of course.

1400
01:36:56,845 --> 01:37:00,423
<i>Just enough to make him forget
his loyalty to his...</i>

1401
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:03,013
<i>dirty, rotten, capitalistic country.</i>

1402
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:06,051
That's why his memory's
been so bad.

1403
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:08,971
When he returns for lunch...

1404
01:37:09,035 --> 01:37:10,889
if he does return...

1405
01:37:10,955 --> 01:37:13,540
I'll arrange to have
the final dose placed in his food.

1406
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:16,709
<i>It will be a massive one,
but completely tasteless...</i>

1407
01:37:16,778 --> 01:37:19,112
<i>in either a stew
or an omelet.</i>

1408
01:37:19,177 --> 01:37:22,591
But won't that destroy
his memory entirely?

1409
01:37:22,664 --> 01:37:25,478
(CHUCKLING)

1410
01:37:25,544 --> 01:37:28,674
In 36 hours,
he'll be a complete idiot.

1411
01:37:28,743 --> 01:37:32,419
<i>Won't even remember who he is,
much less you.</i>

1412
01:37:32,487 --> 01:37:35,585
And now if you'll pardon me,
I must talk with the local medical staff.

1413
01:37:35,654 --> 01:37:37,508
Good-bye.

1414
01:37:57,633 --> 01:38:00,415
You ever bailed out
of one of these planes before?

1415
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:03,928
No, Captain. I'm not a flier.
I've never even been in a jet before.

1416
01:38:05,695 --> 01:38:08,542
I've, uh, been having
a little trouble with this one.

1417
01:38:08,607 --> 01:38:11,421
Maybe I'd better take it up myself
to make sure it's all right.

1418
01:38:13,502 --> 01:38:15,389
I'm sorry, Captain.

1419
01:38:15,453 --> 01:38:17,460
I've been ordered not
to let you out of my sight.

1420
01:38:18,845 --> 01:38:20,699
Is that a fact?

1421
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:22,673
Yes, Captain.

1422
01:38:22,748 --> 01:38:25,617
I've been instructed
to go wherever you go.

1423
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:32,569
Very well.

1424
01:38:32,634 --> 01:38:35,383
Get up in the back seat.
You can watch me from there.

1425
01:38:39,577 --> 01:38:41,486
Oh!

1426
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,014
Now you put
the other foot over there.

1427
01:38:44,087 --> 01:38:45,996
(STRAINING)

1428
01:38:48,534 --> 01:38:50,444
Here.

1429
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:58,642
You comfortable?

1430
01:38:58,709 --> 01:39:01,708
No, Captain,
it's rather a tight fit.

1431
01:39:03,028 --> 01:39:06,672
Oh. Well, in that case,
just pull that little red lever.

1432
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:08,594
Then you'll have plenty of room.

1433
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,427
Thank you, Captain.

1434
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:24,296
Hey!
What's wrong?

1435
01:39:24,368 --> 01:39:28,011
He made a mistake. He pulled the seat
ejector instead of the seat adjustor.

1436
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:30,348
Aah!

1437
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:26,435
After you get this thing unbuckled,
buzz me twice before you turn me loose.

1438

Oh? What's on your mind?

1444
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:15,510
That steak you were talking about.
Did you get one?

1445
01:41:15,577 --> 01:41:17,432
No. I'm afraid...

1446
01:41:17,497 --> 01:41:20,213
we'll have to get it at the same place
we had it last time.

1447
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,768
I repeat: The same place.

1448
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,806
The same place? What are you talkin' about?
Where are you?

1449
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:27,919
You know that jet
that's guarding you on top?

1450
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:30,892
Yeah.
I'm right underneath him.

1451
01:41:36,404 --> 01:41:38,859
I don't get it.
What's got into you?

1457

Fly a course of 90 degrees
until further notice.

I'll take care of him.

1461
01:42:23,563 --> 01:42:27,207
Better move over to your right.
I might hit his fuel tank.

<i>(GUNFIRE)</i>

1469
01:44:16,852 --> 01:44:20,113
How much fuel have you got?
Enough to get us to Vienna.

1470
01:44:20,179 --> 01:44:22,600
Good. Give her the gun.

1471
01:45:08,585 --> 01:45:12,229
They're comin' after us like a nest of
hornets. Can you hear them on the air?

1472
01:45:12,297 --> 01:45:15,231
Look behind you.
You oughta be able to see them.

1473
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:23,326
There they are.
Two MIGs coming out of 7:00.

1474
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:26,562
Let them come. I'll take care of them.
What are you gonna do?

1475
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:30,371
I don't know. I'm trying to think of
something, and you'd better do the same.

1476
01:46:17,756 --> 01:46:20,177
Those guys back there
are gettin' a little close.

1477
01:46:20,251 --> 01:46:23,599
Have you thought of anything?
See that big cloud ahead?

1478
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:25,845
Yes.
Well, make a right turn into it.

1479
01:46:25,913 --> 01:46:28,084
Then when you get well inside of it,
whip to the left.

1480
01:46:28,153 --> 01:46:32,179
Maybe we can lose them. I was just
thinking the same thing. Here we go!

1481
01:47:12,881 --> 01:47:14,573
Cigarettes?

1482
01:47:14,736 --> 01:47:16,645
Cigarettes?

1483
01:47:18,447 --> 01:47:23,235
Mmm, Papa. Is this a steak,
or is this a steak?

1484
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:25,349
I bet that's all
you came back for.

1485
01:47:25,421 --> 01:47:27,276
It's one of the reasons.

1486
01:47:27,341 --> 01:47:29,270
If I could make my people
realize that things like

1487
01:47:29,285 --> 01:47:31,115
this are better than all
the guns in the world...

1488
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:33,285
What's the other?

1489
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:37,542
Wipe off your chin.
