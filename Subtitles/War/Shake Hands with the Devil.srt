00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,904
United Nations, New York

2
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,121
November 1, 1993

3
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,137
United Nations Mission in Rwanda
(UNAMIR) Headquarters

4
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,323
Excuse me?

5
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,425
Do you know those young men?

6
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,053
The boys with the wigs.

7
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,560
They're Interahamwe.

8
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,633
Sorry?

9
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,065
Interahamwe.

10
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,396
What’s that?

11
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,470
Militia

12
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,597
We have to protect ourselves
from our enemies.

13
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,681
Happy to see you, Prime Minister.

14
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,842
Glad to see
you’re not always workingl

15
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,777
I'm a Hutu,

16
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,889
Obviously.

17
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,888
It's bad enough to be a woman.
If I were a Tutsi as well...

18
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,758
I wouldn't be primeminister.

19
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,393
I'm a Hutu but...

20
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,527
since I'm a so-called moderate,

21
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,698
the Hutu hardliners hate me.

22
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,470
Come to Mommy.

23
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,062
Only French.

24
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,837
- You speak French, right?
- Yes.

25
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,500
You’re very courageous.

26
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,370
I'm just stubborn.

27
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,118
I love my country.

28
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,897
I hope you'll love it too.

29
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,034
I love its beauty.

30
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,164
Everybody loves beauty.

31
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,238
Loving a beautiful child...

32
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,897
That’s easy.

33
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,742
What’s harder

34
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,040
is to love a child
who's not so beautiful.

35
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,453
South of the D.M.Z.
(Demilitarized Zone)

36
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,184
North of the D.M.Z.

37
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,405
Rebel Army (RPF)
General Kagame's HQ

38
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:27,530
December23, 1993
Government and RPF negotiate
at Kilometer 64

39
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,902
Major Kamenzi
RPF Chief Negotiator

40
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:38,772
Colonel Bagosora
Government Chief Negotiator

41
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,742
It’s late, we're uncomfortable.

42
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,613
There'll be nothing to eat or drink

43
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,017
until we settle the last points

44
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,679
Which are first:

45
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,326
Which parties nominate ministers
forth interim government?

46
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,523
Second: Accommodations in Kigali
for the RPF representatives

47
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,259
and for troops to protect them.

48
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,426
RPF (Rebel) troops arriving
at new NQ Kigali

49
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,819
Please, General.

50
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
Meet my wife.

51
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,762
A pleasure, Madame.

52
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,465
What shall we toast?

53
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,135
Peace!

54
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,002
Peace!

55
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,841
We all want peace,

56
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,001
except Tutsis.

57
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,579
As I was explaining
to Colonel Marchal.

58
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,279
Tutsis don’t want to share power.

59
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,851
They want everything

60
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,647
Not just Rwanda!

61
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,654
Uganda, Zaire...

62
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,848
Gentlemen...

63
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,117
You Belgians

64
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,159
won't hear the truth.

65
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,990
Because you're to blame.

66
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,857
Tell me, Col. Bagosora...

67
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,296
What is it, my dear General?

68
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,426
Does President Nabyarimana
have an heir?

69
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,838
If something happened to him,
who'd be his successor?

70
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,499
Has he appointed anyone?

71
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,877
He doesn't like to think
about such things.

72
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,887
It's OK I just want to talk.

73
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,616
I always carry a gun.

74
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,087
My name doesn’t matter.

75
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,624
You can call me... Jean-Pierre.

76
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,638
U.S. Embassy

77
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,110
Office of President Nabyarimana

78
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,319
These allegations are...

79
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,953
very disturbing.

80
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,357
It’s bunch of lies.

81
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,268
Tell me again, General...

82
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,965
Who is peddling this story?

83
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,233
I can’t reveal his name,

84
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,639
but we believe him.

85
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,879
Temporary Rebel HQ in Kigali

86
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,695
They caught Tutsis
trying to get out.

87
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,222
They say they're spies!

88
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,493
April 6, 1994
8:15 p.m.

89
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,679
Yes, Prime Minister?

90
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,011
It was his plane.

91
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,218
<i>The president was on board</i>.

92
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:42,150
Things could get out of control.
I'll need your help.

93
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,089
<i>I'll send troops</i>.

94
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,959
<i>As for me Prime Minister,</i>

95
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,397
you're in charge.

96
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,062
- <i>I'll inform Col. Bagosora</i>.
- Thank you, General.

97
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,272
Thank you.

98
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,981
Rwandan Army Headquarters

99
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,292
Not only our president,

100
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,394
but also our chief of staff,
and Burundi’s president...

101
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,138
It's amazing!

102
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,506
Let me assure you,
our Crisis Committee

103
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,273
will run the country

104
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,942
until the politicians resume power.

105
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,319
But Rwanda has government

106
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,412
under Prime Minister Agathe.

107
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,490
That old whore!

108
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,492
Madame Agathe!

109
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,323
She is a woman who talks too much.

110
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,661
Neither the people
nor the cabinet support her.

111
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,538
I can’t recognize your committee
as the legal government.

112
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:06,042
It's not up to you to say
who controls my country.

113
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,704
Call Mr. Booh-Booh.

114
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,171
Gladly.

115
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,941
Col. Marchal?

116
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,109
The roadblocks downtown...

117
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,618
Were they your orders?

118
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,778
Never!

119
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,015
Tell him we're on our way.

120
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,419
We tried to secure the crash site.

121
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,428
They stopped us.

122
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,661
The Presidential Guards
are out of control tonight!

123
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,395
They are mad with grief!

124
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,835
Their president is dead,
maybe murdered.

125
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,799
It might calm them to hear
the government still rules,

126
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,575
that there hasn’t been a coup.

127
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:58,996
Get out!

128
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,196
- Get out!
- Idiot!

129
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,598
Do you know who I am?

130
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,260
Let them go!

131
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,543
Lucky you still control the Guard.

132
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,915
We might have been in trouble.

133
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,916
J. R. Booh-Booh,
Political Head of UNAMIR

134
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:32,292
Madame Agathe is the legitimate
head of your government.

135
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,393
Can you get her safely
to the radio station

136
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,635
so she can make
a public appeal for calm?

137
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,070
I asked Col. Marchal for an escort.

138
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,234
Belgian Para commandos,
some of my best men.

139
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,572
Excellent.

140
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,574
Colonel, everyone is anxious

141
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,344
to get the situation under control.

142
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,116
I spoke to the US ambassador.

143
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,452
He's calling a meeting

144
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,582
for 9:00a.m. At his embassy.

145
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,777
Prime Minister Agathe's Residence

146
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,977
I understand, General.

147
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,323
We'll stay right here.

148
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,018
All the armed men outside,

149
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,960
aren't they here to protect me?

150
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,230
Thank you, General.

151
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,027
Good night.

152
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,992
I order you to disarm your men!

153
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,193
This place is under UN protection.

154
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,167
I represent the government
of Rwanda,

155
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,468
and I order you to disarm. Now!

156
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,202
You've no authority.
I'm head of security here.

157
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,937
You're wasting my time!

158
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,608
More than 20government soldiers
are ordering us to disarm.

159
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,775
Awaiting orders!

160
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,115
- Now!
- Awaiting orders!

161
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,554
<i>Tango 2 you're not</i>to<i>fire</i>
<i>unless fired upon</i>.

162
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:24,526
<i>If you're overwhelmed,</i>
<i>handover your weapons</i>.

163
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,687
Weapons down!

164
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,529
Drop them! Lie down!

165
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,999
Down! Weapons down,
and lie-down

166
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,969
You tool
Drop your weapons and lie-down!

167
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,437
That’s an order.

168
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,098
On the ground!  You, down!

169
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,970
Faster! Hands on your head!

170
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,443
Who do you think you are?

171
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,946
You Whites,
who do you think you are?

172
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,414
You've no business here!

173
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,985
You know nothing... nothing!

174
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,445
Nothing at all!

175
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,792
We don’t need you here!

176
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,795
Don’t worry, children.

177
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,992
Everything will be fine.

178
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,526
Don’t worry.

179
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,883
<i>The Guard seized the radio station</i>.

180
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,048
Roadblocks are every where!

181
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,355
<i>Tutsis are being massacred</i>
<i>across the city</i>.

182
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,725
<i>Tutsis and moderates,</i>

183
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,262
Thank you, General.

184
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,894
Thank you.

185
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,942
No. Nobody passes!

186
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,241
It’s restricted.

187
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,779
I must find Col. Bagosora.

188
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,079
I have orders.

189
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,620
If you drive through, we'll fire!

190
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,289
Stop!

191
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,458
Stop!

192
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,959
Stop!

193
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,970
You're not allowed!

194
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,074
Take aim.

195
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,924
Good day, General.

196
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,865
Where's Col. Bagosora?

197
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,097
You can’t go on foot hop in.

198
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,169
Thank you.

199
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,337
Col. Bagosora is
at the military college.

200
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,670
- Stop!
- Can't stop...

201
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,536
Those are my men!

202
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,872
- It’s an order!
- They’re out of control

203
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,911
The camp is out of control.

204
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,787
God dammit!

205
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,222
General!
Gen. Dallalre!

206
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,154
Come this way.

207
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,334
We believe that
only our Crisis Committee

208
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,809
can restore order
to the people of Rwanda.

209
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,310
I expect your cooperation.

210
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,572
And forth details...

211
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,944
General Dallalre,

212
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,786
welcome.

213
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,789
I was hoping
you'd address the officers.

214
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,768
First, I deeply regret

215
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,630
the loss of your president.

216
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,733
Some of your units are overcome
by grief and anger.

217
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,278
I understand.

218
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,273
But they’ve committed grave crimes.

219
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,680
That must cease right now.

220
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,781
We in UNAMIR are staying put.

221
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,919
We will do all we can

222
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,888
to prevent renewed civil war.

223
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,993
We won’t abandon Rwanda.

224
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:49,961
Thank you.

225
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,562
What if war resumes?

226
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,039
One moment...
What about my men at Camp Kigali?

227
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,075
I don’t know.

228
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,908
But the radio says Belgians
shot down the president's plane.

229
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,208
That's bullshit!

230
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,546
What about my men?

231
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,346
The camp is mutinous.

232
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,113
I want to go in right now.

233
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,121
UNAMIR must stay out of this.

234
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,384
UNAMIR is not leaving.

235
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,519
I’ve a massage from Gen. Kagame.

236
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,131
If the killings don't stop
before sunset,

237
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,292
he'll order in his troops.

238
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,427
If nothing's done, Colonel,

239
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,402
this means war.

240
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,903
If you'll excuse me.

241
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,479
I want to see my men!

242
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,687
General,

243
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,653
I'm told your men
are at Kigali Hospital.

244
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,663
One moment, General.

245
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,775
He says the bodies
of the Belgians are in back.

246
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,748
Bodies?

247
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,145
Did he say the bodies?

248
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,151
Ne says back there,

249
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,180
behind the morgue.

250
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,340
One...

251
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,976
two, three,

252
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,952
four, five, six,

253
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,617
seven, eight...

254
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,127
No.

255
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,186
Seven, eight,

256
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,662
nine...

257
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,205
Seven, eight...

258
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,774
nine,

259
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,177
ten...

260
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,146
Nine,

261
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,048
ten...

262
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,824
See these men are washed

263
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,498
and laid out properly.

264
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,360
Treated with respect.

265
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,783
Hundreds of unarmed
observers are missing.

266
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,789
Sorry, Minister.
I'll call you back.

267
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,570
Calm down, please.

268
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,606
Please, calm down.

269
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,874
This hotel is under UN protection.

270
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,474
What’s going on?

271
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,068
There are traitors here.

272
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,443
We won't let them leave.

273
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,414
You will not enter
this hotel for any reason.

274
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,646
It's under UN protection.

275
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:51,355
I order you to bar
anyone who's armed.

276
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,534
Is that clear?

277
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,205
My observer saw you
unloading ammunition

278
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,709
that was handed to the Rwandan army.

279
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,105
Your observer was mistaken.

280
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,707
We are here only
to evacuate the Whites.

281
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,818
And some good friends of France.

282
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,952
Who are directly responsible
for what’s happening.

283
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:34,295
Who we evacuate is none
of your business, General.

284
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:57,138
April 9, 1994
Polish Catholic Mission, Gikondo

285
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,580
<i>Yes, General</i>.
<i>I got your message</i>

286
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,251
<i>about a deadline for a cease-fire</i>.

287
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,691
<i>What's your answer?</i>.

288
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,992
We’re meeting at lunch
and we’ll discuss it.

289
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,259
The deadline is4:00p.m.

290
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,095
I understand.

291
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,030
Otherwise UNAMIR will be withdrawn.

292
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,230
Your friends here would miss you.

293
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,709
The world will be very upset
if there is no cease-fire

294
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,836
and the atrocities continue.

295
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,005
Very upset

296
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,606
Rwanda is a small African country

297
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,209
little noticed by the world.

298
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,379
Haven't you found that so?

299
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,316
<i>Nairobi?</i>.

300
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:31,312
Step away from the window, General.

301
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,184
You see,

302
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:37,350
the UN believes I can do more
for the peace process in Nairobi.

303
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,359
You’re head of the mission.

304
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,292
I'll be in constant touch.

305
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:25,216
Interahamwe Leaders

306
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,960
We're at your disposal, General.

307
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,232
We'll do everything we can.

308
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,064
Liars!

309
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,197
Just a bunch of bloody liars!

310
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,294
You gave me your word.

311
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,772
There was a misunderstanding.

312
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:29,474
I'm ready to work with all leaders,

313
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,135
including you.

314
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,180
If you are leaders, that is.

315
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:57,537
As people scrambled to leave,
they were shot by the militia.

316
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,480
We were caught in a crossfire.

317
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,458
People were queuing here
when the bombs fell.

318
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:22,729
They were literally shredded.

319
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,345
General!

320
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,782
We need soldiers to protect us!

321
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,014
Where are your soldiers?

322
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:43,816
You have guns.

323
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,326
Protect us!

324
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,421
Shoot at them!

325
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,257
Most of my men are unarmed.

326
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:50,831
Then what use are they?

327
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,661
Give them guns!

328
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:55,559
- We don’t have enough.
- Not enough? Why not?

329
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,868
We’re dying and all you say is
there's nothing you can do!

330
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:02,499
Why not? Why?

331
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,092
Are you part of Dallalre's gang?

332
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,223
Why? Is there a problem?

333
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:53,061
If I see this great general,
I'll kill him.

334
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:38,402
Dr. Bernard Kouchner
Emissary of the French Government
