What is this thing doing here?

Who is responsible
for bringing this thing?

00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,346
Strika, is it you
that is bringing this thing?

478
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,227
Strika, untie him.

479
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,230
So all of you grown men,

480
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:55,317
it is Strika, the small boy,
that is finding this prisoner.

481
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,237
Where is Two-I-C?

Two-I-C, what are we
to be doing with this thing?

487
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,376
This thing?
It is just a boy.

488
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,753
A boy?

489
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,215
A boy is nothing.

490
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,134
A boy is harmless?

491
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,428
[boys] Harmless, no, sir!

492
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,012
[Commandant]
Does a boy have two eyes to see?

493
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,514
[boys] Two eyes, sir!

494
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,517
[Commandant] A boy has hands to strangle
and fingers to pull triggers.

495
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,686
Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?

496
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,022
A boy is very, very dangerous.
You understand me?

497
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,276
Very dangerous, you understand?

498
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,193
- Very dangerous, you understand?
- Yes, sir!

499
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,194
Huh?

500
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,236
- Huh?
- Yes, sir!

501
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,782
Strika, are you hungry?

502
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,993
Are you wanting to be eating this thing?

503
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,709
Let me see your hands.

504
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,799
Oh, you have hands like a baby.

505
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,677
[sighs]

506
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,559
What are you doing here?

507
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,144
[breathing heavily]

508
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,689
You should be telling me.

509
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,566
If you are telling me,
I will be helping you.

510
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,486
You see, Strika is hungry.
He will eat you.

511
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,737
Huh?

512
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,780
What are you doing here?

513
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:35,667
The government army killed my father...
and my big brother...

514
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,757
and my father told me to run...
into the bush.

515
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,968
[sighs]

516
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,306
Everybody here is
calling me Commandant.

517
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,725
[soldier] How does the Commandant look?

518
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,809
[soldier] How does the Commandant look?

[soldier] How does the Commandant look?

520
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,895
[soldier] How does the Commandant look?
[all] All right, sir!

521
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,688
Ah.

522
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,149
Now, what are they calling you?

523
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,984
[softly] Agu.

524
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,278
Oh, you must say it
like you are prouder!

525
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,905
Agu.

526
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,407
One more time.

527
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,323
Agu.

528
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,199
- Agu.
- Uh-huh.

529
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,452
Well, Agu,

530
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,414
that is what I will be
calling you then, eh?

531
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,500
[breathing heavily]

532
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,503
[grunts]

533
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:26,092
Leave this one under my charge.
I will be training him to be a warrior.

534
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,804
So you can be fighting
the army that is killing your father.

535
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,724
Is that what you want?
You must be saying yes!

536
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,100

Rambo, give this SBU some work.

556
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,250
You must carry this one.

557
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,338
I saved your life. I saved your life.

558
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,340

- Move out.
- [Two-I-C] Soldier, move!

564
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,974

You are now under NDF control.

588
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,487
If you're willing to stay, then stay.

589
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,656
But you must be initiated.

590
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,574
Am I clear?

591
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,407
- Am I clear?
- [older boys] Yes, sir!

592
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,618
[Two-I-C]
They are not understanding me, boys.

593
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,035
Show them what I'm talking about.

594
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,495
[man] Raise... Put up your fucking hands!

595
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,205
- [man] Raise... Put up your fucking hands!
- Check them. Check them. Make sure...

596
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,832
[all clamoring]

597
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,506
Bring me the small boy.

598
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,716
This way.

599
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,011
CO Hope!

600
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,600

00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:09,608
Yes, sir! Come over.

603

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,609
Please, can I have some of the food?

609
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,485
- Please, can I have some of the food?
- [soldiers laughing]

610
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,281
You think you are soldier now, eh?

611
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,492
You's nothing.
You're not doing nothing here.

612
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,121
I carry ammunition all day.

613
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,750
You! Hey! Hey! Move!

614
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:09,793
What? What I do?

615
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,877
- What? What I do?
- [Preacher] Wake up!

616
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,756
You go back and
stand on top of the chair.

617
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,841
[Chicken Legs] Do it!

618
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,176
I said go and stand
on top of the chair!

619
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,262
Yeah. And salute!

620
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,809
[Commandant faintly]
Two-I-C, go and call Strika to my house.

621
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,020
[Two-I-C] CO Hope!
Send Strika to Commandant!

622
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,190
Strika, go.

623
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,028
[Preacher] Where you go get
this thing from?

624
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,948
[CO Hope] Two-I-C tell me
to train this boy.

625
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,783
[inaudible]

626
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,756
Show me position! Make sure you are clear.
Move them, now!

627
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,840
[man] Yes, sir!

628
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,925
[Two-I-C] First group, move!

629
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,973
You stay together! You stay together!

630
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,517
Close the space.
You're too far.

631
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,437
Where are you looking at?
Where are you looking? Eh?

632
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,898
Look at your enemy.

633
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,524
Change!

634
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:19,404
[Agu] <i>God... I want to be
seeing my mother again.</i>

635
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:24,492
<i>Two-I-C is saying,
small-small we are winning this war.</i>

636
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:29,164
<i>And then if you are willing,
I can be finding her again.</i>

637
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,373
[Commandant sighs]

638
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,959
<i>But, only you know.</i>

639
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:39,715
[Two-I-C] The National Reformation Council
took advantage of this instability

640
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,012
and militarily seized power
to restore UPC dominance.

641
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:48,016
We NDF refuse to recognize
this illegitimate government.

642
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,225
Who are we?

643
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,351
- Who are we?
- [all] We are NDF.

644
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,686
[Two-I-C] I said who are we?

645
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,104
[Two-I-C] I said who are we?
[all] We are NDF!

646
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,524
[Two-I-C] <i>Our very own politicians,
who steal our resources</i>

647
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,570
<i>and give them away for small-small dollar
in exchange for private pay-offs,</i>

648
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,697
they are spit on the constitution!

649
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,866
They are spit on your rights!

650
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,202
They are trying to spit on your future!

651
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,995
I say, who is your Supreme Commandant?

652
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,288
[all] Dada Goodblood!

653
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,289
I say, who do you fight for?

654
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,041
- I say, who do you fight for?
- [all] Dada Goodblood!

655
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,669
[Two-I-C] <i>In the battlefield,
you not be thinking normally.</i>

656
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,587
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

657
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,421
- <i>Do you hear me?</i>
- [all] <i>Yes, sir!</i>

658
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,258
[Two-I-C] <i>The only thing mattering
is the mission of the NDF!</i>

659
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,176
Am I clear?

660
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,219
- Am I clear?
- [all] Yes, sir!

661
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,761
- Soldiers, are you hearing me?
- [all] Yes, sir!

662
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,723
You fight and kill anyone
who destroys the peace.

663
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,808
[all] Yes, sir!

664
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,476

[whistle blowing]

669
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,882
Offside, offside! That's what I saw.
Offside, offside! Offside!

670
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,716
[all shouting]

671
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,721
[soldier] Hey, stop it!

672
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,432
All right, stop it!

673
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:17,981
[whistle blowing]

674
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,774
[Commandant] Native Defense Forces!

675
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,234
[all shouting]

676
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,028
[Two-I-C] How does your Commandant look?

677
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,195
[Two-I-C] How does your Commandant look?
[all] All right, sir!

678
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,655
How does your Commandant look?

679
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,949
- How does your Commandant look?
- [all] All right, sir!

680
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:35,373
[Commandant] What is it that has brought
this big family of strangers together?

681
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,833
Was it fear?

682
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,044
- Was it fear?
- [all] No, sir!

683
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,086
Was it war?

684
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:40,962
- Was it war?
- [all] Yes, sir!

685
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,965
We were defending ourselves.

686
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,177
We have to get revenge. Huh?

687
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,636
We have been defending ourselves

688
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,515
against the killings and rapings
of our own people from the PLF

689
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,185
and now from the NRC junta.

690
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,730
But it has awakened a sleeping beast.

691
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,150
It has awakened a giant.

692
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,445
It has put the weapons of this war
back in the hands of you,

693
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,615
the young and, therefore, the powerful.

694
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,619
Young men! Wealth?

695
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:17,748
We will not wait
to inherit any wealth. Huh?

696
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,918
We will not wait for them
to come and give it to us.

697
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,294
[all] No, sir!

698
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,754
[Commandant] We are going to take it.

699
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,465
[Commandant] We are going to take it.
[all] Yes, sir!

700
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,841
We're going to take it from them.

701
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,093
- We're going to take it from them.
- [all] Yes, sir!

702
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,052
Seize it!

703
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,136
- Seize it!
- [all] Yes, sir!

704
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,932
All of you that have

Shut your mouth.

881
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,568
You are making it hard.
This is hard.

882
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,404
It's hard,
so you must split him good.

883
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,451
Huh? Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father.

884
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,078
Huh?

885
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,995
Go on.

886
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,830
- Go on.
- [man crying]

887
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,208
[Commandant] Shut up!

888
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,710
- [Commandant] Shut up!
- Please. Please.

889
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,003
Agu, go on.

890
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,798
Agu!

891
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,051
[man] Please, no.

892
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,344
[Commandant] Chop him good-good.

893
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,512
Please! [sobbing]

894
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,516
[Commandant] These are the ones,
the dogs that kill your father.

895
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,185
Where is your mother?

896
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,644
Please...

897
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,606
[Commandant] Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father!

898
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,400
Chop that head!

899
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,570
- [wailing]
- Chop him!

900
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,573
[wailing continues]

901
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,411
Agu, come on!

902
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,956
Ahh!

903
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:33,794
[gasps]

904
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,296
[Commandant] Strika, help your brotha.

905
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,762
[yells]

906
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,337
[Commandant] Good.

907
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,340
That's right.

908
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,466
Watch his blood.

909
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,178
That is what you call justice. Hmm.

910
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,932
[Agu] <i>God... I have killed a man.</i>

911
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,812
<i>It is the worst sin...</i>

912
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,147
<i>but I am knowing too,</i>

913
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,858
<i>it is the right thing to be doing.</i>

914
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:38,775
[Commandant] Tripod!

915
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,609
- [Commandant] Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

916
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,486
This will be the Commandant's car.

917
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,531
Take this fucker out.
He is filthy.

918
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,326
Two-I-C! Two-I-C!

919
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,455
Give this to my charge. Huh?

920
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,959
This will be the Commandant's car.

921
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,418
- This will be the Commandant's car.
- Yes, sir.

922
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,338
[Two-I-C] If you are losing it,
then I am losing you.

923
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,132
[Commandant] Hmm!

924
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,094
Uh-huh.

925
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,096
[Commandant] This...

926
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,639
- You are driving?
- [Two-I-C] Okay to move out.

927
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,101
Everyone, get ready to move out.

928
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,019
- [retching]
- Get ready to move out, Agu.

929
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,553
You got this stuff from where?

930
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,975
From dead bodies?

931
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,444
Everybody is calling you "Strika." Why?

932
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,077
Are you liking war?

933
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,166
Hey, I'm asking you a question,
and you are not talking.

934
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,795
Are you having family?

935
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,017
I am thinking about my mom...

936
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,854
my brother...

937
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,859
and my little sister.

938
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,921
Are you stupid?

939
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,177
Why are you not talking?

940
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,845
I am asking a question.
You are not talking.

941
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,306
[boys rapping in native language]

942
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,006
[boy] Go! Go! Fast!

943
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,478
[boys] Go! Go, go!

944
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,106
[all exclaiming]

945
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,317
I got you, Strika.

946
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,350
[boy 1] Where is he?

947
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,185
[boy 1] Where is he?
[boy 2] Keep going, keep going.

948
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,271
[boy 3] Grass cutter! Grass cutter!
Grass cutter!

949
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,480
[boy 2] Left, left, left.

950
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,861
[man chanting in native language]

951
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,959

952
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,011
[all cheering]

953
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,767
[all laughing]

954
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,148
[Commandant] And you're having
any food that you want,

955
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,776
from chicken, cow,
fruit and vegetable...

956
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,448
Any kind of fish that you want, we got.
The fisherman is bringing it from the sea.

957
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,617
There's nothing you cannot have there.

958
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:44,873
And the best thing of this place,
this town of abundant resources,

959
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,376
is the women.

960
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:52,422
Hey, the women are too beautiful there!
Too beautiful.

961
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,925
Ah! The next thing you know, your soldier
will be standing to attention.

962
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,511
[all laughing]

963
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:02,807
They are having bottoms
with specifications so nice

964
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:07,354
that the ground where they're sitting down
is also rejoicing.

965
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:12,151
And they know...
they know how to be treating a man.

966
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:16,363
How to make him feel good,
kisses and all that, huh?

967
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,366
Last time I was there,
my soldier was hurting.

968
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,450
I couldn't stand up, eh!

969
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,701
[all laughing]

970
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:27,249
But you will see
because you are going there yourselves.

971
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,333
Hmm?

972
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,960
You will see with
your own eyes, gentlemen.

973
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,629
Mmm-hmm.

974
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,963
[laughing]

975
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,217
[Two-I-C] Commandant, sir!

976
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,596
Who is this?

977
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,765
- Who is this?
- Refugees from the village, sir.

978
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,477
They said the PLF and the NRC
took their village three days ago.

979
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,896
They killed most of the town,
but they let these ones go.

980
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,231
Hmm.

981
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:58,280
Well, let us be giving
their village back, huh?

982
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,656
[Two-I-C] Yes, sir.

983
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,450
[explosions in distance]

984
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,534
[bullet whizzes]

985
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,417
Look at that.

986
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,794
They are cutting people's hands.

987
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,672
Fucking PLF.

988
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,382

989
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:20,927

991
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,742
[Commandant] Radio!

992
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,826
- [Commandant] Radio!
- Yes, sir.

993
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,040
Two-I-C!

994
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,501
- Two-I-C!
- <i>Roger, you are loud.</i>

995
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,835
Report!

996
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:57,005
<i>Uh, we are facing heavy fire, sir. Over.</i>

997
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,298
Can you take the bridge?

998
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,717
It's very difficult, sir.
Men are fighting bravely,

999
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,177
but I don't know if we can
hold too much longer. Over.

1000
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,304
[Commandant] <i>Press on!</i>

1001
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,847
[Commandant] <i>Press on!</i>
[Two-I-C] Roger. We need support, sir.

1002
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,474
Some of our men are injured.

1003
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,436
<i>The men's spirits are low.
Sir, do you copy?</i>

1004
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,729
Sir?

1005
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,814
- Sir?
- <i>Can you take the bridge?</i>

1006
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:19,236
Copy, sir. We will reapply pressure
and push for the bridge. Over.

1007
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,612
<i>Take the bridge!</i>

1008
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,281
That is your task! Mortar.

1009
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,114
- That is your task! Mortar.
- Yes, sir!

1010
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,658
Your ammo now!

1011
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,826
- Your ammo now!
- Ammunition ready, sir!

1012
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,245
Stand by!

1013
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,340
Agu and Strika.

1014
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,591
Yes, sir!

1015
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:47,013
See this thing, huh?
This is a very special device.

1016
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:52,269
We can be seeing the enemy
even when the enemy is hiding.

1017
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,521
Come.

1018
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,398
Wait, Strika.

1019
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:04,489
Ah! There you go. See our guys.
Look, we are taking them.

1020
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,117
You see?

1021
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,289

- See that?
- Yeah.

Uh-huh.

01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,633
- [Commandant] No retreat!
- [all] No surrender!

1057
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,593
No retreat!

1058
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,677
- No retreat!
- [all] No surrender!

1059
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,637
We're moving!

1060
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,222
We're moving!

1061
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,475
- No retreat!
- [all] No surrender!

1062
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,643
We're moving!

1063
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,439
[speaking native language]

1064
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,111
[shouting in English] No retreat!

1065
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,571
- [shouting in English] No retreat!
- [all yelling] No surrender!

1066
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,574
[yelling]

1067
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,041
[chanting in native language]

1068
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,879
[all yelling]

1069
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,143
[firing]

1070
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,480
[soldier] Move it!
[Commandant] Move it!

1071
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,699
[soldier] Move it! Move it!

1072
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,745
[all yelling]

1073
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,586
[soldier] Move it!

1074
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,258
[all singing in native language]

1075
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,127
[Preacher] Our Father,
from dust we were created.

1076
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,879
We shall go back to dust.

1077
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,673
[Commandant] Eleven of my men. Gone.

1078
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,759
[Two-I-C] I commit my fellow soldiers
into your hands.

1079
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,887
May their soul rest in peace. Amen.

1080
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,602
[Agu] <i>I am now knowing
the smell of the dead.</i>

1081
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,604
<i>They are sweet like sugarcane</i>

1082
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,733
<i>and rotten like palm wine.</i>

1083
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:55,905
<i>And when they stay in the sun, they are
growing plump like brown mangoes.</i>

1084
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,713
[Commandant faintly] Very true, sir.

1085
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,797
[Agu] Strika.

1086
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,966
[indistinct radio chatter]

1087
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,476
[Agu] What?

1088
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,937
[Goodblood on radio]
<i>You have your next mission. Stand by.</i>

1089
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,856
[Commandant faintly]
You are loud, Supremo.

1090
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,734
[Goodblood] <i>Capture the central regions,
capital city, Bov.</i>

1091
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,860
<i>When you accomplish that,</i>

1092
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,030
<i>I will promulgate an order
making you Brigadier General.</i>

1093
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,324
<i>You'll be a general before
we finally seize the capital city.</i>

1094
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,243
[Commandant] Yes, sir.
It is a challenge, sir.

1095
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,747
But I promise you,
it's mission possible. Over.

1096
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,498
[Goodblood]
<i>Well, then, next time I see you,</i>

1097
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,167
<i>I'll be speaking to a general.</i>

1098
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,128
<i>And how is your Two-I-C performing? Over.</i>

1099
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,048
Two-I-C? Sorry, sir.
What do you mean "Two-I-C"?

1100
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,800
[Goodblood] <i>I've always rated
that young man.</i>

1101
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,761
Well, Two-I-C is
a formidable soldier.

1102
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,137
Over.

1103
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,431
[Goodblood] <i>Teach him
the ways of a good commander.</i>

1104
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:04,557
Yes, sir.

1105
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,685
[Goodblood] <i>Now, take Bov.
Keep that spirit up,</i>

1106
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,436
<i>and bring us closer to victory.</i>

1107
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,689
[Commandant] Of course, Supremo. Over.

1108
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,942
[Goodblood] <i>You want to be a general,
don't you, Commandant?</i>

1109
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,109
Yes, sir.

1110
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,610
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Earn it. Over and out.</i>

1111
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:18,321
Over and out.

1112
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,075
Agu, you fought well today.

1113
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,492
- Agu, you fought well today.
- Thank you, sir.

1114
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,413
A-ha! What is this?

1115
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,041
Ah!

1116
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,336
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1117
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,297
[Commandant chuckles]

1118
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,843
Agu, you are wanting to
be knowing how to be leading?

1119
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,386
I am happy to be following you, sir.

1120
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,387
- I am happy to be following you, sir.
- That is good,

1121
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:48,226
because there is no learning
how to be leading.

1122
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,771
Some people are born to be leaders,
others are born to be followers,

1123
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,733
and others are just waiting to be dying.

1124
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,525
I'm a good follower, sir.

1125
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,069
- I'm a good follower, sir.
- Agu, you are different.

1126
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,905
You are reminding me of
when I was a small boy.

1127
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:04,743
That is how I know
you are going to be a leader.

1128
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,829
You see, even the best leader

1129
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:12,083
sometimes he must be knowing
how to be a follower.

1130
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,128
Ah, even me.

1131
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:21,425
I am following the Supreme Commandant,
even if I am not agreeing.

1132
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,887
Huh?

1133
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,098
Yes, sir.
I'm a good follower.

1134
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,349
[chuckles]

1135
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,394
You are seeing this place?

1136
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:35,523
The Commandant is saying
we must take this.

1137
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,733
That it is important.

1138
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:41,070
So, hmm, if it is important to him,
it is important to me.

1139
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,446
[Agu] Yes, sir.

1140
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,118
Because if we get that,
then we can go to Taro.

1141
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,254
That is where your mother is, eh?

1142
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,089
- That is where your mother is, eh?
- She is in the capital.

1143
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,677
[Commandant] Come, Agu.

1144
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,263
After we've been greeted
by Dada Goodblood,

1145
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,016
we'll be taking the capital certainly.

1146
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,439
Come.

1147
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,406
This one has special juju.

1148
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,699
Thank you, sir.

1149
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:30,286
You see, I've been wanting to help you
more than the others, Agu,

1150
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,582
but you cannot be telling the others
how I'm helping you like this.

1151
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,750
It'll have to be our secret.

1152
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,170
You are knowing how to keep secret?

1153
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,004
- You are knowing how to keep secret?
- Yes, sir.

1154
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,714
Well, be saying it.

1155
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,092
- Well, be saying it.
- I can be keeping this secret, sir.

1156
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,760
[sighs]

1157
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,898
I'm not punishing you, Agu.
Mmm?

1158
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,151
But I do care for you.

1159
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,578
[sniffs]

1160
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,123
[snorts]

1161
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,255
Aye.

1162
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,300
Agu, kneel down.

1163
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:39,105
Be doing this thing... for me.

1164
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,741
[distant footsteps]

1165
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,461
[Agu breathing heavily]

1166
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:32,700
[chickens clucking]

1167
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,493
- [chickens clucking]
- [boy 1] They are jumping like rabbits.

1168
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,998
Move, move to your left.

1169
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,588
- Go, go. Keep going.
- [boy 1] Go. Keep going.

1170
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,048
- Keep going.
- Move, move.

1171
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,217
[boy 2] To your left side.

1172
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:51,760
[chicken clucking]

1173
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,262
- [chicken clucking]
- [children talking indistinctly]

1174
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,430
[Preacher] Agu.

1175
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,184
Agu?

1176
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,770
I don't want that I call you
and you just stand there. Agu?

1177
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,316
Come here,
I'll give you some brown-brown.

1178
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,361
It'll cure everything for you, eh.

1179
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,780
Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.

1180
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,035
Hmm?

1181
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:21,665
My boy, what is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

1182
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,211
Come here,
I'll give you some morale booster.

1183
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,672
I think I'll give you
that brown-brown, so...

1184
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,801
Morale booster, you know.
Come, come. Here.

1185
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,137
[Agu yelps]

1186
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,473
Yeah, that my boy.

1187
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,309
Yeah. Morale booster, eh?

1188
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,520
Make you strong.

1189
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,397
More protection.

1190
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,443
[Commandant] <i>Nobody is your friend
where we are going.</i>

1191
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,655
<i>They are the enemy.</i>

1192
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,409
<i>They are the farmers
that have fed the enemy.</i>

1193
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,286
- <i>The farmers' wives whose breasts...</i>
- [Preacher] Agu. Agu.

1194
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,828
<i>... have been feeding babies.</i>

1195
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,664
[Preacher] <i>Agu.</i>

1196
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:05,126
[Commandant] That is the nature
of the land that we are going.

1197
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,504
The collaborators and the traitors.

1198
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,840
<i>Our people's blood
has been flowing for years.</i>

1199
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,344
<i>That's why it is time
for their blood to flow.</i>

1200
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:18,681
- <i>We will spare nobody.</i>
- [all clamoring]

1201
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,891
We'll spare nobody,

1202
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:24,645
because they are all enemy,
all of them!

1203
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,773
Let us pray.

1204
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,528
God, let us pray.

1205
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:37,658
<i>He is guiding us with
what we are about to be doing.</i>

1206
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,243
<i>He is helping us.</i>

1207
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,081
<i>Let us fulfill your justice.</i>

1208
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,418
<i>Give us the strength!</i>

1209
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,506
<i>God, we will be sacrificing our blood!</i>

1210
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,676
<i>That is why we must spare nobody!</i>

1211
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,554
<i>We will spare nobody!</i>

1212
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,139
<i>Nothing will hurt us.</i>

1213
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,892
[camera clicking]

1214
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:08,064
<i>Because we are invincible.
We are invincible!</i>

1215
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,653
[indistinct chanting]

1216
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,949
- [soldier] NDF! NDF!
- [all responding indistinctly]

1217
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,409
- Who are we?
- [all] NDF, sir!

1218
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:21,744
- Who are we?
- [all] NDF, sir!

1219
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:22,661
Who are we?

1220
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,537
- Who are we?
- [all] NDF, sir!

1221
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:32,171
[soldiers chanting in native language]

1222
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,980
[Commandant shouting in English]
NDF, spare nobody!

1223
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:51,815

01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:20,856
At ease, gentlemen.

1395
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,774
At ease.

1396
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,948
[chuckles]

1397
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,995
It looks like your family has grown.

1398
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,916
They must eat while we talk,
unless you are hungry, too.

1399
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,585
I'm not hungry. Two-I-C,
take them and go and eat.

1400
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:45,380
Two-I-C, you stay.

1401
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,589
Come.

1402
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,597
[Preacher] Lot of food over here.
Let's eat, man!

1403
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:57,184
I love food.

1404
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,145
[soldiers chatting indistinctly]

1405
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,775
What is this?

1406
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,363
You have made me wait.

1407
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:15,452
You are leading me to believe
we are changing objectives.

1408
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,413
Are we not taking the capital anymore?

1409
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,625
Chief, to protect our people,
the time is now.

1410
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:27,880
If we have the momentum
and we have the power, why wait?

1411
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:33,345
You are not the political voice
of this movement, Commandant. I am.

1412
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:37,765
Protecting our people
remains the priority.

1413
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:41,894
But as you know, the world is
becoming aware of this war now.

1414
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:45,815
No one will escape judgment
when it is over.

1415
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,778
And the decisions we make
have far deeper consequences.

1416
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:55,492
And what decisions have you made...
for my battalion?

1417
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,622
Are you not making me general?

1418
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,749
No, I am not.

1419
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:06,294
I'm giving your battalion
to Two-I-C, Commandant.

1420
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,712
That is why I brought you here.

1421
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:12,717
And you, I will promote
to Deputy Chief of Security,

1422
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,801
effective immediately.

1423
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,639
I hope you accept and act accordingly.

1424
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,099
[Two-I-C stands to attention]

1425
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,476
Thank you, sir. I promise
to fulfill my duty to the fullest...

1426
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:22,560
[Commandant] Two-I-C, shut your mouth!

1427
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,023
Get out!

1428
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,652
Soldiers.

1429
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,454
[Commandant] You are demoting me.

1430
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:47,335
This, my battalion...
that I have made with my own hands.

1431
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:49,003
I'm their father!

1432
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,340
Your battalion is my battalion,
Commandant,

1433
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,967
as are hundreds of others
across this nation.

1434
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:58,305
I want the ceremony of changeover
tomorrow,

1435
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:01,349
so that Two-I-C can take the battalion
back out for battle.

1436
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:05,520
As you know, and with thanks to you,
we have the NRC on their heels

1437
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:08,731
with the help and support
of the UN and ECOMOD.

1438
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:12,026
It has now become
a battle for public image.

1439
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,156
And what of my payment? Hmm?

1440
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,574
What of my payment?

1441
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:22,495
What share of the resources
will I be seeing?

1442
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,957
Do not forget you are a soldier.

1443
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,086
Your most important duty is obedience.

1444
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,628
Your first duty is obedience.

1445
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,505
Your second duty is obedience.

1446
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,300
Your third duty is obedience.
Everything is obedience.

1447
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,512
Without obedience, you have nothing.

1448
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,101
- [scoffs]
- Have you forgotten yourself?

1449
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,896
I have not forgotten myself.

1450
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,984
You are right.

1451
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:56,488
I'm a soldier...

1452
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:59,116
not a politician.

1453
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:06,206
I will have one more night...
with my men.

1454
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:11,961
Dada Goodblood.

1455
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:15,882

- Move out!
- [Tripod] Move!

1457

Move out!

1458
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:18,926
- Move out!
- Move out!

1459
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,595
Let's go.

1460
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,645
Tripod.

1461
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:29,562
- Tripod.
- Yes, sir.

1462
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:33,024
Assemble the COs and the troops
and bivouac outside of town.

1463
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:36,319
I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys
to all celebrate tonight.

1464
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,529
Yes, sir.

1465
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,322
Where are we going?

1466
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,410
You will see.

1467
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,328
You will like it.

1468
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:49,374
And if you and Strika are my bodyguards,
and I am going, then you are also going.

1469
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,334
Are you hearing me?

[Commandant] Yeah, make 'em bring
something for my soldiers.

Commandant, permission to be dismissed.

a special one for my Two-I-C,

Huh?

1591
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:59,721
That is why it is good
to always sleep one eye open.

So, you...
you are the big man now, huh?

1734
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:03,957
Hmm?

1735
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,209
Where will you be going? Huh?

1736
01:56:06,292 --> 01:56:09,295
Will you surrender to the other NDF camp?

1737
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:12,048
No. They will eat you.

1738
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:16,386
And what of ECOMOD? Huh?

1739
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:19,180
That might be better, but what next?

1740
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:21,182
Jail?

1741
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:23,184
War crimes?

1742
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:24,352
Huh?

1743
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:31,485
You think you can just go
and do what you want in peace?

1744
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:34,112
You will go back to your village

1745
01:56:34,195 --> 01:56:38,492
and your family will not
associate themselves with you.

1746
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:40,410
Huh? You will be nothing.

1747
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:44,748
You and your uneducated, poor mind,
you'll be nothing.

1748
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:48,334
Nobody will care for you. Huh?

1749
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:50,754
Look at you.

1750
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:57,343
And you will wake up and you will rise
and see the sunrise and see the sunset,

1751
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,889
and you can just wait all day, all day,

1752
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:05,602
with thousands of men just like you,
waiting for somebody to give you a job.

1753
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:06,728
Huh?

1754
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:10,023
That is what you want to go and do?

1755
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:13,151
You are stupid! [scoffs]

1756
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:16,655
You have nothing!
No future!

1757
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:17,906
I am your future.

1758
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,576
- You fucking die here, sir.
- [cocking gun]

1759
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:21,993
What?

1760
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:30,376
How are you going to shoot me
if you don't have bullets?

1761
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:35,423
And you, Agu?

1762
01:57:35,506 --> 01:57:37,425
You wanna kill Commandant?

1763
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:41,221
Hey, Agu, I want you
to kill Commandant. Come.

1764
01:57:41,304 --> 01:57:42,138
Push it.

1765
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:43,014
- Push it.
- [Preacher whispers] Do it.

1766
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,934
Come, Agu, come.
Put it here. Here!

1767
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,227
A-ha! A-ha!

1768
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,437
Wanna kill Commandant?

1769
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,439
[softly] Do it, Agu.

1770
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:53,441
Do it.

1771
01:57:53,524 --> 01:57:56,111
[Commandant] Kill Commandant!

1772
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:57,988
You wanna surrender?

1773
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,239
Huh?

1774
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:01,282
You wanna surrender?

1775
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:06,121
[gently] You wanna surrender?

1776
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:09,165
Yes.

1777
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,257
Hey, Agu.

1778
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,970
Just get out.

1779
01:58:24,765 --> 01:58:29,645
Just remember,
when you are all poor and hungry

1780
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,189
you'll remember me!

1781
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:37,068
You'll remember your Commandant.

1782
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,988
[yelling] Just go! Just go!

1783
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:41,865
Come on. Everybody, let's move!

1784
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,700
[soldier] Yes, sir!
[Preacher] Come on, let's go.

1785
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:48,038
And know that I will be
calling for you one day.

1786
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,960
Go and drink gunpowder tea
and playing draughts.

1787
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:58,131
No, no, no. You remember me.
You remember your Commandant.

1788
01:58:58,214 --> 01:59:00,216
You're gonna say, "Yeah!"

1789
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:06,890
Remember, I will call for you again...

1790
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:09,893
and you'll come.

1791
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:13,271
Remember.

1792
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,577
They will just lock you up in jail!
You are stupid!

1793
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:30,914
When the time come back,

1794
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:33,333
the other ones,
they'll come eat you.

1795
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:36,795
Just chop for you...
[stammering] your heart.

1796
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:39,547
Agu, you stay here because they don't...

1797
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:46,179
[thunder rumbling]

1798
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:24,342
- [soldier] Halt! Stop there!
- [guns cocking]

1799
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:25,635
Who are you?

1800
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:26,636
- Who are you?
- [Preacher] NDF, sir!

1801
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,721
[soldier] And what is your mission here?

1802
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:28,805
[Preacher] Surrender, sir!

1803
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:31,808
Raise up your arms!
All weapons in the air!

1804
02:00:31,892 --> 02:00:32,893
All of you!

1805
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:36,521
Now turn and face the bush!

1806
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:40,025
Don't look at my face!
Put your weapons on the ground!

1807
02:00:40,108 --> 02:00:43,361
Step back.
Step back!

1808
02:00:43,444 --> 02:00:45,488
And turn around!

1809
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:47,240
I said, turn around!

1810
02:00:47,323 --> 02:00:48,658
All right, hands up!

1811
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:51,244
Hands up! Sit on the floor!

1812
02:00:53,538 --> 02:00:54,873
[speaking native language]

1813
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:58,251
[speaking English] Sit down!

1814
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,379
Put your hands on your head!

1815
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,011
Don't look at my face!

1816
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:48,885
[inaudible]

1817
02:02:50,446 --> 02:02:52,657
[boys chatting indistinctly]

1818
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,431
[boys shouting playfully]

1819
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,018
[all clamoring]

1820
02:03:33,698 --> 02:03:35,408
[boys cheering]

1821
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,097
[Father Friday]
Agu, how are you settling in?

1822
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:59,140
Hmm?

1823
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:04,104
I know things are hard.

1824
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:06,772
I've been there, remember?

1825
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:11,152
We are all here to help you.

1826
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,947
Okay?

1827
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:17,075
[Agu] <i>I am not knowing
how long I am staying here...</i>

1828
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:21,537
<i>but I'm staying here for a long time.</i>

1829
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:28,669
<i>Some week, some month, I am not knowing.</i>

1830
02:04:30,921 --> 02:04:34,217
<i>All I am knowing
is how it is feeling here.</i>

1831
02:04:36,761 --> 02:04:42,017
<i>I am knowing the sound of people screaming
and the smell of dead bodies...</i>

1832
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,393
[gasping]

1833
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:48,731
<i>and I am knowing the feeling of
the brown-brown and</i> djamba <i>in my blood.</i>

1834
02:04:50,108 --> 02:04:51,776
[singing in native language]

1835
02:04:57,073 --> 02:04:58,866
[speaking English] Hey, calm down!

1836
02:04:58,949 --> 02:05:00,243
This is your home!

1837
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,745
No, they are giving us poison there!

1838
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,497
- They want us to die!
- [boys] Yes!

1839
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:06,082
- They want us to die!
- [Father Friday] Calm!

1840
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:08,793
[Agu] <i>Preacher is tiring of this place.</i>

1841
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:10,920
<i>He's saying, "The war is not over,</i>

1842
02:05:11,004 --> 02:05:13,714
<i>"and they are needing fighters like us."</i>

1843
02:05:13,798 --> 02:05:16,926
We need money for here.
We need money. Eh?

1844
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,054
You can't stay here without money.

1845
02:05:19,845 --> 02:05:22,265
And we're soldiers,

1846
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:24,642
fighting is what we know.

1847
02:05:24,725 --> 02:05:26,769
That's what we should do.

1848
02:05:26,852 --> 02:05:29,564
Have you forgotten?
We have food to eat.

1849
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,274
- We have shelter.
- Shh!

1850
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:37,280
And even we learn, we learn.

1851
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,156
- And even we learn, we learn.
- Yeah.

1852
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:39,532
[Preacher] You for shut up!

1853
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:42,785
You NRC soldier,
with the talk, you talk too much.

1854
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:47,332
Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving.

1855
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:49,167
Preacher!

1856
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:50,043
- Preacher!
- Let's go!

1857
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,089
Randy, don't go into the bush again.

1858
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:57,758
Don't follow Preacher.

1859
02:05:57,842 --> 02:06:00,178
Randy!

1860
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:16,902
I don't like when you look into my eyes.

1861
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:20,906
So if I look at a table,
how can I talk to you?

1862
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:22,492
[Agu] <i>Amy.</i>

1863
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:24,619
<i>She thinks that my no speaking</i>

1864
02:06:24,702 --> 02:06:28,414
<i>is because I can't be
explaining myself like baby,</i>

1865
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,500
<i>but I am not like baby.</i>

1866
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:34,712
<i>I am like old man
and she's like small girl</i>

1867
02:06:34,795 --> 02:06:39,967
<i>because I am fighting in war
and she's not even knowing what war is.</i>

1868
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,220
Try.

1869
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:46,307
Try to talk to me about
some of your experiences...

1870
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:51,437
or try to tell me what you are thinking.

1871
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:56,442
I'm thinking about my future.

1872
02:06:57,777 --> 02:06:58,861
[Amy] Very good.

1873
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:01,114
Very good.

1874
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:04,159
So how do you see your future?

1875
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:14,502
Do me this favor, okay?

1876
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:24,637
I think if you talk to me about it,
it will make you feel better.

1877
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,356
I saw terrible things...

1878
02:07:37,858 --> 02:07:40,695
and I did terrible things.

1879
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:43,781
So if I'm talking to you,

1880
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:49,204
it will make me sad...
and it will make you, too, sad.

1881
02:07:49,287 --> 02:07:50,871
In this life...

1882
02:07:52,748 --> 02:07:55,876
I just want to be happy in this life.

1883
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:01,090
If I'm telling this to you...

1884
02:08:04,969 --> 02:08:07,305
you will think that...

1885
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,141
[sighs]

1886
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:15,020
I am some sort of beast...

1887
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:19,317
or devil.

1888
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,656
I am all of these things...

1889
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,536
but I also having mother...

1890
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:35,916
father...

1891
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:41,256
brother and sister once.

1892
02:08:43,341 --> 02:08:45,551
They loved me.

1893
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:01,651
[all yelling playfully]

1894
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,161
