Get this written up ASAP.

Obviously, it's a big shock. It's a...massive terrible shock.

- No time to lose, Simon.

- Yes, boss.

172
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,280
- That the report? 
- Yup. 

173
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Millsy... 

174
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
It's for my lot, Simon. It's not for your lot. 

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,280
I know we're from different regiments, 

176
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,680
but we're on the same team. 

177
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
You and me, corporals together. 

178
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
You're a lance corporal. 

179
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,120
Yes, but...come on. 

180
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,320
OK, look, I just need to know where you were when the shot was fired. 

181
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Just put, "There was nothing we could have done to prevent it." 

182
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
OK. 

183
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,640
Um... 

184
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not "very little we could have done". 

185
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,680
Nothing. Nothing we could have done. 

186
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,920
No thing. 

187
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
No...no thing. 

188
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Millsy! What's wrong with you? Not "almost nothing". 

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,720
Not "practically nothing". Nothing. 

190
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,440
- But... 
- What could we have done? 

191
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,080
- Tell me that. 
- OK. 

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
The moment he took his helmet off, 

193
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
you could have wrestled him to the ground. 

194
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,520
You wanted me to wrestle 

195
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,680
a CIA former special-forces Iraq veteran to the ground. 

196
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
- Would have saved his life. 
- Yeah, but it wouldn't have saved mine. 

197
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
Because he'd have killed me! 

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,560
Nothing. 

199
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,960
- Nothing, short of wrestling him... 
- Oh, give that here! 

200
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,400
He's quick. He is quick. 

201
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,160
- So, poor Colonel Carter. 
- Yes, tragic loss. 

202
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,240
A great soldier. 

203
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,640
Five minutes ago, he was a bit of a bell-end. 

204
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,160
That would be the grief talking. Anger. Denial. 

205
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,840
- Sadness. 
- It must have been very traumatic 

206
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,160
- for your whole team. 
- Yeah. They are a bit shaken up. 

207
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,360
So, if anyone needs to come and talk to me, I'll drop everything. 

208
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,080
Well, I was thinking the two of us could spend some time... 

209
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,600
The young lads particularly. It can hit them very hard. 

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
- Give it back! 
- I just want tae borrow your wank mag! 

211
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
Get off! 

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,520
- This your mum, Rocket? 
- Go fuck yourself. 

213
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm trying to. 

214
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,720
THUD Padre. 

215
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,960
Padre, this is Mac and Rocket. 

216
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,320
They're both privates, appropriately enough. 

217
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
Guys, if you wanted to drop in, have a chat, 

218
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
you know, after what happened to Colonel Carter... 

219
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,000
He took his fucking helmet off! 

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,160
Ma'am. 

221
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,520
It was...pretty full on. 

222
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,880
- AMERICAN ACCENT: 
- Not as full on as Fallujah, huh? 

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,680
Not now, Mac. 

224
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
Still too soon, aye? 

225
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,320
- Yeah. 
- Fuck. 

226
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
- Toffee? 
- BOTH: 
- Brilliant. 

227
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and see a man about a wank. 

228
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,040
- All right, Bird? 
- Fucking amateurs. 

229
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,720
Bird, Padre. Padre, Bird. 

230
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,320
Er...does everyone call her that? 

231
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Bird's my name. Lynda Bird. 

232
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,960
I don't have a problem with that, 

233
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
and I don't think anyone else does...ma'am. 

234
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,760
Oh. Sorry. 

235
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Toffee? And if you also want to come in for a chat... 

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,600
I heard about what happened this morning. 

237
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
Yeah. Messy. 

238
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
Have you seen the robot? 

239
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,520
REME don't have a bloody clue what they're doing. 

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,760
What, a team of highly trained technicians don't have a bloody... 

241
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,800
- They are wrecking him. 
- Him? 

242
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
It. 

243
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
Wrecking it. 

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
I haven't named the robot, OK? 

245
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
Well, you should. He'll be annoyed. 

246
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,120
I'm not some dappy cow who's got a name for their Nissan Micra. 

247
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Oh, I used to call mine Bertie. 

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,960
And that's why you're a Padre and I'm a soldier. 

249
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Just one of the lads, yeah? 

250
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,960
Well, even lads have a sensitive side, so... 

251
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,120
- SHE BELCHES 
- Yeah. 

252
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,440
- Er...my door's always open. 
- Uh-huh. 

253
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
Winning their trust, it always takes a while. 

254
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
Actually, it would probably help if I came out into the field with you. 

255
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
Could I do that? 

256
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
Couldn't you just stay here and pray or something? 

257
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,440
It's just we try not to take passengers. 

258
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,560
You took Colonel Carter. 

259
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,120
Yeah, and look what happened to that twat. 

260
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
May he rest in peace. 

261
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
Sorry, Padre, you've only just arrived. It's not going to happen. 

262
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,520
All right? 

263
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,640
Ooh, you look like a cat that's just been spayed. 

264
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,560
- Huh? 
- Nick knock you back? 

265
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah, I wanted to... 

266
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,400
Oh, no, no, no. Not like that. 

267
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
- I'm the Padre, so... 
- No shagging? 

268
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,680
Er...let's just say I'd be looking for the right context. 

269
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,600
- No shagging till you're married? 
- Well, as a Christian, I think it is 

270
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
important to save that particular act... 

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
- So, you don't want to shag him? 
- It's more a case of... 

272
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
- Simple yes or no's what I'm looking for. 
- I'm not... 

273
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,640
- Just curious. Yes or no? 
- It's...I just... 

274
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,720
- Yes or no? Yes or no? 
- I'd rather... 
- Listen. 

275
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,840
It's a simple question. Yes or no? 

276
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,440
- It's really not quite that... 
- OK. 

277
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
OK, fine. 

278
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,640
Oral? 

279
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,040
Oh...! 

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,240
- So, did ye...defrock her? 
- Sorry? 

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,200
Sister Mary. Did you get your winkle up her wimple? 

282
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,560
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 

283
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Do you really fancy that new Padre? 

284
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
You can't fancy the Padre. 

285
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,720
She's...the Padre. Oh, it'd be like shagging God. 

286
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,760
- She's a good-looking woman. 
- A MILF? 

287
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,320
A NILF! A nun he'd like to fuck. 

288
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
- She's not a nun, she's a vicar. 
- A VILF. 

289
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,120
Hang on. She's called Sister Mary, but she's not a nun? 

290
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
You're the ones calling her Sister, 

291
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,640
and she is C of E so everything is negotiable. 

292
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,160
HE HOOTS 

293
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,080
- Cat flap and back door? 
- You, Mac, will be struck down. 

294
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,120
Aye. But I'll die wi' a smile on my face. 

295
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,920
So, listen, guys, this morning was tough, 

296
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,400
but what happened wasn't your fault, OK, and... Oh, hi, Mary. 

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,320
Have you heard anything about this funeral? 

298
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
Funeral? 

299
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
Apparently, Colonel Carter expressed a wish to be buried in action. 

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
- Er...he wanted what? 
- Is that a real thing? 

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,200
Right! Let's get to it! BIA. 

302
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,240
- BIA? 
- Mm. Buried In Action. 

303
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,680
So, we'll need a grave dug. Mac, Rocket. 

304
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,840
- TOGETHER: 
- Oh, for fuck's sake! 

305
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Simon. There's no such thing as being buried in action. 

306
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
Well, there might have to be, 

307
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,920
because this came direct from the CIA. 

308
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,960
Look, we're not going to... CIA.com. 

309
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,400
- Yep, we are pretty much doing this. 
- Get digging! Now. 

310
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
- Please, no, Skip. 
- Guys. 

311
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,320
We're off. Suspected IED in Red 32. Transport in 20 minutes. 

312
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,280
Er...we could take Carter wi' us, save us the work. 

313
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,320
If we do a controlled explosion... Pupp! Pop him in that. 

314
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Pkow! 

315
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
- Jesus, Mac. 
- What? 

316
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,760
It's what he would have wanted. 

317
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
- Robot's in working order again, boss. 
- Is he? 

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,920
- It, boss. It is. 
- OK. 

319
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Well, send him down. 

320
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,520
Bird, did you pick up anything from the new Padre? 

321
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,800
- Er...mixed signals, boss. 
- Really? 

322
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,840
I mean, she does know how fucking brave I am, right? 

323
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
I mean, I am the bomb guy. 

324
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Risking life and limb. 

325
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,040
- Saving orphans. 
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

326
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,400
- What does your women's intuition say? 
- Get the big guns out. 

327
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,880
Understood. 

328
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,240
Good work, Bird. 

329
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,080
- Arthur! 
- OTHERS SNORT 

330
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,760
OK, he's not called Arthur. 

331
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,440
Well, er...he is now. Come on, Arthur. 

332
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
Come on, Arthur, climb the ditch. 

333
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120
Come on, Arthur. You can do it, Arthur. 

334
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,800
Oh. Well, would you look at that? Arthur just became Martha. 

335
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,720
- Ha-ha(!) 
- OK, boss, it's your turn. 

336
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
- Let's get you into the suit. 
- Ah, Millsy, no, please. 

337
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,840
It's 50 degrees in the shade. Don't make me put it on. 

338
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,560
It's actually two degrees cooler 

339
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,480
than it was yesterday, boss. Come on. 

340
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,800
So, what's your laptop called, then, Bird? 

341
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,120
- It's called a Toshiba A30X. 
- Or Douglas to its friends. 

342
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,000
- What, so you've never named anything? 
- Naw! 

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,200
- I named my cock. 
- Oh, yeah. 

344
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,720
How is Andy McNab? 

345
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,280
Why would you name your cock Andy McNab? 

346
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,960
Cos he's seen so much active service. 

347
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
I thought it was cos it was so hard to find. 

348
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,480
I thought it was cos it always comes out with bollocks. 

349
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
Oh, very good, very good indeed. 

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,800
Shall I fetch the robot, boss? 

351
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,040
- Nah. 
- You mean Arthur? 

352
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,160
If you call him Arthur one more time, you might find 

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,360
that Andy McNab has been cut off behind enemy lines. 

354
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,360
That's when Andy's at his strongest. He'll live off nuts and berries. 

355
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
That doesn't make any fucking sense. 

356
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,480
Let's do this. 

357
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,200
Boss? Boss, what is it? What have you got? 

358
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
Oh, you're gonna like this one, Millsy. 

359
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,280
- What is it? 
- It's a Walkman, Millsy. 

360
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,440
You made me put on this baking hot suit for a bloody Walkman under a bloody rock. 

361
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,480
# Slam it to the left If you're having a good time 

362
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,000
# Shake it to the right If you know that you feel fine... # 

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Hey, it still works. 

364
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,240
# Slam it to the left If you're having a good time 

365
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,920
# Shake it to the right... # 

366
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
MUSIC STOPS 

367
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think it does. 

368
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,400
Boss? Boss, I've got a couple of questions about the report. 

369
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,920
Simon keeps saying that there was absolutely... 

370
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,280
And march. 

371
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,040
- Knock, knock? 
- Come in. 

372
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
Hi. Sorry I'm late. 

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,400
I know we said six, but, er...we had a call-out. 

374
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,320
Red 32 can be pretty hairy. 

375
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,440
I heard you found a Walkman. 

376
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
Yes. 

377
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,200
But you fill one of those bad boys with the right stuff, 

378
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
it could take your arm off. 

379
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,040
I was so excited when I got my first Walkman. I was eight. 

380
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,440
- Were you? 
- Yeah, it was pink. I put stickers on it. 

381
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,960
- Did you? 
- Ah, innocent times. 

382
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,640
Mm. Can I give you a finger? 

383
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,760
- What? 
- Of Scotch. 

384
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,520
- Confiscated from a reporter. 
- Oh. 

385
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,680
- So, are you allowed "the booze"? 
- Are you? 

386
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,240
- No. 
- Well, me neither. 

387
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,480
Apart from communion. You have to have wine for communion. 

388
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Yes, you do. I pretty much have to have wine for communion. 

389
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,200
- KNOCK AT DOOR 
- Boss. Padre. 

390
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,440
Sorry to interrupt. 

391
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,560
It's just, um...when you sent me away before, 

392
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,840
was that one of your jokes? 

393
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Because I've got a question about the report. 

394
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,680
In fact, even if it wasn't, 

395
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
I've still got a question about the report. 

396
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,480
Actually, I've got two questions and a subsidiary question and... 

397
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
- Ooh, Scotch. 
- No, it isn't. 

398
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Just sort it out with Simon. 

399
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,640
The Padre and I were just talking about communion. 

400
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, right. Do you use Scotch for communion? 

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,320
You have to in Scotland. 

402
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,680
Really? Church is very popular there. 

403
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,360
- Yes, and they deep-fry the wafers. 
- Oh. 

404
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,920
Now, off you fuck. 

405
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,080
Oh. 

406
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
So, where were we? 

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,920
- Cheers. 
- Cheers. 

408
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
So, look at you, breaking all the rules. 

409
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,320
Contrary to popular belief, 

410
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm not a nun and I wasn't always a Christian. 

411
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,880
- Really? 
- Yeah. I've done some... 

412
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,640
you know...shit. 

413
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,040
But we're not here to talk about me. 

414
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Well, we could be. 

415
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,320
So, how are you, Nick? 

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Well, maybe I'm becoming too battle-hardened. 

417
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,800
When Colonel Carter died, 

418
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,320
I just felt nothing. 

419
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,680
Some mild irritation at the paperwork. 

420
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,920
That wasn't even that bad in the end. Got Millsy to do it. 

421
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,240
I just worry that, um... 

422
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
I worry that I'm becoming cold. 

423
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,760
In need of warmth. 

424
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,080
Yes? 

425
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,760
Well, er... 

426
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,240
it's the solitude. 

427
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,200
You know, you, er...you walk to the device alone. You work alone. 

428
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,400
One mistake, and you die alone. 

429
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,440
I remember my first bomb after I lost my best mate. 

430
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,720
Steve. 

431
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,560
Good ATO. 

432
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
It was just outside al Hartha. 

433
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,200
We had a report of multiple devices on the main road into Basra city. 

434
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,240
- It was just coming up to 1100 hours... 
- Can I just stop you there? 

435
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,280
I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I think it's only fair to say, 

436
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,040
however this story ends, I'm not going to sleep with you. 

437
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,040
Well, this has been great. Thanks for listening. I feel better already. 

438
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,080
- Bye now. 
- Bye. 

439
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,280
Mm. 

440
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Whoa! Whoa! 

441
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,400
- Yeah, yeah. 
- What, what, what? 

442
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,360
I said six foot deep, not six foot wide! 

443
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,440
- Come on! 
- Bird, a word. 

444
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
Boss? 

445
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,440
- You're a woman. 
- Boss. 

446
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,600
What's Mary's problem? 

447
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
I mean, usually by now it'd be game over. I save lives. 

448
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
The only thing sexier than a man with a gun who shoots people 

449
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,480
is a man with a gun who doesn't shoot people. 

450
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,880
I've got a gun. I haven't shot anyone. 

451
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Well, hardly anyone. I mean, seriously? 

452
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
OK, what did she say? 

453
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
She said, "I'm not going to sleep with you." 

454
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
- That's not very Christian. 
- Thank you! 

455
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,080
I mean, come on! 

456
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,920
- Did you do the al Hartha story? 
- Yes. Nothing. 

457
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,680
Maybe she's got quite a strong bullshit detector. 

458
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
That is a true story. 

459
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,080
Yeah. But it didn't happen to you, did it? 

460
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,480
- Happened to Captain Ryerson. 
- Yeah, we swapped. 

461
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,160
He uses my Belfast story, cos it works better with his accent. 

462
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Look, there's nothing else for it. 

463
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,440
You're gonna have to let her see you in action. 

464
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,280
What on earth do you think you're doing, digging a bloody great hole in my base? 

465
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,520
It's for Colonel Carter, sir. 

466
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,040
Given the tragic nature of his death, 

467
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
we wanted to give him a good send-off. 

468
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,480
There is nothing that we could have done to prevent... 

469
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,400
What's the first rule? Don't dig up the base! 

470
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,560
- Padre said... 
- Don't dig it up. 

471
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,880
Stop showing initiative, Lansley. Just do your job. 

472
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,520
Sir. 

473
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
Anyway, he apparently wanted to be buried in Fallujah. 

474
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,200
- Demented. And Nick? 
- Sir? 

475
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
- Hurry up with that report. 
- Sir. 

476
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,680
- Millsy? 
- Boss? 
- Hurry up with that report. 
- Yes, boss. 

477
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,200
So, Padre, today I pit my brain against the bomb-maker's brain. 

478
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,680
Mano-a-mano. 

479
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,000
Er...boss? I fixed Arthur. 

480
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,960
We could send him down. Robot-a-mano. 

481
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,680
I think it's going to need the human touch. 

482
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,520
Yeah, I just have a feeling about this one, boss. 

483
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,840
A feeling, Bird? Oh, goody! So, we're relying on women's intuition? 

484
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,960
I wouldn't knock "women's intuition", boss. 

485
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
OK, send him down. 

486
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
Be quick. 

487
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,840
OK, ready, boss. 

488
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,840
More to the general direction of the mountain? 

489
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,760
If you would. 

490
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,440
Oh, it's quite exciting, isn't it? 

491
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,960
Yes. Quite. 

492
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Boss, I don't want to say anything, but I should be driving the robot. 

493
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,560
Don't say anything, then. 

494
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,200
Of course, the, er...the robot rarely finds what you're looking for. 

495
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,360
Ultimately, it's just... 

496
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,920
one man alone, 

497
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,240
not knowing what each step will bring, trying to... 

498
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,840
No! 

499
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,720
Ow! That is really fucking hot. 

500
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,200
This dust is really... 

501
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,480
- Get down! 
- Oh! 

502
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,880
Gosh. 

503
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,720
Sorry. 

504
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,160
Oh! 

505
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,400
Sorry. It's just, er...well, you did say you'd drop everything. 

506
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,880
Oh, ha-ha! That's very good. 

507
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,200
Look, um...I just wanted to see whether you were all right. 

508
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
So, you waited till I was just out of the shower? 

509
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,280
What? 

510
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,720
I had no idea that you were just... 

511
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,240
you were just out of the shower. 

512
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Explosions can affect people in weird ways. 

513
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
I just wanted to see if you were OK. 

514
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,560
Yeah. Sorry. 

515
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,640
Yeah, I am... I'm a little bit on edge. 

516
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,680
- MILLSY ON RADIO: 
- 'She's just got out of the shower. Go in now, sir. Over.' 

517
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,240
Er... 

518
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
They'll say anything, that lot. 

519
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,920
- Bye now. 
- Wait. Look, I'm sorry. OK, I'm sorry. 

520
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,360
Look, it's just... 

521
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Look, I'm a soldier. 

522
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
OK? I don't know how to approach someone like you, someone who's... 

523
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
..someone who's good. 

524
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,560
Look, you were there today. 

525
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,520
That could have been me. I just... 

526
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
I...I go through that every day. 

527
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,520
And, er... 

528
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,600
..I just don't know how much time I have left. 

529
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,520
Look. 

530
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,280
I know you're under unimaginable stress. 

531
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,520
But aren't you a bit better than...this? 

532
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,640
- Am I? 
- Aren't you? 

533
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,160
- Well, am I? 
- Well, are you?

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,280
Er...the funeral was cancelled, right? 

536
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,480
- I thought so. 
- I'd better throw some clothes on. 

537
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,600
Great. 

538
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,960
- So, um...off you fuck. 
- What? 

539
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,080
Oh! Oh.

Is it back on?

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,800
What? Oh. 

544
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
Very good.

- Let her through, let her through.

Oh, very funny. 

547
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,480
We are gathered here today to remember Arthur the robot. 

548
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,800
I now call upon Arthur's best friend, Corporal Lynda Bird. 

549
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,880
Who likes a bit of mechanical assistance. 

550
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
- Ha-ha(!) 
- What's going on? 

551
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,160
Oh, for heaven's sake, get it filled in. 

552
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
Well, ashes to ashes. 

553
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,560
Rust to rust.

- What's going on here? 
- Just filling in the grave, sir. 

556
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
Good. Good. And thanks for the report. Very clear. 

557
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
- Thank you, sir. 
- Looks like there was nothing you could have done. 

558
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,000
That's right, sir. Absolutely nothing. 

559
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,320
Short of wrestling him to the ground. 

560
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,880
But that would be the act of a total lunatic. 

561
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,760
- It would, sir. 
- A total lunatic, sir. 

562
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,680
Oh, and that robot you lost this morning. 

563
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
REME want to take a look at him. 

564
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,120
Don't know where he is, but, er... dig him out, would you? 

565
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,280
Sir. 

566
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,360
- Mac? Rocket? Get to it. 
- TOGETHER: 
- Ah, fuck! 

567
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,560
Bird, I'm so sorry for your loss. Arthur was... 

568
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,400
- Piss off, Nick. 
- Boss, we're up! 

569
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,480
- Suspected IED in Yellow 21. 
- OK, Bluestone 42.
