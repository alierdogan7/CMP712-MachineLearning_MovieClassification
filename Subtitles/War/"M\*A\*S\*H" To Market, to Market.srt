1
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:16,811
- You having much pain?
- Not much.

2
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:20,754
- But I'm a little groggy.
- I'm a little groggy myself.

3
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:24,351
- Wanna lie down?
- You better save your strength.

4
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,865
- Major.
- Oh, Able, I'm glad you're here.
I need some rest.

5
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,994
Yeah, you really look beat.
Good, but beat.

6
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,004
- Thanks.
- Good night.

7
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,438
It's nearly morning.

8
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:41,204
Halt! Who goes there?

9
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:43,302
Klinger, you're a disgrace
to the army.

10
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,144
Thank you, ma'am. I'm doing my best.
I'll escort you to your tent.

11
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,514
- Over my dead body.
- That's possible, Major.

12
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:50,917
Some North Korean prisoners
have been released in the area.

13
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:53,683
An attractive person
like yourself might be in danger.

14
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,691
Of course,
the same is true for me.

15
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,125
I can take care of myself,
Cinderella.

16
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,719
I understand this is a good neighborhood
to pick up sailors.

17
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:05,200
- Oh, can it.
- Halt! Who goes there?

18
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:07,736
She's either surrendering
or signaling for a touchdown.

19
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:11,535
- [Speaking Korean]
- What the hell is she saying?

20
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,599
Her mother's giving birth
and needs help.

21
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:17,204
[Korean]
I'll get my bag.

22
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,651
This is what happens to you
when you don't eat your vegetables.

23
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,122
I'll be back as soon as I can.

24
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,649
- But, ma'am, that's dangerous!
- I'll be fine. [Korean]

25
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:34,720
If anything happens to you,
can I have your clothes?

## [Singing]

27
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:47,143
- Klinger, I'm here to relieve you.
- Good. Undo my bra.

28
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,338
I usually don't let guys
do this on the first date.

30
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:07,953
Ooh.

31
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,903
Looks like you're gonna be wearing
a bigger hat for a while, soldier.

32
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,273
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:18,331
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,741
I can't make this out.
When did he last have morphine?

35
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,644
I can't read it either.
It's Major Houlihan's writing.

36
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:28,411
- Gee, she writes bad enough
to be a doctor.
- Get her here on the double.

37
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:31,352
- What if she's not dressed?
- Bring her in her birthday suit.

38
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,515
My pleasure.
I'll get her.

39
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,458
We took enough shrapnel
out of you to build a jeep.

40
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,553
Two seconds to go.
Celtics down by one.

41
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,428
Pierce with a 50-foot hook shot.

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,060
He makes it!
The crowd goes wild!

43
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:48,696
They spill onto the court.
He's smothered with cheerleaders.

44
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:51,297
[Giggles] Girls, please,
there's enough to go around.

45
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:54,309
- Girls! Whoo!
- Are you okay, sir?

46
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:58,177
Never better.
Have you ever been attacked
by a squadron of cheerleaders...

47
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:01,445
- shaking their pom-poms in your face?
- No, we never had cheerleaders.

48
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:04,112
- My condolences to your libido.
- Right.

49
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:06,815
Uh, sir, I'm looking
for Major Houlihan.

50
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,290
Oh, Radar, you little devil.

51
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,884
It's not for me, sir.
It's for Colonel Potter.

52
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,260
- That's even worse. He's a married man.
- Come on. I gotta find her.

53
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,322
- Have you looked in her tent?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,527
So have I,
but she keeps catching me.

55
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,627
[B.J.]
Two points!

56
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:25,401
[Hawkeye]
Let's ask the average G.I. Excuse me,
sir. I have a question for you.

57
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,636
That must be the one
I ordered last week. Where is it?

58
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,701
- It's in my mouth.
- Spit it out.

59
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,804
The corporal here and I are
looking for a Major Houlihan.

60
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:35,248
Sorry, but I know a geisha house in Tokyo
where you can get a minor Houlihan.

61
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,309
Come on, guys.
This is important.

62
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:41,187
I've just been in the shower,
and I didn't see anyone in there
with clusters like Margaret's.

63
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:44,522
Will you guys pipe down!
There's a doctor trying to sleep here!

64
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,620
- Then shut up, Frank.
You might wake him.
- And nuts to you.

65
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:51,463
- Master of the half-witticism.
- What are you doing here, grunthead?

66
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:56,431
- I'm trying to locate Major Houlihan.
- You mean Major Houlihan, sir.

67
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,373
I don't know what to call her anymore.
She says "ma'am." You say "sir."

68
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,433
## [Hawkeye Singing]

69
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,242
Any mindless baboon can see
she's not here, including me.

70
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:07,249
- Now get out!
- Okay!

71
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,252
But I'm telling you. It's really spooky.
It's like she disappeared.

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,050
- Check Houdini's tent.
- People just don't disappear.

73
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:16,216
- Tell that to Amelia Earhart.
- I hope Margaret's all right.

74
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,055
Trust me. She's great.

75
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,062
How can you make jokes
when she could be lying out
there in a ditch somewhere...

76
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,759
with two broken legs, with rats and bugs
crawling all over her?

77
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:28,065
- Frank, stop it.
You're getting me excited!
- Suppose the Chinese got her.

78
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:31,106
- Suppose King Kong got her.
- Could be. She's always been
a little bananas.

79
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:34,075
- We can't just sit around.
We gotta do something.
- You're right. I'll shave.

80
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:36,236
- I'll take a shower.
- Where's my shirt?

81
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,337
- Here.
- You used my shirt as a basketball?

82
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:40,746
Had to. Your underwear
wouldn't bounce.

83
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,060
- Hey, Klinger?
- [Grunts]

84
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,096
- Uh, Klinger?
- Mom, I don't wanna go to school today.

85
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,859
- I've got a headache.
- It's Radar.

86
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,401
Radar, I don't wanna go
to school today.

87
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:03,371
- Have you seen Major Houlihan?
- She's having a baby.

88
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,430
Klinger, you're dreaming.

89
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:08,443
Honey, let's get back in the front seat.
Here come the cops.

90
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,940
[Sighs]

91
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,415
An officer shouldn't
go out looking like this.

92
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:16,748
You're right, Frank. And that
wrinkled shirt doesn't help either.

93
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,152
- Where I'm going,
nobody cares how I look.
- That could be anywhere.

94
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:23,590
- I'm going out into the jungle
to hunt for Margaret.
- I understand she's game.

95
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,154
Don't be a smarty-pants.
She's probably been abducted
by Chinese heathens.

96
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,292
They have her hanging upside down
by her feet from a bamboo tree...

97
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,996
doing unspeakable things to her.

98
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:37,062
Speak a few.

99
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:43,139
Frank, if you don't put that gun away,
I'm gonna find a new holster for it.

103
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:00,521
You moron!
You could have killed me!

104
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:02,791
It was an accident!
It ricocheted off the footlocker.

105
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,425
- I'll ricochet your nose
off the footlocker.
- What happened?

106
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:08,129
- Hopalong Ferret Face
just shot me in the leg.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,230
- Let me take a look at it.
- Will you respect me in the morning?

108
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,003
He just grazed it.
You're gonna have to have
a couple of stitches though.

109
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:16,739
- Help me get him into O.R.
- Frank, you're a credit to the enemy.

110
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:19,077
I said I'm sorry.
What more can I do?

111
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,616
[B.J.] Put an apple in your mouth.
We'll play William Tell.

112
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,812
[Frank] Say, Beej, you're not gonna
report me or anything, are you?

113
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,788
- [Hawkeye] Frank, stop acting
like a sniveling idiot.
- I'm not acting!

114
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:30,849
- [B.J.] Get away from me!
- Just promise you won't tell
on me and get me in trouble.

115
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,918
Huh? Please? Pretty please?

116
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,055
- [Hawkeye] We promise, Frank.
- <i>[Potter] What happened here?</i>

117
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:39,090
- Frank shot B.J.
- Tattletale! Stool pigeon!
Fink! Indian giver!

118
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,863
- [Potter] How bad is it?
- Superficial.

119
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,872
Fortunately, Frank's as good a marksman
as he is a surgeon.

120
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:50,977
How's your horse, sir?
When I was a kid, my daddy used
to take me to the pony rides...

121
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,878
- How did it happen, Burns?
- You mean...

122
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,010
- Right.
- I was cleaning my weapon,
and it discharged prematurely.

123
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:59,520
Sir, I think the Chinese
have captured Major Houlihan.

124
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,752
I see. So naturally,
you shot Captain Hunnicutt.

125
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,154
- Well, what's so funny, Corporal?
- Sorry, sir.

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,825
<i>Don't blame the boy, Burns.</i>
<i>He knows a goodjoke when he sees one.</i>

127
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,460
- Colonel, permission to go out
and find the major?
- Permission denied.

128
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,299
- <i>But</i>...
- No.

129
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,669
I'll be in my tent.

130
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,208
- [Chuckles]
- A mental pygmy.

131
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:23,268
- Now, what's the story on Houlihan?
- Nobody's seen her.

132
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:26,338
- Strange.
- I've checked with everyone from
Nurse Able to Sergeant Zale.

133
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,716
- "A" to "Z." Very methodical.
- I try to use the alphabet
whenever I can, sir.

134
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:35,121
- You must have missed someplace.
- I've looked everywhere
except the nurses' showers.

135
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,528
Oh, no, sir.
I couldn't look in there.

136
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:44,862
There might be naked female personnel
showering with their clothes off.

137
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:49,871
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, well, "nudidity"
makes me breathe funny.

138
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:52,169
Affects me the same way.
Do it.

139
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,506
But, sir, couldn't we find somebody
else, like maybe Captain Pierce?

140
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,274
No, we'd never get him out of there.
You're the man.

141
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:00,474
I... Yes, sir.

00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:17,979
- Don't be scared.
My eyes are closed.
- What do you want?

145
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:21,647
- I'm just looking for
Major Houlihan. Is she in here?
- No, she's not!

146
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,247
- Oh. Well, then, I'll just go then.
- <i>Good.</i>

00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:10,128
I just have to move it.

158
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:18,568
It's okay now.

159
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,350
Major Houlihan
is here to help you.

160
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:29,780
Just promise me you won't
grow up to be a North Korean.

161
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,259
Medically speaking,
Frank Burns is a beanbag.

162
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:37,729
- Put it in layman's terms.
- He belongs in a rubber room.
He's nuts!

163
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:41,165
- I agree he's a pain in the neck.
- Try three feet lower.

164
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,829
But you gotta give him an "A"
for resourcefulness.

165
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,873
How many doctors do you know
provide their own patients?

166
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,910
Excuse me, sirs. I was just
looking in the nurses' showers.

167
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:51,968
I told you you wouldn't go blind.

168
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,879
- <i>Any luck?</i>
- No, sir. Nurse Baker
was the only one in there.

169
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,247
If that's not luck,
I'll eat my socks.

170
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,776
Radar, call the M.P.s.
Ask 'em if they've seen Major Houlihan.

171
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,824
- Yes, sir.
- And then ask them if
they've seen <i>Gone With the Wind.</i>

172
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,889
Pumpkinhead! Now my lip's
going to swell up!

173
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,726
- Might even get to normal size.
- Go twaddle in your tent.

174
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:13,426
- <i>What is it, Burns?</i>
- Well, Colonel, I'm still
worried about Margaret.

175
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,096
- We're all worried, Major.
- But I'm more worried
than anybody else.

176
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:20,800
- It's not a contest.
- Sir, I just don't feel
like I'm doing enough.

177
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,572
You're doing fine. It's only 10:00,
and you've already shot a doctor.

178
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,205
Sir, I called the M.P.s.
Nobody's seen Major Houlihan.

179
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:31,479
- Well, I better turn
this over to Intelligence.
- That lets you out, Frank.

180
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:33,281
- I'll call "l" Corps...
- Ring up "l" Corps...

181
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,288
Tell the M.P. S
to search all native vehicles.

182
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,153
Alert the M.P. S
to check all native vehicles.

183
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,853
Sir, I'm willing to help in any way
I can. I know I'm a real asset.

184
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,522
You're only off by two letters.

185
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:51,498
I'm telling you, Sparky.
It's weird.

186
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:54,507
If a full-size person like
Major Houlihan can just disappear...

187
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,600
think what could happen
to my rabbit.

188
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:59,009
He could be kidnapped
by some Chinese magician.

189
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,139
- [Chuckles]
- <i>[Door Opening]</i>

190
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:10,754
Uh, Spark, I gotta go.
Colonel Flagg just come in.

191
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,427
Okay, pip-squeak,
what tipped you off?

192
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:20,627
Uh, well, you don't
look anything like you, sir.

193
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,135
And since you're a master of disguises,
I figured you're the only one...

194
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,195
who couldn't look
like you that much.

195
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:30,235
I'll buy that... for now.

196
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:33,678
But if you ever cross me up,
you're gonna get a number eight.

197
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,215
What's that?

198
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:39,241
Have you ever heard of the Malaysian
chest implosion torture?

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,586
- No, sir.
- Good, 'cause there's no such thing.

200
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:45,852
- Yet.
- Right.

201
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:49,262
I'll get Colonel Potter for you.

202
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,264
- Hold it!
- All right.

203
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,323
Nobody tells anybody I'm anywhere.

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,368
- Right.
- Including me.

205
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,939
With you in a minute, Flagg.

206
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,975
Nice suit. Your clown outfit
in the cleaners?

207
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:10,515
Don't try to be funny
with me, Colonel.

208
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,950
I've trained myself
not to laugh or smile.

209
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,116
- Really?
- Watched a hundred hours
of <i>The Three Stooges.</i>

210
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:19,216
Every time I felt like smiling...

211
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:22,126
I jabbed myself in the stomach
with a cattle prod.

212
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:27,099
- That ought to do it.
- Let's can the small talk.
Fill me in on the Houlihan case.

213
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:31,161
Well, she's been missing since
last night. We've looked everywhere.

214
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:33,729
Everywhere? [Chuckles]

215
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:36,800
There's no such thing
as "everywhere."

216
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:39,641
I'm gonna change
and poke around a bit.

217
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:43,706
<i>Pardon me for asking, Colonel, but why</i>
<i>are you dressed like an Italian usher?</i>

218
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,415
- Can you keep a secret?
- I think so.

219
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:54,087
<i>I'm disguised as Ling Chow,</i>
<i>Chinese double agent.</i>

220
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,527
Funny, you don't look Chinese.

221
00:13:56,597 --> 00:14:01,364
Neither would Ling Chow
if he were dressed like this.

222
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,199
- Follow me?
- As far as I'd like to.

223
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:07,331
- Well, I'm off.
- I couldn't have said it better myself.

224
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:12,811
- How's the leg?
- Not too bad.

225
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,144
When I blow on my big toe,
my thigh whistles.

226
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:18,014
Don't be such a namby-pamby.
It's just a little hole.

227
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:21,612
- Like the one in Frank's head.
- Pound it out your porthole.

228
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,695
- Come in.
- I'm already in.

229
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:31,754
- He's so light on his feet.
- Shut up.

230
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:35,268
- If you have anything to say,
keep your mouth closed.
- [Mumbling]

231
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,794
Can it.
What happened to your leg?

232
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:43,071
- Cut myself shaving.
- Another comedian.

233
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,873
- Where's Houlihan?
- I think it's near Dublin.

234
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:49,905
That's insubordination.
You do that to me one more time...

235
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:53,317
and I'm entitled to...

236
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:55,378
bite off your left ear.

237
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:59,358
- Just food for thought.
- He's not bluffing. He got van Gogh.

238
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:02,452
Let me tell you something.

239
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,656
I have a complete record on you.
I know every move you make.

240
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:08,634
Everything there is to know about you,
so watch your step, Hunnicutt.

241
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:11,136
- I'm Pierce.
- Fine.

242
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,765
You wanna call yourself Pierce,
I can play that game too.

243
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,670
[Nervous Giggle]

244
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:27,378
- This won't look good on your record.
- It's only <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

245
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:31,720
Not when you eliminate the third,
fifth and sixth letters.
Then it's Red's Digest, Comrade.

246
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:35,091
- But, Colonel...
- Listen, Pinko! You're my prime suspect.

247
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:38,393
- Isn't it true you had a torrid
relationship with Houlihan?
- No, sir.

248
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,524
- You wanna see the films?
- Films?

249
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,729
- I'll get the popcorn.
- You were insanely jealous
of her engagement.

250
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,171
You were furious at being rejected.
You were capable of murder.

251
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,108
That's right. So you hit her over
the head with a blunt instrument.

252
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:53,613
- The saxophone.
- Then you hypnotized her and
told her she was Johnny Ray.

253
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:56,206
Then you performed plastic surgery.
Made her look like Johnny.

254
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:59,116
<i>[Pierce] The rest is obvious.</i>
<i>You stuck her in a trunk.</i>

255
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:02,815
You mailed her to Las Vegas.
And now she's doing two shows
a night at the Sands.

256
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,882
- Three on Saturday.
- There's only one flaw in that theory.

257
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,726
- Only one?
- They don't do three shows
Saturday night at the Sands.

258
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:14,097
- How do you know?
- I was a showgirl for six weeks.

259
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:24,450
- <i>Colonel Potter, sir.</i>
- Radar, you can call me
either Colonel or sir.

260
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,890
- You don't have to call me both.
- Yes, sir, Colonel.

261
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,951
That's better.
Now, what is it?

262
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,361
The Korean ladies are here
for their baby birthing lesson.

263
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,366
And Major Houlihan and I usually
do that, so I was wondering...

264
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,369
[Simultaneously]
If I could help out and give
the lecture to the Korean ladies.

265
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,304
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir. Sometimes
that stuff makes me gag.

266
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,364
- I'll be gentle.
- Good morning, my colonel.

267
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,469
- Klinger, you look lovely in yellow.
- Always a gentleman.

268
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:55,052
- Now the contractions
are getting really strong.
- [Korean]

269
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:58,249
When you feel one, you take
a deep breath and push. Radar.

270
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:08,366
- <i>Between them, you relax</i>
<i>and breathe normally.</i>
- <i>[Korean]</i>

271
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:11,666
Now we're getting
near the finish line.

272
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,803
Another contraction and you
can see the baby's head appear.

273
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:20,369
So you take a deep breath and push.

274
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,079
Take it easy, Radar. You don't
wanna shoot him across the room.

275
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,084
Now as you gently rotate
the baby's head...

276
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:37,595
the shoulder will appear.

277
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:41,896
And once the shoulders are delivered,
the rest of the body slips
through easily.

278
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:44,994
- Swoosh!
- [Korean] Swish!

279
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:48,837
But it doesn't sound like that.

280
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,709
Congratulations, Mrs. O'Reilly.
It's a bear.

281
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:11,195
A C.I.A., F.B.I.,
Intelligence man drinking?

282
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,461
I'm not drinking.
It just looks like I'm drinking.

283
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:17,264
- You had me fooled.
- Two years ago in Morocco...

284
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:22,365
I had a device surgically implanted
in my throat that neutralizes alcohol.

285
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,535
That way the enemy
can never get me drunk.

286
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:28,479
- I find that hard to swallow.
- I heard they do that
to get the truth out of you.

287
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:32,507
Nobody can get the truth out of me
because even I don't know what it is.

288
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:36,112
I keep myself in a constant
state of utter confusion.

289
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:39,248
That's the best way
to keep things organized.

290
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:42,761
Making yourself at home, Flagg?

291
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,957
I have no home.
I'm the wind.

292
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:50,799
- I told you he was the wind.
You said he was the stars.
- No, I said he was the moon.

293
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,035
Listen, Colonel Wind, would
you mind blowing your butt off
my chair so I can sit down?

294
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,673
Very well, Colonel.

295
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:01,976
Time for me to get up anyway.

296
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,516
- I only sit two minutes a day.
- It's bad to put pressure
on your brains.

297
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:10,351
Glad you're here, Potter.
I want you all to hear my plan.

298
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,357
If it's your plan, sir,
I'll bet it's a good one.

299
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:15,883
Burns, you interrupt me one more time,
I'm gonna drop a grenade
down your shorts.

300
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,896
Got it.

301
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:21,764
Now, I have searched
the entire camp...

302
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,166
and Major Houlihan is not here.

303
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,705
I think the Chinese got her.

304
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,798
I have been
in this business 20 years...

305
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,400
and I'm not interested
in the speculations of an amateur.

306
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:34,776
- What's your theory?
- The Chinese got her.

307
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,838
That's what I said, sir.

308
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:41,186
What?

309
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:43,950
Oh, nothing.
No, it's... Nothing.

310
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,515
Now, I want a platoon of rangers...

311
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:50,028
to parachute into North Korea...

312
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,360
to search and destroy
anything that moves.

313
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:56,095
- But, Colonel, Margaret moves!
- Who would know better than Frank?

314
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,831
Colonel, let's not cause
any unnecessary casualties.

315
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,931
- What's war without casualties?
- Peace.

316
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:04,977
If it wasn't for war,
you wouldn't know what peace was!

317
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:07,376
- He's got a point there.
- Yeah, it's under his hat.

318
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:10,678
All we're interested in
is getting Major Houlihan back.

319
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,775
- I'll get her back.
- Dead or alive?

320
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:17,016
Right. Alert the navy
for offshore artillery.

321
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,184
I want a squadron of copters
for air-to-ground search...

322
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,663
and, uh, round up
a box of scorpions.

323
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,722
About a dozen.

324
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,634
- You mean, uh, scorpions scorpions?
- Big ones.

325
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:35,697
- What the hell are you gonna do
with a box of scorpions?
- It's personal.

326
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,743
Gift for a friend.

327
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,703
That's it. Get moving.

328
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:43,772
<i>Corporal!</i>

329
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,410
If you can't find scorpions...

330
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:50,044
get two snakes and a rat.

331
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,422
And a rat. Right, right.

332
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:57,822
<i>[Baby Cooing]</i>

333
00:20:57,897 --> 00:20:59,888
- <i>Afternoon, Major.</i>
- Corporal.

334
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,264
- I see everything came out all right.
- Isn't he beautiful?

335
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,568
He sure is. In my family,
every baby had a nose like a hawk.

336
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,074
Here. Take him and his mother
over to post-op.

337
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,168
I'll be there in a minute.

338
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:15,874
How do you breathe
through that little thing?

339
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,781
- Anything happen while I was gone?
- I ripped my pink pedal pushers.

340
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:22,218
Other than that, it's been very quiet.
Coochie, coochie, coochie.

341
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,756
[Margaret]
Stop that.

342
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:30,023
You wanna call out
the entire 315th Air Division?
That's gonna make a lot of noise.

343
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,030
Why don't we just drop
an atomic bomb?

344
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:36,228
Hey, don't try
to make friends with me.

345
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:39,430
I've been sitting here quietly
for a long time, and there's
something I'd like to say now.

346
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:42,872
- What is it?
- Good-bye.

347
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,206
- <i>[Hawkeye] I'll join you.</i>
- Go on ahead, you two bleeding hearts.

348
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:47,838
Colonel Flagg and I don't need you.

349
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:52,709
My father touched me
like that once.

350
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,915
To this day, he still has
to wear orthopedic shirts.

351
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,422
- Margaret!
- [All Shouting Indistinctly]

352
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:07,659
- <i>[Flagg] Hold it!</i>
- Colonel Flagg.

353
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,362
Don't anybody touch her.
She may be booby-trapped.

354
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:12,597
Wait a minute, Flagg.
Where have you been, Margaret?

355
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:15,869
I went down the road to deliver a baby.
Didn't Klinger tell you?

356
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:18,934
- Klinger!
- He probably forgot.
His mind isn't what it used to be.

357
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:21,844
- Maybe he's going through menopause.
- We were worried sick!

358
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:24,144
Well, Flagg, it was fun
while it lasted.

359
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,277
Count on me.
I can find anything.

360
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:31,221
Can you find my virginity? I lost it 20
years ago. I haven't seen it since.

361
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,850
Radar!

362
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:37,657
- Get on the horn.
Call off the whole shebang.
- I just did.

363
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,823
Sir, what about your scorpions?

364
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:42,629
That's all right.
I'll get some from home.

365
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:46,798
Well, I guess you've got better things
to do, Flagg, like torturing sheep.

366
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:49,808
As a matter of fact, I do.
Now, everybody close your eyes.

367
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,436
- I beg your pardon?
- Close our eyes?

368
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:56,039
- Oh, no, no, no.
- When I finish a job,
nobody sees me leave.

369
00:22:56,115 --> 00:23:00,108
- I forgot. You're the wind.
- I'm either swallowed up by night
or disappear in the mist.

370
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:02,620
It's my trademark.
Now, close your eyes.

371
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:06,954
- I'd rather close my ears.
- If you don't close your eyes,
I'm not leaving.

372
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:09,551
- Bye.
- See ya.
- Okay.

373
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,564
- <i>[Screams]</i>
- <i>[Glass Shattering]</i>

374
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:26,707
The wind just broke its leg.

375
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,153
I've got it.
Third one from the left.

376
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:39,623
- She was wearing a big hat
and carrying a parasol.
- What are you talking about?

377
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:42,354
I saw Colonel Flagg in Vegas
when he was a showgirl.

378
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,396
I knew there was
something wrong with her.

379
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,956
- What tipped you off, the beard?
- No, she was the only one
carrying a machine gun.

380
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:51,470
## [Singing]
[Imitating Machine Gun Fire]

381
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,971
- Checkmate.
- What? Again? What is it with you?
