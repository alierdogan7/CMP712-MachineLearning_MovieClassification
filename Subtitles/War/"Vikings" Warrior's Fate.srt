I reached a huge hall.

243

One giant, who I took to be the king,

245
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,830
he asked me if I had any skill.

(BURPING)

248
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,404
I told him that I could drink...

249
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,789
- (ASLAUG LAUGHING)
- And that I doubted whether...

250
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,693
anyone in that hall could
drink as much as me.

251
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:51,898
He asked his cup bearer
to bring his sconce-horn.

252
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:56,302
He said some men there took
two draughts to empty it,

253
00:20:56,303 --> 00:21:00,038
but nobody was so feeble that
they couldn't drain it in three.

254
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,708
Did you manage?

255
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,044
I took enormous gulps,

256
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,580
until I was breathless.

258
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:12,885
I saw that the level of the drink...

259
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:16,388
was just a little bit
lower than when I started.

260
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,159
So the king,

261
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,395
he asked me if I wanted to try my hand

262
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:25,031
at some other type of contest.

263
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:28,568
I demanded that he let me

Who did you wrestle?

265

266
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:35,958

She was a horrible old crone,

268

269
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,650

270
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:47,252
But the moment that I laid hands on her,

271
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,572
I realized...

272
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,958
she was strong.

273
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,094
And she caught me in a lock
and threw me off balance.

274
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:58,314
I clung to her desperately,

275
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:02,634
but after a struggle,
I was forced to one knee...

284

that I would see how much it
had ebbed with my efforts.

that I had withstood her for so long,

290
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:46,178
