00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,707
But, Doctor...

182
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,451
I can show doc Rios
everything he needs to know.

183
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,154
And if extra help is
required, I'm sure you can

184
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:58,822
strike a bargain with Quincy.

185
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,224
I can't let you go.

186
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,559
Ruskov asked for me.

187
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,027
And I won't do a thing for him

188
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,963
until he releases Tex and the captain.

189
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,965
Danny: Ma'am, you don't realize
what you're signing up for.

190
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,833
You would be Ruskov's slave for life,

191
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,235
or until he decides to kill you.

192
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,837
Look, we all know

193
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,440
he'll chase us to the ends of the Earth.

194
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,444
This is the only way to stop him

195
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,246
once and for all.

[Key jangles]

204
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:03,253
Coming forward now. Give to me hands.

[Keys jangle, cuffs clicking]

206
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,830
You've looked better. [Sighs]

207
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,465
Oh, you should have seen the other guy.

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
There was only one?

209
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,002
He was a big unit.

210
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,338
No sense of humor.

211
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:23,307
You want to know the kicker?

212
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,375
He didn't even ask me any questions.

213
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,878
Hey! No talk,

214
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:29,680
- or I kiss your ass!
- [Both scoff]

215
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,181
You mean <i>kick my ass!</i>

216
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,883
Just shut up your head, okay?

217
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,556
[Lowered voice] I spoke
to our friend from Chicago.

218
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,591
If I know Mike,

219
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:44,161
he's planning on paying us a visit.

220
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,562
[Lowered voice] We'd better find a way

221
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,030
to make him feel welcome.

222
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:53,537
<i>Kirov</i> class battleships
run on a C.O.N.A.S. system.

223
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,239
That's combined nuclear
and steam propulsion.

224
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,908
Not gonna be able to take out both boilers,

225
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,777
so if you want to kill
her, gotta damage the shaft.

226
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,213
Engines can spin all day,
but the props won't turn.

227
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,015
Not gonna be able to burn through them

228
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,050
with the incendiaries I'm carrying.

229
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,952
There's a soft spot
you're gonna have to find.

230
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,687
But you're gonna have to be careful, sir.

231
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:12,322
There could be a meltdown if
you use too many explosives.

232
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,124
Yeah, and we're all
dead and we lose the C.O.

233
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,460
- Right.
- Which is why you're coming with.

234
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,831
Like I said before, you're part of my team.

235
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,435
You ready to bring it?

236
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,171
Hell, yeah, sir.

237
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,575
- [Pats back]
- Let's map this out.

238
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,744
This is a .45 caliber pistol.

239
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,579
Excellent knock-down
power, but the trade-off

240
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,147
is that it's large and heavy.

241
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,950
It's a got an 8-round magazine, loaded.

242
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,085
And I'm gonna give you an extra.

243
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Let's hope you won't need it.

244
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,555
And lastly, the suppressor.
It's highly effective.

245
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,457
Without it, you'll wake up the entire ship.

246
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:50,093
- But you need time to attach it.
- Are we clear?

247
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,896
- Crystal.
- Outstanding.

248
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,576
Thank you.

249
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,084
If anything should happen...

250
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:15,886
Finish what we started.

you up in one of their helos

out in the middle of nowhere,
taking you to their ship.

254
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,235
We won't have any contact after that.

255
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,171
- I understand.
- [Huffs]

256
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,509
It's a little late to ask if
you really want to do this.

257
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:41,178
Let me just say,

258
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:45,182
what you're doing is... Very brave.

259
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,650
I'm proud to know you.

260
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,620
You're making it sound like good-bye.

261
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,723
I'll see you for breakfast.

262
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,743
[Lowered voice] How
about, uh, "Great Escape"?

263
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,811
[Lowered voice] Kinda hard
to tunnel out of a ship.

264
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,713
Yeah, you got a point there.

265
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:16,815
You ever see "Papillon"?

266
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,383
Are we just doing Steve McQueen flicks?

267
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:19,618
What about "Escape from Alcatraz"?

268
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,286
You'd need a dummy.

269
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:23,855
What about, uh, Bad English over there?

270
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,291
What are you talking of?! Quiet!

271
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:49,448
Take off.

272
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,163
Turn around.

How long I've waited to
welcome you aboard <i>Vyerni.</i>

00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,720
Of course. It was expected.

00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:44,296
What the hell are you doing here?

293
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:47,599
Huh?

Ohh!

295
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,608
Now I understand

296
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,110
why the good Doctor
agreed to pay us a visit.

- [Grunts]

- [Door opens]
- The deal was me for them.

299
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,550
You gave your word that you'd let them go.

300
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:07,319
Not until I confirm

301
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:09,154
that you've delivered what I've requested.

302
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,624
Well, I assume you have a lab.

303
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,802
- [Equipment beeping]
- Ah.

304
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,637
Dr. Scott.

305
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,640
Ah.

306
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:34,412
So nice to see you again.

307
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,248
Do I know you?

European Congress of Virology, 2011.

309
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:43,355
Uh, you spoke on techniques
for hemagglutination-inhibition

310
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:45,590
with arthropod-borne viruses.

311
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,261
And afterwards, I introduced
myself, shook hands.

00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,196
Niels Sorensen.

313
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,832
I'm sorry. I don't recall.

314
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,201
I was with Professor Lindblom.

315
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,836
I remember Jonas.

316
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,671
You were in his department?

317
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,973
Um... for a time.

318
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:05,477
Uh, he... never really saw clearly

319
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:09,948
what I was trying to, uh...

320
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:13,084
Anyways...

321
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:15,086
I'd invite you in, but it's such a mess.

322
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:17,155
[Laughs]

323
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:20,759
Uh, actually, they are, uh,
supposed to clean up every day.

324
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:24,529
And I tell them that the
U.V. light kills the virus,

325
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,033
but, um... [Laughs]

326
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,368
You're infected.

327
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,970
Uh, not exactly.

328
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,305
But you're not even symptomatic.

329
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:34,706
Um...

330
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,408
Perhaps I should explain.

331
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:37,842
It was you.

332
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:40,779
- You added the human gene.
- Yes.

333
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,782
You weaponized the virus!

334
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,317
What? No.

335
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,651
No, I didn't weaponize it.

336
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:50,322
I was really close to a major breakthrough.

337
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:52,691
I added my gene to the virus

338
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:54,859
and then injected it
back into my bloodstream,

339
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:56,528
and it worked.

340
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:59,798
I am completely immune. I just...

341
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:03,134
Uh, I didn't know that I
also made myself a carrier.

342
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,236
So you're patient zero?

343
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,638
No, I didn't start it.

344
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm trying to find a solution here.

345
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:10,709
I'm trying to fix it, and I can fix it

346
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,777
as soon as I get the primordial strain.

347
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:14,946
- If that...
- You don't understand what you've done.

348
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,549
The primordial won't work now.

349
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,384
The virus that you created,

350
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:22,887
the modifications you made...
You've made it so much worse.

351
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,890
And you could have come
forward at any point.

352
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,559
I mean, you must have known this.

353
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,361
No, that was too late.

354
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:31,029
There was zero benefit from me
coming forward at that point...

355
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:32,864
You killed four billion people.

356
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:34,699
- I didn't...
- And you never gave them a chance

357
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,901
- to understand how it happened?
- But I can now.

358
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:39,504
- I mean, can solve it now.
