00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,442
That's too bad. Sergeant,
get them out of there, put the men in.

167
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,360
Put them in the smaIIest house
under guard for now.

168
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,358
Come on! Get this mob out of here!

169
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:12,518
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Right, sir.

170
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,201
Son, change perimeter sentries
every haIf hour.

171
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,085
- AIready been done, sir.
- Good.

172
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:19,363
- What do I do with this Nip?
- Who's he?

173
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:22,724
He was making a dash
with the Japanese officers, sir.

174
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,401
- Put him in the big hut.
- Come on, HorribIe.

175
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,400
Keep a good watch on him.
Suni?

176
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,041
(SPEAKS SLOWLY)
You know that man?

177
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:37,517
Not know, not know.

178
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,723
AII right, go.

179
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:43,002
What wouId
a fuII coIoneI be doing here?

180
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't kick my teeth in,
but WE ARE behind their Iines.

181
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,398
Yeah, but a fuII coIoneI
with onIy eight men out here... Why?

182
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,604
You'd think they'd have a pIatoon
or a company - but eight men?

183
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,237
- Aye, it is a bit odd.
- This is no ordinary fieId map.

184
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,841
That bIue Iine,
those green squares and dots.

185
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:03,125
Sir, the cook wants to know
if he can start on the grub yet.

186
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,676
- Yeah, it's OK now, Perkins.
- Thank you, sir.

187
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,281
And see that we get some
before you get yours.

188
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:09,880
PIeasure, Sergeant... (Guts (!) )

189
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,959
What about that Burmese,
why did he try to run away?

190
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,765
Maybe he was scared stiff, sir.

191
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,078
So are the others but they didn't
beat it with the coIoneI.

192
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,044
Anyway, we'II study this Iater.

193
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,280
In the meantime,
you better cIear away the debris.

194
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,996
Take them into the jungIe
and have them buried in one grave.

195
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:35,843
Make sure there are no traces.
Get it done as quick as you can.

196
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,726
- I'II teII the Padre.
- Never mind about the Padre.

197
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:42,926
I don't want any nonsense
about a service.

198
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:48,400
- My concern is the Iiving not the dead.
- Very good, sir.

199
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,562
Right, buriaI party!

200
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,845
- WeII...?
- Just drying our parts, sir.

201
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:01,796
- I'm sorry about this, sir.
- You'II be, if you don't get it fixed.

202
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,520
You know something?
He can drop dead for my money.

203
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,359
At Ieast he knows what he's doing.

204
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:12,042
''You wiII be, if you don't get it fixed'',
after you with your Iuck!

205
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,880
Who dropped the fIippin' thing
into the water, you or him?

206
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,838
- Has he said anything?
- No, sir.

207
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,755
Do you speak EngIish?

208
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,564
I said, do you speak EngIish?

209
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:43,644
What were you doing with the Japanese?
Why did you try to get away with them?

210
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,366
Are you going to answer?

211
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,802
He doesn't seem to understand,
does he, sir?

212
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:52,561
If he doesn't, he's no use to us.
Take him away...

213
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,958
- Come on.
- ..and shoot him.

214
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,083
No! No!

215
00:18:58,247 --> 00:18:59,839
PIease...

216
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,727
Now we do speak, don't we?

217
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:10,082
Come here.

218
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,046
Get up! Get him on his feet!

219
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,998
(HE GROANS)

220
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,557
Now then, we're going
to do a IittIe taIking, aren't we?

221
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,638
- Aren't we?
- Yes.

222
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:33,640
- That's better. What's your name?
- Hakimbo, sir.

223
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,002
- What were you doing here?
- I Iive here.

224
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,123
- Don't Iie!
- I Iive near here.

225
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,723
- Why was the Japanese coIoneI here?
- He was asking me questions.

226
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,276
- What sort of questions?
- About your troops.

227
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,881
- WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
- Nothing...naturaIIy.

228
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:50,278
- Was he taIking to you in Japanese?
- I can't speak Japanese.

229
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,599
- You couIdn't speak EngIish either.
- I was scared! Now I'm teIIing the truth.

230
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:58,680
- Do you know the meaning of the word?
- We found this money on him, sir.

231
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,318
- Have you seen this map before?
- No.

232
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:09,162
Come here and Iook at it.

233
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,887
- You know nothing of this map?
- Nothing, sir.

234
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:13,878
- What's your name?
- I've toId you.

235
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,003
- Answer the question!
- Hakimbo.

236
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,158
- Where is Singu?
- Sing...?

237
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:21,205
Singu, a smaII viIIage near here.
How far away is it?

238
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,803
- It's onIy a few miIes away.
- Wrong. It's 1 50 miIes away.

239
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:28,403
- If you Iived here, you'd know that.
- I haven't Iived here Iong.

240
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,478
- How Iong?
- OnIy a few weeks.

241
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,286
- Where do you come from?
- Rangoon.

242
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,278
What was your address there?

243
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,837
1 9 Ar Pown Street.
I had a smaII business.

244
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:42,079
- Why did you come here?
- To get away from the Japanese.

245
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,966
- And how are you going to Iive?
- I have money.

246
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,322
- This money?
- Yes.

247
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,604
- It's rather a Iot, isn't?
- I'm not a poor man.

248
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:53,520
- The notes are new.
- I got it from a bank!

249
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,918
No. I don't think you got it from a bank.

250
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,681
TeII me again, what was your address?

251
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:02,407
You heard me!
Your address in Rangoon!

252
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,240
- You've forgotten it so soon.
- You confused me.

253
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:09,285
I confuse you, do I?
I suggest you made everything up.

254
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,200
- No, sir!
- I suggest you work for the Japanese.

255
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,766
No!

256
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:16,521
You suppIy the Japanese
with miIitary information.

257
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:20,123
You met that coIoneI here and
you gave him information for money!

258
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,243
- No, that's not true!
- It is true.

259
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,685
Like aII your kind, you don't care whose
Iife you seII as Iong it's not yours.

260
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,997
- You have no proof.
- I'II get my proof!

261
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,157
You're going to taIk,
do you understand?

262
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,921
Either you teII me
aII you know about that map...

263
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,600
or I'II shoot you.

264
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,077
- The British don't do things Iike that...
- Shut up!

265
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:44,124
I am giving your 1 5 minutes
to make up your mind.

266
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:47,882
Either you decide to taIk,
or you've got 1 5 minutes to Iive.

267
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:52,279
- But I've aIready toId you the truth.
- You change your mind, you can go free.

268
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,881
- Don't take your eyes off him.
- I won't, sir.

269
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:58,358
I have seen to everything, sir.
The dead are being buried now.

270
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,165
Any Iuck in there?

271
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,922
He knows something about that map,
but he's a tough nut to crack.

272
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:08,126
- If you Ieave him with me...
- No, I'II find out my own way.

273
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,245
ShaII we feed the viIIagers?
They're stiII under guard.

274
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,080
Let them out.
TeII them to go about their business.

275
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,123
- You!
- Sir?

276
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:19,960
Where is your rifIe?
I Ieft it in the hut, sir.

277
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,800
Listen, if I ever see you
without your rifIe again,

278
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,686
I'II set you Ioose without food,
arms or ammunition.

279
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:28,919
You'II die the death you're asking for.
Now, get it. Quick!

280
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:30,805
Yes, sir.

281
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,278
And that goes for aII of you.

282
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:37,563
Naughty boy (!)

283
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,958
- Where is that going?
- The MO's asked for more bedding.

284
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,436
- Where is he?
- He is in there, sir.

285
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:47,844
(COUGHING)

286
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,358
Now.

287
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:02,684
(GASPS)

288
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,957
- Got everything you want?
- Yes, aII the Iatest instruments.

289
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,436
Dress it.
Use as IittIe bandage as possibIe.

290
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,325
Doctor.

291
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,717
AII right, aII right, take it easy.

292
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,684
You're going to be okay.

293
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:25,078
- I've had it.
- Try and sit up.

294
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,606
It's not your...
(GROANS)

295
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:30,157
CaIm down.
Take it easy, take it easy.

296
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,478
One Iess sack of potatoes to carry.

297
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:49,079
How do you feeI, sir?

298
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:52,125
I'm aII right... Thanks.

299
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,357
WeII, that's aII I can do for now.

300
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:05,319
I wish I couId do more to heIp.
I feeI so bIoody useIess.

301
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:10,402
There's not much any of us can do,
except watch and wait... Perhaps pray.

302
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,523
- Pretty rough, huh?
- Yes, it is.

303
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,406
- You want any more heIp?
- I need suppIies.

304
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:20,436
I dug a buIIet out of a man's shouIder
without proper anaesthetic.

305
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,325
- You got morphine?
- A IittIe.

306
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,923
Save it. OnIy use it on the men
who have a chance to Iive.

307
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,318
The dying man feeIs he has
as much right to it as anyone.

308
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:32,240
You're gonna have
to give it to them straight.

309
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:37,001
How do you teII a man he can't have
any more drugs because he'II die?

310
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,796
Just Iike that. TeII them truth
and they'II respect you for it.

311
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,276
It's no good giving them iIIusions.

312
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:47,042
If we give them something to hope for,
it may keep them aIive.

313
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:49,960
- OnIy if the hopes are justified.
- Just a minute.

314
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:55,200
- Do we stand a chance of getting back?
- Some of us, maybe.

315
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:57,927
If you want to rest,
I've taken over the big hut.

316
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:02,763
- We'd rather accommodate this one.
- It's a IittIe nearer to the morphine.

317
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:09,564
Hi! You heap beautifuI.
Me go for you, you go with me?

318
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,797
She don't understand Indian taIk.

319
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,322
You distress me.
Love speaks any Ianguage.

320
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,684
- Me strong, Iike tiger!
- Him mangy Iike a tomcat.

321
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,361
- Me carry wash.
- Leave her aIone.

322
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,166
- (SHE COMPLAINS IN BURMESE)

of our main force,

483
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:40,641
so that we stay put, thinking
their suppIy Iines are far extended.

484
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:43,924
And aII the time,
they're moving in behind us.

485
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:48,285
The enemy wiII be moving through
some of the thickest jungIe in the worId.

486
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:51,245
No commander
wouId think this move IightIy.

487
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:55,880
- So it's pretty bad, sir.
- Yes, it is, Sergeant.

488
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:02,123
And by the time our inteIIigence
get wind of this,

489
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,437
it'II be too Iate to move out.

490
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:09,084
Look, you don't suppose
this couId be another pack of Iies?

491
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:11,124
No, no. He's teIIing the truth.

492
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,686
This map confirms it.

493
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,279
And you...

494
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:20,440
I'm not gonna put on a guard you
but I'd advise you not to try to escape.

495
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:24,486
No, sir. It you Iet me,
I wiII serve you very weII, indeed, sir.

496
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,717
- Take him out.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,079
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir!

498
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:51,682
- Sergeant?
- Sir?

499
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:55,044
I want you to take that man
into the jungIe...and kiII him.

500
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,279
Then have him buried
and see they make good job of it.

501
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,484
I'm onIy doing this
because this map is vitaIIy important.

502
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:06,559
The Japanese mustn't know
we have it, or understand it.

503
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:10,561
- With that man aIive, they may find out.
- You think he'II run to them?

504
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:15,164
No. But if they catch him, he'II taIk,
and that's a risk we can't take.

505
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,600
I'II see to it at once, sir.

506
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,798
Do you think we'II be abIe
to get this information through?

507
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:28,164
- That's up to you, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

508
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:30,887
We have to reIy
on that radio being fixed.

509
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,403
We'II have to keep
our fingers crossed then, won't we?

510
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:43,275
There's no good
me teIIing you that I was right.

511
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,405
- The men are getting ready to move on.
- That's right.

512
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,604
I've got wounded here,
to say nothing about the brigadier.

513
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,122
- They can't be shifted.
- We're moving.

514
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:55,359
What about the rest of us?
We've had IittIe food and sIeep.

515
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,837
- You're asking us to...
- I'm not asking, I'm ordering you!

516
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:02,317
- WiII a few hours make a difference?
- Every hour is criticaI.

517
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:06,321
- It's criticaI for the wounded too.
- I'm not worried about the wounded.

518
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,000
What does that mean exactIy?

519
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,842
- It means they're not coming with us.
- You can't do that...

520
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:14,601
Neither can I jeopardise
the Iives of 30 fit men!

521
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,042
Do you reaIize
what this wiII mean to them?

522
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:20,677
It's not the first time the retreating army
has Ieft it's wounded.

523
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:22,838
Yes, but in different circumstances.

524
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:26,204
Look, there must be 20,000 troops
out here in the jungIe.

525
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:29,837
If officers thought onIy of the wounded,
you can write Iot of them off.

526
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,999
- It's against the principIes of humanity.
- PrincipIes?!

527
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,681
I don't see anything wrong
in having principIes.

528
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:37,963
I'II make you see. Look.

529
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:42,359
There's 40 miIes of dense hard jungIe
separating us from survivaI.

530
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,722
The Japanese
are out there mopping up.

531
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:48,721
AII our Iives depend
on us keeping on the move.

532
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,675
It's a hard, sickening
but unavoidabIe decision.

533
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:55,566
I've made my decision.
I'm staying with the wounded.

534
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,287
I'm with you doctor.
I won't desert those men.

535
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:01,007
You think I've
decided this in five minutes?

536
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,840
I thought about
nothing eIse for the Iast two days.

537
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:06,965
We'II be moving at the pace
of a sIowest waIking wounded.

538
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:10,756
I've seen them doing their best
with their stretchers, struggIing.

539
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:13,282
No doubt, they're ready to carry them.

540
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:18,965
It's a burden that's become intoIerabIe.
I've got to get the fit back.

541
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,403
Why don't you put it to the men?
They'd have something to say.

542
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,286
We don't ask the men
what to do in the army!

543
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:28,837
- The brigadier is here.
- You shouIdn't have moved, sir.

544
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:33,239
Don't bIame PauI.
I ordered him. Don't fuss.

545
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:39,565
I'm perfectIy capabIe of deciding,
whether I'm in a fit state to move or not.

546
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:42,036
- Sir, it's my job.
- WeII, doctor...

547
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:45,802
You know how things are.
Doesn't reaIIy matter anyway.

548
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:47,958
- Does it?
- Cigarette, sir.

549
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:49,799
Thank you.

550
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:55,121
- Are you staying here the night?
- That's what we're deciding now, sir.

551
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,596
I see.

552
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:01,316
Then I've been asked to come
over here at an opportune moment.

553
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:05,441
- Asked, sir?
- Yes, by the wounded.

554
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:10,886
We've been having a IittIe discussion
amongst ourseIves.

555
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:14,596
We've decided we're
not doing very much to heIp.

556
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,565
- (PADRE) There's not much you can do.
- There is.

557
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:21,686
We aII reaIize that as things are...

558
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:26,126
..you are not going to make it.

559
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:29,120
We don't want
to be responsibIe for your capture.

560
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,438
So we want you to go on without us.

561
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:35,724
- (DOCTOR) Just a minute, sir.
- Our decision was unanimous.

562
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:39,721
You are to go on without us.
AIan, those are my orders.

563
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:41,923
I'II do as you say, sir.

564
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,806
I don't need to teII you
how we'II feeI about this.

565
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:48,676
And you, Doctor,
I order you to Ieave us.

566
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,998
Forget us few here
and remember the hundreds

567
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:55,045
who wiII want your heIp back
at the headquarters.

568
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:58,597
- You understand?
- I understand, sir.

569
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:02,396
- Good.
- Come on, Iet's get you back.

570
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:10,926
Oh...before I forget.

571
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:16,482
You might Ieave us one pistoI
and sufficient ammunition.

572
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,003
It's a smaII thing, but I wouIdn't
want it to sIip my memory.

573
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,477
One pistoI won't be much use
to defend yourseIf, sir.

574
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:27,560
I'm sorry, Padre,
we won't be needing it for defence.

575
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:30,685
AIan, perhaps you'II come over with me.

576
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,122
I'd Iike to discuss your pIans.

577
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:36,243
Right away, sir.

578
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,923
Perkins, Simpson, grab
a coupIe of spears

579
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:02,965
and get to that cIearing
behind the hut.

580
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:07,564
- Who was it, Sarge?
- The informer - he tried to get away.

581
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:13,763
- How's it going over here?
- Dried it aII up Iike it was my own baby.

582
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,316
Let's hear your baby cry,
that's what we want.

583
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:21,003
Come on, you were toId to move
a quarter of an hour ago! Hurry up!

584
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,840
Sit him down over there.
Sergeant, get me a stretcher.

585
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:26,601
No fuss. Let me sit down here.
I'II be aII right.

586
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:29,156

- WeII done. Set the transmitter and...
- The transmitter?

598
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:08,996
I've got an urgent message.
You mean the transmitter isn't working?

599
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:13,922
- OnIy the receiver, sir.
- Then get it working!

600
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:18,446
The Japanese, sir.
They're just on the outskirts.

601
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:21,440
- How many?
- I saw one, but it's probabIy a patroI.

602
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:23,279
- Everybody packs off.
- Off?!

603
00:44:23,447 --> 00:44:26,280
- Yes, I want them to know we're staying.
- Staying?!

604
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:28,244
Aren't you going after them?

605
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,557
I don't want them
to know we've seen them.

606
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:35,403
- They'II pick us off as they Iike!
- I don't think they wiII.

607
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:39,276
Right, get your packs off.
Sit down. Keep your rifIes at the ready.

608
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:42,359
If it's a patroI,
they'II be back with reinforcements.

609
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:44,722
They'II chase after us.
But if we stay,

610
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,163
they won't reaIise the sergeant
and his party have sIipped away.

611
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:52,240
That'II give him an initiaI run.
It's reasonabIe in the circumstances...

612
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:54,841
- He's dead.
- He was a fine man.

613
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:56,998
Yes, he was a fine man.

614
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:00,523
But he knew
there's onIy one way to fight any war...

615
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:04,883
- ..with the gIoves off.
- Everything's ready, sir.

616
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:08,562
Take two privates, the Padre,
the Doctor, and our newspaper friend.

617
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:11,878
Get your kits ready, immediateIy.
Sergeant, come with me.

618
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,517
This is where I think
the headquarters are.

619
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:32,477
Keep your eyes skinned for another
British unit trying to find this way back.

620
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,686
- We shouId aII have a copy of this map.
- Not enough time to make them.

621
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:40,601
Make sure each member memorises
enough of this, and then destroy it.

622
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:44,157
If you have to break up,
some of you might make it aIone.

623
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,205
If we don't make it,
it won't be for want of trying.

624
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,200
Your party, if any of them tire out
or can't go on,

625
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:52,437
you Ieave them behind -
that's an order.

626
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:55,326
Under no circumstances
must you carry them with you.

627
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:58,240
I'II know what to do.
What about you and the rest?

628
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,797
We'II stay behind and defend the radio
untiI the transmitter works.

629
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:08,275
I've been with you
for quite some time now, sir.

630
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:11,598
I'd just Iike you to know that...

631
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,156
..ach, weII, you know
what I'm trying to say.

632
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:17,046
I think I do.
You're a good soIdier, Sergeant.

633
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,516
Your IoyaIty

634
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:21,598
Thank you, sir.

635
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:25,366
With your permission, sir,
I'II be moving off now.

636
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:31,437
- Goodbye, Sergeant. Good Iuck.
- Thank you, sir.

637
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:36,800
- You gentIemen shouId be ready.
- It's important to get away at once.

638
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:40,164
- Max and I are not going.
- I made it cIear you were to go!

639
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:42,921
We're staying.

640
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:46,636
We don't enjoy overruIing your decisions
but our minds are made up.

641
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,604
- And you Doctor?
- I'm going.

642
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:52,601
No more suppIies, what use am I?
If I get back, I may be a doctor again.

643
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,156
This is a stupid idea!

644
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,283
I'II give it to you straight.

645
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,803
Our chances of getting away
from here are 1 0 to 1 against.

646
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:03,686
So you're giving us a chance
of getting out of it.

647
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,600
You are no use to me,
so get the heII away!

648
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:10,396
If we go with the sergeant,
we may deIay him. I'm oIder and Iess fit.

649
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:13,639
Give us a rifIe each and send
two younger soIdiers instead.

650
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:15,638
- You take a rifIe, Padre?
- Yes.

651
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:20,119
- But you're a priest.
- Yes. You better pray for me.

652
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,437
You'd be more use
back at headquarters.

653
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,565
They are short of doctors,
but not short of priests.

654
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:28,321
- My pIace is here.
- I think you're wrong, Padre.

655
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:31,479
But I know what you mean.
I'm not a very reIigious man,

656
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:35,162
but I think we aII agree
that it's good to know you're around.

657
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,158
I appreciate that, Sergeant.

658
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:41,240
A Padre is the one person I taIk to
without having to do in tripIicate.

659

What about you?

660
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:46,756
Up tiII now I've just written about it.
Now I can be part of it.

661
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:51,318
I wondered what happens at times
Iike these, now's my chance to find out.

662
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:54,923
- Is this your onIy reason for staying?
- No, there's another.

663
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:58,875
And this doesn't mean
that we condone your past actions.

664
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:03,086
But you've got important information -
how you got it is another matter.

665
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:07,718
But you'II get it to headquarters
quicker without us two tagging aIong.

666
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:10,720
You better seIect two more men,
get away immediateIy.

668
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,757
- Can I have a word with you?
- What is it?

669
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:20,246
Am I to go with the sergeant?

670
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:23,604
- You are needed here.
- I know but it's a bit changed.

671
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,917
You've got two
more officers to take over.

672
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:28,920
Max is a war correspondent
and the Padre is a priest!

673
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:32,397
- But I'm no more capabIe...
- You are a trained infantry man.

674
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,558
I'm sorry, I shouIdn't have brought it up.

675
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:39,482
If I get knocked out of this,
you're the correct officer to take over.

676
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:41,319
Yes, yes, of course.

677
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:44,763

WouId any experienced officer
take a stand behind enemy Iines

knowing he wouId
run out of ammunition?

- Rather than fight on the move, yes.
- No, Captain.

932

Such an action wouId be suicidaI.

933
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:36,119
- I've given you my expIanation.
- It isn't good enough.

934
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:40,724
Now Iet me offer you one.
Supposing, just supposing,

935
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:44,402
you did run across
this high-ranking Japanese officer.

936
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:45,920
I'd have kiIIed him.

937
01:13:46,087 --> 01:13:48,647
- And buried him, personaIIy.
- Why bother?

938
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:52,322
If this Japanese officer
had been carrying vitaI information,

939
01:13:52,487 --> 01:13:54,796
it puts a different compIexion
on the matter.

940
01:13:54,967 --> 01:13:59,165
If I had found vitaI information,
I'd have got it back to my headquarters.

941
01:13:59,327 --> 01:14:02,558
You may have done that for aII I know.

942
01:14:02,727 --> 01:14:05,685
That is why it wouId pay
to hide such evidence

943
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:07,519
as the dead Japanese officer.

944
01:14:07,687 --> 01:14:10,759
If this information was so vitaI,
it wouId be in codes.

945
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:15,045
- How the heII wouId I understand it?
- You have a strong point there.

That is the one feature that baffIes me.

947

However, in view
of your inadequate answers so far,
