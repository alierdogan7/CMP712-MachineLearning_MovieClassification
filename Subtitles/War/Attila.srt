1
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:05,836
Though decadent and corrupt,
weakened by politics and war,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,976
the Roman Empire remained
the greatest power on earth.

3
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:13,383
Then a new people, the Huns,
fierce and independent,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,216
appeared from the east.

5
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:19,191
An ancient prophecy told of a man
who would one day unite the tribes

6
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:22,490
and challenge Rome
for the right to rule the world.

7
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:23,613
- My arrow fell short!
- Aim higher.

8
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:25,245
The deer outruns it.

9
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,416
Perhaps it's time
you had a stronger bow.

10
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,618
We're on Dunnotis' land.

11
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:34,289
The chase was long.
We meant no harm.

12
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,959
We'll send him
the antlers as a gift.

13
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,126
Still, we might have been seen.

14
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:41,694
If Dunnotis complains, we kill him.

15
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:44,764
Hush, boy. It's foolish for Huns
to kill Huns.

16
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:49,176
How can we conquer the western lands
if we fight among our own?

17
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,724
Father spoke of the western lands
during the hunt.

18
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:09,423
He was there once,
when he was young.

19
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,294
Did he discover them?

20
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,061
No, no... Others discovered them
long ago.

21
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,932
How?

22
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,168
A gadfly.

23
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,004
A warrior was taming a stallion,

24
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:27,343
and a gadfly bit the stallion
so hard, it ran away.

25
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:31,112
The warrior followed
the stallion into the great marsh.

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,346
But there's no way past the marsh.

27
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:37,517
Oh, the horse found a way,
and the warrior followed the horse,

28
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,549
- and on the other side...
- He found the western lands.

29
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,994
Father says we'll conquer them.

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,830
- When the Great King comes.
- How will we know when he comes?

31
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,030
The Great King
will kneel to no man,

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,470
and all men will kneel to him.

33
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,407
He will rule the Hun as one nation,

34
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,173
and hold the sword of the war god
in his hand.

35
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:04,444
And...he'll go to bed
when he's told.

36
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,108
Yes, Father.

37
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:41,943
(Arrow whistles )

38
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,764
No! Attila, stop!

39
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:08,139
- I want to help! Let me help!
- Get under this cart.

40
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,736
You stay in there.
Get out of the way.

41
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:52,982
Father!

42
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,216
Father.

43
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,863
Father...

44
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,176
Get him!

45
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,445
You are Mundzuk's son.

46
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,185
Where is my grandmother?

47
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,591
She is dead. Your father is dead.

48
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,687
That's his reward
for hunting on our lands.

49
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,631
I am your master now.

50
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,498
Kneel.

51
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,971
Kneel!

52
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:59,141
And I might let you live as my slave.

53
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,169
Hyah! Hyah!

54
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:52,151
What's your name, boy?

55
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:56,789
Attila, son of Mundzuk.

56
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,159
Don't you recognize me?

57
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,463
I am Rua, your father's brother,

58
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,266
and it's a long time
since you've seen me.

59
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:11,536
- My father's dead.
- Yes. Weeks ago.

60
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,805
You've been alone all this time?

61
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,873
You're safe now. Come.

62
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:22,147
Unless you prefer
living alone on the steppes.

63
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,161
(Indistinct chatter)

64
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,547
(Rua )
What are the three sacred animals?

65
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,988
The wolverine,
because he never retreats,

66
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,550
the sheba,
because she protects her young,

67
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:08,118
and the horse,
because it is sacred to the war god.

68
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:12,861
- How many layers in a bow?
- Two of wood, two of bone.

69
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:19,138
How long must you heat
the bow before you string it?

70
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,141
Until the outer layer sweats.

71
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,267
You've been taught well.

72
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,335
Go to your tent.

73
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:34,117
He doesn't belong here.

74
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:37,646
I took my brother's wife
and elder son.

75
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:41,320
Should I leave the younger
to die on the steppe?

76
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,692
Yes.

77
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,753
Yes, for Bleda's sake.

78
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,232
He's the elder.

79
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:51,169
He'll get the larger portion
when I die.

80
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:55,663
There will be trouble between them.
I can see it already.

81
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,611
Who's there?

82
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,162
Who are you?

83
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:23,361
- Who are you?
- Attila.

84
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:27,030
- I am Galen.
- What are you?

85
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,437
- A girl. Are you blind?
- You look like an old woman.

86
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:33,773
- I'm no older than you.
- Why aren't you with the others?

87
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,803
They're afraid of me.

88
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,678
Why are they afraid of you?

89
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:42,583
Because I read the stars and the sky
and the sun and the moon.

90
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,109
You're a witch.

91
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:48,749
I had a vision yesterday
that he would be born.

92
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,021
- Who?
- The Great King.

93
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,825
Stay back.
I was born ten years ago.

94
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,229
No.

95
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:59,758
You were born yesterday,
on the steppes.

96
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,129
Ah, yes.

97
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,970
Yesterday, on the steppes.

98
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,371
(Rua ) Some say it takes months
to make a bow.

99
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,681
But...it takes 15 years.

100
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,916
It starts when the tree
is first planted.

101
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:26,722
You cut the wood too soon,
the bow lacks strength,

102
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,785
too late, it becomes brittle.

103
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,061
King Rua... We found them.

104
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,173
Are these the men
that attacked your camp?

105
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,412
(Rua ) They're yours.

106
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,146
You do with them what you will.

107
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:59,213
- There were more of them.
- They were killed. These remain.

108
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,290
- Kneel.
- Kneel to a boy?

109
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,426
Submit to me and live.

110
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,722
Attila!
Have you spoken to the scouts?

111
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,059
They saw no force of any kind
between us and the river.

112
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,722
Good.

113
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,812
IMPERIAL PRISON
ROME

114
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,186
You should be used to it by now.

115
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,256
We guards eat the same food.

116
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,733
It's slave food.

117
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,829
Only a slave could get used to it.

118
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,956
Aaargh!

119
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,567
I am Flavius Aetius.

120
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,230
Rome endures.

121
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,201
I will endure.

122
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,710
(Man ) Parthians, Scythians,

123
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:51,314
Macedonians, Picts, Gauls, Britons,
Angles, Franks, Jews, Egyptians.

124
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,847
The list of defeated peoples
is endless.

125
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,349
- Why are Huns different?
- They simply are, Majesty.

126
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:02,196
- Wait till they face Roman troops.
- They've defeated us before.

127
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:05,430
From the Eastern Empire.
We're made of different stuff.

128
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,462
- We have no troops near the border.
- Send them from somewhere else.

129
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,498
Not possible.
We're overextended as it is.

130
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:18,437
Is it serious? The Huns
have been a nuisance for decades.

131
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:22,816
- They've crossed into our territory.
- They're isolated raids.

132
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:27,755
And when they realize how little
resistance we can offer, what then?

133
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,318
Placidia, one man
might be able to deal with them.

134
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,386
Aetius will not leave prison alive.

135
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,955
He knows their customs,
knows their king.

136
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,830
I said no.

137
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:41,233
(Emperor groaning)

138
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,636
Felix, I know my son is...

139
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,799
immature, but he is learning.

140
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:48,833
He's emperor now,

141
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:53,211
and he'll rise to the occasion
as other emperors have before him.

142
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,441
There! I did it!

143
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:02,616
What shall I hit?
That vase sitting on the pedestal?

144
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:10,058
Idiot!

145
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,497
He's ruined my shot!

146
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,759
I'll think about what you said,

147
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:19,762
but I have to be convinced that
the Huns are a serious threat.

148
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,536
(All yelling)

149
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:30,844
(Woman ) Invaders! Invaders!

150
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,115
(Screaming)

151
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:21,007
(Baby crying)

152
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:28,217
(Man ) Go! Get moving!

153
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,600
Wait! Your name?

154
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:50,870
N'Kara.

155
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,536
You fight bravely.

156
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:01,150
Put her with the slaves.

157
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,812
Her sword was the bloodiest of all.

158
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,223
If she has kin, spare them as well.

159
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,513
(Keys rattling)

160
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,458
You may leave.

161
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,827
I once swore you'd never
leave this prison alive,

162
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,998
but your friends have
begged me to be merciful.

163
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,030
In the light of their plea...

164
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:07,069
(Laughs ) There's only one conceivable
reason for you to be here.

165
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:10,174
- You need me.
- Why would I need you?

166
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,379
If I had to guess,
I'd say the Huns are on the move,

167
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,877
and you and the rest of Rome
are petrified with fear.

168
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,523
There have been reports
of a new warlord...

169
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:25,019
among the southern tribes - Attila.
Do you know him?

170
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:28,693
No, but I know King Rua,
and that's what matters.

171
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:32,933
My son is young. He needs someone
to guide his decisions.

172
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:36,771
You can serve your country
instead of your own ambitions,

173
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:40,141
- if that's possible.
- Anything's possible.

174
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,875
What's your price?

175
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:45,041
First, a full pardon.

176
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,917
You tried to depose me, before
my son became of age. That's treason.

177
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:52,184
Let's call that a misunderstanding.

178
00:21:57,995 --> 00:21:59,622
What else?

179
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:02,859
Full restoration of my estates,

180
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,367
personal staff, hand-picked by me,

181
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,892
and...

182
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:12,534
reinstatement to the rank
of master of both services.

183
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:17,240
If I am to deal with the Huns,
I must have the supreme command.

184
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:20,340
- Felix has the supreme command.
- Remove him.

185
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:23,648
- He recommended your release.
- I'll thank him.

186
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:27,452
- You can rot in this cell forever.
- And you?

187
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,391
You can find someone else
to deal with the Huns.

188
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,591
Warden.

189
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,596
Release him.

190
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:49,500
He is your new supreme commander.

191
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:09,958
The guard who brought me
my food, what's his name?

192
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,988
Petronius, my lord.

193
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,910
- Father!
- Lydia.

194
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:32,885
Oh, you're really free!

195
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,910
Oh, I was afraid to believe it.

196
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,482
I came to the prison
but they wouldn't let me see you.

197
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:42,187
My God, look at you.

198
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:47,291
You're a young woman,
and a lovely one at that.

199
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,728
The villa's really ours again?

200
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,265
Yes.

201
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:58,936
And the one in Sicily too.

202
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,473
Tomorrow I'll bring in workers.

203
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,643
It'll be as beautiful as ever.

204
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:14,758
(Galen ) Come on, move!
You wretches, move!

205
00:24:16,226 --> 00:24:19,161
Ha, ha, you're in my lot now!

206
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:26,396
(Attila ) King Rua,

207
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:29,098
I bring you tribute from our victory.

208
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:34,640
(Scoffs ) A victory over farmers?

209
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,011
The people are watching.

210
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,178
You are brothers!
Embrace like brothers.

211
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:01,494
Let us see the treasures
that Attila has brought us!

212
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,540
Attila, don't let your brother's
envy spoil your victory.

213
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,945
(Attila ) He's right.

214
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:16,541
It was a village defended
by peasants and farmers.

215
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:20,315
We fight peasants
because no one else dare fight us!

216
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,323
Yes. Not even the Romans.

217
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:27,123
- Rome? That's a different matter.
- We are Huns. We fear no one.

218
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,685
True.

219
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:32,460
But, uh, why wake a sleeping lion?

220
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:38,669
We were 50 leagues
into their territory.

221
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,970
There were no legions,
no soldiers. Not one.

222
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,140
Let me take a larger army
and go further.

223
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:51,673
- How much further?
- To Rome itself.

224
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,179
What will you do when you get there?
Scratch against the walls?

225
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,214
They're wide as wagons,

226
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,851
but they're made of stone,
not of wood!

227
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,810
(Roars )

228
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,972
I scared you.
Galen scared the great Attila.

229
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,678
- I could have killed you.
- What did you bring Galen?

230
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:29,550
- Nothing.
- Attila always brings something.

231
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,112
- You did, didn't you?
- Maybe.

232
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:35,422
Did you have another vision
while I was gone?

233
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:39,918
- Maybe. What did you bring me?
- And no more about the god of war?

234
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:43,798
That vision has been in our tribe
since we crossed the great marsh.

235
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:47,361
After a hard battle,
the war god fell asleep.

236
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,497
His sword dropped from his hand.

237
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,030
Whoever finds it will rule the world.

238
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,340
You must believe it, Attila.

239
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:55,901
Why?

240
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:59,574
Because when you're
in my visions, so is the sword.

241
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,881
A handle of gold and ivory,
crowned with rubies.

242
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,077
I won't even rule the tribe.

243
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:09,682
When my uncle dies,
Bleda will be king.

244
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:13,388
Bleda's not in my visions. You are.

245
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,467
Go away, woman!

246
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,731
Leave me alone.

247
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,033
To think of the red-haired woman.

248
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:27,271
The whole tribe knows.

249
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:30,402
A red-haired woman
has caught Attila's eye.

250
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,811
A red-haired woman has caught...

251
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:33,837
(Yells)

252
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:50,487
Tonight we celebrate
the victory of Attila,

253
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:54,023
the first with Roman spoils.

254
00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:55,797
(All cheer)

255
00:27:55,836 --> 00:28:01,206
Bleda, as the eldest,
you take precedence, however.

256
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:04,266
Choose wisely.

257
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:11,509
Attila, your raid
has brought us many riches,

258
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,985
and I commend you.

259
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,782
Since I did not fight,

260
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:18,381
I claim nothing of value.

261
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,493
Only...

262
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:24,985
an animal, unknown in these parts.

263
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:33,335
A strange creature
with piercing eyes and red fur.

264
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:35,032
(Crowd laughing)

265
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,406
Bring it in.

266
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,982
Later tonight,
I may start my own race.

267
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,291
Huns with red hair.

268
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:01,297
(Crowd laughing)

269
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,816
Attila, what are you doing?

270
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:30,121
You can't kill Bleda. You can't!

271
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,191
Not in Rua's tent,

272
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,823
but when he comes out,
I will be waiting.

273
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:38,026
No. Your time has not yet come.

274
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,933
This morning I had another vision.

275
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:44,564
Destiny has chosen you,
but only if you bide your time.

276
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,601
I'm tired of your visions!

277
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,173
No! I won't let you.

278
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,113
(Groans )

279
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:03,887
A woman.

280
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:06,859
Hey, Galen.

281
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:11,931
If you fight with Bleda over a woman,
the tribe will turn its back on you.

282
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:14,059
Even if you win, you lose.

283
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:17,832
Go back to Rua's tent,
claim your share of the spoils,

284
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:20,135
claim the conquered village.

285
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:23,973
- Am I a farmer, that I need land?
- Claim the village.

286
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:26,002
It was in my vision.

287
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:32,779
Next!

288
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,781
The horse shied.

289
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:43,754
You and your horse are one.

290
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,820
His mistake is your mistake.

291
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:32,107
(Yells)

292
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:49,155
The beast with red fur.

293
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,717
The toadstool who talks.

294
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:55,662
Bleda mounts you
more often than he does his horse.

295
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:59,065
It is no choice of mine.
I'd sooner die than bed a Hun.

296
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:01,068
Then why don't you?

297
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,762
My sister and mother.

298
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,401
If I kill myself,
Bleda will kill them.

299
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,307
They live because of Attila.

300
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:14,977
I've seen the way he looks at you,
and the way you look at him.

301
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,343
I belong to Bleda.

302
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:23,118
A Hun doesn't possess a woman
until she bears his child.

303
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,062
If you bear Bleda's,
Attila won't want you.

304
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,061
And how can I help it?

305
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:39,264
These seeds.
Swallow one every day.

306
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:42,104
They will keep
little Bledas out of your womb.

307
00:32:44,411 --> 00:32:46,242
Attila or Bleda?

308
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,747
Bleda or Attila?

309
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:53,212
I know who Galen would choose.

310
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,727
We don't even know
if the Huns will attack again.

311
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,669
Trust me, they will.

312
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,899
I lived among them when I was young.

313
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,737
How did that happen?

314
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,505
There was a treaty,
an exchange of hostages.

315
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:22,479
They are brave, strong,
and far from stupid.

316
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:27,041
Is it true their women
walk around naked?

317
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,549
They crossed the border
here above Cologne.

318
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:35,285
They sacked 20 villages.

319
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:38,260
As I told Felix, we should
send troops to punish them.

320
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:40,695
And as he told you,
we have none to send.

321
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:45,065
If we pull legions from the west,
the Goths will pillage us instead.

322
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,662
The Huns have violated
our territory,

323
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:50,365
and therefore
insulted my divine person.

324
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,204
The insult must be avenged.

325
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:56,679
It was the Huns that drove the Goths
against us in the first place.

326
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:58,475
And split the empire.

327
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:02,109
That's why I rule the West
and Theodosius the East. I know.

328
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:04,984
Yet your divine brain
does not grasp the point.

329
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:09,481
What we must avoid at all costs is
fighting the Huns and Goths at once.

330
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:11,686
(Girl giggling)

331
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,493
Mmm!

332
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:23,595
Traitor. I'm your sister.
You're supposed to help me.

333
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:25,435
You wanted to be kissed.

334
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,272
Flavius Aetius.

335
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,337
The divine Honoria.

336
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:37,112
I hope you're
behaving yourself, Aetius.

337
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:41,110
If you don't, Mummy said
she'll throw you right back in jail.

338
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:42,747
Forever.

339
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,690
Mummy will have her joke.

340
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:50,692
- Shall we continue, divine one?
- We're going to the Forum.

341
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:53,199
Pritella's daughters
will be there.

342
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:55,963
We'll finish later.

343
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:59,734
I have to talk with Mummy, anyway.
Later, Aetius.

344
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:02,468
I...command it.

345
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:04,170
(Honoria giggles )

346
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:06,841
Goodbye, Mummy.

347
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:12,048
Where is my son going?

348
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,178
To the Forum.

349
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:17,279
He needs rest
from his intellectual labors.

350
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:20,224
- But he is progressing?
- No.

351
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:24,593
Nevertheless, whatever steps
you take, you will take through him.

352
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:28,088
After he obtains your approval.

353
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:34,035
Some things need immediate attention.

354
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:36,802
Training of troops,
stockpiling of supplies.

355
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,833
See to that on your own.

356
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:41,311
- It would help if I had your seal.
- Why?

357
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:44,872
Three years in prison
have destroyed my reputation.

358
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,477
I need proof
that I act on your behalf.

359
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:51,546
The Huns are at our border, Placidia.

360
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:55,081
We must both forget old hatreds.

361
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,526
(Aetius ) Petronius...

362
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,934
Don't worry.
If I wanted you dead, you would be.

363
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:14,000
(Petronius ) I beg you,
forgive my foolishness.

364
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:16,012
I was not well in the head.

365
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:19,808
How does your head feel now?

366
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:23,012
Ready for whatever service
you require, my lord.

367
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,987
Good.

368
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:27,579
I require you to kill someone.

369
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,284
Who is it, my lord?

370
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,461
The Emperor Valentinian.

371
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:41,461
It's all arranged. You'll be gone
before anyone knows.

372
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:47,372
Ten gold talents now,
ten after it's done.

373
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,035
A fortune.

374
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:52,945
- I'll be a hunted man forever.
- No, no, no.

375
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:56,280
The Emperor's mother herself
will protect you.

376
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:59,650
She's tasted power.
She doesn't want to give it up.

377
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,185
Her seal.

378
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:09,686
She gave it to me for this purpose.
Keep it with you.

379
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:12,858
If you're taken,
it'll be your protection.

380
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,440
Tomorrow noon, the Garden of Corona.

381
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,705
Use the south gate.

382
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,974
I'll see that he's alone.

383
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,665
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

384
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,706
Halt.

385
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,737
How dare you raise a weapon
against the Emperor!

386
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,746
I was walking by.
Thought he looked out of place.

387
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,282
Thank God I followed him!
What are you doing here?

388
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,819
I had an invitation from Mummy
to have a picnic.

389
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,494
See if you can find out who he is.

390
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:39,739
He carries my mother's seal.

391
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:42,342
How is that possible?

392
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,119
She invited me here...to be killed.

393
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,125
No. Your own mother?

394
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,184
I should have known!

395
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,264
All this talk
of teaching me to be emperor

396
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:01,565
was just to keep me off guard!

397
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,829
I'll have that bitch boiled alive.

398
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:08,240
No, no, no. Sire.

399
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,642
- You have no proof.
- Her seal!

400
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:14,171
She'll say it was stolen
or she loaned it someone.

401
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:18,151
She'll have an explanation.
Trust me. I know how she works.

402
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:19,743
Yes.

403
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:22,950
You've been
her victim too, haven't you?

404
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,256
- All those years in prison.
- I am not important.

405
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,988
Rome is, and you are Rome.

406
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,463
Act wisely.

407
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:41,167
- What must I do?
- For now, nothing.

408
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:46,474
When she finds out her scheme
has failed, she'll lay low.

409
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,450
We'll take care of her
when the time is right.

410
00:39:57,557 --> 00:40:00,821
I put myself in your hands.

411
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,431
Attila, walk with Galen
in the woods.

412
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,027
I'm tired.

413
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,436
A short walk with your friend.
You won't regret it.

414
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:19,939
(Attila ) Woman...

415
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,208
Where are you?

416
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,075
Don't be afraid.

417
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:04,983
I'm not afraid.

418
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:20,057
Go back.

419
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:23,401
If my brother misses you,
you'll be punished.

420
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,463
I don't care.

421
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,409
Go back.

422
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:42,749
(Aetius ) Valentinian,
tell me what Rome is.

423
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:44,882
A great city, a great country.

424
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,494
Rome is a fire...

425
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,096
a golden flame of power,

426
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:56,125
of majesty, beauty, knowledge.

427
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:59,866
For a thousand years,
she has been the light of the world.

428
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,704
Go outside.

429
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:03,606
Look around you.

430
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:12,010
The Colosseum, the Senate,
Forum, theaters, markets, aqueducts,

431
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:14,042
that bring water from 100 miles away

432
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:16,987
so we can live like civilized
men instead of animals.

433
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:22,825
Of course, you're saying
that Rome is rich,

434
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:25,353
and we have to keep it that way.

435
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,424
That's right.

436
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:34,234
Tomorrow, I'll go to Ravenna and
take command of the Third Legion.

437
00:42:34,272 --> 00:42:36,763
It's two weeks' march
to the Hun border.

438
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:39,036
I'll need Senate approval tonight.

439
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:42,843
- Tonight? They're all asleep.
- You are the emperor.

440
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:44,940
Wake them up.

441
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:47,617
Yes!

442
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,745
I will enjoy that.

443
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:53,757
Darling, I haven't seen you all day.

444
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,588
Valentinian?

445
00:42:56,694 --> 00:43:00,960
Thank you. It's proved very useful.
I'm finished with it now.

446
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,299
Attila, you still want to go to Rome?

447
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,334
If you're serious, yes.

448
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:19,974
I'm serious. Then again, perhaps you
won't need to go to Rome after all.

449
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:22,279
I received a message.

450
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,050
It seems that Rome
is coming here, tomorrow.

451
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,850
We know of your incursion
into our territory.

452
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:06,690
Officially, I protest.
But that's not my true purpose.

453
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,719
Our spies bring word that
the Goths plan to move against us.

454
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:14,962
- Which tribe?
- The Visigoths west of the Rhine.

455
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:18,699
Why not march your legion there?

456
00:44:18,738 --> 00:44:23,197
For your sake, Rua,
and the sake of our friendship.

457
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,304
Our spies tell us the Visigoths
plan to move against you as well.

458
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:31,373
They've been paying tribute
to us for, uh...

459
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,783
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

460
00:44:33,852 --> 00:44:36,343
(Aetius ) And they hate you for it.

461
00:44:36,388 --> 00:44:41,325
Just as they hate us. They'll attack
you first to secure their rear,

462
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,887
then us while we sit here
quibbling over a few border villages.

463
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:02,543
He is of your tribe?

464
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,174
The Visigoths tortured him.

465
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:06,774
My spies saw it.

466
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:11,317
Knowing the horse
is sacred to the Hun,

467
00:45:13,091 --> 00:45:16,322
they carved ten horses into his body
with heated knives,

468
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:18,384
one for each year of tribute.

469
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:20,397
It took him three days to die!

470
00:45:22,165 --> 00:45:25,066
(Attila ) There should be more blood.

471
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:30,734
These wounds were made after death.
Perhaps not by the Visigoths.

472
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:40,242
A Roman general has better things
to do than mutilate corpses.

473
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,911
You've grown soft.

474
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:54,023
The Huns I knew
would avenge such an insult.

475
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:56,860
I came to offer an alliance.

476
00:45:56,899 --> 00:46:00,299
I'll march
against the Visigoths alone.

477
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:02,930
Flavius!

478
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:11,042
We, uh, divide the spoils equally?

479
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,478
Of course.

480
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:15,312
We'll join you.

481
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,079
(Men laugh)

482
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,642
Make preparations, now!

483
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,895
Who was the outspoken one?

484
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:39,838
My nephew, Attila.

485
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:43,536
Attila? I've heard of him.

486
00:46:43,576 --> 00:46:46,374
Yes. He's very ambitious.

487
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:50,540
Why, the other day,
he spoke of invading Rome.

488
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,483
Did he?

489
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,285
I raised him and his brother
since they were children.

490
00:46:57,323 --> 00:46:59,814
They hated each other
from the first.

491
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:03,658
There is the source
of their latest conflict.

492
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,095
(Aetius ) A slave girl?

493
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:09,157
(Rua ) Bleda claimed her
just to spite Attila.

494
00:47:10,735 --> 00:47:15,263
If they don't fight over her,
they'll find some other reason.

495
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:19,276
Why not put Attila under my command?

496
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,939
You'd have peace for a time,
at any rate.

497
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:39,861
They march well, but can they fight?

498
00:47:39,897 --> 00:47:43,424
I sense you'd rather fight
against us than with us.

499
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:48,334
I've seen much Roman arrogance
but little Roman power.

500
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:55,904
(Man ) Sentries are set, General. The
enemy is a league west of the Rhine.

501
00:47:55,945 --> 00:47:59,710
(Aetius ) Wake the camp
after the third watch, quietly.

502
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:01,909
We'll occupy the rise at dawn.

503
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:05,818
- The Huns will cut off any retreat.
- Yes, General.

504
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:20,160
The dead man in Rua's tent...

505
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:24,569
The Visigoths
had nothing to do with it.

506
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,574
And you handled it very badly.

507
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:29,907
You should have waited
till I was gone,

508
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:31,970
and you should have seemed puzzled.

509
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:36,143
"If he were tortured while alive,
why isn't there more blood?"

510
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:41,120
Rua realizes the answer for himself
and is more likely to believe it.

511
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,487
Trickery and deceit...

512
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:47,153
That's the way of the Romans,
not of the Huns.

513
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:50,025
Which way rules the world?

514
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:26,520
A Frankish tribe must have
joined the Visigoths overnight.

515
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:28,931
- We've just seen their standards.
- How many?

516
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,935
Their numbers have doubled.

517
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:46,179
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, Father.

518
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,776
- They have the high ground.
- Yes.

519
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,278
But have they realized yet
what they're up against?

520
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:13,565
At the first trumpet, the center
falls back, feigns a retreat.

521
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,009
The second, they turn and fight.

522
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:20,414
The third,
the Huns attack the enemy flank.

523
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,440
Yes, General.

524
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:31,648
Take the message to Attila.
He attacks at the third trumpet.

525
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:33,524
Yes, General.

526
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,357
Prepare for the charge.

527
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:44,100
(All shouting)

528
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:02,143
Sound the first trumpet.

529
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,807
(Trumpets blaring)

530
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:10,915
They're retreating.

531
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:14,047
Roman cowards.

532
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:18,353
No. It's a trick.

533
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,723
Sound the second trumpet.

534
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,133
(Trumpets blaring)

535
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:32,772
(All yelling)

536
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,072
The courier was killed.

537
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,108
- His body was found a furlong away.
- Send another.

538
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:45,451
I did. But he
won't get there in time.

539
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,227
He'll expect us to attack the flank.

540
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:58,159
He sent no orders.

541
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,168
Attack on my signal.

542
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:07,841
Go! Go!

543
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:11,303
(All yelling)

544
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:04,154
With a few more like him, Rome could
conquer the world all over again.

545
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,637
Theodoric.

546
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,707
It's been a long time,
Flavius Aetius.

547
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,083
But the same result -
a Roman victory.

548
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,716
- Your terms?
- A third of your men sold as slaves,

549
00:54:33,757 --> 00:54:38,091
2,000lbs of gold,
one half your fall harvest.

550
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:39,925
Do you mean to starve us?

551
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:42,761
Would you prefer my legions
burn the entire harvest?

552
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,030
You would never dare
without the Huns at your back.

553
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:49,800
Do you accept the terms,
or shall hostilities continue?

554
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:53,271
I accept the terms.

555
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:58,311
Aetius. The girl is well?

556
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:00,508
I told you before.

557
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:04,746
Lydia is no concern
of yours and never will be.

558
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:12,024
You knew each other from before?

559
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:14,051
Theodoric?

560
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,855
Yes, our paths have crossed.

561
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,492
(Muttering)

562
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:21,559
You hate each other.

563
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:26,403
Strange as it may seem, we
were once married to the same woman.

564
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:28,601
She died years ago. He blames me.

565
00:55:31,812 --> 00:55:37,273
So this fight was for Rome...
and to settle a grudge of your own.

566
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:39,309
I strive for efficiency.

567
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,724
You Romans play with kings and
nations as a child plays with toys.

568
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:46,748
(Aetius chuckles )

569
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:53,191
I go back to Rome soon.

570
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:55,098
Come with me.

571
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:57,762
Learn how the world is ruled.

572
00:55:57,804 --> 00:56:02,207
See if Rome really does play with
nations as though they were toys.

573
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:08,212
There's no one like you in Rome
and no one like me here.

574
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:10,237
Today was just the beginning.

575
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,811
We could do great things
together, you and I.

576
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:18,716
If we don't kill each other first.

577
00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:26,291
What do you say, Attila?
Will you come?

578
00:56:37,576 --> 00:56:39,544
(Crowd cheering)

579
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:35,517
Aetius, we congratulate you
on a great victory.

580
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,953
The glory is yours, Caesar.

581
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,821
I present Attila,

582
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:43,989
whose courage and skill contributed
greatly to our conquest.

583
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:47,987
Attila, we welcome you
as an ally and a friend.

584
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:51,024
Let me introduce you
to some of our leading statesmen.

585
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:57,001
Gentlemen, this is Attila.

586
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,032
He's quite striking,
in a primitive way.

587
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:02,876
His clothes are made of animal skins.

588
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:05,382
He'll have them off soon enough.

589
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,078
Was it wise to bring him here?

590
00:59:08,118 --> 00:59:11,714
(Aetius ) One day he'll be king
of the Huns' most powerful tribe.

591
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:13,746
Then we should kill him.

592
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:17,817
Then we'd be at war with the Huns,
just what we're trying to avoid.

593
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:22,160
- Won't his elder brother be king?
- Attila will be king.

594
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,033
Therefore, we'll seduce him with
wealth and treat him as a friend.

595
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:30,937
And at the end
of all your scheming,

596
00:59:30,973 --> 00:59:33,703
- if he turns against us...
- He will not.

597
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:37,702
It will be on your head, Aetius.

598
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:16,705
Grachia, congratulations
on your latest victory.

599
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,016
Kind of Your Grace to take note.
And this must be Attila.

600
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:24,684
Grachia is the current champion
of the Circus Maximus.

601
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:28,627
- Finest charioteer in the empire.
- Come and watch me race.

602
01:00:28,661 --> 01:00:31,392
I'll make sure you have
the finest seat.

603
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:35,458
A chariot driver at a royal banquet?

604
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:39,733
It's shameful how this city
fawns over athletes.

605
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,274
Some of them
have more money than I do.

606
01:01:28,953 --> 01:01:30,784
It suits you nicely.

607
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:36,854
I wear it tonight only.

608
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,919
- I have another present.
- It's not necessary.

609
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,987
I insist.

610
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,032
What is this place?

611
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,067
A bath.

612
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,502
Go on, step in.

613
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:02,606
You've never seen one?

614
01:02:04,186 --> 01:02:07,713
Aetius has only shown you
fortresses and aqueducts,

615
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:11,954
but I think the bath
is Rome's greatest achievement.

616
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:21,325
It's hot.

617
01:02:21,402 --> 01:02:22,801
Yes.

618
01:02:22,837 --> 01:02:24,738
That's the point.

619
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,667
How's it done?

620
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:30,473
A furnace, a few pipes.

621
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:32,308
It doesn't matter.

622
01:02:32,346 --> 01:02:35,907
It's very soothing
once you get used to the heat.

623
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:40,080
I had a feeling you might like it.

624
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,954
I'm not as stupid as people think...

625
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,980
as you probably think.

626
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:51,055
It's just that brains don't
do a woman much good in Rome.

627
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,923
Mummy's an exception.

628
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:57,800
She had real power.

629
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:00,864
But she's made sure
that I never will.

630
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,901
She favors my brother and has done
since the day he was born.

631
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:09,608
He's a hopeless ninny,
but he's a man.

632
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,175
So that's that.

633
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:17,545
I say, if a woman can only
have power through a man,

634
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:22,994
then let it be with the most
powerful man she can find.

635
01:03:49,653 --> 01:03:54,022
- (Sighs ) Rua grows old.
- What do you want me to do?

636
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:58,391
He likes to drink ale
in the mid morning.

637
01:03:59,262 --> 01:04:04,461
Put this in the bowl
next to his bed.

638
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:08,266
He will die peacefully,
and you will live well.

639
01:04:28,691 --> 01:04:30,851
I was afraid you weren't coming.

640
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:33,622
I have other things
to tend to besides you.

641
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,789
I need mushrooms for my potions.

642
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:39,323
Besides, Bleda hardly
touches you any more, anyway.

643
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:40,959
Galen, wait.

644
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,663
He's planning to have Rua murdered.

645
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:45,400
Be quiet!

646
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:49,068
You could be killed
for saying that, and I for hearing.

647
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,306
Bleda bribed a guard to poison him.
I heard them.

648
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:54,370
You have to do something.

649
01:04:54,415 --> 01:04:56,246
- What can I do?
- Warn Rua.

650
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:59,582
- He wouldn't listen to me.
- Then use your powers.

651
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:04,785
It may be best for us if Rua dies.

652
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:07,089
And Bleda becomes king?

653
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:10,254
- Where is Attila?
- Rome.

654
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,696
- How long has he been there?
- Weeks.

655
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:14,825
Why does he tarry?

656
01:05:16,903 --> 01:05:18,700
I don't know.

657
01:05:18,738 --> 01:05:22,071
If there's one thing
that will bring him back,

658
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,668
it's news of Rua's death.

659
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:28,374
Attila must return.

660
01:05:29,414 --> 01:05:31,245
You love him.

661
01:05:31,283 --> 01:05:34,184
A woman who does not is blind.

662
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,121
But he would never love a toadstool.

663
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:44,856
- Why do you help me?
- You're in my visions.

664
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,693
I must be true to them,

665
01:05:46,732 --> 01:05:50,498
and my visions tell me
Attila is in danger.

666
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,526
He must return. Therefore,

667
01:05:53,571 --> 01:05:58,201
let today's king die
that tomorrow's may live.

668
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:11,980
When you said Rome would seduce him,
I didn't know you meant my daughter.

669
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:15,390
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It cannot continue.

670
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:18,417
A marriage
would formalize the alliance.

671
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:21,897
Married to a barbarian?
She'd be a laughing stock.

672
01:06:21,932 --> 01:06:26,232
I doubt it. But at least there'd be
a Rome to do the laughing.

673
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:29,295
Spare me your speech
about sacrifices for the empire.

674
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:33,673
- Like it or not, we must make them.
- She's not yours to barter with.

675
01:06:33,709 --> 01:06:37,042
An alliance with the Huns
will secure our borders,

676
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,140
and buy us time to make
ourselves great again.

677
01:06:41,183 --> 01:06:44,516
If he'll have her, they will marry.

678
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:46,645
Over my dead body.

679
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:49,055
Well, if you insist.

680
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,591
He puts too much faith
in his influence over Attila.

681
01:07:01,636 --> 01:07:03,627
Even if this marriage occurred

682
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:06,868
the Huns might think it
a great joke to attack us anyway.

683
01:07:06,908 --> 01:07:09,706
- It must not occur.
- The girl is obsessed.

684
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:12,108
It may require drastic measures.

685
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:15,472
Then take them.

686
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:21,410
And Aetius
has outlived his usefulness.

687
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:24,457
I understand.

688
01:07:29,229 --> 01:07:32,892
I never believed in destiny before,
but I do now.

689
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:36,368
It was destiny
that brought us together.

690
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:38,962
Do you believe in destiny, Attila?

691
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:41,975
- Perhaps.
- Good.

692
01:07:42,008 --> 01:07:45,000
So many people
are so boringly virtuous.

693
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:48,673
"The will of God" this
and "the will of God" that.

694
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:52,309
Actually, I only know
one other person

695
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:55,979
who really takes destiny seriously.

696
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:57,819
Flavius Aetius.

697
01:07:57,856 --> 01:08:00,587
Strange, isn't it?

698
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:04,925
I despise him but adore you.

699
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:10,330
- What's his destiny?
- To save Rome, he says.

700
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:13,563
And what's yours?

701
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:18,405
A soothsayer in my village
says I'll find a sword.

702
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:20,706
And when you find it?

703
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:24,178
I'll rule the world.

704
01:08:24,215 --> 01:08:26,580
How sad for Aetius.

705
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:29,814
Aetius can take care of himself.

706
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:34,916
If you'll excuse me.

707
01:08:38,896 --> 01:08:42,195
- What do you think of her?
- She's pleasing.

708
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:44,792
That's all?

709
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:47,564
What else is there to say of a woman?

710
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:51,471
(Chuckles ) You've never loved, then.

711
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:54,533
Once. Perhaps.

712
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:59,509
The slave girl, the red-haired one.

713
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:05,451
A man in your position
can have as many women as you wish.

714
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,478
Those that you love...

715
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:09,581
and those that are merely...

716
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:11,615
useful.

717
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,458
And if your destiny
is to conquer the world,

718
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:18,022
you could do worse
than ally yourself with Rome.

719
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:21,524
What if Rome is part of the world
I'm meant to conquer?

720
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:25,096
Well, there are many ways to conquer.

721
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:28,666
You captured Honoria
without striking a blow,

722
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:32,270
and she may be the key
to your next conquest.

723
01:09:34,415 --> 01:09:38,510
To conquest, however achieved.

724
01:09:41,388 --> 01:09:44,481
Father, this message
was brought to the villa.

725
01:09:56,136 --> 01:09:57,797
Rua is dead.

726
01:10:00,573 --> 01:10:03,405
- I must leave at once.
- It's a bad season for travel.

727
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:05,968
Bleda will be plotting against me.

728
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:09,640
Get a fresh start in the morning.
I'll send an escort.

729
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:12,707
Send a messenger
to announce your return,

730
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:16,880
but take a different route
to make assassination difficult.

731
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:20,323
Challenge him quickly,
and have a reason besides ambition.

732
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:24,124
- A pretext.
- Exactly.

733
01:10:24,163 --> 01:10:28,064
For example, you might
accuse him of murdering Rua.

734
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,069
- The fact is, he probably did.
- I have no proof.

735
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,435
It's no matter. It's good politics.

736
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:36,872
It'll put him on the defensive.

737
01:10:37,909 --> 01:10:40,241
Attila...

738
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:44,908
if things go badly, you know
you may always seek shelter here.

739
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:49,212
I will live or die among the Huns.

740
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:55,784
Then rest.
You have a long journey ahead of you.

741
01:11:07,836 --> 01:11:10,304
Have you been eavesdropping?

742
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:12,637
No, learning.

743
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:15,974
You'll miss him, won't you?

744
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:18,002
Yes, I'll miss him.

745
01:11:18,047 --> 01:11:21,380
Rome produces
few such men these days.

746
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:25,511
This Bleda,
will he really try to kill him?

747
01:11:25,554 --> 01:11:27,578
Of course.

748
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,816
I'll say a prayer for him
before I go to sleep.

749
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,486
Yes.

750
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,690
Say one for Rome as well.

751
01:11:45,974 --> 01:11:47,965
Oh, I beg pardon, master.

752
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:49,908
I thought you were leaving.

753
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,311
(Coughs )

754
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:57,117
(Gasping)

755
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,336
Take him!

756
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,304
Take him! Your king commands it!

757
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,649
You are not yet king.

758
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:12,747
Bring me my crown! Quickly!

759
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:16,954
You see how he wants to steal
the crown, as he stole Rua's life?

760
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,621
You lie.

761
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:22,028
Rua should have died as he lived.

762
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,431
A warrior, not in his sleep.

763
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:27,630
No man can choose
the manner of his own death.

764
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:31,731
- No, not if he's murdered.
- Rua died without issue,

765
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,368
and I am the elder son
of his brother.

766
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:36,843
Therefore, I am the rightful king.

767
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:41,247
To what purpose? To be paid
for fighting in the service of Rome

768
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,080
or some other nation?

769
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,678
We will live
as Huns have always lived.

770
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,349
What else should we do?

771
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,483
We should rule the world!

772
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:52,856
You'd have us attack Rome?

773
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:56,763
No.

774
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:59,289
(Bleda ) He has been bought off.

775
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:04,032
Besides, he has a whore in Rome
who calls herself a princess.

776
01:14:08,809 --> 01:14:13,212
If we attack Rome,
we leave our flanks open.

777
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:16,546
We will return
to find our villages burned

778
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:18,710
and our women gone.

779
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:21,550
(Priest) You've said
what we should not do,

780
01:14:21,588 --> 01:14:24,216
but you've not said
what we should do.

781
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:29,056
Attack north... Pannonia and beyond.

782
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:32,553
- Attack our own people?!
- Not of our tribe.

783
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:34,088
But Huns nonetheless,

784
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:36,796
and we've been at peace
for many years.

785
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:40,567
And war will come again,
as it always has.

786
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:49,042
You all know the ancient prophecy.
A conqueror will rise among us.

787
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:52,812
The one who finds
the war god's sword.

788
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:56,014
Have you found this sword?

789
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:00,824
No.

790
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:03,554
Then your words are empty.

791
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:07,494
I will give a different sign.

792
01:15:11,102 --> 01:15:13,866
I say you murdered Rua,

793
01:15:13,905 --> 01:15:16,669
and are not fit to take his place.

794
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:19,574
And I say you lie.

795
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:22,578
Then we'll meet tomorrow
when the sun awakens.

796
01:15:22,613 --> 01:15:25,604
Let the strongest prevail.

797
01:15:25,649 --> 01:15:28,914
And that will be the sign.

798
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:06,316
He will tip his arrows with poison.

799
01:16:08,557 --> 01:16:12,219
If I die of poison, the tribe
will kill him. He knows that.

800
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:15,252
This poison leaves no sign.

801
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:17,890
How would Bleda get such a poison?

802
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:22,963
You?

803
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,032
Galen...

804
01:16:29,511 --> 01:16:31,741
What evil have you worked for him?

805
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:33,474
Did he poison Rua?

806
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:35,880
Bleda swore he'd kill me
if I didn't help.

807
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:38,817
Besides, I knew it would
bring you back from Rome.

808
01:16:38,852 --> 01:16:41,514
- I would have come back anyway!
- My visions...

809
01:16:41,554 --> 01:16:44,285
- Your visions!
- I was right to do what I did.

810
01:16:44,324 --> 01:16:47,054
This time tomorrow you'll be king.

811
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:49,618
- Give me some of your poison!
- I have none.

812
01:16:49,662 --> 01:16:53,462
There are no more mushrooms.
I've been looking for weeks.

813
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:59,570
Then you've not only killed Rua,
you've killed me.

814
01:16:59,605 --> 01:17:03,735
No. If the poison enters you,
I'll draw it out.

815
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:07,542
How? Will you be riding next to me
on a horse of your own?

816
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:11,141
Attila, find the sword.

817
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:15,645
If you have the sword,
nothing can touch you.

818
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:19,418
Nobody has found it
in a hundred years.

819
01:17:19,457 --> 01:17:22,426
How am I supposed to find it
before sunrise?

820
01:17:37,474 --> 01:17:39,533
I'm through with you, woman.

821
01:17:41,845 --> 01:17:43,835
Never speak to me again.

822
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:40,891
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!

823
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:52,836
(Chanting)

824
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:58,382
Powers of earth and sky, be true
to the visions you have shown me.

825
01:18:58,418 --> 01:19:03,082
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

826
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:12,121
(Groaning)

827
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:18,401
(Groans )

828
01:19:23,743 --> 01:19:25,539
(Grunting)

829
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:46,228
Hyah!

830
01:19:50,802 --> 01:19:52,531
(Gasps )

831
01:20:03,947 --> 01:20:05,141
Hah!

832
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:09,743
Ha. Ha.

833
01:20:12,889 --> 01:20:14,652
(Gasps )

834
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:26,264
(Screams )

835
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:35,306
(Chanting)

836
01:20:47,423 --> 01:20:52,224
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

837
01:21:47,313 --> 01:21:49,837
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hah!

838
01:22:36,559 --> 01:22:40,290
(Chanting) Attila! Attila! Attila!
