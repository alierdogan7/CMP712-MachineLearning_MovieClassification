- [Henry VIII]:The King
of France

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,167
has demonstrated
his aggressive policies.

3
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:09,133
He has our Ambassador
murdered in cold blood.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,000
These are all
just causes for war!

5
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,434
- As a humanist I have
an abhorrence of war.

6
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,901
- As a King,
I'm forced to disagree.

7
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,634
Why is Henry V remembered?
Because he won the battle
of Agincourt.

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,834
That victory made him immortal.

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,701
- He has no right to any
of this. I'm a direct
descendent of Edward II.

10
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:30,834
This is my crown and my court.
Not his crown or his court.

11
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,467
- Treason your Grace.

12
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,467
- What if your Majesty
could gain more power

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,968
by peaceful means?
- Which is...?

14
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,434
- Treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.

15
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,801
- The Treaty is entirely
new in the history of Europe.

16
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,467
- [Queen]: You have not answered
my nephew's letters.

17
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:48,334
He advises you not to heed
everything Wolsey tells you.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,634
- You are not my Minister.

19
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,200
You are not my Chancellor.
But my wife.

20
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,734
- About the other
matter we discussed.

21
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,334
- Which other matter?

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,834
- I saved your Master's arse.
Now I want my reward.

23
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,801
And you can
arrange it.

24
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:07,367
- [Queen]: I cannot give
the King a living son.

25
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,467
The King blames me,
he thinks it all my fault

26
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,734
and now he does not
come to my bed.

27
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,634
- It says if a man marries
his brother's wife
they die childless.

28
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,467
But you have a child.

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,300
- But not a son.

30
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,367
- I am with child.
tdIt is his Majesty's.

31
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:24,434
- There is to be a summit
between King Francis
and King Henry near Calais.

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,667
That means you will both have
the opportunity to meet
the King of England.

33
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:30,400
[Laughing]
Mary and Anne Boleyn.

34
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,767
- Pope Alexander
is desperately ill.

35
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,901
I can assure the support
of the French cardinals,

36
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,801
you will
be elected Pope.

37
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:41,300
- It's time. My father planned
to assassinate Richard III.

38
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,067
He would come before him with a
knife secreted about his person.

39
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,434
Your Majesty.

- What of Buckingham?

153
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:56,334
- In my presence he has railed
against your Eminence,

154
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,000
calling you
a necromancer, a pimp,

155
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:02,567
accusing you of using
evil ways to maintain
your hold over the King.

156
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,868
- And what did Lord Buckingham
say about the King?

157
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:09,167
- He told me he has a greater
claim to the throne,

158
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:12,000
and that as his Majesty
has no male heirs,

159
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,334
and will have none,
that he, Buckingham,

160
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,834
will succeed to the throne.

161
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,234
But he also told me once
that he has considered

162
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,701
bringing that eventuality
forward more quickly.

163
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,868
- In what way?

164
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:28,601
- By assassinating his Majesty.

165
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,100
- You did well to come to me.

166
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,501
But I must warn you,

167
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,734

179
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,934
You won't deny that,
will you?

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,567
Even our wrestlers
are better than yours!

181
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,701
- Are you sure?

182
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,300
- What?

183
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,300
- I said are you sure?

184
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,234
All your wrestlers
are better than mine?

185
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,634
Do you want to prove it?

186
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:57,300
- What are
you suggesting?

187
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:01,934
- I am challenging you to
a wrestling match, brother.

188
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,467
 <i>- Non, David.</i>

189
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:06,834
- You're a coward.
 <i>- Merde!</i>

190
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,467
French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.

191
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,734
 <i>Parce que tel est</i>
 <i>notre bon plaisir.</i>

192
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,734
Let's do it now.

193
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,334
- Groom!

194
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,701
 <i>- Alors ça commence!</i>

195
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,400
- Your Majesty...

196
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,834
- No.

197
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,167
- Your Majesties...

198
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,434
Gentlemen...

199
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,100
The rules are as follows:
the first man to throw
his opponent

200
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,067
to the ground
shall be declared the winner.

201
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,567
Are you content?
- Yes.

202
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,501
- Then fight on!

203
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,901
- What bet will you lay?
- Go, Henry.

204
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,734
- 2 Kings, 2 Queens and a Fool.
- Who's the Fool?

205
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,968
- I don't know yet,
but it's a full house.

206
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,000
- Come on, your Majesty!

207
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,968
- Henry's gonna win.

208
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,734
- Whatever happens,
he's not gonna win.
- Go, Henry!

209
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,067
- Come on!
- Yes!

210
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,100
- Yes!
- Come on!

211
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:22,000
- Ha! Ha!

212
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,000
- I want a re-match!

213
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,300
I want a re-match!!

214
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,934
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a re-match?

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,133
- Are you calling me afraid? Of
what am I supposed to be afraid?

216
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,501
- Of me!
- Let's have it then...

217
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:38,033
- I'm not going to sign
the treaty!
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

218
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,834
- I'm not gonna sign it!
Go and tell them!

219
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,434
- Alright if that's what--
- I said...

220
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:43,934
Go and tell them!
- Alright!

221
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,367
If you want the wod rlto think
that the King of England is
easily changeable, shallow,

222
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,734
intemperate, incapable
of keeping his word

223
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,334
then of course,
I will go tell them.

224
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,133
After all, I am merely your
Majesty's humble servant.

225
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:09,834
Rns|

226
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,801
- Lady Mary.

227
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,834
- Your Majesty.

228
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:22,300
- I've heard
a lot about you.

229
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:30,067
You've been at the French
court for 2 years.

230
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,167
Tell me...

231
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:41,834
What French graces
have you learned?

232
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,033
- With your Majesty's
permission?

233
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,200
- Granted.

234
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:26,968
7"]

235
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,000
- Ah!

236
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,133
[Choir]

237
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:03,801
- And now I ask his gracious
Majesty, the King of England,

238
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,934
to also sign, in good faith,

239
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,801
the Treaty of Universal
and Perpetual Peace.

240
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:32,834
"J0

241
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,801
[Applause]

242
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,200
[Choir continues]

243
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,601
[Screaming]

244
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:16,067
32M6EA

245
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:18,067
- Leave.

246
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:38,767
Forget about the French.

247
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,033
The Queen's nephew's
been electd.e

248
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,334
Now he's not only Charles V,
the King of Spain,

249
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,334
he's also
the Holy Roman Emperor!

250
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,501
His dominions are vast,

251
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:52,400
his wealth extraordinary.

252
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,534
And he's only 20 years old.

253
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:05,534
You will make arrangements
to visit him at Aachen.
Personally.

254
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,801
It may suit us better to do

255
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:09,567
business with him,
than with the French.

256
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,200
- Yes, Majesty.

257
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:19,434
- Sir Thomas Boleyn, your Grace.

258
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:24,701
- Your Grace I--

259
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,367
- What did you thinks|
of that performance?

260
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:28,601
- I...
- Don't be stupid!

261
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,968
You're not stupid. The King's
performance! At the summit!

262
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,167
How did it strike you?

263
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:37,100
- Personally, I would have
wished to seen a greater

264
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,801
more powerful man upon
the throne of England.

265
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:44,400
Someone whose very presence
would have made the French
sit up and come to heel.

266
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,767
- I have the way
and the means

267
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,100
to crush the usurper
of my throne

268
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,367
as one would crush
a revolting spider.

269
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,667
I will
make him wish

270
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,000
that he had entered the Church
after all and left the affairs

271
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,567
of the state to those
who are born to rule!

272
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:08,634
If you betray
me Boleyn,

273
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,667
I'll feed
your body to my dogs.

274
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,901
- Now...

275
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,300
What have you
discovered here?

276
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:26,434
- I have it on
good authority...

277
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:31,000
that the Duke of Buckingham
is raising an army.

278
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,801
He says it's
to protect him while
he tours his Welsh estates

279
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,767
where he's not popular.

280
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:40,834
He's also been borrowing
large sums of money.

281
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,601
- Buckingham.

282
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,634
Invite him to court,
for the New Year.

283
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,501
But don't say anything
to alarm him.

284
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:15,501
tq

285
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,534
How are your children?

286
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:21,367
- They're well,
thank you, your Majesty.

287
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:23,501
I encourage them all
at their studies.

288
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:27,167
Even the girls.
- Always the idealist.

289
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:31,300
- At some point,
I imagine,

290
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:34,234
it will be considered
ordinary enough,

291
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,167
and nothing strange
for a girl to be educated.

292
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:40,501
- I've received a gift.
From the Duke of Urbino.

293
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,334
It's a book called
 <i>The Prince,</i> by a Florentine,
Niccolo Machiavelli.

294
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,534
- Yes I know it.

295
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:48,934
It's about
political opportunity.
[Chuckling]

296
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
- It's true...

297
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:55,100
It's not like your book, <i>Utopia.</i>

298
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,601
It's less... utopian.

299
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,901
Nevertheless he asks
an important question

300
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:08,434
whether it is better for a King
to be feared...

301
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,501
Or loved.

302
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,901
Buckingham is going
to try and kill me.

303
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,200
[Crackling fire]

304
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,901
- Your Eminence.

305
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,300
- Lady Blount.

306
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:48,200
You are full term?
- In a little while.

307
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,901
- Are you well?

308
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:54,334
- As can be expected.

309
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,701
Have you some message
from his Majesty?

310
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,200
- No. None.

311
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,200
But from your husband.

312
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,100
- My husband?

313
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:07,100
- Yes, I have spoken
to him.

314
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,834
He finds that he is...

315
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,501
Reconciled to your condition.

316
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,434
- Then he won't send me
to a nunnery?

317
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:17,334
- He will be
made an Earl

318
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
and be given estates.

319
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,901
- And my child?

320
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:27,033
- That is for the King to decide

321
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,033
whether he will
recognize the child.

322
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,367
I'm afraid I can offer you
no more comfort than that.

323
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,968
- Will you tell the King
of my love for him?

324
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:49,100
***

325
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:09,267
- My Lord, I hereby pledge
my allegiance to you
and your house

326
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:13,167
and do swear to serve you,
even unto death.

327
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,167
- We thank you from
the bottom of our heart.

328
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:19,734
And in due course, you will find
your loyalties richly

329
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,934
and properly rewarded.

330
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,567
- I thought
I should tell you.

331
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:38,367
I am being sent to meet
the new Holy Roman Emperor.

332
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:43,701
The King has asked me
to draw up a new treaty,

333
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,501
uniting us
against the French.

334
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:49,033
- You must be
very disappointed.

335
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,834
- I am very realistic.

336
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:56,434
- Then I am disappointed.

337
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,400
- Our dreams were
very unrealistic.

338
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,767
- Maybe so.

339
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:05,167
But I will continue
to dream them,

340
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,300
even if I am alone in doing so.

341
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:20,033
I fear his
Majesty no longer...

342
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,634
Trusts or cares for me
as he once did.

343
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:27,767
- Thomas, let me give
you a little advice.

344
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,033
If you want to keep
the love of a Prince,

345
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,000
this is what you must do:
you must be prepared

346
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:36,667
to give him the thing you most
care for in all the world.

347
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:44,067
- The thing I care for most
is my integrity.

348
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,667
What is it you care for most in
the world, your Eminence?

349
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,534
***

350
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:08,100
- [Lord]: Make way for the great
Duke of Buckingham!

351
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,734
- His Grace,
the Duke of Norfolk.

352
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:19,734
- Your Grace.

353
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,434
- I hope your majesty will

that is treason too, as
your Grace should know.

You don't know anything.

If I'm accused of treason,

393
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,300
I should be judged
by a jury of my peers,

394
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,033
not by the dogs of butchers.

395
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,133

Buckingham's case.

400
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:33,067

- What?

404
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,701
- I believe
it could be dangerous

405
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,300
to find the Duke
guilty of treason.

406
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,834
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.

407
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,501
On the other hand,
he could be found guilty
of some lesser offence,

408
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:56,334
heavily fined
and banished from court.

409
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,133
In that way
45i[he would be

410
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,868
disgraced but his friends
and allies would have

411
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:04,167
little cause or occasion
to rise against you.

412
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:07,434
- And that would be
the best outcome?

413
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:11,667
- I believe it would, yes.

414
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:17,167
- And you would see to it that
the court came to that decision?

415
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:20,000
- I have every confidence.

416
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:24,868

- Does the King still
call for you at night?

424
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,033
- No papa.

425
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,100
- [Norfolk]: Even though
the King is your Godfather

when you approach him...

427

- Your Grace.

428
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:15,901
- What do you want?
- Only to pass on
his Majesty's love.

429
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:19,534
He appreciates
the role you will play at
my Lord Buckingham's trial.

430
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,534
And for all the care

431
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,834
you have for
his Majesty's well being.

432
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,901
He also sends you this.

433
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:43,400
- This is my father's ring.

434
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:46,601
He was executed by his Majesty's
father, did you know that?

435
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,734
- His Majesty thought
you might like to wear it.

436
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,501
Is this your son?

437
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,167
- Yes it is. He is going to be
received by his godfather.

438

The King.

439
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,067
- Your Grace should have a care
for his inheritance.

440
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:13,634
It would be terrible, for
example, if some action of yours

441
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:18,667
were to deprive him
of a father, a title and a ring.

442
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,234
Your Grace.

443
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:52,000

445

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,601
Give me a child.

536
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:10,334
A son to fill my empty womb.

537
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,200
I beg you...

538
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:24,601
- In a few weeks

539
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:28,501
the court will quit
Whitehall for Hampton Court.

540
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,200
There's been
an incident

541
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:33,734
of the Sweating
Sickness in the city.

542
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:37,567
You know how afraid
the King is of any illness.

543
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,701
- How is the King?

544
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:50,534
I was sorry to hear of

545
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:53,367
Cardinal Orsini's
election as Pope.

546
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:56,868
You are perpetually
sorry, More.

547
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:59,667
- I wasn't simply being polite.

548
00:50:59,734 --> 00:51:01,701
- Oh, really?

549
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,834
- I was not.

550
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,767
As long as there is such blatant
corruption in the Church,
that heretic Luther

551
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,834
will continue to gain followers.

552
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:13,834
I know that if your Eminence
had been elected, you
would have wkedor

553
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:17,267
tirelessly to cleanse the Church
of all its evil practices.

554
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:24,133
- Perhaps you think
too highly of me, Thomas.

555
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,300
Perhaps, you think too highly
of the whole human race.

556
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:42,968
- Lady Blount.

557
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,667
- Mr. More.

558
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:54,300
- The Queen!

559
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,033
- My Lady.

560
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:04,334
- The Queen!

561
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,934
- Uncle.

562
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,701
- Anne.

563
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,167
- Sweet Anne.
- Yes, Papa.

564
00:53:06,234 --> 00:53:08,133
- You know why you are here?

565
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,400
- No, Papa.

566
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:12,467
In Paris,
no one explained.

567
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:14,367
- Good. It's better
that way.

568
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:16,868
- What's happened?

569
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:19,534
- His Majesty is tiring
of his French alliance.

570
00:53:19,601 --> 00:53:23,801
It seems he is also
tiring of your sister.

571
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,667
He no longer
invites her to his bed.

572
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,200
- Poor Mary.

573
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,267
- Poor us!

574
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,701
When she was his mistress
all our fortunes were made.

575
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,634
Now most likely
they will fall.

576
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,701
Unless...

577
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:47,801
- Even if he had me,
who is to say he would keep me?

578
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:49,834
It's not just Mary.

579
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:52,200
They say that all
his liaisons are soon over.

580
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:55,434
He blows hot, he blows cold.

581
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:59,234
- Perhaps you could imagine a
way to keep his interest more...

582
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,901
Prolonged?

583
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:07,133
I daresay you learned
things in France?

584
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,367
How to play
his passions.

585
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:15,534
There's something deep
and dangerous in you, Anne.

586
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:21,067
Those eyes of yours are like
dark hooks for the soul.

587
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,701
- How was your meeting
with the Emperor?

588
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,801
- Good. Productive.

589
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:39,734
He makes no secret of his
antipathy for the French.

590
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:44,868
He wants to go to wa

591
00:54:44,934 --> 00:54:47,234
for an alliance
with your Majesty.

592
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,100
- And in return for
our alliance?

593
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:52,901
- There will be a joint
invasion of France

594
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:57,367
for the overthrow
of King Francis.

595
00:54:57,434 --> 00:55:00,200
- And I shall claim the crown

596
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:04,133
***
and once more truly be King of
England, Ireland, and France,

597
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,801
just like my forefathers.

598
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,667
Your Eminence, has built
the most beautiful palace.

599
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,968
- Thank you,
your Majesty.

600
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:19,133
- Probably the finest
house in England.

601
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,300
I have nothing
to compare with it.

602
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:27,400
Nothing to show more fair.

603
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:36,634
- Your Majesty,

604
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:40,367
it is yours.

605
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:48,634
- With the furnishings?

606
00:55:53,234 --> 00:55:55,200
[Laughing]

607
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,067
Come on!

608
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:14,634
