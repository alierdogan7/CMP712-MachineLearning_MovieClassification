1
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,344
Roberto!

2
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,858
You promised.

3
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,130
- Adios, Kashkin.
- Adios, Roberto.

4
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,085
Oh, hola, Americano.

5
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,387
- Hello.
- Hola, amigo.

6
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,999
Get back!

7
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,395
- Help yourself, Jordan.
- General Golz!

8
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,061
What an accent.

9
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,205
He even knows me
in the dark.

10
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,333
That's all we have in Spain now:
Accents. Eh, Jordan?

11
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,342
Yes, I was looking for you
when the lights went out.

12
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,542
I saw you.
How did it go? The train.

13
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,416
- All right.
- Mm-hmm. And, uh, Kashkin?

14
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,081
- He caught one.
- Huh?

15
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,453
- He didn't want to be taken alive.
- Oh.

16
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,655
- So it was like that.
- Yes. Murder.

17
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,858
- Orders are orders.
- I still say it was murder.

18
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,993
Well, in this business,
Jordan, remember nothing.

19
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,662
Nothing except
the next job.

20
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,002
- What's next?
- A bridge.

21
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,202
- Oh, a bridge.
- Right. To blow the bridge is nothing.

22
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,476
But to blow it at the stated hour
and the time set for the attack,

23
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,610
that's a horse of another color,
as you Americans say.

24
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,451
- Attack?
- Yes. At last we take the offensive.

25
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,755
Oh, it will be beautiful attack.
On paper it looks wonderful.

26
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,389
And if it succeeds...
No, I will not say "if."

27
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,000
This time, it must succeed,
and it will.

28
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,467
What I've told you,
Jordan,

29
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,404
is known only to
the General's staff.

30
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,603
Our only chance to succeed
is by a surprise attack.

31
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,579
Now, here's the bridge,
over a deep gorge.

32
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,845
It's the only way the enemy
can bring up reinforcements.

33
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:57,012
Tanks, artillery, troops...
all must come over this bridge.

34
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,522
I must know absolutely
it is gone.

35
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,820
Not before the attack.
They'd rebuild it.

36
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,795
It must go the minute the attack starts.
No sooner, no later.

37
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,233
So, the bridge is nothing.

38
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,294
But suppose their soldiers are sitting
on it when it's time to blow it.

39
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,602
You know, sentries on both ends.
What do you do then?

40
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,305
In our country, General, they say
never blow a bridge 'til you come to it.

41
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,644
Good.
That's good.

42
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,186
You joke. In this business,
one should joke a little.

43
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,120
I am so serious.
It's why I can joke.

44
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,557
- You think you can get through
the enemy lines tomorrow night?
- Sure.

45
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,529
Good. That will give you three days
to prepare for the dynamiting.

46
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,864
Wait for the attack at dawn,
after the third night.

47
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,869
Mm-hmm. How will I know
the exact time?

48
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,374
Well, use these. Listen.
First, we attack from the air.

49
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,242
When our planes fly over, you'll hear
the explosions. That's your time.

50
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:58,373
Oh, uh, I've got a good guide for you:
An old man named Anselmo.

51
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:03,079
But good. Knows the country like a fox,
and, uh, the people to help you.

52
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,054
Now go and find yourself
a pretty girl.

53
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,825
- But first, get a haircut.
- Is that an order, General?

54
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,901
- Why not?
- I don't like your barber.

55
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,141
Up the gorge to the left
is the bridge.

56
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,612
- Sentry boxes, huh?
- At each end, Roberto.

57
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,383
Always two sentries
on guard.

58
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,652
Where do
the sentries live?

59
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,626
At the roadmender's hut,
across the bridge.

60
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,093
You can't see it
from here.

61
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,795
The other post is on this side,
in that old sawmill.

62
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,609
- How many men at the sawmill?
- Eight and the corporal.

63
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,201
The other post...
how many men?

64
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,248
Maybe more.
We'll find out. Look!

65
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,352
They always spit
in the gorge.

66
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,361
It brings luck.

67
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,523
I wish I could
spit that far.

68
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,571
- Roberto.
- Hmm?

69
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,014
That sentry... He looks like
a man from my village.

70
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,678
He's very young.

71
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,791
He must die?

72
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,186
You couldn't do it,
Anselmo?

73
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,697
I would kill
the sentry, yes,

74
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,135
considering the necessity
of the bridge.

75
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,504
But if I live later,

76
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:07,544
I'll try to live in such a way,
doing no harm to anyone,

77
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,240
that it will be forgiven.

78
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,749
Come on. Let's get this dynamite
where it'll be safe.

79
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,280
- You wait here, Roberto.
- Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.

80
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,720
You want to be shot at
carrying these?

81
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,353
No, not even in a joke.

82
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,395
Go ahead.

83
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,801
Roberto.

84
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,751
He's the boss here, Roberto.
Very strong man.

85
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,887
- I can see.
- Foreigner.

86
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,693
And a friend.
Didn't the old man tell you?

87
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,733
I'm asking you.

88
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,941
I'm here for the republic.

89
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,418
You know those seals, don't you?

90
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,714
S.I.M.,
Service of Military Intelligence.

91
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,551
This is the seal of the General's staff.
They command for the republic.

92
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,252
In these mountains,
I command. No one else.

93
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,635
- What's that?
- Dynamite.

94
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,237
Good.
I can use dynamite.

95
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,433
- How much you bring me?
- None.

96
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:20,443
- What's your name?
- What's that to you?

97
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,242
Pablo.
He's Pablo.

98
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,373
- What for?
- A bridge.

99
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,816
- What bridge?
- That's my business.

100
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,323
- In this country, foreigner,
it's my business.
- Is that the way to talk?

101
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,325
- Do you want to die?
- No.

102
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,225
- Shut your mouth.
- But didn't you hear
what this comrade said?

103
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,163
- He comes for the republic!
- Anselmo.

104
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,701
Help us get this stuff up to your camp,
will you? The old man's tired.

105
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,803
Hola.
What is it that comes?

106
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,712
The old man
and the dynamiter.

107
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,425
Hey, that, that stuff.
Not in the cave.

108
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,167
- What are you making?
- A trap for foxes.

109
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,713
See? Very practical.

110
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:09,287
He catches rabbits. If a gypsy
catches rabbits, he says it's foxes.

111
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,414
If he catches a fox,
he would call it an elephant.

112
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,584
- And if I catch an elephant?
- You'd say it was a tank.

113
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,691
I'll get me a tank, old man.

114
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,065
Someday I'll get me a tank,
and you can call it what you please.

115
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,400
Gypsies talk much,
kill little.

116
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,805
- I'm going for wine.
- Bring a cup for me.

117
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,004
- Hey, you have wine, huh?
- And plenty of it.

118
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,810
- We eat like generals here.
- He eats like ten generals.

119
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,511
- What do gypsies do in the war?
- They keep on being gypsies.

120
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,955
- Well, that's a good job.
- The best.

121
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,621
- How do they call you?
- Roberto. And you?

122
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,392
Rafael. Oh, wine!

123
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,970
- There will be food soon.
- Food!

124
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,131
You have tobacco, huh?

125
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,024
Yeah. I know these.

126
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,721
Much air and little tobacco.

127
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,170
Ah, we eat!

128
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,270
- Hola.
- Hola.

129
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,444
That's the way I comb it.

130
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,377
Go ahead and eat.

131
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,559
Hey. Bread.

132
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,191
How are you called?

133
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,827
Maria.
And you?

134
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,904
Roberto.

135
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,637
Been here long?

136
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,946
This long.
Three months.

137
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,348
They shaved my head
in Valladolid.

138
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,682
I was on the train.
They were taking me south.

139
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,551
- The train Pablo blew at Talavera.
- Yeah.

140
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,990
Many of the prisoners were
caught again, but they saved me.

141
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,028
They and Pilar.

142
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,860
We found her hiding
in the rock...

143
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,866
where she'd run
from the train.

144
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,595
You should have seen her
when we brought her here.

145
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,433
No hair at all!

146
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,566
Cried all the time,
and if anyone touch her,

147
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,474
she'd shiver
like a wet dog.

148
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,080
Man, but she was ugly.

149
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,743
God's truth, Roberto,
though gypsies usually lie.

150
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,480
She looked like
a half-drowned kitten.

151
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,386
Hey.

152
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,489
- You blow trains?
- I have.

153
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,998
- Here?
- No, in Estremadura.

154
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,733
In another six months,
it'll grow out.

155
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,895
Are you, uh, his woman?

156
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,021
Pablo's?
You've seen Pablo.

157
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,695
- I've seen Rafael too.
- No.

158
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,335
No, not the gypsy.

159
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,670
This is a very strange woman, Roberto.
Is of no one.

160
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,939
But she cooks well.

161
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,980
Really? No one?

162
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,824
No one.

163
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,453
No one.
Nor of you, either.

164
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,292
No.

165
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,458
No, I have no time for women.

166
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,737
No?

167
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,310
Maria. Maria!

168
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,890
Who's that?

169
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,929
Pablo's woman,
Pilar.

170
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,033
She's something barbarous,
but brave! Wah!

171
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,602
- Hundred times braver than Pablo.
- Pablo was brave in the beginning.

172
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,195
Sure. He killed more people
than the cholera.

173
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:06,504
At the start of the movement, he killed
more people than the bubonic plague.

174
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,240
But Pilar...
she's something barbarous!

175
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,714
- Mmm!
- Gypsy's afraid of her.

176
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,786
Why not? She has
a strong hatred for me.

177
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,085
- Why?
- She treats me as a time waster.

178
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,455
- She doesn't like gypsies.
- What an injustice.

179
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:28,828
She has gypsy blood herself.
She knows of what she speaks.

180
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,836
But she has a tongue.
It bites like a bull whip!

181
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,933
What are you saying now,
you lazy, unspeakable son
of an unmentionable gypsy?

182
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,445
Answer me, gypsy.

183
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:47,041
I was telling this comrade
what a kind woman you are, Pilar.

184
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,052
- Liar!
- This one comes as a dynamiter.

185
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:55,058
I know that. Relieve Andres.
He's on guard at the top.

186
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,285
I go, Pilar. I go.

187
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,930
I'll see you, Roberto,
at the hour of eating.

188
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,795
Not even in a joke!
Three times today you've eaten.

189
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,630
- And I can eat twice more.
- Get out of here.

190
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,035
- And send me Andres.
- Eh.

191
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,575
- Hola, Ingles. How are you,
and how's everything in the republic?
- Good.

192
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,979
- Both good.
- I'm happy.

193
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,985
What was that gypsy
saying about me?

194
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,087
He said you were much woman.

195
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,214
And I'd say he's right.

196
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:31,089
And what were you saying
to the girl before I came out?

197
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,391
- Mmm, nothing.
- I saw how she was from seeing you.

198
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,263
- I only joked with her.
- Jokes.

199
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,769
Listen to me, Ingles.

200
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,305
She's young.
Not hardened as we are.

201
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:46,605
And she's had a bad time, the worst time
a woman can have, you understand?

202
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,808
- Yes, I guess so.
- I'm worried about her.
When do you leave here?

203
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,919
In three days...
if I'm still alive.

204
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,457
What made you say that?
That way of speaking never brings luck.

205
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,422
Let me see your hand.

206
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,929
Well?

207
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,234
Nothing.
I saw nothing.

208
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,202
What you come for?
Blow another train?

209
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,704
No, a bridge.

210
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,274
All the better.
Now we have causes.

211
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,867
Let's blow all the bridges and get out.
I'm sick of this place.

212
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,742
We are all rotting here
because there is no fighting.

213
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,749
Nothing to do but
watch Pablo get drunk.

214
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,751
This life is ruining him.

215
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,448
- Tell me, what did you see in my hand?
- I saw nothing.

216
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,525
Yes, you did.

217
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,653
I'm only curious, Pilar.
I don't believe in such things.

218
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,493
- In what do you believe?
- In my work.

219
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,466
- I saw that.
- What else?

220
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,972
Nothing else. A bridge
is very difficult, you said.

221
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,871
- No, I said it was important.
- But it can be very difficult.

222
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,776
Yes. I'm going back there
to look it over again.

223
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,644
- How many men have you got here?
- Five that are good.

224
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,719
The gypsy's worthless,
although his intentions are good.

225
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,481
Pablo I no longer trust.

226
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,054
Thanks. I like
your way of speaking.

227
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,730
I try to speak frankly.

228
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,766
- Then tell me what you saw in my hand.
- No.

229
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,963
I saw nothing else.

230
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,542
Go now to the bridge.
I look after your equipment.

231
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,437
Let me tell you again, Ingles.
I'm glad you've come.

232
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,243
We will understand each other.

233
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,671
Are they not well outside?

234
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,812
I don't want dynamite in here.
We have fire.

235
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,856
It's far from the fire.

236
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,795
Smoke?

237
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,587
How goes it, gypsy?

238
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,454
- Is she gonna let you eat again?
- Why not?

239
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,397
Is there wine?

240
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,433
Not much left.

241
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,334
Well, in that case,
I'll have a cup of water.

242
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,934
Maria, is there any water left?

243
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,668
It's too strong
or I'd give you some.

244
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,637
I'd offer it to you, Pablo,
but there's not much left.

245
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,074
- I have wine.
- What drink is that?

246
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,079
Medicine.
Wanna taste it?

247
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,614
- What's it for?
- It changes your ideas.

248
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,914
Yeah?

249
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,061
Bitter as gall!

250
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,631
I'd rather be sick
than have that medicine.

251
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,691
That's the wormwood. I'm glad you don't
like it because there's not much left.

252
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,102
What are you saying there?

253
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,640
I was explaining
the medicine.

254
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,905
Maria.

255
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,119
- What's that?
- The bridge.

256
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,152
Showing the construction.

257
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,120
Look how it seems.

258
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,655
Why, that's
the bridge itself.

259
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,663
- How do you blow up bridge?
- That's what I'm figuring out.

260
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,530
No!

261
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,627
I don't go
for the bridge.

262
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,774
Neither me nor my people.

263
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,744
Then we'll do it alone.
Old one?

264
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,440
Yes.
Without this coward.

265
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,880
Hey, you.
What did you say?

266
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,352
Nothing for you.
I spoke to Roberto.

267
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,892
My orders are
to blow the bridge.

268
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,561
And I say no.

269
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,900
In these mountains, we hide.

270
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,775
My business is to take care of
my people, and I-I know my business.

271
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,779
Live one place.
Fight somewhere else.

272
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,748
Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,
but a way off.

273
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,251
Not here where
they will hunt us.

274
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,323
You'll clear out. Get away
to the Gredos. You've got horses.

275
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,791
I have five horses
and eight people!

276
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,332
You and the old man
with the loud mouth make ten.

277
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,937
Now if this bridge is blown,

278
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,904
we will be hunted.

279
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,032
Hunted from the earth,
from the air.

280
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:29,579
Yeah. Explosions
will fall from the sky...

281
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,615
on my horses.

282
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:35,311
Until you had horses,
you were one of us.

283
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,684
Now you're rich with horses.
You want to retire.

284
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,317
A lie. You no expose the horses
for the cause.

285
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,362
To eat well, yes.
To steal, yes.

286
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,423
To murder, yes.
To fight for the republic, no.

287
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,593
You're an old man who will
make trouble with his mouth.

288
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,331
I'm an old man
not afraid to fight.

289
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,806
I'm an old man
without horses.

290
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,572
You're an old man
who might not live long.

291
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,342
I'm an old man
who will live until I die.

292
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,446
You will blow
no bridge here.

293
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,585
- No?
- No.

294
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,627
No bridge.

295
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,065
Pilar.

296
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,830
- What do you say?
- I am for the bridge.

297
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,872
And for the republic.

298
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,964
What's that, woman?

299
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:38,072
I am for the bridge
and against you, nothing more.

300
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,044
What you say, Primitivo?

301
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,244
I am also for the bridge.

302
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,722
- Fernando?
- To me, the bridge means nothing.

303
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,193
I'm for the woman of Pablo.

304
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,491
- Andres?
- Yes, equally.

305
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,835
The same, Pilar.

306
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,806
Then we blow the bridge and retreat
to the Gredos afterwards.

307
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:08,641
You with your head of a bull
and your heart of a hog.

308
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,443
You think there will be
any afterwards from this bridge?

309
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,484
I am for the republic,
and the republic is a bridge.

310
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,682
It means nothing, huh? Nothing,
then, to be hunted like a beast...

311
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,192
after this thing
which brings no profit.

312
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,024
Everyone to die for it?

313
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,259
Don't try to
frighten us, coward.

314
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:35,270
Coward? Is it cowardly
to know what's foolish?

315
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,864
Or am I a leader
for nothing?

316
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,978
Haven't I brought you all alive
through a year of this war?

317
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:45,946
This foreigner comes here to do a thing
for the good of the foreigners.

318
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,346
And for his good,
you want to sacrifice us.

319
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,082
I'm for the good
and safety of all.

320
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,747
Safety. Huh!

321
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,053
There is no such thing
as safety.

322
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,562
Did I spend nine years with
the worst-paid matadors of the world...

323
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,634
not to learn about fear
and about safety?

324
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,032
Speak to me of anything
but safety.

325
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,465
Look at him.
How I believed in him once.

326
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,374
And look what he is now.

327
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,415
From one year of war, you've
become lazy, a drunkard and a coward.

328
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:22,577
Woman, you have no right
to speak in that way,

329
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
not before my people
and the stranger.

330
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,584
Do you still believe
you command here?

331
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,987
Yes.
Here, I command.

332
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,633
Here, I command.

333
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,134
Haven't you heard them?

334
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,670
Here, no one commands
but me now.

335
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,740
I should shoot you
and the foreigner both.

336
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,744
Try it and see what happens.

337
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:57,581
Listen to me, drunkard.
You understand now who commands?

338
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:02,216
- Why, I command.
- No. Listen.

339
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,295
Take the wax
from your ears.

340
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,796
Listen well.

341
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,663
I command.

342
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,542
All right.
All right!

343
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,551
You command.

344
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,052
And if you want, he...
he can command too.

345
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,362
Maybe I am lazy
and drink too much.

346
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,832
Maybe you think
I'm a coward,

347
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,632
though you know better.

348
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,367
Maybe, but I'm not stupid.

349
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,277
Now if you're a woman as well as
a commander, show us something to eat.

350
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,250
Maria.

351
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,926
Take the food.

352
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,390
- You must be careful.
- Pablo?

353
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,963
If you sleep, yes.

354
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,431
I'll keep an eye open.
What's he doing?

355
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,937
Only drinking. There'll be danger
if he begins to hide the sadness.

356
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,542
If he pretends to be friendly,
it'll mean he's made a decision.

357
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,443
I heard Pilar say it.

358
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,481
What kind of decision?

359
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,577
Who knows? After what's happened,
it would mean great danger for you.

360
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,782
I'll look after myself.
I'm thinking about the bridge.

361
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,383
I'm thinking
about you, Roberto.

362
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,733
Why, Maria?

363
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,564
Well, I don't know.

364
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,146
Did I muss it?

365
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,044
All day I wanted you
to do that.

366
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,621
I, too, Maria.

367
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,181
Where is Pablo?

368
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,351
Aha. He's gone
to the horses.

369
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,917
Now you have to kill him. Why don't
you kill him before he kills you?

370
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,961
He won't kill me.

371
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,896
We waited for you to kill him.
Why didn't you?

372
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,902
And turn Pilar against me? Without
the woman, there's no control here.

373
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:44,304
So he takes the horses and goes.
What about your bridge then?

374
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,603
Ah, you don't know Pablo.

375
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:54,715
Now, man, you have
tightened your garters.

376
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,779
You, my friend.
You know I'm not a coward.

377
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,814
Yeah.

378
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,784
You are no woman,
no fool.

379
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,181
No.

380
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,726
Nor any colt
of a girl either...

381
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,523
that makes a man
crazy with hunger.

382
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:19,294
You don't lie, make insults
and leave me like my people.

383
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:23,271
Yes. Yes, eat.

384
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,842
Eat, my friend.

385
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,446
Pay no attention to the woman.
You know who commands.

386
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:36,275
You and me,
we'll show them who's stupid.

387
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,821
Not me.
Not you, my friend.

388
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,654
Get out of sight!

389
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,461
- Ours?
- German and Italian.

390
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,971
- Huh? Can they see the horses?
- They're not looking for horses.

391
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,973
Man, I could see their faces.

392
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,270
I spit in their faces.

393
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,140
I spit in the milk
of their mothers.

394
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,681
I tell you... I tell you
they could see the horses.

395
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,685
Wipe the sweat from your face.
They could see the cigarette butts.

396
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,312
Huh?

397
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,218
- Hey, wait! They may be back!
- Coward!

398
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,887
Go to your horses.

399
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,125
- Have you seen planes like this before?
- Never, Ingles.

400
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,166
Get inside.

401
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:08,002
I'm going with Pilar to the camp of
El Sordo. We've got to have more horses.

402
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,013
You know your sentry posts.
Keep a close watch.

403
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,815
Anselmo,

404
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,580
I want you to write down everything
that passes along the road.

405
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,282
I can't write, Roberto.

406
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,516
I'll show you how to write.

407
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,596
Look how Roberto
can make pictures.

408
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,791
That... That's a truck.
See?

409
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,733
And here's a soldier on a horse.

410
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,738
Look! A tank!

411
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,244
I will catch me
a tank like that!

412
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,553
Whatever passes,
make a mark.

413
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,885
The man on the horse
is for cavalry.

414
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:58,051
Each mark will mean a troop
of 20 mounted men. Understand?

415
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,253
Each troop, a mark.

416
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,323
In this way,
I can write. Yes.

417
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,335
That's an educated pencil!

418
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,841
One paper is for movement up the road,
the other for movement down the road.

419
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,173
When you get back tonight, I'll know
what they're moving up to the front.

420
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,476
Better get along,
and take some food with you.

421
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,180
Can I write too? Huh?

422
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,221
I want you to watch the bridge
and the two sentry posts.

423
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:30,019
See if more soldiers are brought and
at what intervals the guard is changed.

424
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,687
What... What is "intervals"?

425
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,891
How many hours the sentries stay on
and at what time changes are made.

426
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,695
Yeah.

427
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,033
- Without a watch?
- Take mine.

428
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,663
Oh!

429
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,901
What a watch!

430
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:50,172
Look at what a complication.

431
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,875
- Such a watch should be able
to read and write.
- Don't fool with it.

432
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,985
- Can you tell time?
- Why not?

433
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,714
12:00 day: Hunger.

434
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,051
6:00 night: Drunk.

435
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,022
With luck.

436
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,522
10:00 night: Ooh-ooh.

437
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,927
You don't need to be a clown.

438
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:09,964
Do what I tell you
and keep out of sight.

439
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:15,633
Salud, gypsy.
Did you see the air machines?

440
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,434
See them?

441
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,042
We ate them
for breakfast.

442
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:24,740
Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.

443
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,180
It's a long walk
from La Granja.

444
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,821
La Granja?

445
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,755
Yes, Roberto.
You wish tobacco?

446
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,055
- You?
- Didn't you sleep here last night?

447
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,062
For a while, yes.

448
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,860
Then I thought of my woman
and children in La Granja.

449
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,867
- Then I went to La Granja.
- Wasn't that dangerous?

450
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,905
Eh, it's all a matter of
getting past their sentries.

451
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,974
That's why
I only go at night.

452
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,975
Oh, Maria.

453
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,915
See much movement along
the road last night?

454
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,315
Nothing.
A few trucks, as usual.

455
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,388
Cars.
A few guns, as usual.

456
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,584
- No troops.
- Pick up any news in town?

457
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,888
But nothing.
Oh...

458
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,591
It still goes badly in the north.
That's not news.

459
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:23,205
Oh, yes, there is talk that
the republic is preparing an attack.

460
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,911
- That what?
- That we are preparing an offensive.

461
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,704
- Where?
- Perhaps here.

462
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,680
Perhaps near Navacerrada.

463
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,912
- Have you heard of it?
- Where's that talk come from?

464
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:41,616
Where?
Surely you know how rumors fly.

465
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,717
The officers talk in the cafes,
and the waiters listen.

466
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,921
The rumors come running.

467
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,498
They say this is
an offensive of some size,

468
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,160
but, uh, it's only a rumor.

469
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,838
What else did you hear?

470
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,840
Nothing, man.

471
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,745
Uh, just...
there is some talk...

472
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,146
that the republicans will try
to blow the bridges, but...

473
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,048
Are you joking?

474
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,451
This one
doesn't joke, Ingles.

475
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,525
Bad luck he doesn't.

476
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,221
A man like me is never
alarmed by rumors, Pilar.

477
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,992
- Remember anything more?
- No.

478
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:28,036
Oh, they talk as usual of soldiers to be
sent to clean us out of these mountains.

479
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,766
There is some talk troops are on the
way, but they always talk like that.

480
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,275
Is not to give
any importance to.

481
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,403
Only rumors as usual.

482
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:40,573
Mmmm, rumors.
Everything as usual.

483
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,175
Things are bad
in the north, as usual.

484
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,721
The troops come
to hunt us out, as usual.

485
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,485
An offensive here,
as usual.

486
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,562
Man, you are a monument
to "as usual."

487
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,292
But the last two, Pilar,
are only rumor.

488
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,595
My mother!

489
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,763
Let's go, Pilar.
Who'll look after my things?

490
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:07,104
The man of rumors. Remain here,
Fernando, and guard the explosives.

491
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,735
Very well, Pilar.
Calm yourself.

492
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,372
There is nothing to worry about.
Only rumors.

493
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,485
Wait.

494
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,450
Hello, Maria.

495
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,630
Hello, Roberto.

496
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,266
Ingles.

497
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,674
- Hola, Pilar.
- Hola.

498
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,311
- Hola, Joaquin.
- Hola, Maria.

499
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,313
Tell El Sordo
I am coming with Ingles.

500
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,509
A good boy, Ingles.

501
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,643
El Sordo saved him
when his family was killed,

502
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,621
and now they are like
father and son.

503
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:34,194
Ingles, tell me.
Have you known many women?

504
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:39,493
- They meant nothing.
- I think you lie.

505
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,104
Well, maybe, a little.

506
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,005
And for this one?
For Maria, you care much?

507
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,009
Let's get on.

508
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,548
What is the reason
for the bridge, Ingles?

509
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,149
Is there gonna be an attack?

510
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,421
And the airplanes this morning.

511
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:12,331
Does that mean the enemy's found out?
They're preparing a counterattack?

512
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,427
- I only know one thing for certain.
- What's that?

513
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,370
- You have to shout.
- I only know one thing for certain.

514
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,943
The bridge has got to go
when the attack starts.

515
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,603
To do that, we've got to have more
horses and more men, if we can get them.

516
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,885
When do we blow it?

517
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,654
Day after...
Day after tomorrow.

518
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,123
- Why not tonight?
- Orders.

519
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,560
- How do you get whiskey?
- Make it.

520
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,635
No, no, no. I joke.

521
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,762
This is good whiskey.
We got it on a raid.

522
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,703
No ice.
Plenty ice up there.

523
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,543
Too far.

524
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,756
Easier blow the bridge
tonight.

525
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,324
I'd be shot for it.

526
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,892
Do it in daylight
and we may all be shot for it.

527
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,224
- Not if we have horses.
- Hmm?

528
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,263
Not if we have enough horses.

529
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,232
We'll get out of here quickly
before the soldiers come after us.

530
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,930
I have five horses
and four men.

531
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,232
Five men, Sordo.

532
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,070
So it is.
Five with the boy.

533
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,608
Five men
and five horses.

534
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,740
- That's ten horses for 15 people.
- Mmm.

535
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,250
We've got to have
five more horses.

536
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,652
For the retreat, yes. No one
will get out alive without a horse.

537
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,522
- How can you get horses?
- Steal 'em.

538
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,026
Only soldiers
have horses now.

539
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,496
Soldiers and thieves like us.

540
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,193
- Can you get five more tonight?
- When?

541
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,803
Tonight.

542
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,430
We can try.

543
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,567
- Good.
- Maybe not so good.

544
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,742
Not good if it snows.

545
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,974
Horses make tracks,
and soldiers follow tracks.

546
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,415
- It is too late for snow, Sordo.
- Hmm?

547
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,384
It's the month of May.

548
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,012
And the sun is shining.

549
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,024
Look at the young general.

550
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,392
Already he's stealing horses.

551
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,761
He's always talking, Pilar, how
he's carried the girl from the train.

552
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,960
- Yeah.
- Let's see you carry her...

553
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,536
down the hill, my boy.

554
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,163
Now you make fun of me.

555
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,875
Wait, Joaquin!
I'll carry you on my shoulders!
