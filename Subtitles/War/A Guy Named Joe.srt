1
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,267
Off we go

2
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,868
Into the wild blue yonder

3
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:41,434
Riding high...

4
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,767
It's Pete sandidge's
Squadron.

5
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:00,367
I'll bet you he's the best
Flyer in the whole world.

6
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,334
He's a grand-standing
Windbag.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,367
You can't trust him
With a motorcycle,

8
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:05,634
Much less an airplane.

9
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,033
The report says "only one
Plane slightly damaged."

10
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,000
Every time they cross the
Channel, it's the same old story.

11
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,033
Here's the squadron. I got a
Chance to get a little sleep-

12
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,968
But no. Sandidge and yackey are
Up there somewhere playing tag.

13
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,033
And to think I once
Turned down a chance

14
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,534
To transfer to
The quartermaster corps!

15
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,033
Another routine
Complaint about him

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,534
From headquarters
This morning.

17
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,534
What did it say?

18
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,968
Oh, the usual.

19
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,033
What does headquarters think
These guys came over here for,

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,567
A sewing circle?

21
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,067
They're playing
For keeps!

22
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,033
Cops and robbers
With rocks in the snowballs,

23
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,567
Brass knuckles
And lead pipes

24
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:37,534
And a roughneck conviction that
Can lick any man in the world.

25
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,767
So headquarters in london
Complains... So what?

26
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:43,000
Look, look,
Here comes one on fire!

27
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,267
Uh-oh. I think
They're coming in now.

28
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,133
Those undisciplined
Hooligans.

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
If they've ruined another ship, I'll
- I'll kill 'em!

30
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,000
Every time they go up, there's
Nothing but trouble, trouble, trouble!

31
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,167
You'd think b-25s
Grew on trees!

32
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,501
Look at that ship!
A 3-alarm fire!

33
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,634
It's going to make
A crash landing!

34
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,734
Let's go.
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,868
Any bloody noses
Down there?

36
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,534
We're all right,
Skipper.

37
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,601
You all right?

38
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,534
We're o.k., sir.
That was one swell landing.

39
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,868
Good shooting.

40
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,501
Thank you,
Sir.

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,801
You o.k., Pete?

42
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,033
Sure, I'm o.k.
Gimme a cigarette.

43
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,000
You know, you just did make it, pal.

44
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,000
Thanks for
Herding me in.

45
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,200
Uh-oh.

46
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,367
Boy, oh, boy, I never seen so much black

47
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,534
In one place
In my life, did you-

48
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,501
Good morning.

49
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,000
Morning, sir.

50
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,000
Mission completed, sir.
All planes safe.

51
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,534
Oh, yes.
Yes, thanks.

52
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,501
Boy, you set
This crate down

53
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,534
Like a ladybug
On a toadstool.

54
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:26,534
I thought for a minute you was
Going to have to bail out, Pete.

55
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,868
Can't afford to lose a plane
In good shape like that.

56
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,534
Make a report
To intelligence.

57
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,501
Pick me up
In about an hour.

58
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,534
Oh, Sandy?

59
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,534
Looking over
Your ship, I-

61
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:40,534
Yes, sir. I was gonna make the
Report. I got a date. See you later.

62
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll make
The report, sir.

63
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,901
Mind if I walk
With you?

64
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,200
No, sir.

65
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,167
Lucky the other man got
Off so easily, isn't it?

66
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,601
Uh-uh. You know I
Always bring 'em back.

67
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,334
Just a day for a little
Bad luck, that's all.

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,334
And yesterday
Was your day, too,

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,367
And the flight
Before that.

70
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,501
Yeah. Been havin' a
Lot of luck, haven't I?

71
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,467
What a beautiful day. Look at that sun.

72
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,501
Makes a guy
Feel good.

73
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,501
How high were you when you
Went in for your bombing run?

74
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,501
Now, look, nails, al
Is making out a report.

75
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,501
I got a date, and she's
Gonna get mad if I'm late.

76
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,501
I gotta shave and wash
And everything.

77
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,534
Why don't you wait
For the pilot's report?

78
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,467
O.k. Tell Dorinda for me she's
Lucky you got back at all.

79
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:22,968
What are you trying to
Do, break up my romance?

80
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,000
Just trying to
Keep you alive.

81
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,701
Ha ha. Leave that to me,
Nails. I'll be seeing ya.

82
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:28,701
Yeah.

83
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:29,934
Soon.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,534
There he is!
You call him.

85
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,033
No. I did it
Yesterday.

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,501
Just holler, "hey, joe"
Like the americans do.

87
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,200
But his name
Isn't joe.

88
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,701
Don't you know anything about slang?

89
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,667
In the american
Air forces,

90
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:45,033
Anybody who's a right chap
Is a... A guy named joe.

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,000
That's very foolish,
Peter. I'll call him.

92
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,367
No, elizabeth.
I will.

93
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,501
Yeah.
Oh, Pete!

94
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,767
We're very glad
You got back safe.

95
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,167
Could you settle
An argument for us?

96
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,667
Could you, please?

97
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,334
Yeah, sure. I guess
That could be arranged.

98
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,601
Well, now, what's
The beef this morning?

99
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, cyril says the
Spitfire's a better plane

100
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,000
Than the
American p-38,

101
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,000
And I say the
P-38's better.

102
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,667
I didn't say it was all the way better.

103
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,467
I just said it was mostly better.

104
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,434
We shouldn't have
Any trouble about that.

105
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,501
The p-38
Is a little faster,

106
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,033
And the spitfire is a
Little more maneuverable.

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,534
They're both
Good planes.

108
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,033
You see?

109
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,000
I told him,
Talking all the time

110
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,033
About the spitfire
Being better

111
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,534
Was bad for british
And american relations.

112
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,033
Well, I've got an uncle in america.

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,501
That's more
Than you have.

114
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,534
Everybody has an uncle
In america.

115
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,033
Pete, what would
Happen

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,000
If you went way,
Way up high

117
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,033
And forgot to turn
Your oxygen tank on?

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,033
Well, you'd get weak. You'd
Get dizzy, and short of wind.

119
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,234
You wouldn't be able to think
Properly. You couldn't coordinate.

120
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,234
I mean, you might tell
Yourself to do one thing,

121
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
And you'd find yourself
Doing something else.

122
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,901
Gosh!

123
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,000
Pete, tell us
How it feels

124
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,701
To be up alone
In a plane

125
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,200
All by yourself.

126
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,200
Again?

127
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:06,167
Please.

128
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,667
Do tell us,
Pete.

129
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,000
We're nuts to
Hear you tell it.

130
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,167
All right.

131
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:15,767
Well, when you're up there
All alone in your ship, you...

132
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,467
Say, uh...

133
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,133
You kids don't ever mention
Any of this stuff I tell ya,

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,501
Do ya?

135
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, no! Never.

136
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:25,968
Well, don't.

137
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,434
We won't.

138
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, uh, when
You're up there,

139
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,534
You're-you're
All alone.

140
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,567
It's just you and your ship and the sky.

141
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,968
And you don't want
Anybody up there with you.

142
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,000
You don't want
Anybody to spoil it.

143
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:41,033
Everything's kinda still.

144
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,033
You have the feeling that
You're halfway to heaven.

145
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,501
You don't even seem to hear
The sound of your own motor,

146
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,701
Just a kind of a buzz,

147
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,801
Like the sky
Was calling you...

148
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:54,467
Like the sky
Was singing you a song.

149
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:55,467
Gosh.

150
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,934
Yeah.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,467
And somehow it's never
8:00 up there.

152
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,400
It's... It's always now.

153
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,968
And the earth
Is so far below you

154
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,968
That it just doesn't
Matter anymore.

155
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,000
The sky is the thing
That's important.

156
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,501
The sky is your pal.

157
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:13,133
You feel like nudging it and
Saying, "hi, sky. How are you today?

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,501
And how's the old moon
The last time you saw him?

159
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,000
The wind drift comes
Straight off the morning star,

160
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,934
And beautiful white
Clouds drift towards you.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,934
And they're like
Old friends,

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,467
Friends you never
Want to say good-bye to.

163
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,467
And you see a patch
Of clear area between 'em,

164
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:32,467
And you duck in and out
Like a porpoise

165
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:34,000
Rolling in the ocean.

166
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,968
And then you say
To yourself, "boy, oh, boy,

167
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,033
"this is the only time
A man is really ever alive,

168
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,033
The only time
He's really ever free."

169
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,033
The old sky smiles
Back at ya

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,067
And says, "boy, you're
Right. You're dead right."

171
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,467
What happens when your motor conks out?

172
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,934
Oh, elizabeth,
Elizabeth,

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,701
How did you ever get
Into this gang?

174
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,267
Hey, Pete,

175
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,734
Come on, will ya?

176
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,767
Where've you been?
I've been waiting for ya.

177
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,968
You kids run along.

178
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,968
Can we come by and
See you tomorrow, Pete?

179
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,467
Yeah, but not a word
About this to anybody.

180
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:10,434
This is just between us now, us pilots.

181
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,801
Gosh!

182
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,601
Well, that Dorinda is
Certainly crazy about me.

183
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,501
She's an hour late already.
Our first day off in 3 weeks.

184
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,467
Maybe she figures
It'd do you good

185
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,534
To be held up
Once in a while.

186
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,601
It kinda keeps a fella's
Interest alive.

187
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,534
One of these days I'll put
That dame across my knee-

188
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,000
You're not even
Listening to me.

189
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,968
That gal's flown stuff all
Over these here british isles.

190
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,968
Bet she could teach you a
Thing or two about a ship.

191
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,501
Then she's late on
Purpose. That's worse.

192
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,534
What does she
Think I am?

193
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,501
I reckon she's got
A pretty good idea.

194
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,501
What's the matter? You
Oughta be feeling good.

195
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,033
Why?

196
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,000
Foolin' nails. We talked
Ourselves outta that one

197
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,000
Slick as anything
I ever did see.

198
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,033
He didn't have
A thing to say.

199
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,534
Are you kidding? That's
Just what I'm worried about.

200
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,534
That's why I wish
She'd show up

201
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,601
So we could get outta
Here! Gimme a cigarette.

202
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,667
Why don't you ever buy
A package of cigarettes?

203
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,234
Hey, I hear
A puddle jumper now.

204
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,367
Yeah, that's her,
All right.

205
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,133
Yeah... Yeah.

206
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,033
Nobody else in the world
Would try a landing like that!

207
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,300
I can't watch this. Let
Me know if she makes it.

208
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,334
I've branded steer calves
That make less fuss than you

209
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,067
When that gal's
In the air.

210
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,133
Look at her. Pretty a
Landin' as you ever did see.

211
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,601
Are you kidding?
No, look!

212
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,701
How many times
Do I have to tell ya

213
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,567
To quit slipping this maytag
Messerschmitt when you're in a turn?

214
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,534
Now you know
When I saw you down here

215
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,000
I had to kill
That altitude.

216
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,067
You killed more
Than the altitude.

217
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,033
You don't even know
How to level off!

218
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,267
Is that so? Well, I always
Manage to come in on 3 wheels.

219
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,767
So does a tricycle.

220
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,267
And another thing-

221
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,767
Another thing. What?

222
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,400
How'd you get
Your face so dirty?

223
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,367
I waited around
For an hour.

224
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,033
Grumble, grumble. No other
Guy would wait an hour

225
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,033
To watch a girl
Make a bad landing.

226
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't darling me!
Now, darling-

227
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,033
You oughta be
Grounded.

228
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,534
One of these days,

229
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,534
You're gonna spin in and
Break that scrawny little neck.

230
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:22,534
Not scrawny!

231
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,033
It's a turkey neck.

232
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,067
A turkey neck.
Who's talking?

233
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,567
Why, Pete!

234
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,567
You were worried!

235
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,534
Did you ever
Stop to think

236
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,567
What one of those
Crates cost?

237
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,567
Hah! That's a cover-up.
You love me.

238
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:35,567
I love airplanes.

239
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,133
That's the same thing.
Hello, al!

240
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,601
Say, you pretty near scared
Our hot pilot here to death

241
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,000
Comin' in like that.

242
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,067
Well, he's probably got a
Crush. They get over it, though.

243
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,067
Least all mine do.

244
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,567
Get in before
I do break your neck.

245
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,567
Oh, Pete. Sorry.
Nails wants to see you.

246
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,534
Aw, now, cliff,
Be a good fellow.

247
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,501
When you got here, we were
Gone. It's a kind of mystery.

248
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,501
Yeah, but a mystery where the
Detective is always the fall guy.

249
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,534
Besides, I said
I was sorry.

250
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,501
See, this wouldn't have
Happened if you'd been on time.

251
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,033
Come on,
Come on.

252
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,033
If you hadn't pulled
Some fool stunt,

253
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,033
He wouldn't be out here hunting for you!

254
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,501
What have you done
Now?

255
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,534
Nothing. You know they can't
Run this show without me, honey.

256
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,033
You get all dressed up and be
At the inn for dinner at 8:00.

257
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,534
It's possible
I won't be there.

258
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,534
If you're not, I'll have somebody
Else... Better-lookin', too.

259
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,734
You do and I'll scratch your eyes out.

260
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,534
You sent for me,
Colonel?

261
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:38,534
Yes. Yes. Um...
Let's see, what-

262
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,067
Oh, sit down, major.

263
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,067
Thank you, sir.

264
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,067
Oh, I know
What it is.

265
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,033
I got a problem here
You can help me solve.

266
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,567
Is that so, sir?

267
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,534
Yes. Knowing how interested you are

268
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,067
In photography.

269
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,467
Ha ha. You must be thinking
Of someone else, colonel.

270
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not interested
In photography,

271
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,501
Especially
On my day off.

272
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,501
Oh, this won't take
Very long.

273
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,501
I happened to run
Across photographs

274
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,000
Of the raid
This morning.

275
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,501
Very, very interesting.

276
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,968
Here. Have a look.

277
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,467
Yes, sir.

278
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,901
Do you, uh, see it,
Major?

279
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,968
How high, or rather, how low would
You say that plane was flying?

280
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,033
Oh, I wouldn't
Know that, colonel.

281
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,033
My guess would be
About a thousand feet.

282
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,033
That's exactly
What I would say, major!

283
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,501
Exactly!
A thousand feet.

284
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,534
Captain yackey's report
Said the squadron

285
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,534
Bombed at, uh,
12,000 feet.

286
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,968
I was just wondering

287
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,033
Whose plane could have
Come in at a thousand?

288
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,601
And another thing...

289
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,534
Have you any idea
What that is, major?

290
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:39,033
No, colonel, I haven't
The faintest idea.

291
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,000
That is an engine
Whistle-

292
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,067
You know,
Off a locomotive-

293
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,567
Toot toot.

294
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:47,567
It was blown right through
The fuselage of your ship.

295
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,567
Amazing, isn't it,
Major?

296
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:54,000
Would you like me
To say

297
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,000
Of course!

298
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,501
Of course I would,
Major!

299
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,501
You know, after all these
Years of being buddies,

300
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,400
Why should we
Suddenly allow rank

301
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,367
To come between us
And the truth?

302
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,634
Speak up, Pete!

303
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:07,334
You said to take care of
The roundhouse, didn't ya?

304
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,834
Well, the squadron missed it,
So I went in and took it out!

305
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,534
I've been under the impression
This is a war we're fighting!

306
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,000
Of course,
I could be wrong-

307
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,033
Don't get excited. Of
Course we're fighting a war.

308
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,000
But you seem to want to end
It in the next 3 days, alone!

309
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,033
Come on, nails, let's
Get this over with!

310
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,000
All right! When you're
With your squadron,

311
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,033
You lead the squadron,
Not lone wolf it.

312
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,033
You control a lot
Of lives and planes.

313
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,033
I expect you to stay
Where you belong!

314
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
You said to take out
The roundhouse!

315
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,100
You can't take out the
Roundhouse at 12,000 feet!

316
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,534
Then make a report, and we'll
Put it on special assignment!

317
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,601
When a tough job comes
Up, I won't make a report!

318
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,033
And I won't assign it to somebody else
- I'll do it myself!

319
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,501
So long as I'm in
Command,

320
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,467
I don't want any
Squadron commander

321
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,534
Playing hide 'n' seek
Among the chimney stacks!

322
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,567
Are you trying
To be a hero?!

323
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,033
Aw, wait a minute,
Nails!

324
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,000
Where were you when you got
That dfc, playing mumblety-peg?

325
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,501
O.k., o.k.! You didn't catch
Up to your squadron for-

326
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,501
Well...

327
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:09,000
I suppose you've got me right
Where you want me, haven't you?

328
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,501
Well, you know, nails,

329
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,000
The guy in the air
Has always got it

330
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,000
On the man on the ground
A little.

331
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,000
I suppose it'll
Always be that way.

332
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,033
Make me a promise,
Will ya, Pete?

333
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Sure.

334
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,534
Promise me you'll be
A little more careful.

335
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,367
Sure, nails, I promise.

336
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:26,534
And look, I'm sorry
I took up your time.

337
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,033
That's all right,
Nails.

338
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
Have a nice time
This afternoon.

339
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,033
Thank you. Thank you.

340
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,534
Oh, and Pete...
No hard feelings.

341
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,501
Ha! No, no, colonel. You
Know better than that.

342
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,901
Atta boy.

343
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,534
Get me headquarters
In london.

344
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,567
I want to talk
To general sloan.

345
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:43,701
Yes, sir.

346
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,000
And, uh, ask
Miss Dorinda durston

347
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:49,033
Of the ferrying command if
She'll stop in and see me.

348
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,567
Yes, sir.

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
She's got a funny look
In her off eye, Pete.

350
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,200
Hello, Dorinda.

351
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello, honey. We've been
Waiting dinner on you.

352
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,968
I hope you two
Have been having fun.

353
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,000
Will you have
A little snort?

354
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,000
No, I don't feel like
Drinking this evening.

355
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,334
A lot of people criticize
A lot of other people

356
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,334
For doing a lot of things
A lot of other people do

357
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,834
Which aren't nearly as bad as the things
A lot of people are doing themselves.

358
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,834
You stay right where
You are, al yackey.

359
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,033
Don't think you can
Crawl out of this.

360
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,534
Why don't you wipe that
Smiling killer look on your face

361
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,501
And tell us what's
The matter?

362
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,534
All right. When are you going
To stop being a dime-store hero?

363
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,534
You got me!
This is for you.

364
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,033
Never mind that.
Answer me.

365
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,033
Well, I'd like to, but
You don't make any sense.

366
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,033
Oh? Well, let me
Tell you something.

367
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,033
I saw the pictures
Of your plane

368
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,534
Flying low enough to scrape
Paint off the rooftops.

369
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,534
Nails showed them to me.
What's more, I saw the plane-

370
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:49,501
Them pictures-

371
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,000
You keep out of this!

372
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,968
What are you yelling
At him for?

373
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,968
Shut up! You're such a low-down,
No-good heel, any woman...

374
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:59,467
Look, darling, this is
A little gift for you.

375
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm very fond
Of you, honey,

376
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,968
But take this or I'll
Wrap it around your neck!

377
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:05,968
Don't talk to me like that!
Who do you think you are?

378
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,033
If you want to risk
Your darn fool neck,

379
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,501
Go ahead.
I can get along.

380
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,167
Only don't sit there like a
Drooling farm boy with a package-

381
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,801
Drooling?
I'm not drooling.

382
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,934
You're drooling and you're trying
To buy yourself off with a present.

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can take this,
Whatever it is,

384
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:21,000
And throw it
In the garbage!

385
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,167
In the garbage? This?

386
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
In the garbage
It goes.

387
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,000
Of all the trouble-making,
Back-stabbing,

388
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,534
Poison-shooting
Dames I ever saw!

389
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,667
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

390
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,701
Yeah.
Pete! Girl clothes!

391
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,434
From london.

392
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,834
Yeah. I've never seen ya
In a real dress, remember?

393
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:54,901
Then you didn't get it just to make
Up for what happened this morning.

394
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,467
You didn't have time.

395
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,667
That's right.

396
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,968
Why didn't you tell me
Before I lost my temper?

397
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,934
You didn't
Give me a chance.

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,968
Oh, but, Pete,
You're such a fool,

399
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,000
And you've
No right to be.

400
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,501
But you're kinda sweet.

401
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,968
Go on upstairs and put that
Thing on, see if I recognize you.

402
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:14,067
If you don't, you big
Lug, you'll break my heart!

403
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,000
Lot of woman, Pete.
Lot of woman.

404
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,968
Could be.

405
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,033
2 with soda.

406
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,968
Uh-oh. Bad luck.

407
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,334
Make it 3.

408
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,501
One with poison.

409
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,501
Ha ha. I thought I'd
Find you hot pilots here.

410
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,567
We've been pining away
For you, nails.

411
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:34,501
Will you have a drink, colonel?
I mean lieutenant-colonel?

412
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes, thanks.

413
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:39,033
That was a very funny trick
You pulled on me this afternoon.

414
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,033
Let's have a drink
On that.

415
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,000
Good. What trick
Was that?

416
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,534
Showing Dorinda
Those pictures.

417
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,534
You almost got me
In a lot of trouble.

418
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,534
That wasn't a trick. I was
Simply trying to prove to her

419
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,968
What a solid
14-carat hero you are.

420
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,434
We're even now,
Huh, nails?

421
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,968
I guess so.
Incidentally, Pete,

422
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,434
I don't believe
You realize,

423
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,968
But headquarters is pretty
Impressed with your record.

424
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:02,968
They feel you're wasting your
Talents as a squadron commander.

425
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,267
They want you to be
A group commander.

426
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,734
No, nails!
That's great!

427
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,767
You'd be a lieutenant-colonel at least!

428
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,968
Maybe a full colonel. A couple of
Chickens wouldn't look bad, huh?

429
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,968
More dough, too. Course,
I'd hate to rank you, nails.

430
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,501
Ho ho ho!

431
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,000
They're shoving the active fliers
Ahead pretty fast these days.

432
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,968
I'm afraid there wouldn't be
Any advance in rank at first.

433
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,000
Not until we see
How you work out.

434
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:26,000
Purely routine,
Of course.

435
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,968
Oh, yeah, sure.
At least I won't be

436
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,968
Pestered with you
For a while,

437
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,067
So let's drink
To that.

438
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,501
Good idea. May be your
Last before you go.

439
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:34,968
Before I go where?

440
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:35,968
Scotland.

441
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,501
Scotland?
That's reconnaissance.

442
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,467
You can't do that
To me, nails.

443
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:41,000
Reconnaissance
Is important.

444
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,000
There's nothing to do there.
It's like being retired.

445
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,033
There is an element
Of rest in it.

446
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,534
You've been trying to do
This to me for a long time.

447
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,033
You won't get
Away with it.

448
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,534
I'll go over your head
To general sloan.

449
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,033
This is funny.

450
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,000
Because here's an order
Signed by general sloan

451
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,000
That says you are
Going to scotland.

452
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:59,033
Nails, you can't
Do this to Pete.

453
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,033
We've been flying
Together ever since-

454
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,534
Isn't this touching?

455
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,534
And really in the best
Tradition of the air force.

456
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,534
Just so you don't feel
You've been forgotten, al,

457
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,534
The general doesn't want any
Broken hearts in the outfit.

458
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,334
Air transport'll have
A ship waiting at 5 a.m.

459
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,501
O.k.
We'll be there.

460
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,300
That's awfully good
Of you, major.

461
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,868
Good night.

462
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,067
Oh, uh...

463
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,634
And thanks for
The drink.

464
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,067
He won't get away
With this.

465
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,067
Sometimes I wonder who he's
Fighting, us or the nazis.

466
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,067
He's just like all the rest
Of these armchair pilots.

467
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:34,567
He hasn't flown anything faster
Than a bathtub for 30 years.

468
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,567
He's afraid to walk upstairs without
A parachute strapped to his back.

469
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,567
Well, I'm going to beat
This rap.

470
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,701
I'll beat it if I
Have to go to the-

471
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,167
Say...
Look at that!

472
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,934
That's o.k.

473
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,734
You like it?

474
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,400
Dorinda,
You're as pretty as

475
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,033
A pair of
Yellow shoes.

476
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,567
Thanks, al.
And you, Pete, my boy?

477
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:22,934
Gosh.

478
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,467
Have a drink.

479
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,534
I want to dance.
Come on. Let's dance.

480
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,567
It's a lovely dress, Pete.

481
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,067
Yeah, it's pretty.

482
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,067
Makes me realize
You're a girl

483
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,067
Instead of
A sky-flying cowboy.

484
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,567
I feel like a girl,
Too.

485
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,567
I feel like
My 16th birthday

486
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,033
And the time I graduated
From high school

487
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,067
And the first time I flew
Solo all wrapped up in one.

488
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,167
Do you?

489
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:54,133
That's a pretty
Large order.

490
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,167
Yeah.
How do you feel?

491
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,534
I feel fine.

492
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,033
Did you pick out this
Dress all by yourself?

493
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,033
What? Me pick out
A dress?

494
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,033
Are you crazy?

495
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,033
Ha ha. Did they
Model it for you?

496
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,033
The girls?

497
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,000
No!

498
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,033
I wish I'd been there.

499
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,033
Why, what's so
Funny about it?

500
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,901
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

501
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,000
Pete.
Hmm.

502
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,000
How'd you know what size shoes to get?

503
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,033
Do you want to
Dance or talk?

504
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,534
I wanna bite
Your ear.

505
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,868
Let me bite your ear.

506
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:22,167
Stop that.
People are looking.

507
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:23,734
Let's just dance.
Come on.

508
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:40,801
You know that guy?

509
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,534
Pete, old man, I never
Saw him before in my life.

510
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,501
Did you smile
At him?

511
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,033
I think I did. Yes.

512
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,501
Yes, I did.

513
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,567
Why?

514
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,067
Because
I'm so happy.

515
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,501
That was a pretty
Stupid thing to do.

516
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,968
Why, Pete,
You're jealous.

517
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,501
I am not jealous.

518
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,501
Don't want you giving the
Guy the wrong impression.

519
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,968
Oh. Pete.

520
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,033
Hmm.

521
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,000
Did I ever give you
The wrong impression?

522
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,534
Why?

523
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,033
Well... Don't watch me
Blush, but...

524
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,033
I tried to
Once or twice.

525
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,501
Say, look...
Do you feel all right?

526
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,501
No, no, no. You haven't got
Spots in front of your eyes?

527
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,234
No, I feel wonderful.
I feel marvelous.

528
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,033
Mighty fancy.
Mighty fancy.

529
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,467
Brother, you ain't
Seen nothin'.

530
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,567
I'll get by

531
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:42,601
As long as I

532
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:46,300
Have you

533
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:50,667
Though there be rain

534
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:54,434
And darkness, too

535
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,601
I'll not complain

536
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:02,667
I'll laugh it through

537
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,100
Poverty

538
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:11,534
May come my way

539
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,734
That's true

540
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,801
But what care I?

541
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:24,801
Say, I'll get by

542
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:28,701
As long as I

543
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,400
Have

544
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:37,033
You

545
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,801
Sing it again.

546
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,701
I'll get by

547
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:46,701
As long as I

548
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:50,567
Have you

549
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:54,868
Though there be rain

550
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:58,133
And darkness, too

551
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,601
I'll not complain

552
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,234
I'll laugh it through

553
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,868
Poverty

554
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:14,133
May come my way

555
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,000
That's true

556
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:23,067
But what care I?

557
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:27,534
Say, I'll get by

558
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:32,067
As long as I

559
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:35,667
Have you

560
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,000
Pete...

561
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,501
Let's dance
All night through, shall we?

562
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,000
I've never done it.

563
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:03,000
I read about it once.
It sounded wonderful.

564
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:03,968
No go.

565
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,000
Why not?

566
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,033
Al and I are shoving off at 5 a.m.

567
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,467
What do you mean,
Shoving off? For where?

568
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,467
For scotland.

569
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:11,968
Scotland?

570
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,968
Yeah. Nails
Assigned us to scotland.

571
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,434
But he promised
He wouldn't!

572
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,434
He what?

573
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,434
Well, he told me
He was thinking

574
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,968
About sending you
Up there,

575
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:23,005
And I said that 10 days'
Leave would do the job better,

576
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,968
And we argued,
Then finally he said o.k.

577
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,033
He promised me!

578
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,033
You been sticking up
For me, huh?

579
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,033
I always
Stick up for you.

580
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,033
Pretty crazy
For me, aren't ya?

581
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,033
Oh, don't fool,
Pete!

582
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,033
How long are you
Gonna be gone?

583
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,234
Not as long
As nails thinks.

584
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,534
Pete.

585
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,534
Mmm.

586
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,033
You realize something?

587
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,000
What?

588
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,033
You realize
That you and I

589
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,534
Have never been up
In a plane together?

590
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,000
Alone, I mean?

591
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,467
Yeah.
I realize that.

592
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:54,934
Why don't you take me
Up with you tonight?

593
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,434
Kind of a good-bye
Flight. It'll be fun.

594
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,501
Yeah. It'd be fun,
Wouldn't it? Yeah.

595
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,501
You know,
You're a sweet girl,

596
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,501
But when I fly for fun,
I like to fly alone.

597
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:05,567
That's not fair.

598
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,501
It's just the way
I feel.

599
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,033
Oh, please, Pete,
Please.

600
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,501
The minute you got
Out of that uniform,

601
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,000
You sure became
A woman.

602
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,234
Oh, please, please!

603
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,334
You're taking awful
Advantage of a pretty dress.

604
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,300
But I've never
Flown with you, Pete.

605
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,834
Dorinda, cut it out.

606
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:21,334
You're dancing
Too close.

607
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,834
Ha ha. Give up?

608
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,000
Do we fly?

609
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,000
Do we?

610
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,968
I'll tell you what
I'll do with you.

611
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,000
You know how I feel

612
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,534
About women in the air,
Don't ya?

613
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,033
Oh.

614
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,033
Promise me you'll
Get a desk job,

615
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,033
And I'll take you
Up.

616
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,000
Ha ha.

617
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,467
Ah.

618
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,534
Wrong gal, Pete.

619
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:46,501
Wrong place.
Wrong time, too.

620
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,400
Pete.

621
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:52,501
Hmm.

622
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:56,467
Why don't you be a
Good guy and marry me?

623
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:57,968
Why don't you
Run upstairs

624
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:59,968
And skin outta
That graduation number?

625
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,934
Al and I are leaving
In a minute.

626
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,200
O.k. Give me
A kiss.

627
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,734
I wonder what kind
Of kids we'd have.

628
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:11,000
Are you crazy?

629
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,534
Cute, I'll bet.

630
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,534
Not a brain in their
Heads, of course,

631
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,400
But they'd have fun.

632
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,267
Ha!

633
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:46,033
What a fog.

634
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,033
Plane's been buzzing
Around overhead

635
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,033
For the last
Half hour.

636
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,467
Must be like trying
To find your way

637
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,467
Through the inside
Of a cow.

638
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:56,467
I never did see
Such a country!

639
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,400
Even the birds
Are walkin'.

640
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,467
Routine search
Area "a"-

641
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,934
Nil sightings.
Weather: fog.

642
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,968
Does anything ever
Happen up here?

643
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,968
Jack says he hit
A seagull

644
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,968
About 14 miles north
Of here this morning.

645
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,968
Tell him if he can
Hit a pelican,

646
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,300
I'll put him in for the
Congressional medal of honor.

647
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,267
Did I tell you what
That kid of mine hit?

648
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:17,501
No, what did he
Hit?

649
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,501
I just got a letter
From my wife.

650
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:22,501
The kid was hunting rabbits
One morning for about an hour.

651
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:26,000
Back he come running yelling for her
To come out and see what he's killed.

652
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,467
No. So she went out. Know what it was?

653
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,000
A cow.
Deader than $700.

654
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,000
How's that for a kid 8
Years old? A full-grown cow!

655
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,000
Sometimes I think
You're daffy!

656
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,501
You do, huh?

657
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,501
Well, everybody's entitled
To their own opinion, Pete.

658
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,000
You know what I think
Of you, don't ya? Ha ha.

659
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:44,000
I think you're
Gettin' kinda edgy.

660
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,033
Nothing the matter with me
That a few drinks won't cure.

661
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,000
What a way
To win a war.

662
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,534
I reckon maybe you're
Missing Dorinda little bit,

663
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:54,501
Huh?

664
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,467
Oh, you reckon,
Do you?

665
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,067
Mm-hmm. Me, too.

666
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,000
Just don't seem like we can hardly
Get along without her, does it?

667
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:04,000
I never been so lonesome for
Another guy's gal in all my days.

668
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,033
Where do you figure
She is now, Pete?

669
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,534
How do I know?

670
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:10,534
Probably listening to some tall
Talk from that jukebox commando.

671
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,467
I suppose you think
She's doing that.

672
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,033
Maybe.

673
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,000
Ha. You can talk mighty
Foolish sometimes, Pete.

674
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:18,534
Why shouldn't she?
There's no law against it.

675
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:20,567
She's not married to me
Or anybody else.

676
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:23,067
You know, Pete, back where I come from,

677
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,534
Folks call that
Love stuff

678
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,567
Quick poison
Or slow poison.

679
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:29,567
If it's quick poison, it
Hurts you all over real bad

680
00:30:29,634 --> 00:30:31,067
Like a shock
Of electricity.

681
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,567
But if it's slow poison,

682
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,067
It's like a fever
That aches in your bones

683
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,534
For a thousand years.

684
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,033
Slow poison love's what you
And Dorinda got. Ha ha ha.

685
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,067
Yep, that's what you got,
Little case of slow poison.

686
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,734
Hey, that guy must have
Found a hole in the sky.

687
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,501
Transport.

688
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,234
Hi, cowboy.

689
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,033
Hiya. Say, you guys
Really put on fog up here.

690
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,033
Yeah!

691
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,033
Guy around
Name of sandidge?

692
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,000
That's me.

693
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,033
I have a package
For you, sir.

694
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,667
Package?

695
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,300
Dorinda!

696
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,334
Ha ha!

697
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,367
Well, hamstring me
For an old steer!

698
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:19,868
How are you, honey?

699
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,033
Hello, al.
Surprised?

700
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,300
You bet I'm
Surprised.

701
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,267
You look shiny as a new propeller!

702
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,300
Shut 'em off. We'll give you a toddy.

703
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,567
No, thanks. I've got my
Clearance, and I'm an hour late.

704
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,033
Good luck.

705
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,667
Thanks a million, ray!

706
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,033
I've got the most
Wonderful news in the world.

707
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,067
Only first, give me
Another kiss, you big moose,

708
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,801
A real one.

709
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:49,801
You know, al, I think
She's really glad to see us.

710
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,734
Maybe it's a good idea
We came up here, huh?

711
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,000
She appreciates us.

712
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,167
Could be.

713
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:56,133
Pete.

714
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Hmm.

715
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,300
Is that your plane?

716
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:03,300
The b-25 over there
That looks like a ghost?

717
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,267
Sure it's my plane.
Why?

718
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:06,534
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.

719
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:08,634
What do you mean? Let's
Get out of this soup.

720
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,601
How long you gonna
Hang around here?

721
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,634
24 hours.

722
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,033
Correction, 22.

723
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,000
What's all this big news
You're bustin' with, honey?

724
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,701
Something you lugs
Are going to jump at.

725
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,667
Yeah. And I know
What it is, too.

726
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,200
Oh, you do? What?

727
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,534
Nails has finally decided
If he's gonna win this war,

728
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:26,534
He needs a little less
Reconnaissance and more fighting.

729
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,501
Now, it's much
Better than that.

730
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,534
Nails is going back
To the states,

731
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,734
And most of
The old gang with him.

732
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,701
Seems they need
Instructors back there

733
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,234
Who've had combat
Service,

734
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,234
And nails says you two can
Come along if you want to.

735
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,834
Do we have to go?

736
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:43,234
No, it's purely voluntary,
But nails wants you to.

737
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,067
Now isn't that
Sweet of him?

738
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:48,067
So he sent you to try
To talk us into it, huh?

739
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,033
If you want to
Put it that way, yes.

740
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,000
You think I'm gonna go back and
Start teaching a lot of kids to fly?

741
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,467
That's all right for a lot
Of guys, including nails,

742
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:56,968
But not for me.

743
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,934
Sit around in some officer's
Club in kansas city?

744
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,133
I'd go crazy!
Besides, I hate kids.

745
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,567
But you're liable to be
Up here for the duration!

746
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,133
No, no. They'll get in
Trouble soon then send for us.

747
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,067
You haven't got good
Sense, either of you.

748
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,801
You've got a chance to
Go home and do a real job.

749
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:13,567
But no, you'll stick around here
Till you're both knocked off.

750
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:16,067
We could crawl under the
Bed for the duration, too.

751
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:17,601
There's the jeep.

752
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,033
I'll get it and take you
Over to the inn.

753
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,734
Hey, sergeant! Sergeant!

754
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,067
What are you all steamed
Up about, Dorinda?

755
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,033
I've got to get him
Out of here, al.

756
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,000
Out of here?

757
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,033
Yeah.

758
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,033
What for?

759
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,501
Because
His number's up.

760
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,033
I could tell it the
Minute I saw that plane.

761
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,033
Aw, his number
Ain't gonna be up

762
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,033
For a good,
Long time, honey.

763
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,033
He'll probably slip in a
Bathtub and break his neck

764
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,000
When he's 80 or so. He's
A lucky guy. You know that.

765
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,501
I tell you, I felt it.

766
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,968
You remember just before
Joe bailey went down.

767
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,467
You could tell it the
Minute you looked at him.

768
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,968
You told me so
Yourself.

769
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,934
That's right.

770
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,434
And he washed out.

771
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:01,667
Well, that's just the way
I feel about Pete right now.

772
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,000
Well, there don't
Appear to be much

773
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,968
I can do about that,
Honey.

774
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,467
Oh, yes,
There is, al.

775
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:10,501
If I can persuade him
To go back to the states,

776
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:11,501
Will you go along?

777
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,534
If you feel that way
About it, sure.

778
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,501
Then be ready to go
In the morning.

779
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,567
How are you gonna
Go about convincing him?

780
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:19,100
You hungry?
I'm going to-

781
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,334
As a wolf!

782
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,033
As a wolf? Well, then
Come on. See you later, al.

783
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,300
Yeah.

784
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:49,567
Fell asleep.

785
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,033
Mm-hmm.

786
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,501
What did you do?

787
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,501
I listened
To you snore

788
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,501
And looked at
Your legs.

789
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:57,834
Oh.

790
00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't snore,

791
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,000
And you're
A lecherous old man.

792
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,501
That's your fault.

793
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,534
Pete, you're pulling
Your eyebrows again.

794
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,000
She loves me...
She loves me not.

795
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, stop it.
Stop it, stop it.

796
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,968
I'm resigned to your
Being bald some day,

797
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,968
But a bald man
Without eyebrows

798
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:15,501
Looks just like an egg.

799
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:18,501
Don't mention eggs. Haven't
Seen an egg for 6 weeks.

800
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,501
What's wrong with
Eggs, anyway?

801
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,033
They have no character.

802
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,501
Do you know something?

803
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,501
I have no character, either.
Does that surprise you?

804
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,033
No. Uh-uh.

805
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,033
But... I'll bet
I can surprise you.

806
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,267
How?

807
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,267
I'm applying for
A transfer tomorrow.

808
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,300
Where to?

809
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,300
Australia.

810
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,000
Australia?
You're crazy.

811
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,534
No, it's true, Pete.

812
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,367
Aw, don't be silly. Get
That out of your head.

813
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,334
Well, it's my
Business, isn't it?

814
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,901
Whose is it?
No.

815
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:50,234
It's my business, and
I won't let ya do it.

816
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,200
Well, wait a minute,
My buckaroo.

817
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,234
How do you plan
To stop me?

818
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,734
Just by saying no.

819
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,667
That sounds like
An order, Pete,

820
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:59,567
And I don't like
Orders very well.

821
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,501
All right,
Then I'll ask ya.

822
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,501
Dorinda, don't be
A pig-headed fool.

823
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,501
Oh, sweet, sweet,
Irresistible Pete.

824
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,000
Gentle, tactful,
Clever.

825
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:09,501
Wait a minute. Don't
Laugh at me. I'm serious.

826
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,000
So am I serious. Now you
Listen to me for a change.

827
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,968
I'm willing to offer
You a fair deal.

828
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,534
You've always wanted to get
Me out of the air, haven't you?

829
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:19,000
Here's your chance. You go back
With nails tomorrow morning,

830
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,067
Back to the states where
They need you and want you,

831
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,067
And I'll take
Ground service.

832
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:24,834
Otherwise,
I'm off to australia,

833
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,534
And it's that
Or nothing, Pete.

834
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,534
It is?

835
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,033
Mm-hmm.

836
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,567
Well, I'm afraid then
It's nothing.

837
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:34,067
Oh. Quick as that.

838
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,634
All right. Let's talk
About something else.

839
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:39,534
Yeah. You know you got
Feet like a monkey's.

840
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:42,033
I bet you could
Pick up a dime-

841
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,133
Oh, Pete, please,
Please go back! For me!

842
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,634
Why should I?

843
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,534
Because your number's
Up, and because I like you

844
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,033
In spite of the fact
You're such a lug!

845
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,067
You know, Dorinda, the madder
You get, the prettier you are.

846
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,467
You've been a flyer
Long enough to know

847
00:36:56,534 --> 00:36:58,434
That when a guy's
Number is up, it's up.

848
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:01,534
Wouldn't I look swell cracking
Up in a plane outside of dubuque?

849
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:02,834
What about me?

850
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,968
I remember a poem
I learned once.

851
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,501
I had to learn it,
As a matter of fact.

852
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:11,000
Uh... "men must work
And women must weep."

853
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,234
I remember that
Women must weep part.

854
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,501
Ah! So that's the way
You figure it.

855
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,000
Women must weep.
What claptrap!

856
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,501
When you crack up, I'm
Supposed to sit around wet-eyed

857
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,000
Like an old man
With asthma

858
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,000
And mumble prayers
The rest of my life.

859
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,000
What a surprise
You're going to get.

860
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:27,000
You might at least
Crack out with a bottle.

861
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,467
Do you know
What I'll do?

862
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:30,000
Sure, cry like
Every dame.

863
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,033
I'll not cry. I'll find
Myself a man with good sense.

864
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,033
You'll never find
As good a flyer.

865
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,334
Oh, I won't, hey?

866
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't kid your
- what makes you think you're a flier?

867
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,000
You belong back in
1925 in a flying circus.

868
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,534
I can just see you now
Out at the fairgrounds

869
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,033
Doing loop-de-loops.

870
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,300
You never stayed with
Your squadron.

871
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,801
You're a lone wolf in a
Service where men fly together.

872
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,300
You've got hero hunger,

873
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:54,200
And better men than you
Come a dime a dozen!

874
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,567
You'll never have as
Much fun with anybody.

875
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:59,467
Fun! What's fun about
Knowing you're asking for it

876
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:00,934
Every time you take off?

877
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,467
You think I like being sick
Inside all the time?

878
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:05,634
Waiting?

879
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,601
Being afraid when
A telephone rings?

880
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,234
Being afraid
When it doesn't?

881
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,968
Aw, now, don't talk
Nonsense, Dorinda.

882
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:16,834
You're not going to settle
Down with anybody else,

883
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,467
And you know it.

884
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:22,601
What makes you think I'm
Not, you-you conceited ape!

885
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:30,100
Because I'm going back to the
States with you, with you and nails.

886
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh, Pete.

887
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah. You're gonna
Stay on the ground,

888
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,467
And I'm gonna teach some of those
Supermen how to fly an airplane.

889
00:38:36,534 --> 00:38:38,968
Pete... You mean
I win for once?

890
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,534
You mean it?

891
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,534
In a deal like this, you
Only have to win once.

892
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:46,033
And I guess
This is your round.

893
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,200
Oh, Pete.

894
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:50,133
Of course, you might
Figure that I'd won, too.

895
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,968
Fun's over, kids.
Just got a report

896
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:57,434
There's a big convoy from the
States about 300 miles off the coast,

897
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,434
And they think the nazis'll
Sneak a carrier out.

898
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,467
A carrier?!

899
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:01,968
Yep. That's what
They think.

900
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:03,968
We'll just have to go
Out and sink that carrier.

901
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,934
Can't you send
Somebody else out?

902
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,467
No, they're all
On detail.

903
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:09,968
Besides, I never saw a
German carrier, did you?

904
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,934
Come on, Pete,
We gotta go.

905
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,501
I'll be right with ya.

906
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:14,834
See you later,
Honey.

907
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:19,467
You still my girl?

908
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,467
Most of me.

909
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:23,033
Drink to it.

910
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:31,000
We got a lot of things
Settled tonight, didn't we?

911
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, Pete. We never seem
To get a break, do we?

912
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,000
What are you talkin' about?
Meeting you was a break.

913
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,467
Why?
No, don't kiss me.

914
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,467
I just don't
Want to kiss you.

915
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:41,968
What's the idea?

916
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,968
I'm afraid if I say good-bye,
It might mean good-bye.

917
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,100
A kiss can't say it.
Words can't either.

918
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,067
What are you
Talkin' about?

919
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:51,033
I'm not gonna say good-bye
To you for a thousand years.

920
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,033
But if there were
Anything like good-bye,

921
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,501
There's be a kiss
To say it.

922
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,033
You sleep here
All night.

923
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,534
I'll wake you up with
A hot cup of coffee

924
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,801
When I come back.

925
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:13,501
Pete!

926
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:17,501
You don't belong back in
1925 in a flying circus.

927
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:20,634
You're the best cockeyed
Pilot that ever lived

928
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,067
Or ever will!

929
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:23,300
Sure.

930
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:44,701
There she is.

931
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,067
Look at that flock of
Destroyers with her.

932
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:50,067
We got enough bombs here to
Give those guys some trouble.

933
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,567
Yeah, it'd be fun,
Wouldn't it?

934
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:54,534
No. This is a job for
Headquarters to figure out.

935
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,534
What are you trying
To do, be a hero?

936
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,033
He's waitin'
For a turn!

937
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,033
Well, how do you
Like that?

938
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,767
2 weeks ago, he'd have
Gone after the whole fleet.

939
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,000
He must be gettin'
Some brains.

940
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,434
Hey!

941
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,501
No use keepin'
That radio dead.

942
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,033
Radio the carrier's
Position.

943
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,934
We may have to
Bail out.

944
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:19,133
We're bailing out, boys.

945
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,334
Give cap the position.

946
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,033
02295.

947
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,834
5 positions.
We're bailing out.

948
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:26,534
Navigator,
Mark this position.

949
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,200
Radio, notify base.

950
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,133
Hurry up.

951
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,567
When are you
Comin'?

952
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:42,567
Right away.
Go on. Get out.

953
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:43,801
Get out!

954
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:37,567
Well, Dorinda-

955
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:39,067
Don't tell me, al.

956
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,267
Don't tell me.
I know.

957
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:46,067
Maybe I better fix us
Up a cup of coffee, huh?

958
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,400
No!

959
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:55,000
They picked up the other guys all right.

960
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,601
That's good.
I'm glad of that.

961
00:44:01,634 --> 00:44:04,501
I dunno why these things
Have to happen, Dorinda,

962
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,934
But just seems like
Maybe there was something

963
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,033
Pushing him
On and on and on.

964
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,000
I know.
His number was up.

965
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,534
I knew it all along.

966
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:15,234
Yep.

967
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,534
I told him
When he cracked up,

968
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,501
I wasn't going to cry.

969
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:22,000
Not one tear.

970
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:23,968
And I haven't.

971
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,534
Well, I dunno, honey,

972
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:30,534
It just don't seem right
Hardly to cry about Pete.

973
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,534
He was a flier, and the way I figure it,

974
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,634
Fliers may crack up
Once in a while, sure,

975
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:39,033
But they never
Really die.

976
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,033
That's not true, al.

977
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,501
That's not true.

978
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:46,400
Because... I just have.

979
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:47,868
Hey!

980
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,000
Hey! Dick brumley!

981
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:57,000
Hiya, Pete!

982
00:45:57,067 --> 00:45:58,501
Well, it's Pete
Himself!

983
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,601
Yeah!

984
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,501
Hey, you had yourself
Quite a little show

985
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:02,934
With that carrier,
Didn't you?

986
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Ah, sure, sure.
You know me.

987
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:07,000
Come right out of a
Cloud, and there she was.

988
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,701
4 destroyers right around
Her. Doing about 22 knots.

989
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,534
We didn't want to radio our
Position, so we headed for home.

990
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,000
Boy, then it happened!

991
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,000
Her fighter escort
Swarmed all over us.

992
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:19,334
Al was about
6 miles away-

993
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:24,501
So, uh, he wasn't
Very much help, and...

994
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,467
Say, there's something
Cockeyed here.

995
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,534
What?

996
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,033
You don't belong
Here.

997
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,534
Well, I certainly don't
Belong anywhere else.

998
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,000
You're dick brumley,
Aren't ya?

999
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:34,100
Yes.

1000
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,968
I saw you shot down.
Your plane was on fire.

1001
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:38,033
Nobody coulda
Got out of it.

1002
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,000
That's right.

1003
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:41,000
But you got
Out of it.

1004
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,534
No, I rode her
Down, Pete.

1005
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:44,501
Wait a minute.
Take it easy.

1006
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,534
Either I'm dead
Or I'm crazy.

1007
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:49,534
Ha ha. Well, you're not crazy, Pete.

1008
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,100
You mean, I'm dead?

1009
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,868
Yeah!

1010
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,367
I'm...

1011
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,734
You mean...

1012
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,501
You mean
This is for good?

1013
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,000
You guessed it.

1014
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:05,467
You mean I went out and
Let them knock me over?

1015
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,734
That's about it.

1016
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:10,000
And now I'm...

1017
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:12,667
You-you mean I'm dead?

1018
00:47:12,734 --> 00:47:13,934
Yep.

1019
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,968
You mean... Dead.

1020
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,667
How do ya like that?

1021
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:18,968
I don't mind it
At all.

1022
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:20,300
I don't feel
Any different.

1023
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,734
It's pretty much the same
Once you get the hang of it.

1024
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:24,367
Hmm. This is great.

1025
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:26,033
I never played
A harp in my life.

1026
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,501
There's not much time
For harp playing up here.

1027
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,501
There's plenty of work to
Do and good men to do it.

1028
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,000
Come on,
Let's get moving.

1029
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:34,033
I want you
To meet the boss.

1030
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,033
You got a commanding
Officer up here?

1031
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,534
Yeah,
And a good one.

1032
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,534
Well, let's make it
Short and sweet.

1033
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:41,267
Hey.

1034
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:42,534
What's wrong?

1035
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:44,534
That Dorinda girl.

1036
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,701
She sure called
The turn on this one.

1037
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh, well,
That happens, too.

1038
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:50,100
How is Dorinda?

1039
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,834
Oh, she's fine.

1040
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:52,968
Poor kid.

1041
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:54,000
Why?

1042
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:56,467
This is certainly
Gonna be tough on her.

1043
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:58,434
For a while, but she'll get over it.

1044
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,968
What do you mean,
She'll get over it?

1045
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,467
The girl is crazy about me.

1046
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:03,467
She was, but good-looking
Girl like Dorinda

1047
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:05,434
Doesn't have any trouble
Making new friends.

1048
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:07,968
I don't mind if she has
A couple of friends.

1049
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,968
That's very
Generous of you.

1050
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,834
I think she should have
A good time.

1051
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:14,400
You know, nothing serious,
But I think she oughta

1052
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:16,467
Have some fun
Once in a while.

1053
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:18,267
She will.

1054
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,434
Is he our
Commanding officer?

1055
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:32,868
Sure.

1056
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:34,868
One of the greatest
Flyers that ever lived.

1057
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:37,634
Sure. We got 'em
All up here.

1058
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:40,434
These guys know
I'm up here?

1059
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,033
They will.

1060
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,000
What a flyer he was.

1061
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:47,000
Too bad he never
Had a chance

1062
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:50,000
To fly any of
The modern stuff.

1063
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:53,334
I'd like to give him a ride
In some of the real hot stuff.

1064
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,167
You may
Go in now, sir.

1065
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:03,868
Sir, this is
Major peter sandidge

1066
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,467
Of the united states
Army air force.

1067
00:49:05,534 --> 00:49:07,267
At ease.

1068
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,467
Glad to know
You, sandidge.

1069
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:10,968
Thank you, sir.

1070
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:13,067
We've been expecting
You here for some time.

1071
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,701
Thank you, sir.

1072
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:17,868
Is that so, sir?

1073
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:21,467
Yeah. I've been
Studying your record.

1074
00:49:21,534 --> 00:49:23,234
Oh, it isn't much.

1075
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,601
Well, I agree with you
About that.

1076
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:29,100
You can fly fairly well
If you obey orders.

1077
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,467
"fairly well"?

1078
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,534
I do things
With a plane

1079
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,567
The designer
Didn't even think of.

1080
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:35,934
That's just
The point, sandidge.

1081
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,300
We work here
On the general lines

1082
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:40,200
Of trying to do things
With the plane

1083
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:41,534
The designer
Did think of.

1084
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:43,834
Well, I can
Do that, too, sir.

1085
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:44,968
I hope so.

1086
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:46,734
You know our work
Here, of course.

1087
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:48,033
No, sir.
I don't think so.

1088
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,534
It's pretty simple.

1089
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:51,000
We operate
On the principle

1090
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:53,334
Of helping
The other fella.

1091
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,734
If a flyer down below
Needs a little assistance,

1092
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,767
We assign a man
To ride with him.

1093
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,534
Oh, I see. Sure.

1094
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:01,701
Well, it's not much
Like the old days.

1095
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,767
I'll never forget
The day I soloed.

1096
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,534
30-mile
Cross wind blowing.

1097
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:07,534
Motor wouldn't turn up.
I was just taking her off-

1098
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:09,000
You're not under
The impression

1099
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:12,501
That you learned to fly
All by yourself, are you?

1100
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:13,534
Well, if I didn't, sir,

1101
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:14,834
I'd like to know
Who helped me.

1102
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:17,167
Well, I guess
I can tell you that.

1103
00:50:17,234 --> 00:50:20,701
You were helped by every man
Since the beginning of time

1104
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,067
Who dreamt
Of wearing wings,

1105
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:26,067
By pioneers who flew pieces of wire

1106
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:29,234
And paste board long
Before you were born,

1107
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,767
By every pilot that ever
Crashed into the ground

1108
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,767
In order that others
Could stay up in the sky.

1109
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:37,067
I see, sir.

1110
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,067
Now it's your turn to pass
That along to the next man.

1111
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,033
Yes, sir.

1112
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,534
That'll be all for now.

1113
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:46,000
Brumley will break you in
And stay with you for a while.

1114
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:48,300
I think you'll like it
After you get the hang of it.

1115
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:49,868
Yes, sir.

1116
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:52,834
Well, good luck boys,
And do a good job.

1117
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:54,534
Thank you, sir.

1118
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,501
Don't they ever salute in these parts?

1119
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:34,567
Not if they don't
See you, they don't.

1120
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,067
Can't hear us
Either, huh?

1121
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:37,033
No.

1122
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,033
I got a hunch
You and I

1123
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,534
Are going to get awful
Sick of our conversations.

1124
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:43,300
Not if we keep busy.

1125
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,067
Kind of makes you
Feel like nothing.

1126
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:51,100
It's going to take a little
Time to get used to this.

1127
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,467
Hey, buddy.

1128
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:53,968
You realize there are
A lot of things

1129
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:56,467
Going on around you that you
Don't know anything about?

1130
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:59,000
You're a pretty silly-looking
Guy, you know that?

1131
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:02,167
And don't answer me
Back, neither one of ya.

1132
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:08,801
This thing has
Its points, at that.

1133
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:11,901
I just hope I run across
Nails kilpatrick once

1134
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:13,234
Before I die.

1135
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,501
Well, I hope
I run across him.

1136
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,033
What's the layout here?

1137
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,534
Well, these boys
Have had

1138
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:19,901
Their 9-weeks'
Ground work,

1139
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:21,033
Their 9-weeks'
Primary training.

1140
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,534
They're starting
Basic training now

1141
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:25,000
So you can figure out they're
A pretty nervous bunch of kids.

1142
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:27,033
We get the problem children
Of the outfit, huh?

1143
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,968
Something like that.

1144
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,167
How do we know
Which one of these

1145
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:31,167
New-fangled flyers
We're gonna work on?

1146
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:33,467
You'll see.

1147
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:34,534
You
Wanted me, sir?

1148
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,200
You realize you cleared
That water tower

1149
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:37,634
By less than 6 feet?

1150
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,534
I was trying to see
How accurately

1151
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:40,567
I could judge
My distance.

1152
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:42,067
Well, isn't that fine.

1153
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:43,567
Well, when I want
A fool maneuver like that

1154
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:45,400
I'll ask for it,
Understand?

1155
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,000
Very well, sir. I was just remembering

1156
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,601
That major sandidge
Sank a german flattop

1157
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,434
With a maneuver
Like that.

1158
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,534
Now, there's a great little
Kid and a great little flyer.

1159
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:54,000
That will quite
Possibly go down

1160
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:56,901
As the luckiest incident in
The history of world war ii.

1161
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:58,000
Lucky?
Listen to that guy.

1162
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,100
He reminds me of nails.

1163
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:00,968
But he did sink
The carrier, colonel,

1164
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:02,534
And they gave him
A d.s.c.

1165
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,033
You hear that?
I got a d.s.c.

1166
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,834
Unfortunately, it came
Too late for him to wear.

1167
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:08,567
We're not training
You men to die.

1168
00:53:08,634 --> 00:53:10,467
We're training you
To live.

1169
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:12,267
The first budding hero
I catch among you

1170
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:13,601
Will be washed out.

1171
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,100
I don't like
That guy's attitude.

1172
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,167
Randall?

1173
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,434
Yes, sir?

1174
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:20,033
You and rourke seem to be
Having a little trouble.

1175
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,501
Take your ships up, and maybe I
Can find out what's the matter.

1176
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,367
Yes, sir.

1177
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,567
That's all, boys.

1178
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,567
Come on. Let's take a
Look at those 2 flyers.

1179
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:30,934
I don't think I'm gonna
Be very happy here.

1180
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,334
Strange feeling
That's my man.

1181
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,934
Boy, you got trouble.

1182
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,200
That's what
I'm here for.

1183
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:03,467
What's he waiting for?

1184
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:06,033
Give her the gun.
More, you dope.

1185
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,501
Oh, no, no.

1186
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,367
How can a guy do that
To an airplane?

1187
00:54:15,534 --> 00:54:17,033
Why don't he get it
Off the ground?

1188
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,000
What's he afraid of?

1189
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:19,534
That's your problem,
Not mine.

1190
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:21,501
What do you mean
By that crack?

1191
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,534
You picked him up.
He's your baby.

1192
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:25,534
If I ever learn
To keep my mouth shut...

1193
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:27,534
Have you forgotten
When you were having

1194
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:29,534
Your first trouble
With a plane?

1195
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:30,534
Say, listen-

1196
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,501
The point is,
From here on out

1197
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,534
The only way
You can fly a plane

1198
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:36,534
Is through that man
Or somebody else like him.

1199
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,567
From the take-off
I just saw,

1200
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:40,534
There is nobody else
Like him. Look at him now.

1201
00:54:40,601 --> 00:54:42,534
What kind of a guy
Is he? Is he an idiot?

1202
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:44,534
Aw, he's a nice guy.
So's mine.

1203
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:46,534
Yours got his m.a. From boston
Tech in combustion engines,

1204
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:48,534
And mine's an all-american
Guard from usc.

1205
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,534
You mean to tell me a guy
Can learn all about engines

1206
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:52,534
And do what he's doing
To one of 'em right now?

1207
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:54,968
He knows what makes 'em tick.
He can't make 'em fly.

1208
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:58,067
He's nervous. Might be the
Result of inheriting $4 million.

1209
00:54:58,133 --> 00:55:00,167
$4 million?

1210
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:03,934
You know what I'd do with
All that dough if I was him?

1211
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,067
I'd spend it all
On life insurance.

1212
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:07,667
Oh, I can't
Watch this. Come on.

1213
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,300
So, this is where
They sleep, huh?

1214
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:14,534
Where do we sleep?

1215
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:15,934
On the floor.

1216
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's cozy.

1217
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,200
One thing about our
Branch of the service,

1218
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:21,367
We'll never go soft from
Good living, will we?

1219
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:25,667
Well, here's your man.
Get a load of that.

1220
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:26,834
Look at him-
All spread out

1221
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:29,000
On that nice soft bed.

1222
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,934
How can you sleep like that

1223
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,234
After what you did today?

1224
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,133
There's money bags.

1225
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,567
He's not asleep yet.

1226
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:42,234
Why don't you close
Those big blue eyes?

1227
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,667
What's the matter
With ya?

1228
00:55:43,734 --> 00:55:46,100
Are you a worrier?

1229
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:49,200
How do you like
This guy?

1230
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:51,501
4 million bucks,
And he's got insomnia.

1231
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:54,501
What'll I do, let him
Roll and toss like this,

1232
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,100
Or shall I rock
Him to sleep?

1233
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:58,334
Leave him alone.
He's the thoughtful type.

1234
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,868
What are you
Thinking about?

1235
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,467
It can't be
Financial worries.

1236
00:56:01,534 --> 00:56:03,434
What's the matter
With you?

1237
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:04,968
Why don't you
Go to sleep?

1238
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:07,334
Look at that guy.
Look at that kisser.

1239
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,467
4 million bucks.

1240
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,467
Come to think of it,

1241
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:15,033
I never did see a guy that
Inherited a lot of dough

1242
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,300
That was any good.

1243
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:18,968
Good night, sweetheart.
Sweet dreams to you.

1244
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:21,000
I might as well
Tip you off to this-

1245
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,868
I don't think
I'm gonna like ya.

1246
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:26,033
Like him or not, you start
Flying with him tomorrow morning.

1247
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,234
Come on.

1248
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:35,734
You scared?

1249
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,334
If he's not, I am.

1250
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,501
Scared? What do you
Think I'm humming for?

1251
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,067
This colonel sykes
Is one tough baby.

1252
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:41,968
Good luck.

1253
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:43,534
Looks like
Today or never.

1254
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,734
You're first.
So long!

1255
00:56:49,234 --> 00:56:53,434
Well, here we go,
Against my better judgment.

1256
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,434
You can't see me
Or hear me,

1257
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:57,634
But they tell me
I can get through to ya.

1258
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,033
Personally, I doubt it.

1259
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,501
No, no, no.
Don't hug the ground.

1260
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,601
Give her the gun.

1261
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,467
Relax, you got nothing
To worry about.

1262
00:57:06,534 --> 00:57:07,667
Remember,
With all that cash

1263
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:09,400
You got a lot to live for.

1264
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,501
Just sit back and let
The ship fly herself.

1265
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,467
Remember, this airplane
Knows more about flying

1266
00:57:18,534 --> 00:57:20,000
Than you'll ever know.

1267
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,601
I said relax.

1268
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:24,033
I'm too stiff.

1269
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,734
I gotta take it easy.

1270
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,534
Now, listen, buddy.

1271
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:31,000
There's a few corny ideas

1272
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,501
You gotta get out
Of your head

1273
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:34,033
If you're gonna fly
An airplane.

1274
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,000
Most things
Are just the reverse

1275
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:37,534
Of what people think.

1276
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:39,000
The higher you are,
The safer you are.

1277
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:40,534
The earth down there,
That's your enemy.

1278
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:42,634
Once you hit that boy,
You splatter.

1279
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:46,033
Now, take it easy. Relax.

1280
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,067
Enjoy it.
Get a kick out of it.

1281
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,467
There.
That's pretty good.

1282
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,801
That's better.

1283
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:56,467
Take a look around.

1284
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:59,100
Kinda pretty up here,
Isn't it?

1285
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,133
Pretty nice.

1286
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,734
Take your turn
In traffic, randall.

1287
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,701
Hold your proper altitude.

1288
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:14,701
All right, come
On. Let's ease her down.

1289
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:21,267
Don't stiffen.
Don't stiffen.

1290
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:28,200
Down we go.

1291
00:58:28,267 --> 00:58:30,501
Down...

1292
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:33,501
Down, down, down.

1293
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:36,167
Take it easy, now.

1294
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:39,300
Remember, you're
A soap bubble.

1295
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:41,501
You're a feather.

1296
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:43,601
Easy...

1297
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:49,501
Easy, easy, easy...

1298
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,934
That was fine.

1299
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,601
And how you ever got by
Primary training

1300
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,968
I'll never know!

1301
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,167
They must be
Hard up for pilots.

1302
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:08,834
Just think-
All that dough

1303
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:10,367
And you're gonna be
A flyer to boot.

1304
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:12,734
But don't ever forget that
I'm the guy that did it.

1305
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:14,400
That was swell work, ted.
Really great.

1306
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,901
Boy, I almost
Grounded.

1307
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:17,367
Every time
I hit the dirt,

1308
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:18,367
I think the show's over.

1309
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, that's usually
My trouble.

1310
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:21,968
But today I seem to get
The hang of it.

1311
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:23,901
Hey, it looks like you
Got a flyer on your hands.

1312
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:25,200
Yeah. Not bad, huh?

1313
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:26,367
Yeah, you're pretty
Proud of yourself.

1314
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:27,400
It's kind of fun

1315
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:29,400
Punching some brains
In that guy's head.

1316
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:30,400
When does your guy go up?

1317
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:31,534
Right away.
He does?

1318
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,501
Say, did you tell me
He was a football player?

1319
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:34,501
Yeah, that's right.

1320
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:35,901
Oh, I could do a lot
With him.

1321
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:36,901
Well, take him.
You don't mind?

1322
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:38,467
No. That's what
We're here for.

1323
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:39,501
See what you can do
With him.

1324
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:40,434
Thanks.

1325
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:42,734
My mama done told me

1326
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:43,834
When I was
In knee pants...

1327
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:44,701
Cut that out.

1328
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,234
My mama done told me

1329
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,300
When I was
In knee pants

1330
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,901
Son

1331
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:52,934
That's better.

1332
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,367
In the first place, your
Mammy didn't told you enough.

1333
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:56,901
In the second place,

1334
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,100
From now on,
I'm telling you.

1335
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,801
Now listen, you big ape.

1336
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:04,367
Give her the gun,
And execute a forward pass

1337
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,868
Over that first line
Of trees.

1338
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:10,067
Come on, now.
Let's see you do it.

1339
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,100
Oh, you don't want it
That way, huh?

1340
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,400
Change signals then.
Make it a punt,

1341
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,634
Make it a drop kick.
Make it anything,

1342
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,000
But get this baby
Into the air!

1343
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:26,868
Get it over the trees!
Get it into the air!

1344
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:31,901
Phew! You must have
Been a sensation

1345
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:34,501
On the football field.

1346
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:36,834
Make your turn
In traffic, rourke.

1347
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:44,634
That's better, rourke.

1348
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:45,934
There, you hear that?

1349
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,234
The coach likes you.
He thinks you're good.

1350
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,367
Now, here's the way
To figure this thing.

1351
01:00:51,434 --> 01:00:52,868
When you were playing guard,

1352
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:54,400
The quarterback was doing
All the thinking,

1353
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:56,567
And he was getting
All the credit.

1354
01:00:56,634 --> 01:00:57,868
Now all that's changed.

1355
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,934
On our team,
You're the quarterback.

1356
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,868
You do the thinking.
You're the whole show.

1357
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:05,334
Just think
Of those headlines, boy.

1358
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,334
Think of those headlines.

1359
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:10,033
All right, rourke.

1360
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,033
Into the traffic pattern
For a landing.

1361
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,234
Keep an eye open
For other planes.

1362
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,367
Our side's gonna attempt
A drop kick,

1363
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:18,367
And remember,
You're holding the ball.

1364
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:23,868
And you're holding it with
Your fingertips. You get that?

1365
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:25,534
Now, take it easy. Easy!

1366
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,501
Don't fumble now,
You big ox.

1367
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:32,367
Remember, there's 60,000 fans
In those stands watching.

1368
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:34,334
Easy now!

1369
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,801
Set her down like that.

1370
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:40,501
Easy on the controls-
With your fingertips.

1371
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,133
Your fingertips!

1372
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:48,901
Right between the goal posts!

1373
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:51,267
What a pouf!

1374
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,467
Yeah, what a pouf.

1375
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:54,868
Good comeback.

1376
01:01:54,934 --> 01:01:56,901
Yeah, I've seen it
Happen before.

1377
01:01:56,968 --> 01:01:59,901
A man who seemed hopeless
Suddenly gets the hang of things.

1378
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:01,901
He may not be as good
As this tomorrow,

1379
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,868
But he'll never again be
As bad as that first run.

1380
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:06,667
He's-he's feeling it.

1381
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:09,467
I'm a ding-dog daddy
From dumas

1382
01:02:09,534 --> 01:02:10,868
And you wanna see me
Do my stuff

1383
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:12,334
That was great,
Powerhouse.

1384
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,701
There's nothing to it.

1385
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,334
You know what I figured out? What?

1386
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,367
I'm a lot better
When I'm up there alone

1387
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,667
Than when I've got one of these
Instructors riding with me.

1388
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:21,734
How do you like
That guy?

1389
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:23,968
You know what I found out?
This is a cinch.

1390
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:25,501
It's just like football.

1391
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:26,834
Football?!

1392
01:02:26,901 --> 01:02:28,434
Yeah. Reminded me of the day
We beat pittsburgh.

1393
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,601
We pulled a fake reverse.
I cut over center,

1394
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,033
And I opened up this hole
As wide as the second front,

1395
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,968
But the dumb quarterback
Dropped the ball.

1396
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:36,901
So as quick as a flash,
I picked it up,

1397
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:38,467
And the rest is history.

1398
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:39,968
72 yards for a touchdown.

1399
01:02:40,033 --> 01:02:41,200
I heard it
Over the radio.

1400
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:42,868
Everybody heard it
Over the radio!

1401
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:45,267
Now look at that. All this
Life going on around him,

1402
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,968
And he sits there
Reading a book.

1403
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:06,334
I have 2 tickets to the
Majestic theater tonight.

1404
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,133
Would you like them?

1405
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,634
No.

1406
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:14,734
Hey. You know, you've
Got the rest of your life

1407
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,067
To read that book.

1408
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,033
Why don't you
Step out there

1409
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,834
And ask one of those dolls to dance?

1410
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,667
Or does a guy with your kind of dough

1411
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,567
Only dance
With society dames?

1412
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:30,400
Look at that girl
Over there.

1413
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:33,133
Look at her, you dope.
She's a honey.

1414
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,834
She's a dish.

1415
01:03:34,901 --> 01:03:38,367
Maybe you'd like
To dance, huh?

1416
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:40,400
No.

1417
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:42,367
That girl is lonesome.

1418
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:45,400
Why don't you go over there
And tackle her?

1419
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:47,968
Tell you're lonesome.
Tell her you want to dance.

1420
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,367
Tell her she reminds you
Of your sister.

1421
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:51,634
Tell her anything.

1422
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:53,901
Why don't you try spending
A couple of bucks?

1423
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:57,234
You can't tell,
You might like it.

1424
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:03,834
Wouldn't you like
A sandwich

1425
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,267
Or a candy bar
Or something?

1426
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:07,434
No. I...

1427
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:09,667
Uh... Good evening.

1428
01:04:09,734 --> 01:04:10,667
Hello.

1429
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:14,367
I, uh... I came over
Because, uh...

1430
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,100
Because she reminds you
Of your sister.

1431
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:20,367
Well, you remind me a
Great deal of my sister.

1432
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:21,367
Oh, how nice.

1433
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:23,200
Would you like
To dance?

1434
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:25,667
Oh, thank you very much.

1435
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,868
My name is ellen bright.
What's yours?

1436
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:30,868
Randall, ted randall, and
I'm delighted to know you.

1437
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:33,868
That's more than I can say
For that boy at the counter.

1438
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:35,667
What's the matter
With him?

1439
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:36,968
Homesickness.
Just comes in

1440
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:39,000
And stares like that
Every night.

1441
01:04:39,067 --> 01:04:41,334
I guess homesickness
Can be pretty bad.

1442
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,601
Yeah, I imagine it can.

1443
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,100
I remember my first year at college.

1444
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:46,100
I used to get
So lonesome

1445
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:47,434
For somebody
From home,

1446
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:48,801
I could almost cry.

1447
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:50,334
Guess that's the way
He feels right now.

1448
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,400
You know who he is
Or where he comes from?

1449
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh, you can't help knowing.

1450
01:04:55,067 --> 01:04:56,901
He talks about it
All the time.

1451
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:58,267
His name is sanderson.

1452
01:04:58,334 --> 01:05:02,400
He comes from a little town
Called twin hooks, rhode island.

1453
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:04,801
And from what he says,
Twin hooks, rhode island

1454
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:07,701
Is just about 5 times
As beautiful as paradise.

1455
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:16,334
Would you mind waiting
For me for a minute?

1456
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,534
No, of course not.

1457
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:19,133
I'll be right back.

1458
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:24,226
Well, I got him off
To a good start.

1459
01:05:24,227 --> 01:05:25,033
Oh, you did, huh?

1460
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,367
And after we'd won
The game,

1461
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:27,567
We'd all sit around
The dressing room

1462
01:05:27,634 --> 01:05:28,767
Where we'd sing
The old fight song.

1463
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:30,334
You'll love this.
It went like this.

1464
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,234
Fight on for old u.s.c.

1465
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,868
Come and fight on
To victory

1466
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:39,968
Telephone call
For sanderson.

1467
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:42,868
Sanderson?

1468
01:05:42,934 --> 01:05:44,400
For who?

1469
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:45,834
Telephone call
For sanderson.

1470
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,234
Is that you?

1471
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,067
Must be some other sanderson.

1472
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:51,400
Come on.

1473
01:05:51,467 --> 01:05:54,100
Nobody'd be calling me.

1474
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:01,901
Hello?

1475
01:06:01,968 --> 01:06:04,400
Who?

1476
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,334
I don't under...

1477
01:06:08,634 --> 01:06:10,133
Mom!

1478
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,634
It's my mom!

1479
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:21,100
Oh, that was swell of you.

1480
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,367
You know, that's
A funny thing.

1481
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:32,334
He's a nice guy.

1482
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,534
Knows how to spend
His money too.

1483
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,334
All I know is what
People around town said.

1484
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,834
When hank was a boy, you know,
No bigger than this,

1485
01:06:41,901 --> 01:06:44,334
He worked at the sawmill
Down by the river.

1486
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,367
And one day,
He fell into the saw

1487
01:06:46,434 --> 01:06:47,934
And cut off his big toe.

1488
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,701
Oh, that's terrible.

1489
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:52,868
Oh, not for hank. His folks
Didn't even call in a doctor.

1490
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:54,868
And afterwards, when people
Asked about the accident,

1491
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:56,834
Hank said it didn't bother him a bit,

1492
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:58,868
That he'd just
Grow a new toe.

1493
01:06:58,934 --> 01:07:00,300
Are you kidding?

1494
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:02,300
This guy's a bigger liar
Than I was.

1495
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,834
The only difference is,
He gets away with it.

1496
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,334
Well, why can't you and ted

1497
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,067
Come over to the house
Tomorrow night?

1498
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:10,334
Because we're on
24 hours notice.

1499
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,334
That means that by
Tomorrow night at this time,

1500
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,000
We may be a long way
From san francisco.

1501
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,000
We don't know
Where we're going...

1502
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:19,167
What do you mean,
"bring ted over," anyhow?

1503
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,167
He's cute.

1504
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:22,167
How long have you
Known him?

1505
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:23,234
Who?
Ted.

1506
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,834
Oh, we've been buddies
For over a year now.

1507
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:27,534
Same class. We got
Our wings together.

1508
01:07:27,601 --> 01:07:29,167
Go on with the story.

1509
01:07:29,234 --> 01:07:31,801
Oh, well, about a year
Before I left home,

1510
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:34,300
Hank was working
At the same sawmill,

1511
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,367
And he fell into
The same saw.

1512
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:38,868
Only this time
It cut off his foot,

1513
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:40,300
About up to here.

1514
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,334
I don't believe it.

1515
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,767
He was growing
Himself a new foot.

1516
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:45,367
What happened?

1517
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:48,267
Well, some folks said that first
There'd be a full-grown foot.

1518
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:50,167
Then the rest of the leg
Would grow

1519
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,667
Till the foot touched
The ground.

1520
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,767
Others said that they'd
Grow the leg out first,

1521
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:56,200
And then the heel with
The toenails last of all.

1522
01:07:56,267 --> 01:07:57,534
And then there were
Those who said

1523
01:07:57,601 --> 01:08:00,400
That there'd be a tiny
Little foot and ankle,

1524
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,734
And then it would grow till
It got to be full sized.

1525
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:06,300
Don't you think that's a very
Interesting scientific problem?

1526
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:07,634
Oh, I think it's
Just fascinating.

1527
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:10,434
It's just the most wonderful
Thing I've ever heard of.

1528
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:12,567
There's a dame that's headed
For the booby hatch.

1529
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,534
Finally they decided
It's downright immoral

1530
01:08:14,601 --> 01:08:17,767
For a guy to grow a foot without
Them knowing anything about it.

1531
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:18,968
So they go up
To hank's house.

1532
01:08:19,033 --> 01:08:21,834
And they yell up that if hank
Doesn't let them in,

1533
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,834
They're gonna set fire
To the place.

1534
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,834
Well, hank lets go
From his bedroom window

1535
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,334
With a double-barreled shotgun.

1536
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,167
So they set fire
To the back porch.

1537
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,434
Well, the place got hotter
And hotter.

1538
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:33,501
Oh, thank you.

1539
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,534
Oh, wait a minute.
Let me look at you.

1540
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:37,801
This is really amazing.

1541
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:39,801
You know, you remind me
Of my sister?

1542
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:42,567
We're all brothers
And sisters, aren't we?

1543
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,567
First time in 6 months
That line hasn't worked.

1544
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:49,767
O.k. Thanks.

1545
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,100
Well, this is it.

1546
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:52,367
I'm sorry, girls.

1547
01:08:52,434 --> 01:08:55,100
If you're still hungry,
You'll have to finish alone.

1548
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,634
But why?
What's happening?

1549
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:58,868
But ted,
What about the fire?

1550
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,868
I'll tell you
On the way out.

1551
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:03,133
You know, that thing
About the foot-

1552
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,467
If that's a line,
It's no good.

1553
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:07,868
And if he believes
It himself, he's crazy.

1554
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:09,701
Guy couldn't grow
Another foot, could he?

1555
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:10,868
You got me, pal.

1556
01:09:10,934 --> 01:09:13,734
Here, take these girls
Wherever they want to go.

1557
01:09:13,801 --> 01:09:15,067
But what about hank?

1558
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,400
Hank? Oh, hank.
Well, the place burned down.

1559
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:18,400
But what happened
To hank?

1560
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:19,901
Well, nobody knows.

1561
01:09:19,968 --> 01:09:22,033
Did he get out of the
House or didn't he?

1562
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,033
He never got out.

1563
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,000
What about the foot,
You dope?

1564
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:26,434
Did he grow
A new foot?

1565
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:27,767
They never found out.

1566
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:29,334
All they found
Was a little bridgework.

1567
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,334
Gold, you know. Nothing
Else. Nothing at all.

1568
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,767
Ooh!

1569
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:36,567
Well, I didn't say it was
A funny story.

1570
01:09:36,634 --> 01:09:38,267
It smells.

1571
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:41,100
Well, I guess
This is good-bye.

1572
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,834
Well, so long, greg.

1573
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:52,534
I wonder if this is
That wartime immorality

1574
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:54,667
They're always
Talking about.

1575
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,801
'Bye, ted.

1576
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:12,834
Who do we take out next?

1577
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:15,100
Nobody. We're gonna
Ride along with them.

1578
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:16,767
With them?
Those guys can fly-

1579
01:10:16,834 --> 01:10:17,834
That's only half
The job.

1580
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:19,868
We gotta see how they hold up in combat.

1581
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:21,834
Do I have to keep on
Looking at that guy?

1582
01:10:21,901 --> 01:10:23,801
You can't
Give us a hint

1583
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:24,934
Of where we're going, can you?

1584
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,934
Well, I can tell you
That where you're going

1585
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,901
I don't think
You'll find anybody

1586
01:10:28,968 --> 01:10:30,767
Who reminds you
Of your sister.

1587
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:32,400
You got all
That consignment

1588
01:10:32,467 --> 01:10:33,901
Of spare parts
Aboard, sergeant?

1589
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:34,868
Yes, sir. 23 cases.

1590
01:10:34,934 --> 01:10:36,334
Good. Take her up.

1591
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,534
We made it.

1592
01:10:40,934 --> 01:10:43,868
I sure hope that new
Outfit coming in

1593
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:46,033
Brings plenty of spare parts
With them.

1594
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,100
Yeah. What's the matter?

1595
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,400
Blown out.
Blown out, huh?

1596
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:52,901
Hmm. Reminds me of the last
Letter I got from my wife.

1597
01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:55,434
You know what that kid
Of mine did?

1598
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,634
No, sir.

1599
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:58,334
Well, he's trying
To be a chemist,

1600
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,434
And he's out in the barn
One day fooling around

1601
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,667
Mixing stuff together- a
Little potash, a little sulfur-

1602
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:04,367
And maybe a little
Nitroglycerin.

1603
01:11:04,434 --> 01:11:05,701
You know what happened?

1604
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:06,868
No, sir.

1605
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,868
He blew the barn up-
The whole cockeyed barn.

1606
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:10,367
Just blew it up!

1607
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:12,567
Ain't that the funniest thing
You ever heard?

1608
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:14,033
Yes, sir.

1609
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:17,067
That sure is funny,
Colonel.

1610
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:19,734
You know, that reminds me of my kid.

1611
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,767
He's only 4-

1612
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,033
Aw, you wait till he's 9, henderson.

1613
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,467
Then's when
They're really fun.

1614
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,334
Yes, sir, but as
I as saying-

1615
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
Aw, great things, kids.
Great things.

1616
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:30,934
Let me know when you get
This tub finished, will you?

1617
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,267
Yes, sir.

1618
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,467
Oh, al?

1619
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:37,601
Yes, sir.

1620
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,467
What time's that gang
From the states get in?

1621
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:40,434
About an hour, sir.

1622
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:41,901
See that they're
Fixed up.

1623
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:42,968
Sure will.

1624
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:45,067
Old friend of yours got in from sydney.

1625
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah, who's that?

1626
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:47,033
Dorinda durston.

1627
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,300
Are you kidding?
Where is she, nails?

1628
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:50,300
Over in 4.

1629
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:51,300
Holy smoke!

1630
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,901
Give her my regards,
Will you?

1631
01:11:52,968 --> 01:11:54,200
You bet I will.

1632
01:12:07,234 --> 01:12:08,167
Hello, Dorinda.

1633
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:11,267
Al! Al yackey!

1634
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:16,334
They told me you just pulled in, honey.

1635
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,334
Oh, it's good
To see you.

1636
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,767
It's good
To see you, al.

1637
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:22,334
Hey, hey, hey.
What's this?

1638
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,334
Just hold on.

1639
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,701
It'll leave
In just a minute.

1640
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,667
Let me look at you.

1641
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:31,868
Why, al, you're a colonel!

1642
01:12:31,934 --> 01:12:33,133
That's right.

1643
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,634
Everybody gets
Promoted these days.

1644
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:35,901
You ought
To see nails.

1645
01:12:35,968 --> 01:12:38,033
He's a brigadier,
My boss here.

1646
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,868
Colonel al yackey.

1647
01:12:40,934 --> 01:12:42,467
Aw, gee.

1648
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:44,801
Can you imagine
How Pete'd cuss,

1649
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:46,167
Having to salute me?

1650
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:47,801
Yeah.

1651
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,601
He sure would,
Wouldn't he?

1652
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:52,734
Sit down, al.

1653
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,434
I was just starting
To unpack.

1654
01:12:57,701 --> 01:12:59,901
I did that on purpose,
Dorinda.

1655
01:12:59,968 --> 01:13:02,667
I had to find out
How you were doing.

1656
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:04,968
Oh, not so good,
Not so good.

1657
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:06,334
I manage to keep busy.

1658
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,834
Yeah, I know. They tell me
You're trying to win this war

1659
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:10,868
All by yourself.

1660
01:13:10,934 --> 01:13:12,167
Nobody ever
Sees you anymore.

1661
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,834
All work and no play-

1662
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:15,667
Makes a girl keep her
Mind off her troubles.

1663
01:13:15,734 --> 01:13:17,834
You look kind
Of peaked too, honey.

1664
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:19,234
It don't seem right-

1665
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,267
Al...

1666
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:23,367
Please don't
Make me cry.

1667
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:34,734
You're gonna have to
Get over this, Dorinda.

1668
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:35,868
Get over it?

1669
01:13:35,934 --> 01:13:39,367
You sound like I had
The measles or something.

1670
01:13:39,434 --> 01:13:42,567
You don't get over
A thing like this.

1671
01:13:42,634 --> 01:13:44,100
You die from it.

1672
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,434
That's not the gal
I know, honey.

1673
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:48,400
Too many things
To remember, al.

1674
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:51,901
You find you've gone over all the
Big things a million times or more,

1675
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:54,868
And then you begin to think
Of the little things,

1676
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:57,400
Like the time he got
To talking to me

1677
01:13:57,467 --> 01:14:01,400
And stepped off
Into a puddle

1678
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:03,634
And I laughed,
And he got mad.

1679
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:06,334
And then we forgot
All about it,

1680
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,834
Until out of nowhere
At all,

1681
01:14:08,901 --> 01:14:11,801
That little stumble comes
To live with me again.

1682
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:14,801
Remember the time
In the machine shop-

1683
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,834
Yeah, I guess I know
What you mean, honey.

1684
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:21,701
I remember he used to be always
Running out of cigarettes,

1685
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,868
Bumming them from me,
And I'd say,

1686
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:25,868
"Pete, why don't you
Buy some.

1687
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:29,868
I'm never gonna save a
Dime till I get rid of you."

1688
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:32,501
Well, I got rid
Of him, all right,

1689
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:35,400
And I haven't saved
A dime yet.

1690
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,067
This is just plain
Darned foolishness,

1691
01:14:40,133 --> 01:14:41,834
Sitting around here
Moaning like this.

1692
01:14:41,901 --> 01:14:44,868
Look. I'm meeting
A new bunch of boys

1693
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:45,901
From the states
Tonight.

1694
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:47,534
Why don't you come over

1695
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:48,801
To the officer's
Club with us

1696
01:14:48,868 --> 01:14:50,400
And break
A bottle open?

1697
01:14:50,467 --> 01:14:51,434
No, thanks, al.

1698
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:53,067
I'd much rather
Stay here.

1699
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:54,734
You'd rather
Stay here, huh?

1700
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:55,901
Yeah.

1701
01:14:55,968 --> 01:14:56,901
And moan?

1702
01:14:56,968 --> 01:14:58,234
Well,
That's my business.

1703
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,901
That's right, sure. That's
Your business, all right.

1704
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:02,834
But if you're gonna sit
And grieve

1705
01:15:02,901 --> 01:15:04,334
All the rest
Of your life,

1706
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,834
Why don't you
Do it right?

1707
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,300
Why don't you get
A room

1708
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:08,801
And lock yourself up
In it,

1709
01:15:08,868 --> 01:15:10,000
And wear black
Silk dresses?

1710
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:11,801
And put a little white
Handkerchief over your head

1711
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:13,133
And a pasty look
On your face?

1712
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,801
I knew a woman
Back home did that.

1713
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:16,167
She got just what
She wanted, too.

1714
01:15:16,234 --> 01:15:17,901
Folks felt sorry for her
For 30 years.

1715
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:19,234
That's not nice, al.

1716
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,968
All right, so it ain't
Nice. But it's the truth.

1717
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:23,868
You think you're the only guy
That ever got a kick in the teeth?

1718
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:25,834
You're not.
It's happening every day,

1719
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,367
And it's gonna keep right on
Happening till this thing's over.

1720
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:29,834
You can feel sorry
For yourself,

1721
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:31,834
Or you can come out with me

1722
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:33,367
And see how nice people are
When they're alive.

1723
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:37,033
Al, I like you better than
Anybody on earth, I guess,

1724
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,701
And I know you're
Trying to help me,

1725
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:41,334
But this is
Just something

1726
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,868
I've got to work out
In my own way.

1727
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:45,434
Look, honey.

1728
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,367
You see this guy?

1729
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:49,567
That's Pete sandidge,

1730
01:15:49,634 --> 01:15:52,067
The best friend I ever had or ever will.

1731
01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:54,367
He's the greatest guy
In the world,

1732
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:55,901
And I miss him more

1733
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,200
Than anybody ever
Missed a guy before.

1734
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:00,200
But he's dead,
And I'm alive.

1735
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:03,400
I'm gonna put him
Right where he belongs.

1736
01:16:03,467 --> 01:16:05,667
No, al!
Right there.

1737
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:10,000
I gotta go out
To the field, honey.

1738
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:12,667
I'll be back here
In half an hour.

1739
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,968
Now, you get yourself
All prettied up,

1740
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,334
'Cause it's gonna be
Our night to howl.

1741
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,801
Come on, smile.

1742
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:21,501
Aw, you feel better,
Maybe?

1743
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:22,801
Just a little bit?

1744
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:25,334
Oh, al. You're-
You're great!

1745
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,834
You tell that
To all the guys.

1746
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:29,467
I know you.

1747
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:32,801
Now you got just 29
And a quarter minutes.

1748
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:35,033
O.k. O.k., boss!

1749
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,334
Al!

1750
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,234
Al yackey,
Why you broken down...

1751
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,400
Look at those chickens.

1752
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:31,334
So you're
A ground officer, huh?

1753
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,334
Look at him, a colonel,
Fat and sassy.

1754
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,834
The seat of his pants

1755
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,868
Shines better
Than his boots, too.

1756
01:17:37,934 --> 01:17:39,334
How are you,
Captain robertson?

1757
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,534
Welcome to new guinea.
Did you have a good trip?

1758
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:44,868
Smooth as silk. I brought a great
Bunch of pilots for you, too.

1759
01:17:44,934 --> 01:17:47,200
Colonel yackey, this is lieutenant
Rourke and lieutenant randall.

1760
01:17:47,267 --> 01:17:48,367
What are you, colonel?

1761
01:17:48,434 --> 01:17:50,501
The official greeter
For the chamber of commerce?

1762
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:52,167
Randall? That's kind
Of funny.

1763
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,367
I thought for a minute

1764
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:55,367
You and I'd met up
Before someplace.

1765
01:17:55,434 --> 01:17:56,834
No, sir.

1766
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:59,434
Lieutenant ridley, this
Is captain robertson,

1767
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:00,834
Lieutenants randall
And rourke.

1768
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:02,234
Aren't you afraid to go
Around without a parachute?

1769
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,868
You might fall into a spittoon
In your office.

1770
01:18:04,934 --> 01:18:06,300
Lieutenant ridley'll show
You fellas to your quarters.

1771
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:07,801
In case you'd like
To have a drink,

1772
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:09,434
Come over to
The officer's club.

1773
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:10,968
Oh, sounds like
A fine idea.

1774
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:13,334
I'm gonna be with the
Prettiest gal in all new guinea,

1775
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,300
That is, if you guys are
Interested in pretty gals.

1776
01:18:15,367 --> 01:18:16,334
We'd be delighted,
Sir.

1777
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,334
That's swell.
That's good.

1778
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,334
Well, listen to that.

1779
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,634
That big lug talking
About dames and-

1780
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:23,567
I can't believe it.
A colonel.

1781
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:25,300
I'd have been a 3-star-

1782
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,701
I'd have been
A 4-star general.

1783
01:18:29,267 --> 01:18:32,234
So don't sit
Under the apple tree

1784
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,334
With anyone else but me

1785
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,334
Till I come marching home

1786
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:41,834
Ginger beer.
Same.

1787
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:43,868
I don't mind al
Being a colonel,

1788
01:18:43,934 --> 01:18:45,868
But when I saw that star
On nails' shoulder,

1789
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,234
That finished me.

1790
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,167
Don't they have any privates
In this war?

1791
01:18:50,234 --> 01:18:52,367
Oh, yeah, drinking
Ginger beer,

1792
01:18:52,434 --> 01:18:53,868
Laying off the liquor.

1793
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:56,400
He'll be a captain
Before long.

1794
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:58,133
He's my man.

1795
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:17,667
Here. You nibble on these
While I'm gone.

1796
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:27,868
Dorinda!

1797
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:29,801
Hey, girl,
It's me, Pete.

1798
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:32,634
Dorinda, you gotta
Listen to me, I...

1799
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,868
Now, look, Dorinda. I
Can take a lot, you know,

1800
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:37,868
And I have.

1801
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:39,868
Seeing al and nails
Was bad enough,

1802
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:42,534
But-but I guess
This is the moment

1803
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:44,400
I've been afraid of
All along.

1804
01:19:44,467 --> 01:19:47,701
I wondered how I'd feel
And how you would look.

1805
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:50,400
And you look good enough
To eat, Dorinda.

1806
01:19:50,467 --> 01:19:52,701
You look pretty
As a picture.

1807
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,934
I think I'll just
Stay here a minute.

1808
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,901
You still
The same girl?

1809
01:19:58,968 --> 01:20:00,400
You know, Dorinda,

1810
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,067
Some people seem prettier
When you dream about them

1811
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:04,434
Than they really are.

1812
01:20:04,501 --> 01:20:06,834
But a funny thing
About you-

1813
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:08,868
You're even prettier
Than the dream.

1814
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,868
Still my girl?
Sure you are.

1815
01:20:10,934 --> 01:20:13,901
Sure you are, and you
Always will be, won't you?

1816
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:15,868
You know a funny thing,
Dorinda?

1817
01:20:15,934 --> 01:20:17,901
I haven't forgotten
One little thing

1818
01:20:17,968 --> 01:20:19,534
That ever happened
Between us.

1819
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:21,868
I remember how you
Used to burn up

1820
01:20:21,934 --> 01:20:22,901
When I'd ball you out

1821
01:20:22,968 --> 01:20:24,868
About how you
Ham-handled a ship.

1822
01:20:24,934 --> 01:20:27,367
I remember how you used
To hop out of a ship, too.

1823
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:28,400
Always with
A grease spot

1824
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:30,167
On your nose,
Right there.

1825
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:35,400
But I'll never forget
The day we met in london.

1826
01:20:35,467 --> 01:20:38,901
You were riding on top of
The bus, and it was raining.

1827
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:42,267
The rain was on your
Face like on a flower.

1828
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,100
You weren't any too friendly, either.

1829
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,934
So when I busted up
To you and said...

1830
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,400
I beg your pardon.
I don't want to intrude,

1831
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:53,000
But you look exactly
Like a sister of mine.

1832
01:20:53,067 --> 01:20:55,033
Well, that's a strange
Coincidence, isn't it?

1833
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,367
Oh, an amazing one.

1834
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,934
Because I bear a resemblance
To my own sister, too.

1835
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,734
Do you mind
If I sit down?

1836
01:21:00,801 --> 01:21:02,000
No, not at all.

1837
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:03,634
My name is ted randall.

1838
01:21:03,701 --> 01:21:04,634
Lieutenant randall, huh?

1839
01:21:04,701 --> 01:21:05,634
That's right.

1840
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:07,267
I'm Dorinda durston,
Ferry service.

1841
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:09,534
I'm glad to know you,
Dorinda durston.

1842
01:21:09,601 --> 01:21:11,501
I admire the women's
Ferrying service.

1843
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:14,467
I've always thought it had
Such tremendous possibilities.

1844
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:16,100
I hope you won't
Be disappointed-

1845
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,834
Oh, I'm sure I won't be.

1846
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:19,501
Incidentally, I've only
Known you 2 minutes,

1847
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,300
And already I owe you
An apology.

1848
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:22,367
Really?

1849
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:23,968
Yes. I'm here under
False pretenses.

1850
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:24,968
Why, lieutenant!

1851
01:21:25,033 --> 01:21:27,767
It's true.
I have no sister.

1852
01:21:30,133 --> 01:21:33,267
I felt sure you hadn't.
Neither have I.

1853
01:21:33,334 --> 01:21:35,601
How did you know?

1854
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:38,601
Well, it seems that
Somewhere a long time ago,

1855
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:39,934
That line was used before.

1856
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,267
Listen to this drivel.

1857
01:21:41,334 --> 01:21:42,868
That's the trouble
With these kids.

1858
01:21:42,934 --> 01:21:45,367
You teach them something, and
They don't know how to handle it.

1859
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:46,801
No judgment of women.

1860
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,801
Oh, colonel yackey.
Good evening, sir.

1861
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:50,367
Hello, randall.
Here you are, honey.

1862
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:52,167
I see you've met
The lieutenant.

1863
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:53,334
Yes, I've met
Lieutenant randall.

1864
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,200
He says I remind him
Of his sisters.

1865
01:21:55,267 --> 01:21:56,133
She's wise to him.

1866
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:57,834
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

1867
01:21:57,901 --> 01:21:59,901
Sit down, sit down. How
Many sisters have you got?

1868
01:21:59,968 --> 01:22:01,400
11. Did you say 11?

1869
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:02,868
That's quite a family,
11 sisters.

1870
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:04,200
All very beautiful.

1871
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,000
And I remind
Him of every one of them.

1872
01:22:06,067 --> 01:22:07,868
Maybe we better
Get you a drink.

1873
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:10,367
Hey, waiter. Bring us a drink
For this boy.

1874
01:22:10,434 --> 01:22:11,801
Lieutenant randall is
In my command, honey.

1875
01:22:11,868 --> 01:22:13,834
They tell me
He's a pretty hot pilot.

1876
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:15,334
He stinks.

1877
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,534
You have to be a hot pilot
To be in al's outfit.

1878
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:18,868
That's what I hear.

1879
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,834
How about all 3 of us
Having dinner tonight?

1880
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:22,334
I could cook you
A kangaroo steak

1881
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,567
That will drive you crazy.

1882
01:22:23,634 --> 01:22:25,534
How do you cook
A kangaroo steak?

1883
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:28,167
With wallaby sauce.

1884
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,634
What a corny routine
This is.

1885
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:32,133
Well, it sounds
Very interesting.

1886
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,901
I'd love to see it
Done sometime.

1887
01:22:33,968 --> 01:22:35,901
Well, how about tonight?
A celebration.

1888
01:22:35,968 --> 01:22:36,968
Of what?

1889
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:39,467
Of my meeting you.

1890
01:22:39,534 --> 01:22:41,067
Watch this.
This'll be good.

1891
01:22:41,133 --> 01:22:44,067
Watch him get set back
On his heels.

1892
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:46,033
No, I'm afraid not.
Come on, Dorinda.

1893
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,400
You haven't had any fun
For a long time.

1894
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:51,033
She's always like this
When she's on the ground.

1895
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,334
Skittish as a colt.

1896
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,901
Tell him you'll go.
Come on!

1897
01:22:53,968 --> 01:22:55,601
Well, all right.
Sure, I'll go.

1898
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,400
That's better.

1899
01:22:57,467 --> 01:23:00,234
Come on!
Let's get outta here.

1900
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,334
Al!

1901
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,567
Well, where
Have you been?

1902
01:23:08,634 --> 01:23:09,601
Sydney, my boy.

1903
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:10,701
You have?

1904
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:13,267
Yeah. I just you back
A load of spare parts.

1905
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:16,501
Good. You know, you shouldn't
Stay away so long, Dorinda.

1906
01:23:16,567 --> 01:23:19,234
That flyer of yours has just been
Pining away since you was gone.

1907
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,868
Me too. Where is he?

1908
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:22,467
He's up
On security patrol.

1909
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:23,868
How about a coke?

1910
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:26,300
No, I can't, al. I've
Got to fill out my report.

1911
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:27,267
Yeah, I see.

1912
01:23:27,334 --> 01:23:28,634
How's he been doing?

1913
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:29,868
Who?

1914
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:30,834
Ted, you goose.

1915
01:23:30,901 --> 01:23:32,367
Oh, him. He's doing
All right.

1916
01:23:32,434 --> 01:23:33,334
He got 3 more zeros.

1917
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,868
No!
Yeah.

1918
01:23:34,934 --> 01:23:37,300
Oh, I'll just have to cook him
A dinner tonight.

1919
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,367
I'll cook one for you, too.

1920
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:41,200
I wouldn't want
To gum up your party.

1921
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:51,701
Let's make tracks, baby.

1922
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,901
Holy leapin' loopin'
Judas priest!

1923
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,067
Where's that
Security patrol?

1924
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:25,634
You dirty, no good,
Stinkin' sprite!

1925
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:42,033
Nails! Look! Here they come!
Here come our kids.

1926
01:24:46,934 --> 01:24:48,367
Get those meatballs.

1927
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:49,901
Boil 'em in oil.

1928
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:51,200
Tear 'em to pieces

1929
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:53,000
And fry 'em
For breakfast.

1930
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:54,033
What'd you say?

1931
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,601
I didn't say a thing.

1932
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,434
O.k., boy,
It's all yours.

1933
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:00,434
You're supposed to be
Doing something in this war

1934
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:03,901
Besides making wisecracks
To my girl, anyway.

1935
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:07,100
That's it.

1936
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:09,634
O.k., so you're lucky.

1937
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,801
Watch out!

1938
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:15,634
Easy, Dorinda.

1939
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,300
You don't have to worry
About that fella, honey.

1940
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:24,367
He's just naturally the
Luckiest flier I ever did see.

1941
01:25:24,434 --> 01:25:25,534
'Pert near the best.

1942
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:26,534
If you are good,

1943
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:28,367
It's because I've been
Hanging around

1944
01:25:28,434 --> 01:25:30,667
To keep you from breaking
Your fool neck.

1945
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,734
Look at that!
Another one.

1946
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:42,234
I gotta admit you're good.

1947
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:49,968
Robertson.

1948
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:18,434
Hey, look at that!
Look at that.

1949
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,033
There they go.
Look at that!

1950
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,926
We got 6 out of 8.

1951
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:27,767
6 out of 8! Yeah, and lost 1.

1952
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,834
There's nothing unusual
About the shakes, ted.

1953
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,868
You're just excited
After the fight.

1954
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:50,300
I've seen a lot
Of guys

1955
01:26:50,367 --> 01:26:51,434
Have worse
Than the shakes

1956
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:52,601
After
A good show.

1957
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:53,968
Oh, sure, I know.

1958
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:57,267
I wasn't thinking about the
Fight so much as robertson.

1959
01:26:57,334 --> 01:26:58,968
He was a great guy,

1960
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:01,200
And a darn fine
Squadron commander, too.

1961
01:27:01,267 --> 01:27:03,200
You know, it doesn't
Seem possible,

1962
01:27:03,267 --> 01:27:05,467
When you stop
To think about it,

1963
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:07,834
That they're not here anymore,
And they're not gonna be.

1964
01:27:07,901 --> 01:27:10,300
Has anything like that
Ever happened to you?

1965
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:11,334
Yes.

1966
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,100
A person's gotta forget,
Of course,

1967
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,100
But it's not easy at first.

1968
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:16,701
We gotta figure
These things

1969
01:27:16,767 --> 01:27:19,000
A little bit different
Than most people.

1970
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,701
There's something about
Going out in a plane

1971
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:23,334
That beats
Any other way.

1972
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,801
I suppose all
The other branches

1973
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:26,334
Of the service
Feel the same,

1974
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,801
But the guy
That washes out

1975
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,334
At the controls
Of his own ship-

1976
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,701
Well, he goes down

1977
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:32,968
Doing the thing that
He loved the best.

1978
01:27:33,033 --> 01:27:34,968
That's a very
Special way to die.

1979
01:27:35,033 --> 01:27:36,834
Hmm. I never thought
Of it that way before,

1980
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:38,100
But it's true, all right.

1981
01:27:38,167 --> 01:27:40,667
Ted, you're not gonna have
Any eyebrows left

1982
01:27:40,734 --> 01:27:42,133
If you don't stop it.

1983
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,501
Oh. Like with a flower.

1984
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:45,767
Stop it!

1985
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:50,367
Well, I guess we better get on our horse

1986
01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:51,834
Before this turns
Into a wake.

1987
01:27:51,901 --> 01:27:53,834
Oh, no, no.
It's my fault.

1988
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:54,901
Don't go, sir.

1989
01:27:54,968 --> 01:27:58,133
I need a good drink
And a night's sleep.

1990
01:28:00,534 --> 01:28:03,067
Oh, I'm sorry if I
Did anything wrong.

1991
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:05,734
Oh, there's nothing wrong
With you. It's me.

1992
01:28:05,801 --> 01:28:08,667
And everything wrong
With you, I like.

1993
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:11,601
Good night.

1994
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:12,801
Breakfast?

1995
01:28:12,868 --> 01:28:14,033
Sure.

1996
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:16,234
Good night, sir.

1997
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,801
Good night.

1998
01:28:28,367 --> 01:28:30,934
Did you see
What he was doing?

1999
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,901
Yeah, I saw.

2000
01:28:32,968 --> 01:28:35,801
The things he does,
The way he acts sometimes.

2001
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:37,968
You know, honey,
I got a hunch.

2002
01:28:38,033 --> 01:28:39,834
You're falling
For this guy.

2003
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:40,901
Oh, no!

2004
01:28:40,968 --> 01:28:42,367
No?
No, no.

2005
01:28:42,434 --> 01:28:46,767
It's not that. It's-well,
It's hard to explain.

2006
01:28:46,834 --> 01:28:49,534
I
- I get such a queer feeling sometimes,

2007
01:28:49,601 --> 01:28:50,534
Watching him.

2008
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:52,367
Yeah, I know.
I know, honey.

2009
01:28:52,434 --> 01:28:53,834
I know just
How you feel.

2010
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:55,667
I gotta go now.
Good night.

2011
01:28:55,734 --> 01:28:57,067
Good night, al.

2012
01:29:12,334 --> 01:29:13,868
Don't let that
Baby-faced killer

2013
01:29:13,934 --> 01:29:15,667
Pull the wool
Over your eyes.

2014
01:29:15,734 --> 01:29:17,234
You know
What I mean.

2015
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:26,200
Or do ya?

2016
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:29,167
Remember,
You're still my girl.

2017
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,434
Lieutenant randall,
It is my privilege

2018
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:50,901
To bestow upon you

2019
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,434
The distinguished
Flying cross

2020
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:53,901
Awarded for
Bravery, heroism,

2021
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:56,567
And extraordinary achievement
While in aerial flight.

2022
01:29:56,634 --> 01:29:59,367
And upon the recommendation
Of your superior officer,

2023
01:29:59,434 --> 01:30:00,934
And with the approval
Of your commander in chief,

2024
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,801
You have been promoted
To the rank of captain.

2025
01:30:03,868 --> 01:30:04,834
My congratulations, sir.

2026
01:30:04,901 --> 01:30:05,868
Thank you, sir.

2027
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:06,868
They're passing
Out that hardware

2028
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,033
To everybody these days.

2029
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,067
Dismissed!

2030
01:30:09,133 --> 01:30:10,901
Congratulations!

2031
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:12,400
Thanks a lot, guys.

2032
01:30:12,467 --> 01:30:13,834
I hope you'll excuse me,

2033
01:30:13,901 --> 01:30:15,868
But I got some kind of
Special plan for this afternoon.

2034
01:30:15,934 --> 01:30:17,334
All the luck
In the world!

2035
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,033
Oh, thanks. Everything
All ready, powerhouse?

2036
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,801
Captain,
Everything's all fixed.

2037
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:24,467
What special thing
Could he have planned now?

2038
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,634
Come in!

2039
01:30:36,701 --> 01:30:37,667
Out here!

2040
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:38,767
Hello!

2041
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:41,167
Ha ha ha!

2042
01:30:41,234 --> 01:30:42,167
Aw!

2043
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:43,868
Ted, you idiot.

2044
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,868
Hey, look, 2 bars.
I'm a captain.

2045
01:30:47,934 --> 01:30:48,834
I've got
A medal, too.

2046
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:50,367
Why don't
You say something?

2047
01:30:50,434 --> 01:30:51,868
Give me a chance.

2048
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:54,367
You're the prettiest
Girl in all the world.

2049
01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:55,834
You're prettier
Than a p-38.

2050
01:30:55,901 --> 01:30:57,400
Oh, ted, I know what's
The matter with you.

2051
01:30:57,467 --> 01:30:58,400
You're crazy.

2052
01:30:58,467 --> 01:30:59,901
Not really crazy.

2053
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,400
I've just come to
A decision, that's all.

2054
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:02,334
Decision? What?

2055
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,234
Dorinda, I'm gonna
Marry you.

2056
01:31:06,734 --> 01:31:08,133
You're going
To marry me?

2057
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,300
That's it,
Marry you.

2058
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:10,767
You're gonna be mrs.
Ted randall, my wife.

2059
01:31:10,834 --> 01:31:12,300
Me? I'll be
Your husband.

2060
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:13,467
Get it?

2061
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,901
Oh, it's not the most
Original idea on earth.

2062
01:31:15,968 --> 01:31:17,834
It's been
Done before, but...

2063
01:31:17,901 --> 01:31:20,267
Never with
2 people like us.

2064
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:21,801
You mean you and I?

2065
01:31:21,868 --> 01:31:23,334
That's it, married.

2066
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,834
M- a-double r-I-e-d.

2067
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:26,334
The judge goes so and so and so and so,

2068
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,334
And you're married.

2069
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,067
You will, won't you?

2070
01:31:30,367 --> 01:31:31,567
Oh, ted, I...

2071
01:31:34,767 --> 01:31:35,701
Yes.

2072
01:31:35,767 --> 01:31:37,000
Hooray!

2073
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:42,133
Come on in, guys!

2074
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,133
Surprise!

2075
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,000
Ted, you fool!

2076
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:49,033
Yahoo!

2077
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,467
What took you
So long?

2078
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:52,868
Yeah! All the food
Will be cold.

2079
01:31:52,934 --> 01:31:53,934
We thought
You'd never say yes!

2080
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,067
Lots of luck. You'll need it with him.

2081
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:57,567
Play it again!
Play it again!

2082
01:31:57,634 --> 01:31:58,868
Again!

2083
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:04,834
Aw.

2084
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:07,100
Aw, this is the way it's
Gonna be from now on,

2085
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:08,834
You and me
And real living.

2086
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:10,334
When this show
Is over,

2087
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,300
I'm gonna buy the sweetest
Little plane on earth.

2088
01:32:12,367 --> 01:32:13,834
We'll fly together,
Just the 2 of us,

2089
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:15,300
Right over the top
Of the earth.

2090
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:16,534
Darling.

2091
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:18,467
I never used to like to
Fly with anybody before,

2092
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:21,100
But I think I'm gonna like it with you.

2093
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,334
Mademoiselle
And monsieur?

2094
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,300
Yes?

2095
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:24,334
Come and get it.

2096
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,367
Oh, dandy.

2097
01:32:25,434 --> 01:32:27,834
Where'd you get all
This beautiful food?

2098
01:32:27,901 --> 01:32:29,334
It's a military secret.

2099
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,834
Play it again!
Play it again!

2100
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:31,834
Again!

2101
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:33,300
To mrs. Ted randall!

2102
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:35,000
Hooray!

2103
01:32:35,067 --> 01:32:36,267
To mr. Randall!

2104
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:38,400
Hooray!

2105
01:32:40,868 --> 01:32:42,267
Well,
What's the matter?

2106
01:32:42,334 --> 01:32:43,801
I was just thinking,

2107
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:45,100
You were pretty sure of
Yourself, weren't you?

2108
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:46,868
Why,
What do you mean?

2109
01:32:46,934 --> 01:32:48,367
What would you have done
If I'd said no?

2110
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:51,801
Ho ho. Play the other one, boys!

2111
01:32:57,601 --> 01:32:58,734
Oh, no!

2112
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:03,467
'Tention!

2113
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,534
What is this,
A convention?

2114
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:07,801
Carry on, boys.

2115
01:33:07,868 --> 01:33:09,334
Congratulate me,
Sir.

2116
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,968
O.k. What for?

2117
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:12,501
Dorinda and I are
Gonna be married.

2118
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:13,501
No?

2119
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:14,501
Yes!

2120
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:15,834
Oh, is that right?

2121
01:33:15,901 --> 01:33:16,834
That's right, al.

2122
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:18,334
Oh, that's swell.

2123
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,334
Congratulations,
Ted.

2124
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,834
Thank you very much,
Sir.

2125
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:22,334
I feel a little bit
Like a late spring frost

2126
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,834
Coming in here
Like this,

2127
01:33:23,901 --> 01:33:25,334
But your replacements are here

2128
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,834
And nails wants you to
Whip them into shape.

2129
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:27,834
When?

2130
01:33:27,901 --> 01:33:28,868
I'm afraid
Right now.

2131
01:33:28,934 --> 01:33:30,334
He didn't know this was gonna happen.

2132
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,334
O.k., o.k.

2133
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,968
Come on, fellas,
Let's go!

2134
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:36,300
A lot of firsts
For me today.

2135
01:33:36,367 --> 01:33:37,767
First time
I ever got engaged.

2136
01:33:37,834 --> 01:33:39,334
The first time I ever
Led my own squadron.

2137
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,801
Don't forget to
Keep the wine cold.

2138
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:42,334
And the food hot.

2139
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,300
Sure thing.

2140
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,767
Follow me over
To field.

2141
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:52,868
Wish me luck,
Darling.

2142
01:33:52,934 --> 01:33:54,567
You won't need it.

2143
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,734
Oh, and keep my medal for me, will ya?

2144
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:04,200
Are you sure
You trust me with it?

2145
01:34:04,267 --> 01:34:05,801
Oh,
What do you think?

2146
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:10,968
Climb in, romeo.

2147
01:34:24,067 --> 01:34:26,601
You know, you're not sitting
As pretty as you think you are.

2148
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:27,767
You're engaged,
All right,

2149
01:34:27,834 --> 01:34:29,501
But you're not
Married yet.

2150
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:41,434
You really
Wanna keep her?

2151
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:43,801
Well, I'm gonna
Tell you something.

2152
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:45,300
She just loves
Crazy fliers.

2153
01:34:45,367 --> 01:34:47,300
She always has.

2154
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,801
How do you think
I ever got her?

2155
01:34:49,868 --> 01:34:51,267
Go on,

2156
01:34:51,334 --> 01:34:52,901
Put on something fancy,
Money bags.

2157
01:34:52,968 --> 01:34:54,400
She'd love it.

2158
01:34:54,467 --> 01:34:55,801
So would nails.

2159
01:34:55,868 --> 01:34:57,334
Why don't you break
Away from the squadron?

2160
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,834
Tell 'em to keep
Their eye on you,

2161
01:34:58,901 --> 01:35:00,367
You'll show 'em what the
Service really expects of 'em.

2162
01:35:00,434 --> 01:35:01,834
Go on, kid, you won't get into trouble.

2163
01:35:01,901 --> 01:35:03,300
Go ahead. She thinks you're wonderful.

2164
01:35:03,367 --> 01:35:04,801
Don't disappoint her.

2165
01:35:04,868 --> 01:35:06,501
Put on a show for her.

2166
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:09,767
Lieutenant rourke,

2167
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:11,267
Assume commander
Of squadron.

2168
01:35:11,334 --> 01:35:13,100
Tell the new men to
Keep an eye on me.

2169
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:16,501
I'll give them a small idea
Of what we expect down here.

2170
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:17,734
Roger.

2171
01:35:28,234 --> 01:35:29,567
What's he doing?

2172
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:31,267
I don't know, honey.

2173
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:32,767
But whatever it is,
It ain't good.

2174
01:35:46,067 --> 01:35:48,634
This plane'll hold up under
Anything. You know that.

2175
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:50,667
Come on,
You lady killer,

2176
01:35:50,734 --> 01:35:52,901
Fly this crate right
Down to the wing bolts.

2177
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:55,234
And don't forget this.

2178
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,133
She once had a guy who really
Knew how to fly an airplane.

2179
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,634
She can fly
This well herself.

2180
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,400
Go on, fly it.

2181
01:36:25,801 --> 01:36:28,400
Go on down there and take
The tops off those trees.

2182
01:36:43,801 --> 01:36:45,534
Hey, hey, take it
Easy now, take it easy.

2183
01:36:45,601 --> 01:36:47,601
You don't have to
Overdo it, you know.

2184
01:36:53,634 --> 01:36:56,701
Nails is going to
Love that one.

2185
01:36:56,801 --> 01:36:58,300
Nice flying.

2186
01:36:58,367 --> 01:36:59,567
Yeah.

2187
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,767
Well, from now on, son,

2188
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:15,167
It's between you
And your maker.

2189
01:37:15,234 --> 01:37:17,601
I'm stuck, I can't
Think of anything more.

2190
01:37:19,801 --> 01:37:21,267
Sir.

2191
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:22,634
Oh, thanks,
Sergeant.

2192
01:37:24,868 --> 01:37:26,267
Well, looks like
We're gonna do something

2193
01:37:26,334 --> 01:37:29,000
Besides play around here
For the rest of the day.

2194
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:30,534
Oh, colonel yackey.

2195
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:32,267
Yes, sir.
See ya later, honey.

2196
01:37:34,534 --> 01:37:36,234
Colonel, tell that young
Idiot to report to me

2197
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,534
The minute he lands.

2198
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:38,834
Yes, sir.

2199
01:37:56,901 --> 01:37:59,334
Just what did
You do that for?

2200
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,934
I don't know.
I guess I was kind of a fool.

2201
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,234
Yeah, I guess
You were.

2202
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:03,767
You might have been
A fool, ted,

2203
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:05,267
But you're the kind
Of fool that knows

2204
01:38:05,334 --> 01:38:06,400
How to fly
An airplane.

2205
01:38:06,467 --> 01:38:08,100
There's nothing I can
Do for you now, bub.

2206
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:09,868
Come on. The boss wants to see you.

2207
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:12,767
This'll cost that guy
Every leave he'll have

2208
01:38:12,834 --> 01:38:14,167
For the next
6 months.

2209
01:38:14,234 --> 01:38:15,667
He'll have to get married
In the guard house.

2210
01:38:15,734 --> 01:38:17,167
Oh, yeah,
That's possible.

2211
01:38:17,234 --> 01:38:20,000
By the way, the boss wants to see you.

2212
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:21,000
Me?

2213
01:38:21,067 --> 01:38:22,200
Mm-hmm.

2214
01:38:24,367 --> 01:38:26,801
O.k, but let me see
What nails does to him.

2215
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:28,767
After that,
I can take anything.

2216
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:30,934
I just wanna see how
He takes a demotion.

2217
01:38:32,634 --> 01:38:33,767
You go on home.

2218
01:38:33,834 --> 01:38:35,300
I'll be over to see
You after I'm through.

2219
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:36,300
Don't worry.

2220
01:38:36,367 --> 01:38:37,801
It may not be
As bad as you think.

2221
01:38:37,868 --> 01:38:38,767
Good luck.

2222
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:40,067
Thanks.

2223
01:38:40,133 --> 01:38:42,367
Sergeant, drive
Miss durston to her quarters.

2224
01:38:42,434 --> 01:38:44,601
Bye.

2225
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,067
You wanted
To see me, sir.

2226
01:38:53,133 --> 01:38:55,801
Yes. I watched that
Show you put on up there.

2227
01:38:55,868 --> 01:38:57,801
I'm sorry, sir. I
Don't know why I did it.

2228
01:38:57,868 --> 01:38:59,334
Guess I went
A little overboard.

2229
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,634
I know why
You did it.

2230
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:02,334
Don't do those things, captain.

2231
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,667
You're a squadron
Commander now.

2232
01:39:03,734 --> 01:39:05,300
Yes, sir.

2233
01:39:05,367 --> 01:39:06,801
What's the matter with you?
You going soft?

2234
01:39:06,868 --> 01:39:08,334
This guy
Should be busted.

2235
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,734
You're good, randall.

2236
01:39:09,801 --> 01:39:11,767
You're so good, I've got a
Job here you might go for.

2237
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:13,167
I'll take it, sir.

2238
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:14,367
Better have
A look at it first.

2239
01:39:14,434 --> 01:39:16,133
What is this,
A tea par...

2240
01:39:18,934 --> 01:39:20,334
I'll still take it,
Sir.

2241
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,801
You understand, this
Is no ordinary mission?

2242
01:39:22,868 --> 01:39:25,483
Headquarters
Seem to think a p-38

2243
01:39:25,484 --> 01:39:26,868
Is the ship
To do it.

2244
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:28,234
See that?

2245
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,567
That's palibuk,
Palibuk island.

2246
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,167
Right there
Is the biggest

2247
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:36,167
Enemy munitions dump
In the pacific.

2248
01:39:36,234 --> 01:39:37,868
Observation gives us
Clear weather all the way.

2249
01:39:37,934 --> 01:39:38,868
You'll take off
In time to be

2250
01:39:38,934 --> 01:39:39,968
Over palibuk
Around midnight.

2251
01:39:40,033 --> 01:39:41,334
Just get
Your bombs in,

2252
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,367
Then twist out fast,
Right?

2253
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:44,367
I understand, sir.

2254
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:45,567
You must make every effort
To destroy your target

2255
01:39:45,634 --> 01:39:47,334
And then return,
Understand?

2256
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:52,234
I'm not eager to have any
Dead heroes on my hands.

2257
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,467
That's all.

2258
01:39:54,968 --> 01:39:56,133
Sergeant.

2259
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,100
Yes, sir.

2260
01:39:57,167 --> 01:39:58,400
Bring your book.
Get me a3.

2261
01:39:58,467 --> 01:39:59,868
Imagine that.

2262
01:39:59,934 --> 01:40:01,200
If that'd been
Me up there,

2263
01:40:01,267 --> 01:40:03,567
I'd have been sent to scotland
For the rest of my life.

2264
01:40:03,634 --> 01:40:06,133
That guy draws on the
Juiciest job in the outfit.

2265
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,033
A difference in character, I guess.

2266
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,634
He's got a pretty tough
Assignment, at that.

2267
01:40:09,701 --> 01:40:10,834
Well,
You got one, too.

2268
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:11,834
Me?

2269
01:40:11,901 --> 01:40:13,334
The boss wants to
See you, remember?

2270
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,801
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.

2271
01:40:36,934 --> 01:40:38,534
Go on in.
I'll wait out here.

2272
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,534
Come in.

2273
01:40:45,934 --> 01:40:47,367
Major sandidge
Reporting, sir.

2274
01:40:47,434 --> 01:40:49,334
At ease.

2275
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,834
Well?

2276
01:40:50,901 --> 01:40:53,801
Well, there isn't
Much to say, sir.

2277
01:40:53,868 --> 01:40:55,334
I didn't think
It would do any harm

2278
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,367
To put the kid
Through his paces.

2279
01:40:56,434 --> 01:40:57,934
That's not
The truth.

2280
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,667
You were
Jealous of him.

2281
01:40:59,734 --> 01:41:02,300
Why should I be
Jealous of him, sir?

2282
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:05,033
I'm a better flyer
Than he'll ever be.

2283
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,501
Sit down.

2284
01:41:07,567 --> 01:41:08,868
Yes, sir.

2285
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:14,367
I don't think
You really grasp

2286
01:41:14,434 --> 01:41:16,601
What our work is
All about up here.

2287
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:18,334
Oh, yes sir,
Sure I do.

2288
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,267
I know we're supposed to
Follow through with these men

2289
01:41:20,334 --> 01:41:22,567
And make better
Flyers out of them.

2290
01:41:22,634 --> 01:41:24,334
That's only
Part of it.

2291
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,834
I'm sorry it wasn't made
Clearer to you at the beginning.

2292
01:41:27,901 --> 01:41:30,267
It isn't just you
As an individual

2293
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,901
Helping your man
As an individual.

2294
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:35,300
It's all of us working
Together for the future.

2295
01:41:35,367 --> 01:41:37,467
Every man
That ever flew...

2296
01:41:39,367 --> 01:41:43,100
It's hard for me to put
It into words, sandidge,

2297
01:41:43,167 --> 01:41:45,267
If you don't
Feel it.

2298
01:41:45,334 --> 01:41:46,834
I think
I understand, sir.

2299
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:50,267
No, I don't think
You understand at all.

2300
01:41:50,334 --> 01:41:52,868
Let's put it this way.

2301
01:41:52,934 --> 01:41:57,367
Have you ever been up in
Your plane at night, alone,

2302
01:41:57,434 --> 01:42:02,267
Somewhere
- 20,000 feet above the ocean?

2303
01:42:02,334 --> 01:42:03,767
Yes, sir.

2304
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:05,801
Did you ever hear
Music up there?

2305
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:08,133
Perhaps.

2306
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,167
Oh.

2307
01:42:09,234 --> 01:42:11,133
If you've heard it,
You'll remember it.

2308
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,734
It's the music a man's
Spirit sings to his heart

2309
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:17,734
When the earth's
Far away

2310
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:20,834
And there isn't
Any more fear.

2311
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:25,634
It's the high, fine,
Beautiful sound

2312
01:42:25,701 --> 01:42:28,567
Of an earthbound creature who grew wings

2313
01:42:28,634 --> 01:42:31,000
And flew up high
And looked straight

2314
01:42:31,067 --> 01:42:32,934
Into the face
Of the future

2315
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,334
And caught just
For an instant

2316
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:40,934
The unbelievable vision of
A free man in a free world.

2317
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,834
If you haven't
Heard it,

2318
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:46,467
There's no way
I can talk to you.

2319
01:42:46,534 --> 01:42:47,968
I've heard it.

2320
01:42:48,033 --> 01:42:51,367
I have heard it,
Sir.

2321
01:42:51,434 --> 01:42:53,167
I used to try to
Explain it to some kids,

2322
01:42:53,234 --> 01:42:54,334
But I could
Never find words.

2323
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,334
Oh, children would understand. Sure.

2324
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,200
Because the future
Belongs to them.

2325
01:42:59,267 --> 01:43:01,334
They're already
Moving into it.

2326
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,634
They're going to climb
Out of the dust and muck

2327
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:07,534
And lift up their heads and see the sky.

2328
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:10,767
They're going to fly like
A generation of angels

2329
01:43:10,834 --> 01:43:13,534
Into the free air
And sunlight.

2330
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:15,133
Yeah, sure.

2331
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,501
Oh, children would
Always understand.

2332
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:20,734
Free as the air.

2333
01:43:20,801 --> 01:43:24,267
Men have said that ever since
They've crawled out of caves

2334
01:43:24,334 --> 01:43:26,334
And came down
From trees.

2335
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,367
That's what
We're fighting for,

2336
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:31,534
The freedom of the very air we breathe,

2337
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:35,267
The freedom of mankind
Rushing to greet the future

2338
01:43:35,334 --> 01:43:36,868
On wings.

2339
01:43:38,033 --> 01:43:39,267
Can you
Understand that?

2340
01:43:39,334 --> 01:43:41,133
Can you?

2341
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,634
Yes sir, I do.

2342
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:44,701
No man
Is really dead

2343
01:43:44,767 --> 01:43:47,567
Unless he breaks faith with the future.

2344
01:43:47,634 --> 01:43:49,067
And no man
Is really alive

2345
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:52,167
Unless he accepts his
Responsibility to it.

2346
01:43:52,234 --> 01:43:55,267
That's the chance we're giving you here,

2347
01:43:55,334 --> 01:43:58,701
The opportunity to
Pay off to the future,

2348
01:43:58,767 --> 01:44:01,634
What you owe for having
Been part of the past.

2349
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:03,100
It's just another
Way of saying,

2350
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:04,400
"I'm glad I lived.

2351
01:44:04,467 --> 01:44:06,067
"I'm glad
I was alive.

2352
01:44:06,133 --> 01:44:08,067
Now let me
Give you a hand."

2353
01:44:08,133 --> 01:44:11,300
You thought you were choosing
Between life and death

2354
01:44:11,367 --> 01:44:13,300
When you flew in
Over that carrier,

2355
01:44:13,367 --> 01:44:14,801
But you weren't.

2356
01:44:14,868 --> 01:44:18,033
You're choosing
Between 'em now.

2357
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,868
It's up to you,
Pete.

2358
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,300
If you please, sir,
I'd like to go back.

2359
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:25,067
I think I can
Do my job now.

2360
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:26,834
Very well.

2361
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:28,167
You may go.

2362
01:44:36,901 --> 01:44:38,267
Thank you, sir.

2363
01:45:05,701 --> 01:45:06,901
Dorinda.

2364
01:45:06,968 --> 01:45:10,534
Dorinda, I got
Something to tell you.

2365
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:11,834
I've been learning
A lot, Dorinda.

2366
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:14,901
I've learned that this
Thing that's going on

2367
01:45:14,968 --> 01:45:16,334
Is bigger than you and me.

2368
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,801
It's bigger
Than any of us.

2369
01:45:17,868 --> 01:45:19,300
We don't count,
Dorinda.

2370
01:45:19,367 --> 01:45:21,000
We're just nothing.

2371
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:25,434
And yet, if we do the
Job we're supposed to do,

2372
01:45:25,501 --> 01:45:26,934
We could be great people.

2373
01:45:31,267 --> 01:45:34,300
I wish you could hear what
I'm saying to you, Dorinda.

2374
01:45:34,367 --> 01:45:36,334
When I look at you now,

2375
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,501
I sure wish
I'd been different.

2376
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:41,467
Wish I'd told you
A lot of things

2377
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:45,601
That I thought of but I just
Couldn't find the words to say 'em.

2378
01:45:45,667 --> 01:45:46,968
Wish I'd told you
How cute your nose is

2379
01:45:47,033 --> 01:45:50,467
And how it turns up
At the end all of a sudden,

2380
01:45:50,534 --> 01:45:54,000
And how good
The smell of your hair is,

2381
01:45:54,067 --> 01:45:57,601
How your eyes
Light up when you laugh,

2382
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:59,367
And how you fit
Into my arms

2383
01:45:59,434 --> 01:46:01,000
Just as though
You belonged there.

2384
01:46:03,367 --> 01:46:04,767
But I didn't tell you.

2385
01:46:04,834 --> 01:46:06,501
It serves me right.

2386
01:46:08,868 --> 01:46:11,334
You know, this guy of yours
Is going on a dangerous job,

2387
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,100
As tough as they come.

2388
01:46:13,167 --> 01:46:14,467
And I just want
You to know

2389
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:15,868
That I'll bring
Him back, Dorinda.

2390
01:46:15,934 --> 01:46:19,267
He's going to be all right,
Dorinda. Don't worry about it.

2391
01:46:19,334 --> 01:46:21,934
Do you know what I'm
Really trying to tell you?

2392
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,300
I'm trying to
Tell you something

2393
01:46:23,367 --> 01:46:24,934
I never told
Anybody before.

2394
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,467
I love you.

2395
01:46:26,534 --> 01:46:27,701
I love you, Dorinda,
With all my heart,

2396
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:30,234
And I want you
To be happy.

2397
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,968
And if marrying this guy
Is gonna make you happy,

2398
01:46:32,033 --> 01:46:33,767
That's what I want.

2399
01:46:36,467 --> 01:46:37,968
I figure I'll hunt
Myself another assignment

2400
01:46:38,033 --> 01:46:40,334
If I pull this off,

2401
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,133
One that's not
So close to home.

2402
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:48,868
Good-bye, Dorinda.

2403
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:53,501
We'd have made
A great pair.

2404
01:47:09,234 --> 01:47:10,801
Hey. The door was open.

2405
01:47:10,868 --> 01:47:12,000
Pete!

2406
01:47:13,367 --> 01:47:14,300
Ted.

2407
01:47:14,367 --> 01:47:16,300
Dorinda, what is it?

2408
01:47:16,367 --> 01:47:19,167
Oh, nothing.
Nothing...

2409
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:21,400
I just wasn't expecting you, that's all.

2410
01:47:23,033 --> 01:47:24,934
I had a few minutes,

2411
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,133
So I thought I'd come by
And say good night to you.

2412
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,767
What is it, Dorinda.
What is it?

2413
01:47:35,834 --> 01:47:36,767
Ted...

2414
01:47:36,834 --> 01:47:37,801
Yes?

2415
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,300
I've got something
To tell you.

2416
01:47:40,367 --> 01:47:41,834
Go ahead.

2417
01:47:41,901 --> 01:47:44,767
I- I'm not going
To marry you.

2418
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:48,200
But what's
The matter?

2419
01:47:48,267 --> 01:47:49,834
I haven't been
Honest with you, ted.

2420
01:47:49,901 --> 01:47:52,167
I'm not in love
With you, ted.

2421
01:47:52,234 --> 01:47:54,534
I thought I was,
But I'm not.

2422
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:56,300
I'm in love with a guy
Named Pete sandidge.

2423
01:47:56,367 --> 01:47:57,334
Stop it, Dorinda.

2424
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh, yes, I am.

2425
01:47:59,067 --> 01:48:01,567
You're too nice
A person to fool, ted.

2426
01:48:01,634 --> 01:48:04,767
I just realized it,
About myself, I mean.

2427
01:48:04,834 --> 01:48:07,734
I guess when a woman loves
Once, she loves for keeps.

2428
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:09,234
Anyway, that's the way
It is with me.

2429
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:11,701
But he's dead,
Dorinda.

2430
01:48:11,767 --> 01:48:13,868
Oh, that doesn't make
Any difference, ted.

2431
01:48:13,934 --> 01:48:15,667
That was real love,

2432
01:48:15,734 --> 01:48:19,100
Like food and drink
And air and water.

2433
01:48:19,167 --> 01:48:20,734
There's no substitute.

2434
01:48:20,801 --> 01:48:22,300
You wouldn't want a
Substitute, would you?

2435
01:48:22,367 --> 01:48:24,033
Because then, you'd
Never have the real thing.

2436
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,834
You'd only have a
Cheap imitation, and...

2437
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,767
That would
Hurt us both.

2438
01:48:30,834 --> 01:48:32,834
You sure you mean
What you're saying?

2439
01:48:32,901 --> 01:48:35,100
Yes, ted,
I'm so sure,

2440
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:37,167
So sure.

2441
01:48:37,234 --> 01:48:38,767
I haven't got much time.
I have to go right now.

2442
01:48:38,834 --> 01:48:40,501
I wish I could stay
And talk with you.

2443
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:42,934
Oh, it wouldn't do any good,
Ted. Honest, it wouldn't.

2444
01:48:45,968 --> 01:48:47,467
Well...

2445
01:48:47,534 --> 01:48:50,534
If that's it,
That's it.

2446
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:52,834
It was too good
To be true, anyway.

2447
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:55,300
I really should
Have known better.

2448
01:48:55,367 --> 01:48:56,834
Good night, ted.

2449
01:48:56,901 --> 01:48:58,000
Bye, Dorinda.

2450
01:49:03,567 --> 01:49:05,300
Do you mind
If I hate Pete...

2451
01:49:05,367 --> 01:49:07,067
Just for a little while?

2452
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,934
Dorinda, I'm just on
My way to headquarters.

2453
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,868
I had to stop
And tell you something,

2454
01:49:40,934 --> 01:49:42,200
Something I think
You oughta know.

2455
01:49:42,267 --> 01:49:43,434
Oh? What?

2456
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:47,501
I've seen you take one
Awful hard jolt with Pete.

2457
01:49:47,567 --> 01:49:50,167
Well, I gotta fix you
For another one.

2458
01:49:50,234 --> 01:49:52,334
All right, al,
Go ahead.

2459
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:56,634
Well, ted's got himself a pretty
Tough job cut out for tonight.

2460
01:49:56,701 --> 01:49:58,067
A job like what?

2461
01:49:58,133 --> 01:50:00,167
Like blowing up
A jap ammunition dump.

2462
01:50:04,033 --> 01:50:05,834
What are
His chances, al?

2463
01:50:05,901 --> 01:50:08,968
Well, I...

2464
01:50:09,033 --> 01:50:11,634
No so good, Dorinda.

2465
01:50:11,701 --> 01:50:13,801
Where is this
Ammunition dump?

2466
01:50:13,868 --> 01:50:16,067
I can't tell you that.
You know that.

2467
01:50:16,133 --> 01:50:17,601
Military secret,
Huh?

2468
01:50:17,667 --> 01:50:18,567
That's right.

2469
01:50:18,634 --> 01:50:20,067
What do you mean,

2470
01:50:20,133 --> 01:50:22,634
Military secret between you and me, al?

2471
01:50:22,701 --> 01:50:24,033
You think I've been
Crisscrossing this country

2472
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,367
For the last
6 months

2473
01:50:25,434 --> 01:50:26,868
Without getting wise
To a thing or 2?

2474
01:50:26,934 --> 01:50:29,300
There are only 2 ammunition
Dumps that amount to anything.

2475
01:50:29,367 --> 01:50:31,868
One's at palibuk and
The other san laurentia.

2476
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:33,400
Palibuk's
The biggest.

2477
01:50:33,467 --> 01:50:34,968
That's the one,
Isn't it?

2478
01:50:36,968 --> 01:50:40,501
Al, you think ted has a
Chance of coming back alive?

2479
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:41,868
It could be done.

2480
01:50:41,934 --> 01:50:43,133
I'm going back
With you.

2481
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,167
Look, Dorinda...

2482
01:50:44,234 --> 01:50:45,400
I said I'm going
Back with you!

2483
01:50:45,467 --> 01:50:47,067
I've got to
Talk to ted!

2484
01:50:51,367 --> 01:50:52,868
We made it.
There's his ship.

2485
01:50:52,934 --> 01:50:54,567
Good. I'm glad.

2486
01:50:56,434 --> 01:50:58,167
They're in operations. You
Want to wait in my office?

2487
01:50:58,234 --> 01:50:59,901
No. No, you go on in.
I'll wait out here.

2488
01:50:59,968 --> 01:51:03,334
I guess you'd
Rather see him alone.

2489
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:06,767
Now, it's all clear
To you...

2490
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,234
Yes, sir.

2491
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,834
6 minutes.

2492
01:51:09,901 --> 01:51:11,634
Have a cup of coffee.

2493
01:52:01,367 --> 01:52:02,767
Hi, powerhouse!

2494
01:52:02,834 --> 01:52:03,801
Hi!

2495
01:52:03,868 --> 01:52:06,767
What are you
Doing here?

2496
01:52:06,834 --> 01:52:10,200
Just getting this flying bomb
Ready for that guy of yours.

2497
01:52:10,267 --> 01:52:12,601
Boy, I wish I were
Going on this trip.

2498
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:15,067
Maybe you will be.
Nails wants to see you.

2499
01:52:15,133 --> 01:52:16,567
He does?

2500
01:52:16,634 --> 01:52:18,801
Don't cut it.
I'll hold it for you.

2501
01:52:18,868 --> 01:52:20,234
All right.

2502
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:29,467
Keep 'em revved up!

2503
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:30,467
O.k.

2504
01:52:30,534 --> 01:52:32,367
And if they get hot,
Cut 'em.

2505
01:52:32,434 --> 01:52:33,634
Yeah.

2506
01:53:00,901 --> 01:53:01,734
Hey, Dorinda!

2507
01:53:01,801 --> 01:53:03,734
What's that?

2508
01:53:18,067 --> 01:53:19,868
Dorinda, I know what you're
Doing and you're wrong.

2509
01:53:19,934 --> 01:53:22,167
Ted and I could have
Pulled this job off.

2510
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:24,834
Turn around, Dorinda,
Turn around and go back.

2511
01:53:24,901 --> 01:53:26,300
Now, Dorinda, you've
Got to listen to me.

2512
01:53:26,367 --> 01:53:29,000
You've got to turn
Around. You can't do this!

2513
01:53:30,834 --> 01:53:32,834
Everything you're doing
Is against orders, Dorinda.

2514
01:53:32,901 --> 01:53:34,834
It doesn't make
Any sense!

2515
01:53:34,901 --> 01:53:36,334
Now look, Dorinda,

2516
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,200
I know you're
A great little flyer,

2517
01:53:38,267 --> 01:53:40,334
But you're not
A fighter pilot.

2518
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,000
You know, a lot more
Depends on this job

2519
01:53:42,067 --> 01:53:44,100
Than just blowing up
An ammunition dump!

2520
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:45,367
Suppose you don't
Make the grade?

2521
01:53:45,434 --> 01:53:46,968
Did you ever stop
To think of that?

2522
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:48,934
You'll tip off
The whole show!

2523
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,801
Guys hundreds of miles
From here will be dying

2524
01:53:50,868 --> 01:53:51,868
Just because
You got scared

2525
01:53:51,934 --> 01:53:54,601
And started running away from yourself.

2526
01:53:57,868 --> 01:54:00,033
Dorinda, you're throwing your
Life away trying to do a job

2527
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,634
That somebody else
Could have done.

2528
01:54:02,701 --> 01:54:04,133
You're throwing
Your life away

2529
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,000
Because you're afraid
To do your own job.

2530
01:54:06,067 --> 01:54:07,467
You're afraid of living.

2531
01:54:07,534 --> 01:54:09,067
You're afraid
Of life.

2532
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:10,534
And that's double-crossing
A lot of guys

2533
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:12,601
Who are out there
Fighting for it.

2534
01:54:12,667 --> 01:54:16,067
You can't do that,
Not my Dorinda.

2535
01:54:18,901 --> 01:54:21,167
Dorinda!
Dorinda, kick that rudder

2536
01:54:21,234 --> 01:54:23,033
And get this crate
Out of here!

2537
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:25,133
Dorinda, you've got
To hear me! Listen to me!

2538
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,734
Don't be
A pig-headed fool!

2539
01:54:27,868 --> 01:54:29,334
They've spotted us.

2540
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,334
All right, I'm right
Behind you, Dorinda.

2541
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,968
Open up that hot lead!

2542
01:54:39,133 --> 01:54:40,667
Now, Dorinda!

2543
01:54:47,334 --> 01:54:49,634
Come on, twist her out,
Dorinda, twist her out!

2544
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,667
Put her nose up
Into the moon!

2545
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,834
Now just settle back

2546
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:09,434
And let this little
Sweetheart take you home.

2547
01:55:14,133 --> 01:55:15,634
Got some dirt on your face
Again, didn't you?

2548
01:55:28,167 --> 01:55:29,501
That's better.

2549
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,801
Now just point
Her nose in the air

2550
01:55:32,868 --> 01:55:35,000
And climb straight
For heaven.

2551
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,567
Higher, Dorinda,

2552
01:55:43,634 --> 01:55:44,968
Higher.

2553
01:55:53,968 --> 01:55:54,901
Listen, Dorinda.

2554
01:55:59,934 --> 01:56:01,901
There it is.
You hear it?

2555
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,801
I can tell you now,
Dorinda.

2556
01:56:15,868 --> 01:56:18,267
I can tell you everything
I've ever wanted to tell you.

2557
01:56:20,968 --> 01:56:22,300
You're going back and you're gonna have

2558
01:56:22,367 --> 01:56:23,801
A swell life,
Dorinda.

2559
01:56:23,868 --> 01:56:25,801
You're gonna have
A wonderful life.

2560
01:56:25,868 --> 01:56:30,000
Everything's gonna seem
Prettier than it was before.

2561
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:32,934
The rain's gonna have a
Little more smell to it.

2562
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,400
The trees are gonna
Seem a little greener.

2563
01:56:36,467 --> 01:56:39,501
And the nights are gonna
Be all chock full of stars.

2564
01:56:41,234 --> 01:56:43,367
And when you go
To sleep, Dorinda,

2565
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:45,467
You're not gonna
Have any bad dreams.

2566
01:56:48,434 --> 01:56:51,968
And when that morning
Sunlight hits you in the face,

2567
01:56:52,033 --> 01:56:54,200
You're gonna
Wake up laughing.

2568
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,133
And what's more, you're
Going out with people,

2569
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,634
And you're gonna have all
The things that they have,

2570
01:57:00,701 --> 01:57:03,567
Including love.

2571
01:57:03,634 --> 01:57:05,501
You know, the only decent
Thing I ever did in my life

2572
01:57:05,567 --> 01:57:07,234
Was love you, Dorinda.

2573
01:57:08,667 --> 01:57:09,901
But if the memory
Of that love

2574
01:57:09,968 --> 01:57:12,133
Is gonna make you unhappy
All the rest of your life,

2575
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:15,434
There must have been
Something wrong with it.

2576
01:57:15,501 --> 01:57:16,801
It should've been
The kind that filled

2577
01:57:16,868 --> 01:57:18,801
Your heart
So full of love

2578
01:57:18,868 --> 01:57:20,300
That you just
Had to go out and find

2579
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,667
Someone to give it to.

2580
01:57:22,734 --> 01:57:26,133
That's the only real
Kind, isn't it, Dorinda?

2581
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:29,000
That's the only kind
That ever lives.

2582
01:57:32,534 --> 01:57:33,801
You know, I find
Myself wondering

2583
01:57:33,868 --> 01:57:36,100
What kind of kids
You two will have.

2584
01:57:37,434 --> 01:57:39,868
I'd like to talk
To those kids sometime.

2585
01:57:39,934 --> 01:57:42,434
I think I could
Tell 'em something.

2586
01:57:42,501 --> 01:57:44,834
I think I could tell them about life,

2587
01:57:44,901 --> 01:57:46,567
How good it is,

2588
01:57:46,634 --> 01:57:48,334
How good
It can be.

2589
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:52,234
And how the decent
Things in life never die.

2590
01:57:55,567 --> 01:57:57,834
And how the only kind
Of love worth having

2591
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:01,334
Is the kind that
Goes on living

2592
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:03,234
And laughing

2593
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,367
And fighting...

2594
01:58:06,434 --> 01:58:07,801
And loving.

2595
01:58:44,601 --> 01:58:46,033
There he is,
Dorinda.

2596
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:48,534
Go on.

2597
01:58:48,601 --> 01:58:50,367
I'm setting you free,
Dorinda.

2598
01:58:50,434 --> 01:58:52,834
I'm moving
Out of your heart.

2599
01:58:54,834 --> 01:58:56,067
Good-bye.

2600
01:58:58,467 --> 01:58:59,734
Good-bye,
Darling.

2601
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:13,601
That's my girl.

2602
01:59:14,901 --> 01:59:16,534
And that's my boy.
