180
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:18,785
Friday, August 25th, 1939,

181
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:23,353
3:00, in front
of the British Museum.

182
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,345
Like every Friday.

183
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,191
You never came.

184
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:33,108
I waited an hour,
and then I telephoned.

185
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,028
No answer.

186
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,545
I've never had an answer.

187
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:43,827
I had to go back to Libya.

188
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,666
You knew I had to go.

189
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,029
But why did you have to do it
that way, Jimmy?

190
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,706
Why did you have to run away?

191
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:52,190
Because I was afraid of you.

192
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,269
If I'd stayed...

193
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:55,389
If you stayed?

194
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:59,145
Jimmy, why didn't you stay?

195
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:07,793
So you married a Major.

196
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,513
So I married a Major.

197
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:12,583
Why?

198
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,862
I loved him.

199
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,272
David didn't run away.
He isn't a coward.

200
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,992
All men are cowards

201
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,752
in some things.

202
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,792
Let's dance.

203
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:30,106
Yes, it looks like it may be
just what we want.

204
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,912
When do they expect
to have it in service?

205
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:32,983
October, sir.

206
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,063
Fine.

207
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,065
Excuse me, will you?
Certainly, sir.

208
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:38,424
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a moment?

209
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:39,987
Of course. What is it?

210
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,712
I just wanted
to explain, sir,

211
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:44,265
in case you thought
I wasn't eager for action.

212
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,423
[chuckling]
Dear fellow,

213
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:47,152
I never had
the slightest doubt about it.

214
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,384
Go on, fall out.
I'll probably see you later.

215
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:50,873
Thank you, sir.

##[music playing]

218
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:40,385
Did you cure
the General's insomnia?

219
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:41,668
I beg your pardon?

220
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,382
By setting him right
on the birth rate of camels.

221
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,670
No time for jokes, Leith.

222
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,308
Oh.

223
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,347
Your permission to leave, sir.

224
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:56,503
Good night, sir.

225
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,433
Good night, Mrs. Brand.

226
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,742
Good night.

227
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:08,422
Anything the matter?

228
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:09,993
Mmm-mmm.

229
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,233
Want to go home?

230
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,349
Mmm-hmm.

231
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,143
Sorry about...

232
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:31,910
[airplane whirring]

233
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,666
Sorry about what?
Leith.

234
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:39,063
No manners at all.
Famous for it.

235
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:42,033
But I suppose one
must make allowances.

236
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:43,743
Yes.

237
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:46,623
Always.

238
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:00,382
Did you object to the way he
invited himself over tonight?

239
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:01,589
Did you mind?

240
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,904
But you invited him.
No, next corner here.

241
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:04,983
Oh.

242
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:08,032
So you didn't mind?

243
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,633
I thought so.

244
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,506
You didn't dance with me.

245
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,630
But David,
you didn't ask me to.

246
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,146
You never gave me a chance.

247
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:19,543
The moment he sat down,
you ignored me.

248
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,305
But aren't you being
a little silly, David?

249
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,703
I thought he was your friend.
I was only being polite.

250
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,307
Polite?
You call that polite?

251
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:28,505
You never took
your eyes off him.

252
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,630
The way he held you
when you danced.
I saw you.

253
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,023
Oh, but Jimmy...
Jimmy! You call him Jimmy?

254
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:34,593
Please, David.
You're hurting me.

255
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,073
How do you know
he's called Jimmy?

256
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:38,304
I heard you call him that.
That's not true.

257
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,789
I've never called him
anything but Leith.

258
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,668
If you knew
just how much
I needed you.

259
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,785
And now,
the first night
you are here...

260
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:48,311
Stop it, David!
You're hurting me!

261
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:52,429
Not bad, eh?

262
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,663
I can't take me eyes
off her.

263
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,028
Hey, Frenchie.
Eh?

264
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,464
How do you say
"chick" in <i>francais?</i>

265
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:02,344
Hey, boys,
look... look at that.

266
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:04,312
That's a smasher.

267
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,063
[men continue chattering]

268
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,466
[men laughing]

269
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,272
I'm sorry, Jane.

270
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,349
If I didn't care so much,
I wouldn't...

271
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,786
I can't help
being jealous.

272
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,262
Try, David.

273
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,942
Let's go home.

274
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,232
You want something?

275
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,270
The General
wants to see you.

276
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:04,628
Oh, really?

277
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,228
Sorry, darling. I'll be back
as soon as possible.

278
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,349
What is it, David?

279
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,549
Can't tell you now.

280
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:12,147
A little walk
in the desert.

281
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,225
You shouldn't joke
about it, Leith.

282
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,271
Especially when
you're staying behind.

283
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:18,265
I'm not so sure that I am.

284
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,543
Goodbye.

285
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,103
Good night.

286
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,422
Good night.

287
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,749
Mokrane!

288
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,233
[speaking Arabic]

289
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:05,827
[speaking Arabic]

290
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:08,510
I am very happy
to see you, sir.

291
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,312
It has been
long time.

292
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,146
It will be very good
to work with you again.

293
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,349
Thank you, sir.

294
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,833
[speaking Arabic]

295
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:19,429
Very good, Mokrane.

296
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,072
Very lucky
to have him with us.

297
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:22,667
You seem to know him
pretty well.

298
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,473
Oh, yes, I met him first
about five years ago.

299
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:28,353
First time I went to Libya.
We worked together.

300
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,583
Loyal?

301
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,709
A friend.

302
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,147
Oh, Michael?
Sir.

303
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,824
Start the briefing
right away, will you?
Very good, sir.

304
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:38,144
I want to see you two
for a moment.

305
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:47,704
Well, gentlemen,
I've decided
you're both indispensable.

306
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:49,387
So you're both going.

307
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:54,671
(Paterson)
Maj. Brand will be
in command, of course.

308
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,506
John Barton,
who, in my opinion,

309
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,664
is the best young
commando officer we've got,

310
00:19:58,754 --> 00:19:59,982
will also be with you.

311
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,587
These are your orders.

312
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:16,626
I need not remind you
that you'll be
entirely responsible

313
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,591
for the lives of 30 men.

314
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:20,867
They're all expendable.

315
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,228
All of us.

316
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,874
We don't expect you to do
anything inhuman, of course.

317
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,388
But we need those documents
from Benghazi.

318
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:29,590
We need them here,
right away.

319
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:31,987
I understand, sir.

320
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:33,863
All right, then.

321
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:34,943
Thank you, sir.

322
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,424
(Callander)
Two planes will drop you
in the desert,

323
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,153
three hours' march from
German HQ Benghazi.

324
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:55,071
Sgt. Evans of the Camel Corps
will meet you with your gear,

325
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:57,345
and you'll proceed
to rendezvous.

326
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,872
At 2305 hours,

327
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:02,184
Maj. Brand will
lead his attack.

328
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:04,825
At the same time,
Mr. Barton

329
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,667
will put in
his diversionary attack
from the north.

330
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:09,473
Barton, will you show me
on the model

331
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,465
the point from which
you'll make your attack?

332
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:14,513
From this direction, sir.

333
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,710
Good. Now remember:

334
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,985
if Maj. Brand is to succeed,

335
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:21,190
you must hold out
for 20 minutes.
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:22,707
Now carry on.

337
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:25,592
(Callander)
After the two groups have
accomplished their missions,

338
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:28,393
they will rendezvous
24 hours later at El Sidi.

339
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:30,430
They will then proceed
to Crown City,

340
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:34,104
where Sgt. Evans will be
waiting with the camels
to bring you back.

341
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,067
It will be a four days' ride.

342
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:40,631
Ok, tomorrow night
at 2300 hours, where
exactly will you be?

343
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,465
Right here, sir.

344
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,028
(Callander)
Good.

345
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,063
Any questions?

346
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,867
What happens, sir,
if the camels don't arrive?

347
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:57,989
We walk it.

348
00:21:58,074 --> 00:21:59,587
What, with my feet?

349
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:02,304
You'll have to carry me
on your back, sir.

350
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:03,793
Anything else?

351
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,232
All right, fall out.

352
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:10,307
And get some rest.
It may be a long journey.

353
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,583
Good night, sir.

354
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:16,789
Good night.

355
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,512
[speaking Arabic]

356
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:21,229
Good night, David.
Good night, sir.

357
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:22,588
(Callander)
Good night.

358
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:38,869
(guard)
Sorry, fellows,
you can't go out tonight.

359
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:39,989
[men clamoring]

360
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:41,632
(guard)
These are my orders.

361
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:44,103
(soldier)
I've got a date tonight.
Let's get out of here

362
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:46,545
I'm sorry, fellows.

363
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:48,873
[all shouting]

364
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,785
(Wilkins)
Well, whose orders
are they, then?

365
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,830
Orders of Maj. Brand, Wilkins.

366
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:56,111
Oh, it seems our Maj. Brand
doesn't like me, personally.

367
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:57,547
He likes
discipline, though.
Yeah.

368
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:00,148
The only thing
he ever slept with
is the book of rules.

369
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:01,349
Maj. Brand, please.

370
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:02,947
Who are you, please, ma'am?

371
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,865
I'm the book of rules.

372
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:06,863
Jimmy!

373
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:15,106
Is it true you're going?

374
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,263
Yes.

375
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,343
When?

376
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:18,822
In a few hours.

377
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,393
How long will it last?

378
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,544
Well, the survivors
should be back in a week.

379
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,908
Survivors?

380
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,710
Your husband's still here.

381
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:30,023
[door opening]

382
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:31,388
I don't want
to see him yet.

383
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:32,509
[door closing]

384
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:33,629
All right.

385
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,272
It's all so mixed up.

386
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:37,948
A year ago, I joined up
to be with David.

387
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,825
What if he doesn't come back?

388
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,746
Then he and I and you
will become a part of history.

389
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,267
Of its futility.

390
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:48,106
Don't talk to me
in riddles, Jimmy.

391
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,268
It's a long time
since I was in Libya.

392
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,551
The Romans built wonderful
cities in Libya, you know.

393
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,223
Dead bones
sticking out of the sand.

394
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,626
War rolled over them.

395
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:01,992
Be good
to see them again.

396
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,827
But you always seem
to prefer stones
to people.

397
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:07,510
You learn things
from stones.

398
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:08,947
What?

399
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:11,753
All that people have forgotten
in the centuries, and...

400
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,110
I seem to remember
that I was less than
a stone to you.

401
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:17,866
I loved you, Jimmy.

402
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,706
Better go in.
There isn't much time.
What can I say to him?

403
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:25,823
[door closes]

404
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:29,224
Tell him all the things
women have always said
to their men

405
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:30,633
before they go to the wars.

406
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:32,511
Tell him he's a hero.

407
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,945
Tell him he's a good man.

408
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,310
Tell him you'll be
waiting for him
when he comes back.

409
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:40,864
Tell him he'll
be making history.

410
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,950
[airplane whirring]

411
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:34,993
(Evans)
Sgt. Evans, sir.

412
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,065
Mr. Barton's plane
arrived an hour ago.

413
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,712
(Brand)
Very well.
Camels all right?

414
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,068
Oh, pretty healthy, sir.

415
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,352
We're relying on you,
Sgt. Evans.

416
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,907
They can't
pick us up by plane.

417
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:46,064
If you're not at Crown City
with those camels...

418
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,065
Don't worry sir.
We'll get you back all right.

419
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:50,509
Well, here's
your Arab clothing.
Thank you, Sergeant.

420
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:52,152
Your gear and provisions
you will find

421
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,270
at map reference 278225.

422
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,790
That's at the head
of the wadi,
the river bed,

423
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,751
27 km due east
of Benghazi.

424
00:25:58,834 --> 00:25:59,869
All right.

425
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:02,388
I'll have a man
watching for you, sir.
Thank you.

426
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,787
Synchronise watches.

He's early.

453
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:04,508
No, sir.

454
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,508

Hurry it up, Wilkins.

Can't rush it, sir.

Skilled labor.

All right. Start loading.

478
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,947
Assemble the others, Leith.
I've got them.

Just look at this.
The papers have been stolen!

488

Was he all right?

all right, sir.

00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,104
With your permission, sir,
I'll rejoin my group.

Thanks.
Thank you, sir.

504
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:07,671
I wanted to ask you
something, Leith.

505
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:08,948
Go ahead.

506
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,544
Why did you take over
with the sentry?

507
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:15,547
I've been wondering
when you'd ask me that.

508
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:17,307
Oh, you have?

509
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:19,026
What was the matter?

510
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,513
Couldn't you stand
the tension?

511
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:22,993
Couldn't you?

512
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:27,349
Is that what you're
going to tell them
back at headquarters?

513
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:28,503
What?

514
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,867
That I failed?

515
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:35,146
What happened tonight
has nothing to do with me.

516
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:36,952
That's between you...

517
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:38,863

that I was afraid?

Well, I wasn't.

522
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:01,027

00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:02,789
I was.

All right,

525
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,304

Yes, ok, sir.

526
00:39:14,314 --> 00:39:15,747

Oh!

537
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:26,148
We got here
a few minutes before you did.

538
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,065
Jerries didn't see us.
We saw them,

539
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:29,913
so we opened up
on them.

540
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:32,189
You know what
the instructions were.

541
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,344
We'll have all the patrols
in the desert on our tails.

542
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:35,913
We could have
taken care
of ourselves.

543
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,427
I'm sure
you could have, sir,

544
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:39,869
but we got the half-truck
with our first grenades...

545
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:41,910
I think
you lost your head.

546
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:43,673
Who's that?

547
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:49,273
[wind howling]

548
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:53,152
You hang on there,
Browning.
You'll be all right.

549
00:41:55,674 --> 00:41:57,471
Just my horrible luck.

550
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,708
[groaning]

551
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:04,509
[speaking German]

552
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:05,663
Lutze.

553
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:08,309
<i>Oberst Hans Lutze?</i>
<i>Jawohl.</i>

554
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:12,349
The man in charge
of the documents.

555
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:14,026
Good work, Barton.

556
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,105
Just the man
to help you
sort them out, sir?

557
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,071
Our patrols
will sort you out.

558
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:20,714
(Barton)
Seems a bit sulky,
doesn't he, sir?

559
00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:23,149
And he's probably right
about the patrols.

560
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:26,792
Colonel, you come with me.

561
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,744
Capt. Leith,
we have to go on.

562
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,745
You stay behind
with the wounded.

563
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,506
Casualty report, sir.

564
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:39,182
We lost Perkins
and Hunter.

565
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:40,502
Roberts very
badly wounded, sir.

566
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,710
Browning got a small chunk
taken out of his leg.

567
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,466
And the Germans?
They're all dead, sir,

568
00:42:44,554 --> 00:42:46,510
except the colonel here,
and one badly wounded.

569
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,266
Thank you,
Sergeant.
Sir.

570
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:53,543
Yes.

571
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:56,828
Yes, what?

572
00:42:57,714 --> 00:42:58,988
I'll stay.

573
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:01,190
Then take the men
you need.

574
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:02,463
Wilkins.

575
00:43:04,394 --> 00:43:05,986
Sgt. Dunnigan,

576
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:08,026
you'll stay
with Capt. Leith.

577
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:09,103
Sir.

578
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:11,270
With your knowledge
of the desert,

579
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:14,664
you should be able
to overtake us
before tomorrow night.

580
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:17,907
Barton,
fall in the men.

581
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,188
Yes, sir.

582
00:43:24,754 --> 00:43:25,903
[gasping]

583
00:43:28,114 --> 00:43:30,150
What are we going to do
about the two wounded men,
sir?

584
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:33,067
Maybe we could
rig up a stretcher
of some sort.

585
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:36,783
No.

586
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,789
They'd bleed to death
in an hour.

587
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,591
Anything
I can do for you?

588
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:52,471
Would you like
a cigarette?

589
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:56,747
[soldier groaning]

590
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,629
[mumbling]

591
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,312
Easy, easy, easy.

592
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:08,273
Try to take it easy.

593
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,753
What are you
going to do, guv?

594
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:11,267
Knock 'em off?

595
00:44:12,154 --> 00:44:14,429
I'm the one
for that job,
you know.

596
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,631
They're no good to you.

597
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,951
Stand in your way.

598
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:21,271
There's no
profit in it.

599
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:24,863
Why don't you let me
do it for you?

600
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:27,306
Follow the others.

601
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,863
Ah.

602
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:38,310
I'd like to stay here
with you, sir, if I may.

603
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:39,429
Follow the others!

604
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:40,503
Sir.

605
00:45:12,714 --> 00:45:14,033
All right, Jackie,
I'll take that.

606
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,832
I can manage.
Come on,
give it to me.

607
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,474
Thanks, Sergeant.
Aw, get along with you.

608
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:19,589
I still
don't get it.

609
00:45:19,674 --> 00:45:20,709
What?

610
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:21,988
Not waiting
for Leith.

611
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,190
Maybe he's trying
to lose him.

612
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:29,863
Maybe not.

613
00:45:29,954 --> 00:45:31,785
Training
for the postwar Olympics.

614
00:45:31,874 --> 00:45:33,546
I wonder
when that'll be.

615
00:46:17,794 --> 00:46:19,068
[groaning]

616
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:32,428

<i>Meine frau,</i>
<i>mein kind.</i>

625
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:42,828
We were so happy
before the war.

626
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:45,709
Help.

627
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,902
Help me.

628
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:54,989
No.

629
00:48:58,314 --> 00:49:00,066
No more war.

630
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,746
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

631
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:03,543
<i>Nein!</i>

632
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:06,783
[gun firing]

633
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,182
Hurry up.

634
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:25,993
Any family?

635
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:30,231
Don't drag things out.

636
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,025
Do what you've got to do.

637
00:49:34,594 --> 00:49:35,663
[groans]

638
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:37,507
But be quick about it.

639
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:41,666
You're a brave man.

640
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:53,066
[trigger clicking]

643
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:23,029
Damn you!

Let me down, damn it!

647
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,387
You're hurting me!

648
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,702
You coward!

649
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:20,227
[sobbing]
Leave me alone!

650
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:43,023
We have been watching you,
my friend.

651
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,108
He's dead.

652
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,027
[wind howling]

653
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,423
Yes.

654

[chuckling]

655
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:21,746
I kill the living,

656
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:24,466
and I save the dead.

657
00:52:30,474 --> 00:52:32,704
It's written
for everyone to die.

658
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:36,109
It makes no difference.

659
00:52:37,874 --> 00:52:38,863
Yes.

660
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:43,105
Except for that little matter
of when, and for what.

661
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:49,464
[airplane approaching]

662
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,783
German.

663
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:46,991
All right, Browning
let's have a look at it.

664
00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:48,348
Doesn't hurt much.

665
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:53,952
This is not a break.

666
00:53:56,674 --> 00:53:59,632
We have to reach the camels
as soon as possible.

667
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:01,666
If we don't
make an effort...

668
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:03,984
This little piggy
went to Benghazi,

669
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:07,149
and this little piggy
stayed home.

670
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:08,826
You sensible fella.

671
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:11,872
And this little piggy
had roast jerry.

672
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:14,514
Wilkins, don't you want
to reach the camels?

673
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,426
It's not me, sir, it's him.

674
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:22,473
[all laughing]

675
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:29,949
Get up.

676
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:32,507
I don't think
we can go on, sir.

677
00:54:32,594 --> 00:54:33,913
The men
are worn out.

678
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:35,905
It's none of your
business, Bob.

679
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:37,109
Get up!

680
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:39,752
Ask me nicely, Major.

681
00:54:44,994 --> 00:54:47,269
Death for death,
I'll take this one.

682
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:48,789
It's quicker.

683
00:54:48,874 --> 00:54:50,273
[gun cocking]

684
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:54,063
[gibbering]

685
00:54:54,154 --> 00:54:55,507
He's right off
his rocker.

686
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,630
He's gone farmy.
Nutty as a fruitcake.

687
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:00,274
Who is?
Wilkins or the Major?

688
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:03,632
Jimmy and Jane.
Jane and Jimmy.

689
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,227
Who's Jane and Jimmy?

690
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:07,350
(Wilkins)
Jane and Jimmy.
Jimmy and Jane.

691
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:10,312
[laughing maniacally]

692
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:13,224
[muttering]
Jane and Jimmy.
Jimmy...

693
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:21,027
Take a break.

694
00:55:26,754 --> 00:55:28,710
All right, let's take a look
at that leg now.

695
00:55:28,794 --> 00:55:31,706
Hadn't we better make sure
that Wilkins is all right?

696
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:33,513
He'll come out of it.

697
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,869
More than we will.
He always does.

698
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:37,632
All right, come on.

699
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:51,948
[gasping]

700
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:33,632
Yes, sir.
Fall in the men.

701
00:56:33,714 --> 00:56:34,863
Yes, sir.

702
00:56:34,954 --> 00:56:37,104
Come on, men.
Let's get moving.

703
00:57:34,274 --> 00:57:36,344
[wind blowing]

704
00:57:48,994 --> 00:57:50,393
Sergeant.
Yes?

705
00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:54,184
Why do they call it
Crown City?

706
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:55,946
It looks
like a crown.

707
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:58,143
Does it?

708
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,268
Yes. Why, it goes in and out.

709
00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:03,431
Tents and things.

710
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:05,392
Can't you see that?

711
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:06,509
No.

712
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:08,949
No. It looks like
Piccadilly Circus.

713
00:58:09,354 --> 00:58:11,709
Yeah.
If the camels
are there.

714
00:58:12,234 --> 00:58:13,553
Hmm.

715
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:19,312
Tired, Sergeant?

716
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:21,590
I'll be all right
for another five days, sir.

717
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:23,949
Soon as I get
my tablespoonful
of water.

718
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,063

00:59:08,634 --> 00:59:09,669
[whistles]

721
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:14,103
[whistles]

722
00:59:44,674 --> 00:59:46,790
I'm glad
someone isn't thirsty.

723
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:56,549
Evans.

724
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:00,428
It's Evans, sir.

725
01:00:01,314 --> 01:00:02,542
Where are the camels?

726
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:06,470
[footsteps approaching]

727
01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:57,102
Mokrane.

728
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:06,507
Capt. Leith.

729
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:21,388
(Barton)
It's Mokrane
and Capt. Leith, sir.

730
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:39,072
What happened to you?

731
01:01:42,234 --> 01:01:45,192
I had to hide
from a German plane
after you left.

732
01:01:45,474 --> 01:01:47,112
When that had gone,

733
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,188
you'd gone.

734
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:55,151
Mokrane knows
the desert.

735
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,186
Without him,
I'd probably
be dead, too.

736
01:01:57,274 --> 01:01:58,343
Too?

737
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:00,345
The wounded
you left me to kill.

738
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:02,231
I left you
to save them.

739
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:04,426
(Leith)
One man to save three?

740
01:02:04,514 --> 01:02:06,425
(Brand)
You should have waited.

741
01:02:08,314 --> 01:02:09,747
Barton.
Sir?

742
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:11,912
Detail a party
to bury those men.

743
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:12,983
Sir.

744
01:02:16,394 --> 01:02:18,430
Sergeant.
Yes, sir?

745
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:20,186
Get up a burial party,
will you?
Yes, sir.

746
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:22,185
Spicer, Anderson,
over here.

747
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:23,946
You broke the rules.

748
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,263
I know.

749
01:02:26,354 --> 01:02:27,673
It's inhuman.

750
01:02:27,754 --> 01:02:29,153
War's inhuman.

751
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:32,187
No good trying to shift
the responsibility.

752
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:35,187
What else have you been
doing all this week?

753
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:37,272
I have my orders.

754
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:41,743
What were your orders
about attacking
the sentry at Benghazi?

755
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:44,548
I've been in the army
for 13 years.

756
01:02:45,154 --> 01:02:48,351
I still find it very difficult
to kill a man in cold blood.

757
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:50,345
But not to arrange for him
to die by himself.

758
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,868
You said the wounded
hadn't a chance.

759
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:56,625
Without Mokrane,
I didn't have a chance.

760
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:59,551
You're imagining things.

761
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:02,947
That's exactly what I mean.

762
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:05,549
What?

763
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:07,306
You're running away again.

764
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:10,347
(Brand)
And you are running
into a court martial.

765
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:13,188
Capt. Leith, if you've
any complaints against me,

766
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:15,310
we'll take them up in Cairo.

767
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:24,064
I suppose there was
nothing else to do.

768
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:26,031
About the wounded,
I mean.

769
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,186
I broke the rules.

770
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:30,951
What would you
have done?

771
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:32,953
I don't know.

772
01:03:34,234 --> 01:03:36,748
I don't know enough
to break the rules.

773
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:38,863
Mmm.

774
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,673
You're lucky.

775
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:53,909
How many others?

776
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:54,983
The entire party.

777
01:03:55,074 --> 01:03:56,666
Evans, too,
I suppose.
Yes, sir.

778
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,183
Camels?

779
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,947
No sign of them.

780
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,149
I see.

781
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,792
Any trouble with Lutze?

782
01:04:19,914 --> 01:04:21,427
Not so far, sir.

783
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:27,265
This must've been
quite a city.

784
01:04:27,354 --> 01:04:28,673
I can't make it out.

785
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:30,949
Berber, I think.
10th century.

786
01:04:31,554 --> 01:04:35,069
Built, I suppose,
to protect themselves
from Arab invasions.

787
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,549
I'm not very good
in this period.

788
01:04:39,034 --> 01:04:41,070
Ah, it's too modern for me.

789
01:04:43,674 --> 01:04:45,232
Without camels...

790
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:49,463
how long do you think
it will take us
to reach headquarters?

791
01:04:49,754 --> 01:04:51,153
I hadn't thought about it.

792
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:55,263
[camel grunting]

793
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:02,744
Blimey, the camels are here.

794
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:05,384
What about that bloke
Mokrane, then?

795
01:05:05,474 --> 01:05:06,668
Come on!

796
01:05:07,114 --> 01:05:08,911
# The camels are coming,
hooray! Hooray! ##

797
01:05:08,994 --> 01:05:10,666
(soldiers)
Hooray! Let's go!

798
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:11,743
(soldier)
This is it.

799
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,153
[soldiers chattering]

800
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:16,146
[camel grunting]

801
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:18,031
Find any more?

802
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,991
[all chattering]

803
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:21,792
[soldiers yelling]

804
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:27,230
(Brand)
Load the documents on him.
Yes, sir.

805
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:29,464
Come on. Come on.

806
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:35,070
Leith, as soon
as the burial detail
is completed,

807
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:36,428
will you fall in the men?

808
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:39,153
We'll move out.
All right.

809
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:02,067
[bucket grating]

810
01:06:07,554 --> 01:06:08,907
Here we go.
It's coming up.

811
01:06:08,994 --> 01:06:10,029
[men chatting excitedly]

812
01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:11,149
(soldier)
He got some!

813
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:15,546
[soldiers chattering]

814
01:06:15,674 --> 01:06:17,266
It may be poisoned.

815
01:06:17,354 --> 01:06:18,707
Cheerful Charlie.

816
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:21,024
I don't mind a bit
of arsenic in mine.

817
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:22,593
(Leith)
Get back, Wilkins.

818
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:23,993
Mokrane knows his desert.

819
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:25,302
Get back!

820
01:06:27,394 --> 01:06:28,986
Yes, he knows
his jerries, too.

821
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:31,747
It's an old German trick,
poisoning wells.

822
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:35,553
How about letting him
take the first drink, sir?

823
01:06:35,714 --> 01:06:37,511
We do not poison wells.

824
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:40,190
Then it will be all right
to drink this, won't it?

825
01:06:40,274 --> 01:06:43,550
You'll take a Crown City
cocktail with us, won't you?

826
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,904
With or without
a cherry, jerry?

827
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:47,825
I tell you, we do not
poison wells.

828
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:48,903
Who is poisoning wells?

829
01:06:49,194 --> 01:06:52,709
(Barton)
Mokrane's afraid the Germans
may have poisoned the well.

830
01:06:58,954 --> 01:07:01,514
So, suddenly,
nobody's thirsty anymore.

831
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,666
[sloshing]

832
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:35,223
[coughs]

833
01:07:36,794 --> 01:07:38,785
This water is not poisoned.

834
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:42,265
It's too soon
to tell yet.

835
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:43,868
Mmm-hmm.

836
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:47,672
Come and get it.

837
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:50,348
[speaking German]

838
01:07:51,794 --> 01:07:53,750
Are you disappointed, Jimmy?

839
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:57,349
Would you be happier
if the poison were
burning out my guts?

840
01:07:57,434 --> 01:07:59,743
Why did you drink
the water, Brand?

841
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:03,150
Was it to make yourself a hero
in front of the German?

842
01:08:03,794 --> 01:08:05,830
We may be missing
an officer.

843
01:08:11,274 --> 01:08:12,627
Drink, sir?

844
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:18,713
Thank you, no.

845
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:31,832
Well, I could fall in.

846
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:05,706
What's so funny?
Hmm?

847
01:09:06,954 --> 01:09:08,910
Courage.
What about it?

848
01:09:09,914 --> 01:09:13,224
It's odd
that you had the courage
to drink that water,

849
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:15,544
but you didn't have
the courage to
kill the sentry,

850
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:17,545
and you don't have
the courage to kill me.

851
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:18,953
Why should I
want to kill you?

852
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:20,387
Because I...

853
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:23,225
I saw the truth of you.

854
01:09:24,434 --> 01:09:26,072
I wasn't afraid.
Yes, you were.

855
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:28,190
You were afraid to go in
and kill with your bare hands.

856
01:09:28,274 --> 01:09:31,152
That's what makes a soldier
and destroys you as a man.

857
01:09:32,274 --> 01:09:33,548
War is not murder.

858
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:34,908
[laughing]

859
01:09:35,394 --> 01:09:37,305
Brand, you're wonderful.

860
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:41,753
You have the Christian decency
that forbids killing
a dying man,

861
01:09:41,914 --> 01:09:44,382
but approves the work
of the sharpshooter.

862
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:46,226
Well, war is killing.

863
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:47,667
[laughing]

864
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:49,746
Better and better!

865
01:09:49,994 --> 01:09:53,953
So the fine line
between war and murder
is distance.

866
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:55,946
Anybody can kill
at a distance,

867
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:58,628
with the same sort of courage
that a man shoots rabbits.

868
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:01,626
But when it comes
to the dirty work, you have
to call in the civilian.

869
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:03,705
What are you
trying to say?

870
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:07,623
That I despise you
for the professional
coward that you are.

871
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:10,633
You left me in the desert
so there wouldn't be
any witnesses left

872
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:13,148
to the real Maj. Brand,
didn't you?

873
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,906
Therefore, my death
becomes essential to you.

874
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:20,469
I'm a kind of mirror
of your own weakness.

875
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,990
And it's unbearable,
isn't it?

876
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:27,268
Are you trying
to goad me
into killing you?

877
01:10:27,354 --> 01:10:28,389
[sighs]

878
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,589
Perhaps.

879
01:10:31,114 --> 01:10:32,149
Why?

880
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:34,832
Perhaps, because...

881
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,902
I haven't the courage
to do it myself.

882
01:10:49,554 --> 01:10:50,873
Nice work, eh, Brand?

883
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:53,184
Approved killing
from an approved distance.

884
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:55,105
They were the Arabs
you saw

885
01:10:55,194 --> 01:10:58,311
at the water hole
with the jerry.
Weren't they, sir?

886
01:10:58,794 --> 01:11:01,103
Of course, they were.
You sure?

887
01:13:23,554 --> 01:13:24,782
What's the matter, sir?

888
01:13:24,874 --> 01:13:27,069
Scorpion! Kill it! Kill it!

889
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:31,353
Look at his leg.
It's all right.

890
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,186
Where's the kit?
Yes, sir right here.

891
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:35,868
[men chattering]
Of course, he won't die.

892
01:13:39,034 --> 01:13:40,433
Here, drink.

893
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:43,513
Huh!

894
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:50,263
Here.

895
01:13:58,874 --> 01:13:59,863
Ah!

896
01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:03,629
[groans]

897
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:05,432
(soldier #1)
Blimey! A gent with guts.

898
01:14:05,514 --> 01:14:06,469
(soldier #2)
Knock it off.

899
01:14:06,554 --> 01:14:07,907
[groans]

900
01:14:10,754 --> 01:14:11,789
[groans]

901
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:20,468
[panting]

902
01:14:21,114 --> 01:14:22,945
There's nothing
in the kit for this?

903
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:26,788
(Brand)
It wasn't foreseen
in regulations.

904
01:14:27,594 --> 01:14:29,027
It may help you.
If it gets worse,

905
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,467
we can always
put you on a camel.

906
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:33,626
(Wilkins)
Then who'll carry the water
and the documents? Eh?

907
01:14:33,714 --> 01:14:34,908
(Barney)
Exactly.

908
01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:41,147
[groaning]

909
01:14:43,234 --> 01:14:45,111
[camel grunting]

910
01:14:46,474 --> 01:14:47,668
Mokrane!

911
01:15:00,274 --> 01:15:02,105
You want to kill me, too?

912
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,790
Ammonia. I should have
thought of that.

913
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:13,593
Finest medicine chest
in the desert is a camel.

914
01:15:13,674 --> 01:15:15,505
It could save him, sir.

915
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,266
You call it saving?

916
01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:26,952
[groaning]

917
01:15:30,554 --> 01:15:32,306
Pity about the camel.

918
01:15:32,474 --> 01:15:35,432
Might have saved one of us,
mightn't it, Major?

919
01:15:41,474 --> 01:15:43,192
Now we have to go on.

920
01:15:45,194 --> 01:15:48,152
Divide the water
and the documents
among yourselves.

921
01:15:48,234 --> 01:15:50,702
Yes sir.
Come on.

922
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:05,269
Ah!

923
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:08,792
[coughing]

924
01:16:21,554 --> 01:16:22,987
Barton, fall in the men.

925
01:16:23,074 --> 01:16:24,063
Yes, sir.

926
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,066
Come on, men. Fall in.

927
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,748
(Barton)
All right, sir?
I'll give you a hand.

928
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,583
(Barton)
Here you are, Barney.
That's fine.

929
01:16:54,954 --> 01:16:56,751
(Barton)
Come on, then.
All right, sir.

930
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:58,313
I've got him.

931
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:00,225
(Barton)
Wilkins and I'll
look after him, sir.

932
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:02,986
All right.

933
01:17:45,314 --> 01:17:46,906
Captain doesn't look
too good, does he?

934
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:48,393
No, he doesn't, poor devil.

935
01:17:48,474 --> 01:17:49,509
Everything all right?
Yeah.

936
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:51,391
Don't see anything?
No.

937
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:53,430
Keep your eyes open.
Yeah.

938
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:56,074
I could do with some sleep.
Aye. So could I.

939
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,552
Maj. Brand.

940
01:18:58,554 --> 01:18:59,748
Mokrane?

941
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:01,828
What's the matter?

942
01:19:01,914 --> 01:19:03,666
I'm going to kill you.

943
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,674
I know you saw the...

944
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,223
[groaning]

945
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:11,545
[gun firing]

946
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:21,672
He tried to kill me.

947
01:19:28,634 --> 01:19:30,511
Is it that easy to kill?

948
01:19:57,954 --> 01:20:00,673
I'm afraid Capt. Leith
is pretty bad, sir.

949
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,073
Can he walk?

950
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:03,667
I don't think so.

951
01:20:03,994 --> 01:20:06,064
Barney's afraid
it's gangrene.

952
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,269
(Brand)
If we left him
half our water...

953
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:50,267
And he has a gun.

954
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:55,824
To shoot himself with
when he runs out of water?

955
01:20:57,634 --> 01:20:59,590
This is from my orders:

956
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:04,794
"You must not be captured
by the enemy.

957
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,065
"If it endangers your mission,

958
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,668
you are not obliged
to save the wounded."

959
01:21:10,754 --> 01:21:13,507
But that's...
That's not war, sir.

960
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:15,502
Isn't it?

961
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:21,583
I'll stay
with Capt. Leith, sir.

962
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:23,229
No.

963
01:21:25,354 --> 01:21:26,946
I can't spare you.

964
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:38,592
I'm sorry, James.

965
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:43,113
But I hoped you would feel
more fit today.

966
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,990
Prepare to move, Sergeant.

967
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:54,142
Yes, sir.

968
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:58,192
Is there anything
I can do for you, sir?

969
01:21:58,274 --> 01:22:00,993
Take over, Mr. Barton.
Get the men started.

970
01:22:01,394 --> 01:22:03,589
I have to talk
to Capt. Leith.

971
01:22:03,714 --> 01:22:05,113
But, sir l... I...

972
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:06,991
Take over, Mr. Barton.

973
01:22:23,114 --> 01:22:25,469
We're all murderers now,
aren't we?

974
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,386
Welcome to the club.

975
01:22:28,514 --> 01:22:30,345
Don't be a fool, Leith.

976
01:22:30,474 --> 01:22:32,624
I want to get you
out of this if I can.

977
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,942
So I see.

978
01:22:36,594 --> 01:22:39,825
I wonder
if you have the courage
to finish me off now.

979
01:22:41,314 --> 01:22:43,350
You said you wanted to die.

980
01:22:43,554 --> 01:22:44,703
Did I?

981
01:22:45,554 --> 01:22:47,988
(Brand)
Whatever I did,
you drove me to it,

982
01:22:48,474 --> 01:22:50,783
with your
insinuations
about Jane.

983
01:22:51,954 --> 01:22:53,945
Your insinuations.

984
01:22:54,634 --> 01:22:55,908
Not mine.

985
01:22:57,794 --> 01:22:59,910
You're not the sort of man,
Brand, who'd...

986
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:02,904
who'd kill for his woman.

987
01:23:05,474 --> 01:23:06,873
But you'd...

988
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:10,268
murder...

989
01:23:11,474 --> 01:23:15,069
to stop her from finding out
that you're a coward,
wouldn't you?

990
01:23:15,154 --> 01:23:18,464
Brand, the returning hero.

991
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,103
The stuffed dummy...

992
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:25,464
with the medal on his chest.

993
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:28,710
And all the witnesses dead.

994
01:23:30,314 --> 01:23:31,747
Mokrane dead.

995
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:33,863
Leith.

996
01:23:37,194 --> 01:23:39,071
My veins full of poison.

997
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:41,982
You're...

998
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:44,185
You... you're not a man, Brand.

999
01:23:45,034 --> 01:23:46,023
You're...

1000
01:23:48,754 --> 01:23:50,984
You're an empty uniform,

1001
01:23:52,314 --> 01:23:55,112
starched by authority,

1002
01:23:55,194 --> 01:23:58,345
so that it can stand up
by itself.

1003
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:01,186
But I'm standing.

1004
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:04,189
Yes. Yes.

1005
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,267
You're right.

1006
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,272
You know, Brand,

1007
01:24:12,754 --> 01:24:14,233
for the first time,

1008
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,423
I almost have
some respect for you.

1009
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,106
You'd better go now.

1010
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:26,867
You'll miss the column.

1011
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:36,465
Is there anyone to notify?

1012
01:24:47,514 --> 01:24:48,947
Mrs. Brand.

1013
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,027
Any message?

1014
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:00,150
Tell her she was right

1015
01:25:01,154 --> 01:25:02,712
and I was wrong.

1016
01:25:04,394 --> 01:25:06,305
And ask her to

1017
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:08,993
to forgive me.

1018
01:25:10,114 --> 01:25:11,229
[wind howling]

1019
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:12,429
Now,

1020
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:16,432
if you haven't got
the courage to kill me,

1021
01:25:18,674 --> 01:25:20,426
don't try to save me.

1022
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:23,663
Huh!

1023
01:25:26,474 --> 01:25:28,942
[wind howling]

1024
01:25:38,074 --> 01:25:40,463
(Leith)
Stop! You'll walk
to your death!

1025
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:44,345
(Brand)
Don't you try to save me.

1026
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:49,863
I contradict myself.

1027
01:25:51,274 --> 01:25:56,029
I always contradict myself.

1028
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:01,952
Dig in!

1029
01:26:03,674 --> 01:26:06,188
Can we hold out?
How much longer will it last?

1030
01:26:06,554 --> 01:26:09,352
Ghibli can blow 24 hours, sir.
Or minutes.

1031
01:26:09,674 --> 01:26:11,710
Leith and Brand,
we've got to get back to them.

1032
01:26:11,794 --> 01:26:14,024
We can't, sir.
Unless this lifts.

1033
01:26:16,994 --> 01:26:18,905
[wind howling]

1034
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:08,584
The ghibli must've killed him.

1035
01:27:22,994 --> 01:27:25,189
Wilkins.
Here, take this.

1036
01:27:54,354 --> 01:27:55,867
There they are.

1037
01:28:08,354 --> 01:28:10,663
...my lucky man!

1038
01:28:10,754 --> 01:28:12,551
[all yelling]

1039
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:29,233
[all cheering]

1040
01:29:09,074 --> 01:29:10,905
Barton, Barney, come on.

1041
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:12,188
Sir.

1042
01:29:12,274 --> 01:29:13,548
(soldier)
What happened?

1043
01:29:13,634 --> 01:29:14,987
(Barney)
Oh, no.

1044
01:29:16,034 --> 01:29:18,070
[soldiers chattering]

1045
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:05,227
[door opening]

1046
01:30:08,234 --> 01:30:09,269
Sir.

1047
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:12,147
Ah, Mrs. Brand.
I'm glad you're here.
I've just had some news.

1048
01:30:12,234 --> 01:30:14,509
Eight men and two officers
are on their way back.

1049
01:30:14,594 --> 01:30:16,073
Which officers?

1050
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,429
I beg your pardon?
Which officers?

1051
01:30:18,994 --> 01:30:20,268
We don't know yet,
I'm afraid.

1052
01:30:20,354 --> 01:30:21,833
(Paterson)
Michael.
Coming, sir.

1053
01:30:21,914 --> 01:30:24,474
Excuse me. The General's
waiting for me.

1054
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:27,143
(Paterson)
Any news?

1055
01:30:27,234 --> 01:30:29,145
(Callander)
I'm afraid not.
Still the same numbers.

1056
01:30:29,234 --> 01:30:30,428
Eight men and two officers.

1057
01:30:30,514 --> 01:30:31,708
I wish I knew
who they were.

1058
01:30:31,794 --> 01:30:33,944
(Paterson)
You send an operation
out like that,

1059
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:36,707
you expect casualties.
I'm prepared to accept that.

1060
01:30:36,794 --> 01:30:38,671
[inaudible conversation]

1061
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:49,384
(soldier)
Hey! The group from Benghazi!

1062
01:31:00,674 --> 01:31:02,312
[soldiers cheering]

1063
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:11,823
Hello, Brand.
I'm glad to see you got back.

1064
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,826
Will you bring your stuff
into the office, right away?

1065
01:31:14,914 --> 01:31:17,382
The General's waiting
for your report.

1066
01:31:57,674 --> 01:31:59,471
David! I'm glad
to see you back.

1067
01:31:59,554 --> 01:32:01,863
Well done. Splendid,
splendid show.

1068
01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:13,907
Start on these
right away, will you?
Yes, sir.

1069
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:21,669
I hope what we've brought back
is of some help, sir.
So do I.

1070
01:32:26,834 --> 01:32:29,109
May I ask your permission
to leave for a few minutes?

1071
01:32:29,194 --> 01:32:30,229
What?

1072
01:32:31,874 --> 01:32:32,989
Oh, yes.

1073
01:32:33,074 --> 01:32:35,542
Yes, of course.
Don't go away, though.

1074
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:37,830
I want to see the men
with you.

1075
01:32:37,954 --> 01:32:39,387
Thank you, sir.

1076
01:32:42,754 --> 01:32:44,790
It's good to have
you home, dear.

1077
01:32:44,874 --> 01:32:46,387
I'm proud of you.

1078
01:32:48,634 --> 01:32:51,068
[men chattering]

1079
01:32:58,194 --> 01:33:00,708
I suppose you'd like to know
what happened to Leith.

1080
01:33:00,794 --> 01:33:01,783
Yes.

1081
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:08,071
[chattering]

1082
01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:13,590
The men think I killed him.

1083
01:33:16,474 --> 01:33:17,702
Did you?

1084
01:33:18,874 --> 01:33:21,593
I wanted to save him,
but it was too late.

1085
01:33:48,634 --> 01:33:50,113
Anything else?

1086
01:34:07,594 --> 01:34:10,825
Just before the ghibli
struck us, he was saying:

1087
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:14,427
"Tell Jane..."

1088
01:34:14,514 --> 01:34:16,664
And then the wind
drowned him out.

1089
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:20,185
I suppose he
would have said:

1090
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,265
"Tell Jane I love her."

1091
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:29,067
Those would have been
my last words, too.

1092
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,873
(Paterson)
Where is the hero of Benghazi?

1093
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:43,069
[soldiers muttering]

1094
01:34:47,674 --> 01:34:50,063
(Wilkins)
Here he comes.
Here he comes, the old man.

1095
01:34:52,194 --> 01:34:53,422
(soldier)
Attention.

1096
01:34:53,514 --> 01:34:55,948
First, may I
congratulate you.
All of you.

1097
01:34:57,554 --> 01:34:59,863
From what I've seen
of the stuff
you brought back,

1098
01:34:59,954 --> 01:35:02,070
I think I can assure you
that Gen. Rommel

1099
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,872
is shortly going
to find himself

1100
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:06,024
in a very delicate situation.

1101
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:08,668
And I have the authority
and pleasure

1102
01:35:08,874 --> 01:35:11,672
to award to the man
who led you,
Maj. David Brand,

1103
01:35:12,394 --> 01:35:14,624
the Distinguished
Service Order.

1104
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:36,310
Those who did not come back,

1105
01:35:36,914 --> 01:35:38,791
when I write
to their families,

1106
01:35:38,874 --> 01:35:42,184
I will do my best
to tell them
exactly what happened.

1107
01:35:43,594 --> 01:35:46,904
May I say how proud I am
to have had you all
under my command

1108
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,746
for this operation.

1109
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:50,906
That's all, I think.

1110
01:35:50,994 --> 01:35:53,303
Fall out. Get some rest.

1111
01:36:08,634 --> 01:36:10,306
[soldiers muttering]
