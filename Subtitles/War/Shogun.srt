684
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:49,819
You're the pilot now. Ha, ha-- Ooh.

685
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,198
A person could think
that was funny.

686
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:59,328
You're supposed to be the prisoner.
You could be taking us anywhere.

687
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,540
But you, you wouldn't do that.

688
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,918
If they were taking me
to lshido's castle,

689
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:08,212
I wouldn't sail them there.

690
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:11,549
Ishido? I thought they were
taking me to Toranaga.

691
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:16,220
So they are. Except that
Toranaga's in Osaka Castle,

692
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:21,684
and Osaka Castle belongs to lshido.
And what a butcher he is.

693
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:26,355
Hell, they all are. Everything
in this country's upside down.

694
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:31,527
- What are you steering?
- South by southwest.

695
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,237
How did you know?
Who told you?

696
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,573
- You did.
- Me?

697
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,075
[CHUCKLES]

698
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:40,244
Madonna, it's all in a haze.

699
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,580
You looked in my rutter!

01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,957
[BOTH LAUGHING]

701
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,880
Ah, inglés, life is so strange.

702
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,259
And if I live,
it is by the grace of God,

703
01:31:56,052 --> 01:32:00,681
helped by a heretic
and a Jap man.

704
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:04,060
There's the sod-eating sama.

705
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:06,437
I'd better go and thank him.

706
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:11,484
You're a dangerous man, inglés.

707
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:14,278
Maybe we'd all be better off
if they killed you.

708
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:46,394
<i>NARRATOR". Osaka,
the white castle city of Lord lshido.</i>

709

<i>An escort of 2O samurai

710
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:09,292
<i>wearing the brown uniform
of Toranaga's army,</i>

711

[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

714
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:00,009
Now, inglés,
it's Toranaga's fifth son.

715
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,803
[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

716
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:08,559
That should keep him happy.
Come on.

717
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,314
Now what's the matter?

718
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,150
[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]

719
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,405
You're staying onboard, inglés.

720
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,201
- Why?
- It wouldn't do any good to ask.

721
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,954
When Toranaga's ready,
you'll find out.

722
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:36,921
<i>Go with God, inglés.</i>

723
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:39,590
And you.
