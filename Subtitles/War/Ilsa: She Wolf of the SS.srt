1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,428
The film you are about to see is based
on documented facts.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,268
The atrocities shown were performed
as "medical experiments" -

3
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:17,778
-In special camps in the Third Reich.
The crimes are historically accurate-

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,990
-But the film's characters are compos
of several notorious Nazis.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,952
They showed the events were collected
to a place of dramatic account.

6
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:33,587
Because of the shocking subject
father movie is only for adults.

7
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:40,760
The film is dedicated to the hope of
that these atrocities never happen again.

8
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,109
- Yes!
- No, not yet!

9
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,939
No, please! No!

10
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:11,969
You would have expected.

11
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,600
The weather today will be mostly fine.

12
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:07,809
In the north, it gets a little chilly
and it becomes essentially clear.

13
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:10,152
It's time to go now.

14
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:13,107
Go where?

15
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:17,328
Heading south, we have temperatures ...

16
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,826
- With them.
-Get dressed!

17
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:29,340
- Ilsa, you promised ...
-What did you call me?

18
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:35,174
Ilsa. I mean commandant.
Fräulein doctor.

19
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:37,555
It was better.

20
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,932
Much better.

21
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:52,104
You said I'd never
return to camp before.

22
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,109
It would not be the same, you say!

23
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:59,364
- Yes ...
-Why there for me?

24
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:05,488
You had the honor
to lie with a German woman.

25
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:12,128
An SS officer. You, a laborer,
belonging to an inferior race!

26
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,042
- Do you dare to challenge me?
I say nothing, commandant.

27
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,969
That is true.

28
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:23,383
Let me stay here with you.
I give you great pleasure.

29
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,893
- Like an animal in heat!
No, as a lover.

30
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:30,972
You bastard! How dare you
say that word to me?

31
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,773
But last night promised you ...

32
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,528
That you would not return
to camp before.

33
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,571
It was everything I promised.

34
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,321
Bring him.

35
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:07,009
When a prisoner has slept with me-

36
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:10,513
- Is he never with a woman.

37
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,648
If he survives
he remembers only the pain from the knife.

38
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:20,860
- Knife?
-As castrate you.

39
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,277
No!

40
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,034
- Begin!
No, commandant.

41
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,285
No! No, Commander!

42
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:35,251
No! No, Commander! No!

43
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,013
I will finish it.

44
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:58,601
There is a doctor Baum in Berlin.

45
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:06,276
He believes that the inferior races
proves their inferiority-

46
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,328
-With a certain body part.

47
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,238
Can you guess which body part?

48
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,907
It makes a man a man.

49
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,618
The doctor has a collection-

50
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:22,004
-That proves his theory and ...

51
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,499
Your ... will be send-

52
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,551
-To him.

53
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,182
No!

54
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:45,517
You see, little man.
I have kept my promise.

55
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:49,689
You see again never camp again.

56
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:27,603
- How many this time?
-15.

57
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,646
Get out, quick!

58
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:34,525
Down!

59
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,121
Get out, bitch! Quick!

60
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,789
Out with you! Fort now!

61
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,170
Forward!

62
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:51,422
Stand up!

63
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:59,721
- They expect miracles in five days.
-Someone has to say that is too many.

64
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,937
Our research is important
than their sterilization.

65
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:07,565
Deon is most important in all camps.
Every job is different.

66
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:09,733
It is significant.

67
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:17,027
You need not be afraid.

68
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:21,028
This is not Dachau,
no Ravensbruck.

69
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:25,413
We are doctors and will help you.

70
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:32,248
Your stay with us will be brief, but
you father a chance to serve the Third Reich.

71
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:37,668
It is your destiny.
Welcome to Camp 9!

72
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,681
This way, girls. Harat!

73
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,600
Then we start.

74
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,701
746.

75
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:08,539
Come, my child.

76
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:16,670
- Remove clothing. We do not see.
I am ashamed.

77
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:21,297
Shame?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

78
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:26,681
We need you to know
what work we'll give you.

79
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,392
We are doctors.

80
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:36,986
- How old are you, friend?
-18, Fräulein doctor.

81
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,654
18?

82
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,323
- Excellent
Thanks, fräulein doctor.

83
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,828
332.

84
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:02,753
Commandant?

85
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:08,302
- Have you decided?
I do not know ...

86
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:14,306
- Hardly labor, huh?
-I am strong.

87
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:19,065
I can work with whatever you want
and is not afraid to take in.

88
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,196
It's good. Great.

89
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:28,616
Stop! You were not allowed to go.

90
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,864
- I thought ...
-You think you can not, you obey.

91
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:34,499
Do you understand?

92
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,998
- Yes, what then?
-Yes ...

93
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,669
... Fräulein doctor.

94
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:45,341
For you it will be that door.

95
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,510
Next!

96
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,468
977.

97
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,612
894.

98
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,528
444.

99
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:22,409
- Go, go!
-Fräulein doctor ...

100
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,539
- What do those women with?
-What?

101
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:31,088
- Those who enter there.
-They will be retrained.

102
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:35,016
To earn the Third Reich soldiers.

103
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,971
- And I?
-You will earn kingdom otherwise.

104
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,442
You will help our medical research
and thereby saving thousands of lives.

105
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,983
Right.

106
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,156
What is your name?

107
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,286
Rosette, fräulein doctor.

108
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,120
Rosette?

109
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,663
I will not forget it.

110
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,119
You there! Do you hear what I'm saying?

111
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,915
- Come on!
No. ...

112
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:12,506
You will when I tell you.

113
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,608
No! Stop it!

114
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,319
Let me be!

115
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,126
You must obey orders! Do you understand?
Or would you like more tea?

116
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,671
Give the bitch to me.

117
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,591
I'll shave her so close to skin-

118
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:02,214
-That the blood flowing.

119
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,514
- Leave her alone!
I'll teach her!

120
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:09,971
No, she gets their lesson last night.

121
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:15,229
Tonight she will work in the guardhouse.

122
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:23,286
Our research is too important.
I implore you to inspect it.

123
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,581
General, if I replace the procedure now-

124
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:33,248
-Delayed all our experiments.

125
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,125
General, our discoveries will
change the outcome of the war.

126
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,929
Yes, General.

127
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,889
Yes, mein General.

128
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:57,356
That was good news.

129
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:02,732
Then the general judge it yourself.

130
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,274
And, General, I ...

131
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,116
I conducts its own research

132
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,789
-That probably interests you most.

133
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,879
Thank you, General.

134
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,469
Heil Hitler.

135
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:51,697
- Hello.
-Welcome. My name is Kala.

136
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:53,574
This is Irene.

137
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,222
Get out!

138
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,230
Get out!

139
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,149
Quick!

140
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,980
Quick!

141
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,607
Achtung!

142
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,565
Achtung, commandant.

143
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:02,270
- You are blond.
I was born in Germany.

144
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,647
- Addressing the commandant with respect!
He learns, sergeant, he learns.

145
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:14,702
- Are you German?
I am American, commandant.

146
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:19,532
American? Why are not you
in a POW camp?

147
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:23,788
I read in Germany
when my country declared war.

148
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:28,458
- I have been in camp since.
-Your Country? You are German!

149
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:31,633
There was I not over, commandant.

150
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,014
Take them.

151
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:39,474
- I'm ready.
-Cruising!

152
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,239
Quick!

153
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:15,292
Dr. Baum will be very pleased.

154
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:23,387
And you call yourselves men?

155
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:29,389
I see no manhood
between your legs.

156
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:35,278
You, the oäkte German!

157
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,821
It is clearly visible
that your blood is tainted.

158
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:45,119
This is not a real Aryans built.

159
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:48,409
Size is not everything, commandant.

160
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,958
Does not it?

161
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:54,582
We'll see.

162
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,593
I have only one thing to add.

163
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:08,304
Inmates found to
to speak with patients becoming whipped.

164
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,142
Even the woman.

165
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:16,646
- Why all sleep?
They've been infected with the bacteria.

166
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:20,444
Typhoid, tetanus, rabies.

167
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,699
All known fatal diseases.

168
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:30,906
- Leaving the them there to die?
No, that would be too merciful.

169
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:35,711
- They develop experimental drugs.
-Medicaments ...

170
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:40,921
- Do they work? Fines of them?
-If they were to die of the disease ...

171
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:45,589
... They had died with less pain.

172
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,798
And you, Kala ... What did they give you?

173
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,512
Syphilis.

174
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,772
The only question is when I will die.

175
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:03,565
God can not help one here.
He has forgotten this place.

176
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,123
- The third?
-Yes.

177
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,962
- No changes?
-Only the pulse, commandant.

178
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,963
Berlin laughed at my theory.

179
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,346
Soon I'll give them
documented evidence.

180
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,929
- Then they laugh no more.
-They do not want to believe it.

181
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,559
No, they're men.

182
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:42,108
It is unthinkable for them
that a carefully trained woman-

183
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,149
-Withstand more pain than any man.

184
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,865
- What is this camp?
What it is?

185
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,167
- Gateway to Hell.
-What do they do with all women?

186
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,717
The sterilized
and then sent to the field brothels.

187
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,053
- Oh my God!
-They might be lucky.

188
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,435
- Lucky?
-Yes. There are others.

189
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:24,099
The selected few.
They are taken by the commandant.

190
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,903
- Why?
I do not know.

191
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,116
She has a room in his home.
No one knows what she is doing there.

192
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,744
But the women never return.
Though soon it will not matter.

193
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:42,582
- How can you say so?
-Because, my friend ...

194
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:48,036
You get enough of their own problems.

195
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:52,506
Problems? We are well here
just to work, huh?

196
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,466
No.

197
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,924
That time will-

198
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,638
-When Black Widow sends after you.

199
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:21,239
Castrated? Why?

200
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:26,122
Maybe it's her way
to punish the man-

201
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:29,664
-That makes her
to feel as a woman-

202
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,544
-But that nevertheless still
her thirst for more. Who knows?

203
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:38,888
Only one thing is certain:
when he has served her-

204
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:42,012
-He is out of that one.

205
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:44,225
You too?

206
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:50,645
- Yes, I had her one night.
-Mario ...

207
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,772
It is better
to live as half-man of the moment.

208
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,733
Why?

209
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,901
In order to get revenge.

210
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:05,742
I live only for revenge.

211
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,500
It may come sooner than you think.

212
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:19,171
- What do you mean?
-The Allies approaching fast.

213
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:24,840
- How fast? When will they?
I do not know. But soon, Mario.

214
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,761
I've been waiting for weeks.

215
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,680
I can wait even longer.

216
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,066
Until my time comes.

217
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,568
Mario ...

218
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:48,110
- Cut her out of your ...
-No.

219
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,042
It had ...

220
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:57,379
Destroyed ... Dr. Baum's theory.

221
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,222
Up!

222
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,682
Why?

223
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:57,016
Have you already forgotten, sweetheart?

224
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,764
Where are you taking me?

225
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:03,610
You will be working in the night.

226
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,822
- The guard barracks.
-No.

227
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:12,700
- Please, no!
It's too late to repent.

228
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:17,196
Get up!

229
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:23,043
- Heil Hitler!
-Heil.

230
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:27,425
Commandant, a worker has just
caught talking to a girl.

231
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:32,133
- What area is she in?
Sterilizers, commandant.

232
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:38,725
- Excellent. You can go.
-Commandant's special room?

233
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,201
- You!
-Good.

234
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:18,383
You are not like pigs
they usually send to us.

235
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:22,468
You are different.
So warm, so smooth.

236
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:29,146
Are you a tigress?
Do you resisting?

237
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:31,735
You have to kill me first!

238
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:36,023
Hardly.
Save your strength, dear.

239
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,001
Doctor ...

240
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:58,510
We are both from Poland. We talked
if every country - no more.

241
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:05,968
You are strong. Stronger than he.

242
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:10,598
- Help me, doctor.
-You have to help yourself.

243
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,279
Begin!

244
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:06,756
For them and hang them up.

245
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:10,720
It discourages the other pigs.
When you finished ...

246
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,926
Download American to me.

247
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,373
You are so strong.

248
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,045
So though.

249
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,338
You are beautiful.

250
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,672
I need you.

251
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:43,679
I need to feel you in me.

252
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:55,818
I will satisfy you.

253
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,945
Empty promises ...

254
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:02,122
Attention, Alert-

255
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,912
There is a red alert.
Hostile flight ...

256
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:11,505
I will satisfy you
until you beg me to stop.

257
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,297
Do it then.

258
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:16,979
Interference harder!

259
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:22,737
Not now! No!

260
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,411
Now!

261
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,136
Harder!

262
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:50,641
Makes me ill!

263
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:57,817
Now!

264
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:00,986
Not yet.

265
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:03,154
Not yet.

266
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:31,391
Attention!
Red preparedness is now called off.

267
00:32:31,672 --> 00:32:37,140
There is now a blue alert.
We resume broadcasts.

268
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:44,230
We continue with a selection of music
the Kingdom's finest ...

269
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:57,197
Not more!

270
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,748
Oh no ...

271
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,214
Please.

272
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:11,634
You are made of iron.

273
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:10,606
Oh my God. Did you kill her?

274
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:12,733
No.

275
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,067
You see ...

276
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:21,368
When I hit puberty, I noticed
something that separated me from the other guys.

277
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,249
Something that made me unique, I guess.

278
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,085
Outstanding.

279
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,248
What? What was it?

280
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:33,713
It is very simple.

281
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:38,045
I discovered that I can
hold back as long as I want.

282
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:43,010
I can still.
All night if necessary.

283
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,848
You could call me a freak of nature.

284
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,396
A kind of human-machine

285
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:55,238
-Who can set the controls
pa "fast," "slower" ...

286
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,857
... Or "never."

287
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,367
Oh my God.

288
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,487
Want to know something?

289
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:12,379
Never switch made her
almost insane.

290
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,853
Never.

291
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:34,685
Never! I do not use
like an animal.

292
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,901
Help us Kala.
There must be a way to accommodate.

293
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:42,030
You guys are crazy.

294
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:45,781
But the guards are so few.

295
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,411
Why would they need more?

296
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,831
This is a world of crippled,
broken women.

297
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:56,250
They have lost their strength-

298
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,463
And their dignity.

299
00:35:58,704 --> 00:36:02,465
- There's nothing to do.
-Then we must take over the camp.

300
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,551
Before it becomes our turn.
It was the only chance.

301
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,298
- An uprising?
-Yes.

302
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:12,516
They crush us like flies.

303
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:19,102
No. Rosette is right.
It would be the last thing they expect.

304
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:24,864
- Anna, most can barely walk.
But we can.

305
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:28,274
Until they start on you.

306
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:31,247
We still have some where on us.

307
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,497
You need help.

308
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:35,745
By whom?

309
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,787
The workers.

310
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:42,585
They move everywhere in the camp.
Only they can help us.

311
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,396
In the evening, Mario. It is very important.

312
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,399
Achtung!

313
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:20,203
The next few days
you should go through a series of tests.

314
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:24,583
They show everything we need to know
if your bodies-

315
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,340
-Before you have to participate
the research project.

316
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:33,010
I advise you to cooperate fully.

317
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,642
If you refuse to make diet
you will be punished severely.

318
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:43,688
It was one of you experienced at night.

319
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:49,610
You are here to serve the Third Reich.

320
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:54,327
It is your sole function.

321
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,865
Begin.

322
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:59,779
- Please, go. They see you.
-Can you make it?

323
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,113
- Yes. Join now.
What's your name?

324
00:40:02,396 --> 00:40:05,326
- Rosette.
My name Wolfe.

325
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:08,449
I know that.

326
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,685
Up!

327
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,349
- No, the commandant. I have pain.
-Evil?

328
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,484
You do not know what evil is.
But we'll show you.

329
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:42,150
Go!

330
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,205
Please commandant. Please.

331
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:56,287
Spread your legs.
Do I need to say to everyone.

332
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,310
Go!

333
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:18,689
- We have much to learn from them, Bintz.
Yes, mein commandant.

334
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,153
So there is the strong?

335
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:33,950
Pain then? Are you afraid of pain?

336
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:38,619
Who does not, commandant?

337
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,544
We'll see.

338
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:08,190
De: is clear. Go!

339
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:25,586
I think
that we have found the right one, Bintz.

340
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:28,585
The one we've been waiting for.

341
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:57,029
6000m, commandant.

342
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:03,824
Luftwaffe may owe a lot to us.

343
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:11,919
It's been 50 minutes;
commandant.

344
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:17,970
Reduce pressure by five pounds.

345
00:43:58,874 --> 00:44:04,129
- How hot is it now?
-82 Degrees, mein Ketel.

346
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:08,929
- And for how long?
-Ten minutes.

347
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:14,850
- And her values?
-Absolutely no change.

348
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:17,399
Then we have to move on.

349
00:44:17,684 --> 00:44:20,981
- Increase by five degrees.
-Five? But ...

350
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:26,237
Our soldiers are dying in the inferno
to be burning tanks.

351
00:44:27,652 --> 00:44:32,373
It is for their sake we do it.
For the Motherland.

352
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,330
Five degrees.

353
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,189
No one can perform for you.

354
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:59,069
No.

355
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:04,197
- Do you think it was a dream?
I do not know.

356
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:08,661
You have to prove it to them.

357
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,450
- How about you?
'I SGI' on.

358
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:14,745
I must know the truth.

359
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:30,817
Mario ...

360
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:35,994
This is Anna.

361
00:46:36,943 --> 00:46:38,496
Anna.

362
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:41,408
And Rosette.

363
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,784
- Rosette.
-Hey.

364
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:53,421
Kala ...

365
00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:25,765
I will!

366
00:49:01,498 --> 00:49:05,970
The map is just a rough,
but you have to learn it by heart.

367
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:13,307
Now you, my beautiful commandant.

368
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:18,519
- This time it will be different.
-Say.

369
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:24,491
Take off your clothes. I want you to undress
When I sit and look at you.

370
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,492
No!

371
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,239
Slowly.

372
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:34,829
Show yourself to me - slowly.

373
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,038
Slowly.

374
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:55,783
You are beautiful, Ilsa.

375
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:29,901
Hello! Hitler!

376
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:33,945
I must go now,
but whenever you need me ...

377
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:39,530
When victory is ours, we do children.

378
00:51:42,028 --> 00:51:44,413
They are beautiful.

379
00:51:45,865 --> 00:51:48,166
And strong.

380
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,141
- They are determined.
Who is their leader?

381
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:08,771
- The new - Anna.
-Yes.

382
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:13,527
I said they can die as cattle.
I warned them.

383
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,321
Maybe not.

384
00:52:16,811 --> 00:52:19,196
Thank you, General.

385
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:23,031
Heil Hitler!

386
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:32,956
He will most certainly.
The General himself.

387
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:35,873
He has promised - finally.

388
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:42,506
Now he'll see for himself
all the work we do here.

389
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:45,636
And how important it here.

390
00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:51,263
And my own forskninog ...
He'll see it too.

391
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:58,066
Every day that we're wasting on
not daring to do so-

392
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:02,148
-Us closer to that room.

393
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:05,702
I can not wait for the butcher's knife.

394
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:08,370
Mario will find a solution.

395
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:11,033
If you do not help me-

396
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:15,754
-I hold myself at night,
over the fence there!

397
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:23,209
- Really?
She did not mean it, commandant.

398
00:53:26,795 --> 00:53:31,350
I'm going to say
that General Waldeck come here-

399
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:35,311
And hear you
encourage people to accommodate.

400
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,108
Nothing to say?

401
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,609
You think I'm stupid?!

402
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,624
- Ingrid ...
Yes, commandant?

403
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:58,667
- The punishment for escape attempts?
-But she ...

404
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:00,540
Quiet!

405
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:06,459
A prisoner convicted of that offense
to be flogged to death before the whole camp.

406
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:12,011
- I'm not afraid.
-Good.

407
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,185
Great.

408
00:54:15,134 --> 00:54:18,515
It is better to die than ...

409
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:22,025
I'm not going
punish you that way.

410
00:54:22,349 --> 00:54:24,733
No ...

411
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:28,031
I have something special in store for you.

412
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:35,326
You are so brave,
you fear nothing ...

413
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:39,168
But we'll see?

414
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:42,662
We'll see ...

415
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:46,211
And General ... shall see.

416
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:10,191
It is said that fear of pain
is greater than the pain itself.

417
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,411
Do you know what this is?

418
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:31,627
Sure looks harmless?

419
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:38,387
What happens if I put it on fire?

420
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,851
Then maybe ...

421
00:55:42,468 --> 00:55:46,228
... It becomes something completely different, right?

422
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,991
Not as harmless anymore, huh?

423
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,286
Reply when I'm talking to you!

424
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,250
Do you still feel nothing?

425
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:22,305
But soon it will burn deep within you.

426
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:26,138
It consumes you.

427
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:29,976
It distorts your meat.

428
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,381
- Does she not sent for you?
-No.

429
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:07,429
- Why not? O
She's well else to think about.

430
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,485
She must be cracked.

431
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,613
No one can so much pain.

432
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,781
That's more than four hours now.

433
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,660
Only she can prove my theory.

434
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:38,331
Why?
No screams. Not even a sound.

435
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:47,556
Take her back to her hut.

436
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:50,055
Her barracks, commander?

437
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:53,266
She'll be back later.

438
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,523
But first ...

439
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,443
First, I want everyone to see her.

440
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:05,024
It serves as a warning.

441
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:21,794
- We have so little tig for preparation.
-The girls have so little time.

442
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:25,334
Some have less than that.

443
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:36,307
How much more can she?

444
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:48,127
Up! Quick!

445
00:59:49,664 --> 00:59:51,336
No ...

446
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:10,945
You think you can hold out.
You are wrong.

447
01:00:14,354 --> 01:00:16,656
You will be screaming for mercy.

448
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,613
You beg me to stop.

449
01:00:22,153 --> 01:00:23,909
I'd rather die.

450
01:00:29,494 --> 01:00:30,965
More!

451
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,718
More! The bitch should feel it.

452
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:03,579
- Irene, Kala - this is Wolfe.
-Hey.

453
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:05,581
Hello.

454
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:14,332
This is what I learned today ...

455
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:20,680
Here is the big gate and sentry box.
This switch must be killed first.

456
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:23,802
- He's here?
I'll take care of him.

457
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,971
- What's this?
-Guards' barracks.

458
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:30,686
- We still need weapons, Wolfe.
-We leave them.

459
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:34,599
- When? O
-The morning after the General Act.

460
01:02:09,423 --> 01:02:12,353
- You know what you should do?
-Yes.

461
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:15,017
You!

462
01:02:16,388 --> 01:02:17,978
You, American!

463
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,152
Come on!

464
01:02:29,901 --> 01:02:33,080
- You talked.
No, commandant.

465
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,581
You helped the bitch.

466
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:43,255
- Do not look at me like that.
I can not be lazy to remember.

467
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:48,470
In the evening - when the general sleeping.
If you come to me?

468
01:02:49,337 --> 01:02:52,931
- Yes.
-Will it be like before?

469
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:56,806
Better, commandant.

470
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:37,058
Achtung! Heil Hitler!

471
01:03:43,973 --> 01:03:47,270
Welcome to Camp 9, General.

472
01:03:47,518 --> 01:03:51,195
A pleasure to meet fräulein major.

473
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:55,787
The reports on your charm
and your beauty was not excessive.

474
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:59,491
- The General is too friendly.
-Not at all.

475
01:03:59,696 --> 01:04:03,373
May I introduce
my adjutant Captain Richter.

476
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:07,959
- Commandant.
-Well, sir ... What have you to show us?

477
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:22,056
Wait here.

478
01:04:34,813 --> 01:04:40,330
I have very much liked to see
General my experiments.

479
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:56,507
- Do you use no nakors?
Ger-man experimental caviar?

480
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,901
But five there, General, is too short a time.

481
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:20,737
It's war, fräulein major.
We all have to sacrifice something.

482
01:05:22,484 --> 01:05:24,453
Yes, General.

483
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:52,267
And these ...

484
01:05:53,055 --> 01:05:55,309
... Masks-

485
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,824
-Has been infected with a new strain typhoid?

486
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:05,111
Yes, General.

487
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:09,616
So she gets ...

488
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:13,208
Vector ...?

489
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:20,416
In two weeks she rubs it all
and everyone she comes in contact with.

490
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:24,337
Gott im Himmel!

491
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,473
You can destroy an army!

492
01:06:39,683 --> 01:06:43,277
The wound is infected with gangrene reply.

493
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,607
Gas gangrene?

494
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:48,699
It kills many brave men.

495
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:52,112
Soon, not for long.

496
01:06:53,363 --> 01:06:56,043
Have you discovered an antidote?

497
01:06:56,407 --> 01:06:59,291
We see many encouraging signs.

498
01:07:00,704 --> 01:07:03,752
It's only a matter of time.

499
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:06,293
Verdammt! Time ...

500
01:07:08,086 --> 01:07:11,549
It is always a matter of time.

501
01:07:21,681 --> 01:07:25,738
And now, General,
my own private experiments.

502
01:07:26,186 --> 01:07:29,568
You will
find it very interesting.

503
01:08:01,804 --> 01:08:07,605
For three nights, general,
and all that without a single scream.

504
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,654
No man had endured such a pain.

505
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:15,118
She proves everything in my theory.

506
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:18,823
Not just everything, fräulein major.

507
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:23,871
This is a camp
for medical research.

508
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:29,498
You must not waste time Germany
on your private projects.

509
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,793
- But ...
-Momentl

510
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:42,642
- Could not you break her?
We tried everything.

511
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:44,729
It seems so.

512
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:52,775
Well. I will present your evidence
for Reichsführer itself.

513
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:57,525
Now we just get women
on hazardous items.

514
01:08:57,941 --> 01:09:00,029
But if you are right ...

515
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,915
Thank you, General.

516
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:04,323
Macht nichts.

517
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:11,122
Tonight we
a special surprise for you.

518
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:15,167
Then there will be two surprises.

519
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,927
Because I have one for you too.

520
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:25,182
Achtung!

521
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:47,956
Remarkably.

522
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:50,585
Remarkable!

523
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:57,507
But her legs ... They are so cool.

524
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:01,597
- As marble.
-Yes.

525
01:10:12,888 --> 01:10:15,142
Looking forward, General.

526
01:10:23,649 --> 01:10:25,535
When we eat ...

527
01:10:27,736 --> 01:10:29,622
Exactly.

528
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:34,128
I thought it would amuse you.

529
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:48,343
Lovely! Lovely!

530
01:10:49,841 --> 01:10:52,521
Cold pain or destruction!

531
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:45,231
In reich Führer Heinrich Himmler
name I give you this order.

532
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,488
Reichsführerns is cross-

533
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:52,078
-The highest award
that can be given to someone in the SS.

534
01:11:52,276 --> 01:11:57,709
Reichsführer shows hereby
its recognition and praise-

535
01:11:57,906 --> 01:12:00,374
-The great dedication you have shown in-

536
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:03,125
-In the service of the Third Reich.

537
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,675
Heil Hitler!

538
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:40,574
- Sends her after you?
She said that.

539
01:12:41,614 --> 01:12:43,168
Oh, Wolfe ...

540
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:48,425
- I'm so scared.
-I know.

541
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:56,011
And you with her ...
I do not think about stuff like that.

542
01:12:56,254 --> 01:12:58,508
Rosette, listen to me.

543
01:12:59,465 --> 01:13:03,308
Just think about tomorrow
and what must be done.

544
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:06,274
Nothing more. Okay?

545
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,567
Yes, Wolfe.

546
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:12,030
And after that ... freedom.

547
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:15,073
Free hot?

548
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,525
- With you?
-Yes.

549
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:38,215
That's not a workbench!

550
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:12,220
Me first!

551
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,608
Then all of you!

552
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:30,701
It was an unforgettable evening.
Cheers!

553
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:38,750
It was a pleasure to have the general here.

554
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:43,715
We leave here tomorrow morning.

555
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,426
Shortly after dawn.

556
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,050
So early?

557
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,559
Duty first.

558
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:58,639
Of course, General.
-But no ceremonies.

559
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:02,893
I only go when I'm done.

560
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,400
Can I help further the general?

561
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,700
Yes ...

562
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,792
No. No!

563
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,836
Not coat.

564
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:27,749
Just pants.

565
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:54,744
The briefs also.

566
01:16:56,735 --> 01:16:58,241
Yes ...

567
01:17:08,288 --> 01:17:09,878
The boots ...

568
01:17:10,749 --> 01:17:12,588
Put them on again.

569
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:27,525
Fraulein Ilsa ...

570
01:17:32,436 --> 01:17:34,358
Do you understand?

571
01:17:37,149 --> 01:17:39,997
You are like a blonde ...

572
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:42,409
... Goddess.

573
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:47,705
Mother Earth for all of us.

574
01:17:59,128 --> 01:18:00,932
For me ...

575
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:05,893
... Is only one way.

576
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:11,271
One way to pleasure.

577
01:18:13,392 --> 01:18:15,527
Do you understand?

578
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:19,866
Come on, please.

579
01:18:22,192 --> 01:18:23,864
Come on.

580
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:30,665
I love you!

581
01:18:36,957 --> 01:18:38,926
You have to ...

582
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,466
Now.

583
01:18:43,296 --> 01:18:45,383
"On the
meadow!

584
01:19:04,316 --> 01:19:05,574
Wolfe?

585
01:19:28,673 --> 01:19:30,476
But, commandant ...

586
01:19:30,717 --> 01:19:33,765
Get him.
I need a real man.

587
01:19:34,053 --> 01:19:37,351
This is Radio Deutschland
nation voting ends for Tonight.

588
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:54,447
-Damn!
-Yes!

589
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,901
Reports from our enemy
distort the truth-

590
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:32,867
-In an attempt plumt
to force our people to surrender.

591
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:36,498
- Do not believe these lies.
-Different?

592
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:39,374
Yes, Ilsa.

593
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:42,626
Everything we've done before ...

594
01:20:43,244 --> 01:20:45,249
All enjoyment.

595
01:20:45,663 --> 01:20:50,468
All ecstasy.
It will be forgotten.

596
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,889
Show me how. Show me!

597
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,392
Your socks, Ilsa.

598
01:20:58,134 --> 01:21:00,898
Go get your silk stockings.

599
01:21:02,263 --> 01:21:05,312
... Developed a new fighter.

600
01:21:05,516 --> 01:21:11,282
Heinke 162 reaches
to speeds of 1000 km / h.

601
01:21:12,064 --> 01:21:15,278
These planes may soon be in-

602
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:21,617
And then add the enemy
yet another devastating blow.

603
01:21:22,574 --> 01:21:27,462
- We continue; with ...
-Lie on the bed, Ilsa.

604
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:30,884
No, Ilsa!

605
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:35,797
- I thought ...
-I asked you not to think!

606
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:38,886
I ordered you
to lie on the bed.

607
01:21:39,131 --> 01:21:41,433
Do as I say, Ilsa.

608
01:21:50,017 --> 01:21:51,987
Out with arms and legs now.

609
01:22:05,407 --> 01:22:07,246
Fort. Quick!

610
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:10,454
No, not fast, Ilsa.

611
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:13,876
Slowly, step by step.

612
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,763
First wrists. Then the feet.

613
01:22:20,589 --> 01:22:23,934
Hard, Ilsa. It has to be tight.

614
01:22:24,801 --> 01:22:27,387
Only then can you be my slave.

615
01:22:28,054 --> 01:22:30,273
My love slave.

616
01:22:30,848 --> 01:22:34,479
- I am your slave.
-It would not you?

617
01:22:34,685 --> 01:22:36,571
Yes ...

618
01:22:39,898 --> 01:22:42,283
You are trying to escape from me-

619
01:22:43,026 --> 01:22:45,612
-But you will find no protection.

620
01:22:50,034 --> 01:22:54,375
- Soon, soon.
-Pray for mercy.

621
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:57,250
Ask me quit.

622
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:06,760
Do you feel the ecstasy, Ilsa?

623
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:10,146
- Should I hurt you?
-Oh, yes.

624
01:23:10,761 --> 01:23:13,893
Makes me sick. Was Cruel.

625
01:23:14,264 --> 01:23:16,316
Be Cruel!

626
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:59,144
- What are you doing?
-Ensures that you will not loose.

627
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:02,737
I'm ready now.

628
01:24:03,854 --> 01:24:05,444
Good.

629
01:24:29,754 --> 01:24:33,550
Attention!
There is now a red alert.

630
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:37,557
I'll be back.

631
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:51,278
- You did not stay so long now.
That's right.

632
01:24:51,942 --> 01:24:57,245
Go ahead of me quiet and nice,
otherwise you get a big hole in your stomach!

633
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:22,585
- No, it was not me!
-Come on!

634
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:32,929
Get off me!

635
01:29:40,803 --> 01:29:42,773
Get them here!

636
01:29:43,556 --> 01:29:45,525
Help me-

637
01:30:10,248 --> 01:30:14,839
Attention! There is a red alert.

638
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:17,721
Hostile aircraft approaching.

639
01:30:17,922 --> 01:30:22,181
- We have to go out and all that fast.
-One thing must be done first!

640
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,023
What?

641
01:30:25,179 --> 01:30:28,228
Revenge. Let those who tormented us ...

642
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,773
Themselves ... to feel pain!
No, Kala.

643
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:37,284
- If you release them free?
We give them to the Allies.

644
01:30:38,484 --> 01:30:40,703
They are brought to justice, I swear.

645
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:44,123
Before the right one? What they gave us
for justice?

646
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:48,128
In five months I've been here.

647
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:52,800
They've done things with my body
and the bodies of others ...

648
01:30:55,083 --> 01:31:00,552
- Let's go to the mountains.
-Goodbye, friends. God be with you.

649
01:31:08,513 --> 01:31:10,814
Mario, come with us!

650
01:31:11,557 --> 01:31:15,614
What life awaits a half man
outside the fence?

651
01:31:42,754 --> 01:31:46,680
Attention! Red readiness now called off.

652
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:52,483
There is now a blue alert.
We resume broadcasts.

653
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:07,991
... And betraying their national duties
loss of both life and honor.

654
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:17,070
... Communications and transport centers
must be defended to the last-

655
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:21,537
-Without regard to the enemy lines.

656
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:26,622
Local commanders
held personally liable for this.

657
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:33,419
They are sentenced to death
for negligence in that respect.

658
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:59,037
General?

659
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:03,951
Your orders have been executed.
Camp 9 has ceased to exist.

660
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:06,535
You can communicate Reichsführer-

661
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,707
-That the Allies did not find anything.

662
01:35:10,078 --> 01:35:12,795
They must never know anything.
