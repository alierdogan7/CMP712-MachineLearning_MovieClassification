1
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:35,957
[blowing wind]

2
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,704
- Ah!

3
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:43,763
- Ah!

4
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,629
[grunts]

5
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,746
- It's us, Sire!

6
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,969
And it's you!
You're here at last.

7
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,353
[gurgling]

8
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,128
- Ah, gentlemen.

9
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,926
The King of Rome's first charge,

10
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,683
and as you see,
he's chosen to attack the heights

11
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:37,149
like I did in Austerlitz.

12
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:39,608
- Alas, Sire,
Austerlitz is far away.

13
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:41,137
The defeat of our armies--

14
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,183
- Not a defeat. A retreat.

15
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,415
- Certainly, Sire.

16
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,538
But thousands of our men
are still in Russia.

17
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,036
Without you there,
what can they do?

18
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:54,185
- I came back because
the affairs of France demanded it,

19
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:57,579
but I have Murat at the head
of our troops and I know him.

20
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,405
He will save all
that can be saved.

21
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,798
The men he brings home
will stay home forever.

22
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:04,620
As it is nearly Christmas,

23
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,739
I have decided to give a present
to all the French people,

24
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,137
and most of all
to you, my dearest.

25
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,758
The wars are over.

26
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:14,418
I declare peace to the world.

27
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,311
[gasping]

28
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:24,323
- Bravo, Sire! Bravo!

29
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,806
[soldier:] Company!

30
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,413
Present arms!

31
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,166
- This way, please.

32
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,818
The fact that the people of Paris

33
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:57,144
adore their beloved
Empress more each day

34
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,367
is a great joy for us all.

35
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,729
- That's not what
she says in her letters.

36
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,118
- No? Oh, her natural
discretion, I expect.

37
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,802
Your Excellency would
agree that it's tactless

38
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,923
for a woman to acknowledge
that she is irresistible.

39
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,253
- Humility is hardly
a prominent virtue

40
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:16,544
in a Princess
of the House of Austria.

41
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,304
Wouldn't you agree?

42
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,594
- Let us not forget
that the Empress Marie-Louise

43
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,387
has become completely French,

44
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:24,682
like most of Europe.

45
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:28,675
- Only France is French,
Monsieur de Caulaincourt.

46
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,381
The other countries
are French by force.

47
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,781
So it's temporary.

48
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,278
- Come now, Metternich!

49
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:08,772
[clicks heels]

50
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,165
No need for rituals.

51
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:12,986
The Austrian ambassador
is at home here.

52
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,673
But first of all, tell me
how dear old Francois is.

53
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,133
- His Majesty the Emperor
of Austria is very well.

54
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,356
And you, Sire?

55
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,081
- I couldn't be better,
ever since I declared

56
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,243
peace to the world.

57
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,971
- An admirable phrase, Sire.

58
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:29,898
- I'm glad you like it.
It's not just a phrase.

59
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,089
- In that case, Sire,

60
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,653
you are bound
to accept the conditions

61
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:36,237
that Emperor Francois
has asked me to relay to you.

62
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,734
- Conditions?
- Yes.

63
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:43,121
What we expect
in exchange for this peace

64
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,377
that France has asked for.

65
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:49,659
- Perhaps I have been
unclear, Metternich.

66
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:52,091
I'm not asking for peace,
I'm making it.

67
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,516
In fact, I'm imposing it.

68
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:58,561
- I'm afraid France
is in no position to impose

69
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,256
anything at all, Sire.

70
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:05,042
Everyone is aware
that you have lost

71
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,042
most of your troops in Russia.

72
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:25,009
- You dare order me
to give up my conquest?

73
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,233
And to restore
the old boundaries?

74
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,245
So hundreds of
thousands of Frenchmen

75
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:37,241
will have suffered and
died for nothing?

76
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:41,024
You're insane.
Your Emperor is insane!

77
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,578
- Your Majesty is free
to do as he pleases, of course.

78
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,236
- Oh, thank you so much.

79
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:49,098
- But if France
refuses to subscribe

80
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,456
to the conditions we propose...

81
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:56,011
Austria unfortunately
will be obliged

82
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,264
to declare war on France.

83
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:04,011
- Austria declare war on me?
On me?

84
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,599
It can't be.

85
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:10,460
Have you forgotten
whom l've married?

86
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,281
Come over here,
Let me show you something.

87
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,611
[cheering]

88
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:26,540
It only took me three months
to build up the Grand Army again.

89
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,500
This is one of my new regiments.

90
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,619
[cheering]

91
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:36,075
- Your new toy soldiers, you mean.

92
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:39,256
They are children, Sire.

93
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:40,850
- You're wrong to disparage them.

94
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,077
They are called the Marie-Louise,
named after my wife.

95
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,592
Because of her, my son
has Austrian blood in his veins,

96
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,823
so if your Emperor
declares me war,

97
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:53,839
he will be rising up against
his own daughter and grandson.

98
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,066
- Rest assured that Emperor
Francois has not forgotten

99
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,688
that he gave you his daughter
as Empress of France.

100
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,610
But he can and will act solely
in the interests of his people.

101
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,436
[cheering]

102
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:19,425
- It's not in Austria's
interests to attack France.

103
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:23,908
Prussia, Russia and England
are using you, and that's a fact.

104
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,300
I married Marie-Louise for peace,

105
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,984
and obviously l've been betrayed.
It is not surprising.

106
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,607
French people have
thought all along

107
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:37,125
that they were getting
another Marie Antoinette.

108
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:40,217
- I was told they had
come to love her.

109
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:42,977
- You were misinformed.

110
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,938
Nobody loves her.
No one except me.

111
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:50,785
Take this answer
back to your master:

112
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:54,743
of Austria dares
to declare war on me,

113
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,961
I will reduce Vienna to rubble.

114
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,088
I swear it.

115
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,358
- Then you are lost, Sire.

116
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,138
You are lost.

117
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,212
[crumpling paper]

118
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,240
[singing in German]

119
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:16,827
[man:] Fire!

120
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,035
Company, pull back!

121
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,480
[men shouting]

122
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:03,468
- So you're deserting!

123
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,765
- Sire, I know you
do not mean that.

124
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:08,350
Marshall Murat was
informing Your Majesty

125
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:12,210
that he's going to his kingdom
of Naples for reinforcements!

126
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,466
- His kingdom?
I made you king.

127
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,057
of I fall, you fall.

128
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,578
And I don't believe a word about
your damned reinforcements!

129
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:23,735
You have negotiated
your departure with the Austrians.

130
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:27,626
- What are you implying?

131
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,068
- I'm not implying,
I'm saying it to your face.

132
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,725
Murat, there is only one way,

133
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,841
just one, for you
to convince me of your loyalty.

134
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,774
Come back from
Naples with troops

135
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:45,200
who are ready to give
their lives for me.

136
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,436
- Sire,

137
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,935
I do have to take my leave.

138
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:57,224
This wound of mine--

139
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,084
- Your wound?

140
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:02,203
Yesterday, you said
it was a mere scratch.

141
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,223
I won't hold you back!

142
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:09,980
Well, gentlemen!

143
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,775
Any more candidates for desertion?

144
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,135
No one is indispensable
to me, you know!

145
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:17,252
- Sire, Sire. We love you.

146
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:20,047
Those who must go leave
with broken hearts.

147
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,995
For those who stay,
we only ask you

148
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,726
for one thing: the truth.

149
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,951
We have lost the war, haven't we?

150
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:33,496
- Lost the war? Because
the enemy has a few more troops?

151
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:36,224
I have my reserves, easily
enough for a counter-attack.

152
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:37,316
[murmuring]

153
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,349
What was that? General!
What did you say?

154
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,305
- He was saying, Sire,
a counter-attack is impossible.

155
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:46,125
We can barely hold on
to our positions as it is.

156
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:51,310
Perhaps an orderly retreat,
to defend France--

157
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:52,807
- France?

158
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,990
Fight on our own soil?

159
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,488
- France must be defended, Sire.

160
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,171
She is in mortal danger.

161
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,525
[chickens clucking]

162
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,635
- Go away!

163
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,529
I have nothing to give you.

164
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:07,683
I've got nothing
left but my hens!

165
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:12,302
And if you take them--

166
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,890
- You can keep your hens.

167
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,153
We need horses,
two or three will do.

168
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:19,046
- You've got horses!
They're right under your asses!

169
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,545
- We need farm horses

170
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,934
to pull our cannons
out of the mud.

171
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,223
And if you have any sons
to lend us a hand...

172
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,761
- I had two sons.

173
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,087
But that monster Napoleon
got them both killed!

174
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,568
I will make him suffer for it,

175
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,929
if I have to follow him to hell!

176
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,684
- Sire! We're wasting time.

177
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,183
- Sire?

178
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,673
He called you Sire?

179
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,527
You're...

180
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,146
- The monster.

181
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:04,493
- No! Leave her.

182
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:11,174
What were your sons called?

183
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:17,211
- The oldest was Gervais.

184
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,905
The little one, Clement.

185
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,402
He wasn't even 16.

186
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,290
- Gervais and Clement.

187
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,374
We cannot let them
die for nothing.

188
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,230
- They died for you.
But you're nothing!

189
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:36,743
You're less than that pile of dung!

190
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,865
- You have a right to refuse.

191
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:43,399
But if you lend us your horses,

192
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,151
to pull out
our cannons of the mud,

193
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,975
their shells
will avenge your boys.

194
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,500
- What's the use?

195
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,857
The enemy is all over France.

196
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,853
Everyone says we're finished.

197
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:58,144
- No, no.

198
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,536
We're never finished. Never!

199
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:03,158
All France is fighting
against the enemy.

200
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:08,308
Your sons gave their life
so this country might survive.

201
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,637
I'm giving my life for it.

202
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,859
And you cannot give up a horse?

203
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:30,962
- One of you come
to the stables with me.

204
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:33,156
[bell tolling]

205
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:37,107
[bell ringing]

206
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,526
[grunts]

207
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,958
- Madame, it's Joseph!

208
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,956
The Emperor's brother!

209
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,173
Open the door, please!

210
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:02,957
- You've had news
of His Majesty?

211
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,254
- Yes. Well, no.

212
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,150
It's all terribly confusing.

213
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,508
But you must leave
Paris right away.

214
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,507
- What?

215
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,190
- The enemy is
at the gates of the city.

216
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:16,413
All of them! The Russians,
the Austrians, the Prussians!

217
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,909
Please! Take the child and flee!

218
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,622
- Flee? of I leave,
the population will think

219
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:24,386
they have been abandoned!

220
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:27,143
And their despair
will cause more damage

221
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,938
than the enemy's cannons.

222
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:32,056
I swore to wait here
for Napoleon to return.

223
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,590
Otherwise, the Empire will be lost!

224
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,405
- Madame, it's an order
from the Emperor,

225
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,590
dated the 8th of February 1814.

226
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:44,556
''of the enemies
march in Paris

227
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,138
''with troops that
cannot be resisted--''

228
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,797
which is the present
situation, Madame--

229
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,059
''then send my wife and child away.

230
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:55,247
''l would rather know that my son
was drowned in the Seine

231
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,801
''than in the hands
of France's enemies.''

232
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:00,335
You recognize
His Majesty's writing?

233
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,126
- Yes, but not his mind.

234
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,554
Napoleon cannot want
his son's death.

235
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:07,840
- Only as a last resort,
if escape is impossible!

236
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,735
But it will be possible!

237
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,422
I've arranged everything
for your departure.

238
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,150
- What about him? Where's he?

239
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:16,342
At the head of his armies,
l suppose.

240
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,378
[scoffs]

241
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:20,097
- His armies.
What's left of them.

242
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,243
- Go! Find the little King of Rome.

243
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,242
Get him ready for a journey.

244
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,387
Where have you arranged
for me to go?

245
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,717
- To Blois,
on the banks of the Loire.

246
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:39,239
- Very well. But I warn you,
I shall not stay there.

247
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,557
I shall join the Emperor
wherever he is.

248
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:45,879
He cannot bear to be
parted from his son for long.

249
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:48,806
And you, Monsieur,
can I count on you

250
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,556
to assure the defence of Paris
till the bitter end?

251
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:56,977
- I hope you do not doubt
my courage, Madame.

252
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:03,652
[thunder clap]

253
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:07,073
- We need the horses.
It is very urgent...

254
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:09,660
- l've already told you,
I have none to give you.

255
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:12,260
- Please, Sire.
I don't want to force you.

256
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,787
[discussion continues
in distance]

257
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,780
- You can have them.

258
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:18,002
- OK. Thanks.

259
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:24,750
They have agreed
to give us fresh horses!

260
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,405
We can be in Paris
in an hour.

261
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,531
- They are not shouting
''Long live the Emperor.''

262
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:35,614
It's the first time.

263
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:37,834
- Well, Sire...

264
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:47,172
- General Beliard?
What are you doing here?

265
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,794
- Marshall Marmont's orders, Sire.

266
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:50,989
I have come to find
housing for the troops

267
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,786
who will evacuate the capital.

268
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:54,511
- Evacuate the capital?

269
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,341
Are you mad, General?

270
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:59,595
My brother Joseph is in charge
of the defence of Paris!

271
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:01,323
- He has signed the surrender,

272
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:04,013
and has given the order
to withdraw the troops.

273
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:12,753
- Even the army has given up.

274
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,802
But the people of Paris
have never let me down!

275
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,998
I will call them to take up arms,

276
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:20,690
and drive out the enemy.
The Battle of Paris!

277
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,950
- There will be
no Battle of Paris, Sire.

278
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:28,801
It's too late. It's over.

279
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,918
They've signed the surrender,

280
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,345
and Your Majesty
is honour-bound to respect it.

281
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:38,763
France has given her word, Sire.

282
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,220
[clock ticking]

283
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:13,511
- Even my bodyguard deserts me.

284
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,946
[door closing]

285
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,983
- Sire?

286
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:29,166
The Cossacks have entered Paris.

287
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:48,931
The people will agree to any
treason to protect the city.

288
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,910
They even applauded
the Allies' decree

289
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,297
demanding your abdication...

290
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,779
abdication, under these conditions.

291
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,562
[laughs]

292
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:10,095
- I don't need to read it

293
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:14,139
to know the conditions
are unacceptable.

294
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:23,481
- Unappealing, perhaps,
Sire, but unacceptable...

295
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:29,486
is a word that is no longer
in our vocabulary.

296
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,075
You have to leave France.

297
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:40,491
But they are granting you
sovereignty of the Isle of Elba.

298
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,199
It's off the coast of Italy.

299
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:48,562
- I know the place. It's a pebble.

300
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:54,939
Napoleon, king of a pebble.
Grotesque!

301
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,119
- Sire! There's a Polish lady who--

302
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,338
- Countess Walewska.

303
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:10,516
I gave everyone else so much,
and they all abandoned me.

304
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,329
And I refused her the one thing
she desired the most,

305
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:20,019
the sovereignty of
her beloved Poland,

306
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,712
and yet she has come.

307
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,928
- Shall I bring her in,
Your Majesty?

308
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,023
- Yes.

309
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,287
No!

310
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,337
No, I can't see her.

311
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,782
Tell her to go away.

312
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:44,504
of they hear I have received her,

313
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:46,299
they could use it as an excuse

314
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,550
to stop me seeing Marie-Louise
and my son again.

315
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:56,068
My conquerors are very petty,
Caulaincourt.

316
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,686
Marie will understand.

317
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:02,077
I'm sure she will.

318
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:07,659
I'm sure she will.

319
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:28,487
- What has been decreed for him?

320
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:30,220
- Exile.

321
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:32,313
- Forever?

322
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:35,734
- It's out of his hands, Madame.

323
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,228
But one can hardly imagine
the Emperor's agreeing

324
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:41,274
to be a phantom king for long.

325
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:43,244
They were allowing him

326
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:46,562
to assemble a royal court...
of sorts.

327
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,821
- Does that mean
I'd be able to visit him?

328
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:50,048
- Oh, yes.

329
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:54,007
Perhaps not right away, of course.

330
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,763
But...

331
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,243
Madame...

332
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:04,828
the Emperor, he...

333
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,156
he...

334
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,338
Madame, the Emperor loves y--

335
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:13,963
- He loves me.

336
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,599
Give this to the Emperor.

337
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:29,548
Explain that it's not because
I'm angry with him,

338
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,808
but because he might need it.

339
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:35,734
I know his enemies.
They are mine too.

340
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:41,046
They will strip him of everything,
introduce him to nothing.

341
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:45,103
- Madame.
[clicks heels]

342
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,855
[clock ticking]

343
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:02,107
[Napoleon:]
My sweet Marie-Louise.

344
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,725
I love you more
than anything in the world.

345
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:08,621
Know that my misfortunes
trouble me

346
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:11,580
only because
they make you suffer.

347
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,970
Kiss your son for me.

348
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,855
Farewell, dear Marie-Louise.

349
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:19,320
I am yours.

350
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,406
[Napoleon groaning]

351
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,061
- Your Majesty?

352
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:55,792
[coughing]

353
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,854
Your Majesty-- oh my God!

354
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,311
Your Majesty!

355
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:02,343
[groaning]

356
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,820
Help! Help!

357
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,151
Sire...

358
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:11,839
Go get Dr. Ivan! Rush!

359
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,167
[groaning]

360
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:18,581
- Sire? What's happening?

361
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:20,444
- Drink! He's poisoned himself.

362
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:21,975
- Sire?

363
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,600
Yes!

364
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:30,344
Sire! Sire!

365
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:34,961
Sire! Sire!

366
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:16,522
- These beans remind
me of Corsica.

367
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,382
So does the sun.

368
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:21,376
Many things here
remind me of Corsica.

369
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:24,026
It's not so bad here.

370
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,412
- We are so far away.

371
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,411
- Far from what?

372
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:34,028
Army tents in the mud, carriages
that people throw bombs at?

373
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,059
Men who have betrayed you?

374
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,516
Women who have been unfaithful?

375
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:42,561
Ah, Napoleon, judging
from what l've seen,

376
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,059
ruling over France brings
very little happiness.

377
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,602
- Ruling over this island
brings even less.

378
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:53,193
- Ruling? But you're not ruling here.

379
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:56,091
You're like a landowner,

380
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,978
what you would have been
in Corsica if you had stayed.

381
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,522
- It was my father
who wanted me to be a soldier.

382
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:06,524
He sent me to school in France,

383
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,842
without asking me
if I wanted to go.

384
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:11,962
- You would have left anyway.

385
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:13,928
Our island was too small for you.

386
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,788
You found even France too small,

387
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,977
you had to make it
bigger and bigger.

388
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:22,559
- Not to spread our borders,
but to spread our ideas!

389
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:26,149
Our love of liberty,
our audacity, our youth!

390
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,841
That's what I wanted to spread
throughout Europe.

391
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:30,840
- And Europe didn't want your gift.

392
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,197
Or maybe the colour
of the ribbon you tied

393
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,918
was too much the colour of blood.

394
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,878
- It was England
that didn't want it.

395
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:41,733
The English plotted everything,
right from the start.

396
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:43,198
of it had not been for them,

397
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:46,314
I would never have
fought with Spain.

398
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,372
The Czar would have
stayed my friend.

399
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,409
And Austria would not
have forgotten

400
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:52,164
that I was a part of the family.

401
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:55,453
I'm sure it's the English who
are stopping my wife and son

402
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:56,647
from coming to see me.

403
00:32:56,722 --> 00:33:00,198
- What makes you think
she wants to come here?

404
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,791
Your wife's become Austrian again.

405
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:05,949
You've seen the last
of her and your son.

406
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:25,390
It's a beautiful day!

407
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,607
You should try to enjoy
yourself a little.

408
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,457
[lively music]

409
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:44,585
[applause]

410
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:58,314
[man laughing]

411
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:05,654
- That signora is not dancing!
Do your duty, Cambronne.

412
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:08,407
- But, Sire, she's
the fishmonger's wife.

413
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,123
- What of it? You're
the son of a wood merchant.

414
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,993
- Would you give me
the pleasure of this dance, madame?

415
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,085
[speaking in Latin]

416
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:37,505
That's Latin. It means:

417
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,627
''Napoleon is happy
wherever he is.''

418
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,359
My new motto.

419
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:47,639
- Sire, Cipriani has just
arrived from Genoa.

420
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:58,902
- At last, you're here!

421
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:00,492
No one suspected anything?

422
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:02,687
- I introduced myself
as your steward,

423
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:06,307
saying l'd come to buy goods
that can't be found on the island.

424
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,933
As soon as you talk
business with the Genoese,

425
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,232
they drop their guard.

426
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:12,228
I have good news
and bad news for you.

427
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:15,378
The good news is very good,
but the bad is worse than ever.

428
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,004
- Start with the bad news.

429
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,407
- The English don't believe

430
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:21,061
you've resigned yourself
to ending your days here.

431
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,720
The fact that the
Island of Elba

432
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:25,252
is only three or four days by sea
from the French coast

433
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,679
keeps them awake at night.

434
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,105
They are planning to send
you to another island.

435
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:31,758
- They cannot do that!

436
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:35,153
The Island of Elba
was assigned to me

437
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,007
by an international treaty,
signed by all the powers!

438
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,471
- The English don't care.

439
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,865
They plan to capture you

440
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,052
and smuggle you in
secret to St. Helena.

441
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,416
- St. Helena?

442
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,069
- It's in the middle of
the south Atlantic Ocean,

443
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,367
thousands of miles
from all inhabited land.

444
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,523
- What's the good news?

445
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,317
It had better be good,
to make up for that one.

446
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:56,937
- I think Your Majesty
will appreciate it.

447
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,131
According to my informers,

448
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:02,253
the situation in France
is turning very bad, very fast.

449
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,547
After welcoming the Russians
and Austrians as liberators,

450
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,601
the people can't
stand them anymore.

451
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:10,227
The Emperor was right
to want to gut them,

452
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:11,661
is what they're saying.

453
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:16,375
As for King Louis XVIll, opinion
is unanimous. They all hate him.

454
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:20,265
So many Parisians have thrown
away their royalist badges

455
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,883
that the main sewer is blocked up.

456
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:25,315
- What I wouldn't give to see it.

457
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:28,397
- What they wouldn't
give to see you, Sire.

458
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,294
They want you back,
with all their hearts.

459
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:37,201
- I have a brig and
a schooner at my disposal.

460
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,894
Small ships, but built for speed.

461
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:44,816
We might manage to slip
past the English fleet...

462
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:49,293
if the night is dark enough.

463
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,494
Come on.

464
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,450
inform General Bertrand
we have news.

465
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:07,373
Join me after
the ball, both of you.

466
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,831
[new song begins]

467
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:17,631
Will you give me
the honour of this dance?

468
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,454
You have been crying,
my little Fanny.

469
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,338
of Bertrand has been
unkind to you,

470
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:29,301
just tell me
and I will punish him.

471
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:32,749
I'll make you my mistress.

472
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:35,043
- I have been crying, Sire.

473
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:39,059
But my husband has nothing to do
with it. It's because of you.

474
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,153
- Me?

475
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:41,557
- Yes, Sire.

476
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:44,244
When I think of the grief
I am going to cause you.

477
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,474
I have received a letter from
France, from Caulaincourt.

478
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:50,022
He should have written
to Your Majesty directly,

479
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,024
instead of choosing me
as a messenger

480
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,518
to bear you such sad news.

481
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,039
- Nothing's happened
to my son or my wife?

482
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,085
Josephine?

483
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:05,305
- Sire, she's dead.

484
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,464
[echoing:] She's dead.

485
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:10,189
At first they thought
she had caught a chill,

486
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:11,850
but it was far worse than that.

487
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,318
Purulent pharyngitis.

488
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:16,604
Madame de Beauharnais
put up a very brave fight

489
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:20,357
for several days, but
the fever got the better of her.

490
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,580
Caulaincourt says
that her last words were:

491
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,672
Bonaparte.

492
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:26,730
[echoing:] Bonaparte.

493
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,730
Bonaparte.

494
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:31,848
Bonaparte.

495
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:35,106
Bonaparte.

496
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,143
- Sire.

497
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,053
Sire?

498
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:45,473
Sire?

499
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:02,385
- Cambronne!

500
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,606
Fetch the almanac.

501
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:08,689
I want to know the date
of the next lunar eclipse.

502
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,776
Gentlemen, I want the brig
L'Iconstant and the schooner

503
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:16,296
moored in a quiet bay
outside the port.

504
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:20,158
Have them repainted
to look like English ships.

505
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:25,941
- Yes, Sire.

506
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,538
- Row! Row!

507
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:17,533
Row! Row!

508
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:21,350
Men, haul her up!

509
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,331
Come on, men!

510
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,428
- Come on! Come on!

511
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,386
Sire! We live close by,

512
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:43,969
and my wife always has
a good fish soup on the fire.

513
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:45,835
I'd be honoured if you'd wait

514
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:48,454
for the rest of
your army at our house.

515
00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:50,115
- That is my army.

516
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:51,448
- That's it?

517
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,777
That's all
the men you have

518
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,205
to drive out the King
and his bunch of scoundrels?

519
00:40:56,636 --> 00:41:00,386
Listen, if you need
more help, take my sons!

520
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,416
They're only 9 and 10,

521
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:04,703
but I'm sure they could
still be useful!

522
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,599
- I have a blunderbuss
in my cabin!

523
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,597
I'll get it!

524
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,817
- You will not need a weapon!

525
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,044
I intend to reclaim my throne

526
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:15,663
without spilling a single
drop of French blood.

527
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:20,846
[all:] Long live the Emperor!

528
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:33,608
- Monsieur de Talleyrand-
Perigord, Prince de Benevent,

529
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,189
begs Your Majesty
to grant him an audience.

530
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,916
- Prince de Benevent,
and what else?

531
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,036
Kindly oblige me by renouncing
those preposterous titles

532
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,129
bestowed on you by the usurper.

533
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:46,598
What's that?

534
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:49,817
- A dispatch, Sire, from
the head of the telegram service,

535
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,747
and judging by
the state he was in,

536
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,368
it must be of
some importance.

537
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,596
-[laughing:]
In a state?

538
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,026
Was I in a state
during all those years

539
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:01,743
that the odious Bonaparte spent
loitering in this armchair?

540
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:05,066
I awaited my hour,
and my hour has come,

541
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:07,099
and this armchair is mine now.

542
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,917
It's exceedingly
uncomfortable, actually.

543
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:11,811
I shall have it upholstered.

544
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:14,170
Do you know what's
in this dispatch of yours?

545
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,200
- I do not, Sire.

546
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:20,210
- Bonaparte has
landed in Provence.

547
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,102
Take it to the Minister of War.
He will know what to do.

548
00:42:40,387 --> 00:42:41,847
- Have you heard the rumour?

549
00:42:41,914 --> 00:42:43,466
Napoleon
has escaped from Elba.

550
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:46,465
The English were fools
to leave him on an island!

551
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,454
A man like that should be
locked up in a fortress!

552
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:52,410
- One will need to catch him
before one locks him up.

553
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:54,992
- That won't be a problem
with a regiment!

554
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,121
I'm on my way to
the King right now

555
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,088
to offer to take charge of this.

556
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:01,943
I will bring that madman
back in an iron cage!

557
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,006
- Don't you think it
would be better

558
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:05,862
to bring him back
dead, on a cart?

559
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,854
- It would be wasteful.
Parisians adore sensations.

560
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:12,038
They would love seeing him
in a cage, gripping the bars

561
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:14,695
and roaring like
the bloodthirsty beast he is.

562
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:16,265
- I'm curious, Ney.

563
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,481
Why such hatred after
so much devotion?

564
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:22,668
- I could ask you
the same question.

565
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:24,635
- I only ever served him.

566
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:28,883
Changing masters is natural for
a servant. But you loved him.

567
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,449
People say one of the reasons

568
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:32,635
he tried to kill himself
in Fontainebleau

569
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,692
was because you'd deserted him.

570
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:37,987
- Nonsense! I was not
the only one to take my leave.

571
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:39,417
He lost almost everyone

572
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,707
who believed in him
and followed him.

573
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:45,855
- And what if he seduces
them once again?

574
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:48,752
- With what? Napoleon
is a wanted man now.

575
00:43:48,856 --> 00:43:50,249
Alone and on the run,

576
00:43:50,317 --> 00:43:52,967
with nothing but
the boots on his feet!

577
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:44,033
- Sire, I beg you.
Take cover behind your men!

578
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:47,285
Let me try to talk to them.

579
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,742
- With a gun in your hand?
Put it away, Cambronne.

580
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,236
- But, Sire!

581
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:54,731
Ah, shh--

582
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,385
- I beg your pardon?

583
00:44:58,454 --> 00:44:59,914
- Nothing.

584
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:03,664
- I recognize their insignias.
It's the 5th of the Line.

585
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,320
And Ney is in command!

586
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:06,790
- Soldiers!

587
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,416
Prepare to fire!

588
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,821
[guns cocking]

589
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:25,923
- Soldiers! Lower arms!

590
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:35,220
Marshall Ney!

591
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:39,505
Soldiers of the 5th of the Line!

592
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,435
I am your Emperor.

593
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,692
- On my command,

594
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,976
fire!

595
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,884
Take the names of all
who refused to shoot!

596
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,851
They will be charged
with mutiny

597
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,971
in the face of
the enemy, and shot!

598
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,468
Men to replace the mutineers!

599
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,414
- Soldiers!

600
00:46:19,248 --> 00:46:22,567
of any one of you wants
to kill his Emperor,

601
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:23,962
here I am.

602
00:46:40,012 --> 00:46:41,370
[cheering]

603
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:11,437
- Well! You took your time, Ney.

604
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:14,823
You always used to be the first
to come for my orders.

605
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:17,214
Keep your sword, you fool.

606
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,298
How will you be able to defend
your Emperor without it?

607
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,226
[soldiers cheering]

608
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,507
- You're right, Sire!

609
00:47:27,585 --> 00:47:30,270
Paris is still a good way off.

610
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:33,694
Officers and soldiers
of the 5th of the Line!

611
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,780
In force! Music at the head!

612
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:38,712
And tear up those rags,
for God's sake!

613
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,600
The tricolour or nothing!

614
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:43,324
[cheering]

615
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:03,754
- I asked you to come,
my dear architect,

616
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:06,445
because there are too
many things in here

617
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,666
that remind me of the usurper.
I cannot concentrate.

618
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:14,160
I would be grateful if
you would change the furniture,

619
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:17,184
hang new curtains,
and repaint the walls.

620
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:19,210
- Repaint the walls, Sire?

621
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:21,133
By the time they are dry--

622
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:23,059
- I have learned to be patient.

623
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,181
I waited many years
for my throne.

624
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:26,581
- Yes, of course, Sire.

625
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:29,699
But it is said that
Bonaparte has crossed Lyon.

626
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:32,526
- What of it?

627
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:35,112
How does that affect my paint?

628
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:43,125
[horses passing]

629
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:47,341
- It's him! It's him, it's Napoleon!

630
00:48:50,073 --> 00:48:51,589
[cheering]

631
00:49:05,388 --> 00:49:06,644
- Out.

632
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:11,226
Your Majesty.
[grunts]

633
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,188
Tomorrow, monsieur, tomorrow.

634
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,409
It is well past my bedtime.

635
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:20,098
- Your Majesty, Napoleon has
already reached Fontainebleau.

636
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,255
He's marching on Paris.

637
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:27,209
- So it's all over, is it?

638
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,457
All by himself, that man
has retaken France.

639
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,384
Who would have thought it?

640
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,456
- We must go, Your Majesty.

641
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:45,247
- But I would so
much rather go to bed.

642
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:49,696
- l've made all the arrangements
for Your Majesty's flight.

643
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:52,988
- Departure, Monsieur.
I'm not Louis XVI,

644
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,447
and I have no intention of
restaging that shabby drama

645
00:49:56,517 --> 00:49:58,170
of the flight to Varennes!

646
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,620
Quickly, quickly!

647
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:04,949
My poor wretched feet.
I'm out of bed.

648
00:50:06,282 --> 00:50:09,171
And on top of everything,
it's raining!

649
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,353
Oh! Oh!
Push! Push me!

650
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:15,717
Push me. Push me again.

651
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,517
- Wherever you may go, Sire,

652
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,573
I will join you.

653
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:29,093
- Say no more, Monsieur
de Talleyrand, I beg you.

654
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:35,777
[thunder clap]

655
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:39,327
- of the need arises.

656
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,013
[cheering]

657
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:05,084
- Do you hear that,
Caulaincourt?

658
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:07,234
I have never known
such enthusiasm.

659
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,292
Not even the day
after Austerlitz,

660
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,658
not even at
the coronation, gentlemen.

661
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:13,347
- While France exalts, Sire,

662
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,883
England mobilizes troops.

663
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,672
And they are not alone.

664
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:19,758
Austria, Prussia, and almost
certain, Russia too.

665
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:22,349
- You have a new coalition
against you, Sire.

666
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:23,887
- For what?

667
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:27,035
To put that old King
back on the throne?

668
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:28,797
- He's meaningless, Sire.

669
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,887
It's you they want
to catch and cage.

670
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,320
- Ney also said he
would put me in a cage!

671
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,178
And I had him eating
out of my hand.

672
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:38,262
And they will be all eating out
of my hand at the first victory.

673
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,193
- Victory? You mean war again?

674
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:44,546
- I have no choice.
They're always attacking me.

675
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:50,156
I've always wanted peace,
and they prevent me every time.

676
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:55,080
- Sire! Marshall Murat
wishes to see Your Majesty.

677
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:56,633
- Murat.

678
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,733
[door opening]

679
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,863
- Here I am, Sire.

680
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:31,551
- So I see.

681
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:37,834
What about the reinforcements

682
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,761
you were bringing back from Naples?

683
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:42,481
- That was almost a year ago!

684
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:43,982
- Yes.

685
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:47,331
Yes, almost exactly.

686
00:52:47,439 --> 00:52:51,119
- It's been a bad year
for both of us, Sire.

687
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:54,239
But misfortune
has brought some good.

688
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:57,566
When I lost my crown
as King of Naples,

689
00:52:57,638 --> 00:52:59,823
I became plain Murat again.

690
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:03,148
Marshall Murat.
Murat the cavalryman!

691
00:53:03,253 --> 00:53:06,005
Whom you will need
for the war ahead of us.

692
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:07,332
- Need?

693
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:09,624
I think not.

694
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:11,555
Neither need nor want.

695
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:14,104
Thank you for offering
your services,

696
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:16,299
but it is one year too late.

697
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:18,594
- Do you feel as bitter as that?

698
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,286
- Bitter?

699
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,841
I gave you my sister,
I made you King,

700
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,176
and you betrayed me.

701
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:25,833
How should I feel, Murat?

702
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,889
How can you even look at me?

703
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,816
Ney will take your place
at the head of the cavalry.

704
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,849
[horses galloping]

705
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:55,073
[Napoleon:]
We will confront regiments

706
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:58,123
from Hanover and Brunswick,
Bavaria and Wurttemberg,

707
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,492
Hesse and the Piedmonts,

708
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:02,779
Holland, Belgium,
Prussia and Russia,

709
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,073
Austria and the English.

710
00:54:04,147 --> 00:54:07,795
- 700,000 of them,
only 200,000 of us.

711
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,292
- 700,000 once
they have joined together.

712
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:12,148
We must attack
them separately,

713
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,699
and fight the Prussian
army under Blucher,

714
00:54:14,777 --> 00:54:16,998
and the English army
under Wellington,

715
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,859
before they can
combine forces.

716
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,889
I hand the Prussians
over to you, Grouchy.

717
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:21,974
- Thank you, Sire.

718
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:26,202
- And the English to you, Ney.
- With pleasure, Sire.

719
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,582
[bagpipes playing]

720
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,407
- Attack!

721
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:58,794
- Has Ney lost his mind?

722
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,154
I didn't give the order yet!

723
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:01,516
Never, never charge infantry

724
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:04,067
before they've been broken up
by a round of shells!

725
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:06,930
- I heard him say he wanted
to earn his reputation

726
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,118
as the best cavalry
officer in the army

727
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:12,275
by leading a wonderful charge.

728
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:15,169
- A brilliant massacre!

729
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,320
Who could cost us the battle as well
as the future of France!

730
00:55:18,396 --> 00:55:19,620
Send for Grouchy!

731
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:21,980
He will have finished
with the Prussians by now.

732
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,132
He must direct his movements
to fall on Wellington's left wing.

733
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:26,497
- Yes, Sire.

734
00:55:39,624 --> 00:55:41,346
[cannon blasts]

735
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:45,461
- Marshall Grouchy,
do you hear the cannons?

736
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:46,795
- Yes, I'm not deaf!

737
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:48,056
- It is the Emperor.

738
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:50,349
He's engaging the English.
We must join him!

739
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:53,773
- My orders are
to pursue the Prussians,

740
00:55:53,843 --> 00:55:55,327
so I'm pursuing the Prussians!

741
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:57,093
- How do you know
they're up ahead

742
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:58,558
and not spread around us?

743
00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:01,673
- I do not answer to you,
General, only to the Emperor!

744
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,767
The Prussians are
over that hill,

745
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:06,562
and I'm preparing
a big surprise for them.

746
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:08,685
Go, ride!

747
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:15,568
[cannons blasting]

748
00:56:26,401 --> 00:56:28,451
- Over there, Sire, over there!

749
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:30,146
That cloud of dust!

750
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,976
- An army on the march.

751
00:56:32,047 --> 00:56:35,469
It's Grouchy bringing
us 30,000 more men.

752
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:36,794
Victory!

753
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:38,382
- Send out scouts immediately.

754
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,509
Make sure it's
Marshall Grouchy's army!

755
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:42,239
- What's gotten into all of you,

756
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:45,756
taking initiative without
waiting for my orders?

757
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:47,590
Do you doubt what
I see, Cambronne?

758
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:48,816
Of course it's Grouchy!

759
00:56:48,891 --> 00:56:50,817
I called him back.
Where else could he be?

760
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:52,811
- Order rescinded, Sire?

761
00:56:52,878 --> 00:56:55,630
- No, no, no. Send out
your scouts if it reassures you,

762
00:56:55,702 --> 00:56:57,286
if you're all so afraid!

763
00:56:57,362 --> 00:56:58,880
As soon as Grouchy arrives,

764
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,106
tell him I'm waiting for him
at the Sainte La Haye farm.

765
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,936
We will take it
from the English.

766
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,830
- Yes, Sire.

767
00:57:58,124 --> 00:57:59,450
- Vive la France!

768
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:14,100
- Sire, this prisoner
has just been captured.

769
00:58:14,169 --> 00:58:17,126
- I have no time now
to interrogate an English soldier.

770
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,315
Have someone else.

771
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,677
- He's not English, Sire.
He's Prussian.

772
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,903
- Prussian?

773
00:58:22,011 --> 00:58:26,020
How can he be Prussian?
Where was he captured?

774
00:58:26,097 --> 00:58:29,076
- This army approaching us,
it's not Grouchy.

775
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:31,804
It's the entire Prussian
army led by Blucher.

776
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:34,234
- The Prussian army still exists?

777
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,054
What is Grouchy doing?
What's happening?

778
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:39,312
Why don't people
do what I say?

779
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:42,307
Why can't I count on anyone?

780
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,456
- Sire, we are all doing our best.

781
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:48,316
- Yes, sorry.

782
00:58:48,388 --> 00:58:52,070
I know you're all putting
your hearts into it.

783
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:53,297
Send in the guard!

784
00:58:53,372 --> 00:58:55,263
- They are the last troops we have.

785
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:56,260
- I know!

786
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:59,178
I know.

787
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:05,629
[explosion]

788
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,076
- Over here, soldiers!

789
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:34,655
Come and see how a Marshall
of France meets his death!

790
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:36,521
[shouting]

791
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:39,017
[all shouting]

792
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:18,513
- French soldiers!

793
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,163
No one will ever
forget your courage,

794
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:26,554
but it's time
to lay down your arms!

795
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,515
- The hell it is!

796
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,203
Charge!

797
01:00:30,311 --> 01:00:31,670
[men shouting]

798
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:45,284
[bagpipes playing]

799
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,556
- Form the square!

800
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:36,012
Protect the retreat!

801
01:02:09,543 --> 01:02:13,621
We will block the road
to Charleroi to cover our retreat.

802
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:16,613
Our retreat.

803
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:22,364
[door opens and closes]

804
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:27,939
The blow l've been
dealt this time...

805
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,829
is mortal, Caulaincourt.

806
01:03:31,898 --> 01:03:33,258
Mortal.

807
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:41,262
[thunder clap]

808
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:56,112
[crowd cheering]

809
01:03:57,712 --> 01:03:59,897
[clock ticking]

810
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:02,224
- Those people who
are cheering you,

811
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,682
I hope you do not envision
calling them to arms, Sire.

812
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:09,569
A few hundred Parisians
who are still unaware

813
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:12,787
that Waterloo was
a complete disaster.

814
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:21,426
- I have done all I can to heal
the scars of the Revolution.

815
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:25,813
I will not reopen them
by provoking a civil war.

816
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:29,728
- Then let's get this over with.

817
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:34,312
The deputies have given you
one hour to sign your abdication.

818
01:04:34,389 --> 01:04:39,100
of you fail to do so,
they will depose you publicly.

819
01:04:41,696 --> 01:04:44,018
It will be painful for everyone.

820
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,516
- Silence!

821
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:50,198
I will not allow you
to dictate my conduct.

822
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:53,915
Nothing can force me
to yield to your deputies!

823
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:56,106
Yes, I say your deputies,

824
01:04:56,181 --> 01:05:01,028
because I believe it was you
who turned them against me!

825
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:05,210
I don't care about them.
I challenge their vote!

826
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:07,674
- That would be difficult.

827
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:10,064
In fact, impossible.

828
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,632
- Then I shall
dissolve the chamber.

829
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,168
- The members have decreed

830
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:22,023
that anyone who attempts
to dissolve the chamber

831
01:05:22,093 --> 01:05:23,747
will be considered a traitor.

832
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:29,928
- You are the traitor.

833
01:05:33,488 --> 01:05:35,810
Stab me in the heart with this.

834
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:39,527
It would be more loyal
than anything you've done.

835
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:41,028
- Calm down.

836
01:05:41,096 --> 01:05:45,706
Worse things can happen
than falling from power.

837
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:48,432
You have been through
this once before.

838
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:52,684
- But I rose again in triumph,

839
01:05:52,757 --> 01:05:54,683
called back by the people.

840
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:57,207
- It only lasted 100 days.

841
01:05:57,276 --> 01:06:00,492
Should that be called
rising again,

842
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:03,486
or just a last, desperate leap?

843
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,233
- Get out, Fouche.

844
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,554
- Your humble servant, Sire...

845
01:06:11,626 --> 01:06:14,582
for the next 45 minutes.

846
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:18,364
At which time, I shall
have to ask you to leave.

847
01:06:23,154 --> 01:06:26,734
- I should have had you hanged.

848
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:30,951
- A topic for your memoirs, Sire.

849
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:22,550
- Paris. June the 24th, 1815.

850
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:26,267
People of France,

851
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:30,918
I give myself up as a sacrifice

852
01:07:30,993 --> 01:07:35,138
to the hatred
of France's enemies.

853
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:38,822
My political life is over.

854
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:43,780
I abdicate
and I proclaim my son

855
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:45,898
Emperor of the French,

856
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:49,496
under the name of Napoleon II.

857
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:06,962
My presence in Paris
could create disturbances,

858
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:10,224
so I thought
to take refuge here.

859
01:08:10,293 --> 01:08:13,510
But Malmaison belongs to you,
and perhaps you don't want to--

860
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:16,867
- Oh, I welcome
you with open arms, Sire.

861
01:08:16,937 --> 01:08:19,327
This is your home from now on.

862
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,250
So redecorate,
move things around--

863
01:08:22,318 --> 01:08:25,140
- No, no.
I love this house as it is.

864
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:28,030
Just as your mother
wanted it to be.

865
01:08:28,099 --> 01:08:31,350
And I shall stay only
a few days, anyway.

866
01:08:31,422 --> 01:08:32,972
I have great plans.

867
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:35,473
- Please, Sire, I beg you.
Don't think of--

868
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:39,188
- No, don't worry.
I have no desire to reign again.

869
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:41,153
But I can't stand idleness!

870
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:44,405
I shall go to America
and start a new career.

871
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,494
Science, Hortense!

872
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:50,485
I shall be able
to devote myself to science.

873
01:08:50,557 --> 01:08:53,140
It's what I have dreamed
about for so long.

874
01:08:53,215 --> 01:08:55,695
I shall cross
the continent of America

875
01:08:55,773 --> 01:08:59,658
from the north of Canada
to the south of the Land of Fire.

876
01:08:59,726 --> 01:09:03,112
And this great journey
will keep me busy for years,

877
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,966
and will give me
the chance to study

878
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:09,424
all the psychical
phenomena of the planet.

879
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:12,744
I want history to remember me
as a great scientific mind,

880
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,299
and forget...

881
01:09:15,374 --> 01:09:17,230
I was also an Emperor.

882
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:28,726
[sighs]

883
01:10:30,753 --> 01:10:32,213
- Thank you.

884
01:10:35,038 --> 01:10:36,555
[door opening]

885
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:41,380
Ah, pull up a stool, Cipriani,

886
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,138
and try some of this.

887
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:46,291
We will never find, mmm,

888
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:48,722
fish soup like this in America.

889
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,909
- We're not in America yet, Sire.

890
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:54,133
There's an English fleet
cruising off the coast

891
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,495
under orders
to inspect all vessels

892
01:10:56,565 --> 01:10:58,491
sailing under the French flag.

893
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:02,739
- Hmm. I would have taken
the same precautions myself.

894
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:04,328
Very well.

895
01:11:04,405 --> 01:11:07,588
We cannot escape by sea.
What about over land?

896
01:11:07,661 --> 01:11:10,016
- Hmm. l've come from Rochefort.

897
01:11:10,086 --> 01:11:14,402
The whole town is teeming
with troops sent by Louis XVIll.

898
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:16,193
- Anything would be better

899
01:11:16,265 --> 01:11:19,221
than falling into
the hands of that fat pig.

900
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:21,645
- I have thought of a plan.

901
01:11:21,714 --> 01:11:23,502
We can hide you in a barrel,

902
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:27,221
and load it on a small fishing
boat carrying salted cod.

903
01:11:27,295 --> 01:11:28,779
The English will let it through.

904
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:32,299
And then we will join a ship
chartered by your brother Joseph.

905
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:33,862
I've spoken to some fishermen.

906
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:37,054
- Napoleon Bonaparte a stowaway?
I was crowned Emperor,

907
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:40,017
and will remain Emperor
until the end of my life.

908
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:43,471
Abdication or no
abdication, I am France,

909
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,119
and France doesn't flee
in a barrel of cod.

910
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:50,084
- But you can't just stay
here until they capture you!

911
01:11:50,152 --> 01:11:51,974
- I could take the initiative,

912
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:54,230
and appeal
to our opponents' honour.

913
01:11:54,303 --> 01:11:56,626
- Hand yourself over
to the English,

914
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:59,743
who fought you
with such hatred?

915
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:03,670
- My real crime in their eyes
was overthrowing tradition,

916
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,165
not conquering Europe.

917
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:08,587
I'm prepared to swear
that I will never again act,

918
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:11,839
in word or in deed,
against their damn monarchy.

919
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:16,329
I will even swear
to stay away from America.

920
01:12:16,396 --> 01:12:19,284
What I want is...

921
01:12:19,353 --> 01:12:22,739
a little house in
the countryside, near London.

922
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:25,731
A cottage, a garden...

923
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:29,086
and a few rose bushes.

924
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,096
How can they refuse?

925
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:40,281
It's probably the last important
decision I shall ever make.

926
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:43,272
And it may well be the wisest.

927
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:04,990
[fire crackling]

928
01:13:06,793 --> 01:13:09,148
And you know
the rest, Miss Betsy.

929
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,764
When the English ship
I had boarded in trust

930
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,765
reached Plymouth Harbour,

931
01:13:14,832 --> 01:13:17,346
the First Sea Lord informed me

932
01:13:17,424 --> 01:13:20,313
that I was not
allowed to disembark,

933
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:25,160
scorning all laws of honour
and staining her flag forever.

934
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:27,281
England went back
on her word,

935
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:30,370
and turned me from
a guest into a prisoner,

936
01:13:30,446 --> 01:13:33,663
under house arrest
on the Island of St. Helena.

937
01:13:33,736 --> 01:13:35,662
- But St. Helena is better

938
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:38,742
than being locked up
in an English prison

939
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:40,404
or sent off to Russia!

940
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,906
- St. Helena is a prison.

941
01:13:41,974 --> 01:13:45,621
Your presence is the only thing
that makes it bearable for me.

942
01:13:46,857 --> 01:13:49,870
- Yes. We're really
good friends now.

943
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:53,990
When I think how scared of
you I was in the beginning!

944
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:56,956
But this is the last
time we'll see each other.

945
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:59,742
- Oh, this is another
one of your jokes.

946
01:13:59,814 --> 01:14:01,240
Weren't you satisfied

947
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:04,730
burning my fingers
with candle wax the other day?

948
01:14:04,796 --> 01:14:07,686
What a wicked little
English girl you are!

949
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:11,165
- We're going back to England.

950
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:13,225
My father has been
posted to London.

951
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,332
- At Hudson Lowe's request.

952
01:14:21,806 --> 01:14:24,956
He's doing all he can to isolate me,

953
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,782
sending away everyone
I care for.

954
01:14:28,849 --> 01:14:30,435
I know what he's doing.

955
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:34,294
Once there are no witnesses,
he will be free to carry out his...

956
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,019
evil deed.

957
01:14:38,085 --> 01:14:40,169
- What evil deed?

958
01:14:40,244 --> 01:14:41,433
[laughs]

959
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:42,833
The Governor is a goose!

960
01:14:42,902 --> 01:14:45,824
He's too silly to be
as devilish as you think he is!

961
01:14:45,892 --> 01:14:49,642
- He wants to kill me, Miss Betsy...

962
01:14:49,712 --> 01:14:53,325
by poisoning me
in small doses.

963
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,718
I don't know how he's
doing it, but the fact is...

964
01:14:56,788 --> 01:15:01,138
I'm growing weaker every day.

965
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:04,026
At night...

966
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:08,740
I have such pains in my stomach

967
01:15:08,815 --> 01:15:12,032
that I have to bite my sheets...

968
01:15:12,104 --> 01:15:14,493
to keep from screaming.

969
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,280
In London...

970
01:15:20,044 --> 01:15:22,400
when you hear of my death...

971
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:26,255
remember what l've
told you today.

972
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:30,638
Remember everything l've told
you during these last three years,

973
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:34,682
when you were kind enough
to keep me company so often.

974
01:15:39,113 --> 01:15:42,363
Will you be my message
in a bottle?

975
01:15:42,435 --> 01:15:46,251
Tell them all that
they were wrong about me.

976
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:51,066
That I'm not a monster.

977
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:57,645
Ah, we can't have
you going away

978
01:15:57,717 --> 01:16:00,197
with such a gloomy
impression of me.

979
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:03,955
And it's gloomy in here too,
so, Marchand, the lamp!

980
01:16:04,028 --> 01:16:07,415
- No, l'll do it!
Let me give you some light.

981
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:11,901
I'm afraid it's all I can
give you as a parting gift.

982
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:16,782
Have you finished
dictating your memoirs?

983
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:18,109
- Almost.

984
01:16:19,178 --> 01:16:21,691
- And what have you
said about me?

985
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:23,728
- Nothing.

986
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:27,676
- Because I'm not worth it?

987
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:31,928
Because you ruled the world
and I am just a stupid little girl?

988
01:16:33,029 --> 01:16:35,544
- The Imperial Crown of France

989
01:16:35,622 --> 01:16:39,269
will contribute
less to my legend

990
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:41,460
than the crown of thorns...

991
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:45,485
England forces me to wear now.

992
01:16:45,556 --> 01:16:47,344
But you are not a thorn,

993
01:16:47,415 --> 01:16:49,397
far from it.

994
01:16:50,604 --> 01:16:53,527
So you have no place
in my legend.

995
01:16:53,595 --> 01:16:56,913
But in my heart,
it's a different story.

996
01:16:59,675 --> 01:17:02,631
Your parting gift is beautiful.

997
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:06,051
What can I give you?

998
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,323
Can you see any trinkets
you'd like take away with you

999
01:17:11,401 --> 01:17:13,361
to remember me by?

1000
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:20,268
- Just give me a lock of your hair.

1001
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:10,493
[door slamming]

1002
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:15,080
[drum playing]

1003
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,642
- Do you think you could
see America, little general?

1004
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:10,199
[footsteps approaching]

1005
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,340
- ls that you, Marchand?

1006
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,238
- Yes, Sire.

1007
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:20,697
Is there anything I can
do for Your Majesty?

1008
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:22,158
- No.

1009
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,610
I'm very weary.

1010
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,830
I shall try to sleep.

1011
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,528
Tell me,

1012
01:19:31,595 --> 01:19:33,849
has it been raining
like that for long?

1013
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:36,909
- Raining?

1014
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:43,055
But Sire, it's very
fine weather today.

1015
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,472
The sun is shining.

1016
01:19:46,544 --> 01:19:49,093
Your Majesty must
be dreaming.

1017
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:07,171
[children's voices]

1018
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,441
[rhythmic clacking]

1019
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:16,800
[man:] Three, four!

1020
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:22,114
Forward!

1021
01:20:22,191 --> 01:20:24,808
Push! Push!

1022
01:20:26,643 --> 01:20:30,188
[man continues
shouting in distance]

1023
01:20:38,635 --> 01:20:41,614
- Welcome to
the Royal Military Academy, Sire.

1024
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:43,414
- This is my son, Napoleon.

1025
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:48,135
- l'll take good care of him.
Don't worry, Sire.

1026
01:20:48,204 --> 01:20:49,686
You should leave now.

1027
01:21:05,545 --> 01:21:07,866
[rain falling on roof]

1028
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,748
Everything here at
the Royal Military Academy of Brienne

1029
01:21:12,821 --> 01:21:16,706
works towards subjugating
character and suffocating pride.

1030
01:21:16,774 --> 01:21:20,024
The cell doors are locked at night.

1031
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:23,846
In case of absolute necessity,
you have a bell.

1032
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:26,996
Any misuse of it will
be severely punished.

1033
01:21:31,956 --> 01:21:33,812
[lock turning]

1034
01:21:47,038 --> 01:21:50,118
[groaning]

1035
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:54,038
[coughing]

1036
01:21:56,806 --> 01:21:58,731
[thunder clap]

1037
01:22:01,423 --> 01:22:03,178
- It's all right, Sire.

1038
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,435
You've just had a bad dream.

1039
01:22:05,509 --> 01:22:10,085
The storm will blow out to sea,
and it'll be sunny tomorrow.

1040
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,780
[wheezing]

1041
01:22:22,219 --> 01:22:23,475
[thunder]

1042
01:22:26,073 --> 01:22:30,116
I've had some good news from
the Comte de Montholon.

1043
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:34,610
Your dear mother is sending
you a new doctor from Italy...

1044
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,931
and also a priest.

1045
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:40,886
[thunder]

1046
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:52,544
[sighs]

1047
01:22:57,933 --> 01:23:01,251
[man:] And in this type of
cannon, fire makes the charge.

1048
01:23:01,322 --> 01:23:04,244
The shaft of light
pierces at an angle

1049
01:23:04,311 --> 01:23:06,599
from back to front.

1050
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,819
Here by the breach, gentlemen--

1051
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:12,011
You, over there.

1052
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:14,542
Are you not interested
in what I'm saying?

1053
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,935
- I know that already.

1054
01:23:16,004 --> 01:23:18,654
- Who do you think you are
to answer me like that?

1055
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:19,986
- I am a man.

1056
01:23:20,757 --> 01:23:23,270
[laughing and jeering]

1057
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:53,336
- The mad dog has gone
back into his kennel.

1058
01:23:55,704 --> 01:23:58,253
I doubt that we'll
see him again.

1059
01:23:58,363 --> 01:24:01,805
[groaning]

1060
01:24:13,809 --> 01:24:15,736
- No.

1061
01:24:15,804 --> 01:24:18,782
It helps me sleep.

1062
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:21,283
I would not
exchange my bed now

1063
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:23,899
for all the thrones in the world.

1064
01:24:24,009 --> 01:24:26,297
[clock ticking]

1065
01:24:41,682 --> 01:24:43,405
[squeaking]

1066
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:50,053
Not even the rats
are afraid of Napoleon.

1067
01:25:03,442 --> 01:25:06,693
[laughing and jeering]

1068
01:25:18,956 --> 01:25:21,007
[laughing]

1069
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:35,857
[screaming]

1070
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:50,214
- You call yourself a man?

1071
01:25:50,284 --> 01:25:53,931
All I see is a little boy
who cannot control himself.

1072
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:55,726
You will not go far, little fellow.

1073
01:25:55,799 --> 01:25:57,726
You will not go far.

1074
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,496
[groaning]

1075
01:26:15,964 --> 01:26:16,893
[gasps]

1076
01:26:18,556 --> 01:26:20,210
[inhales]

1077
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:24,026
- Head...

1078
01:26:25,965 --> 01:26:28,082
army.

1079
01:26:51,743 --> 01:26:53,601
[sobbing]

1080
01:27:21,676 --> 01:27:23,999
[bell tolls]

1081
01:27:39,217 --> 01:27:40,972
[bell tolls]

1082
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:44,588
[clock ticking]

1083
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:57,281
- Forty-nine minutes past five.

1084
01:28:08,053 --> 01:28:09,808
[bell tolls]
