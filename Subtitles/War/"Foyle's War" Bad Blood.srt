Simon.

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Morning, Mark.
How are you?

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,240
Just missed the quack.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,000
No change, I'm afraid.

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,400
But you are going to be all right?
Apart from being blind, you mean?

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
You shouldn't have done it.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,800
It's only temporary, Mark.
I'll be fine.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
What about the new test?

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
We're going ahead now.

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,680
Halliday in charge?
Yes.

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,200
He's got no bloody idea
what he's doing.

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,120
Do be careful, won't you?

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,400
You're a fine one to speak.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
Just keep an eye on him.

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Wind direction?

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
South-southeast.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,040
Perfect. Get on with it.
Captain -

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,600
I think this is not -
I have my orders, Wilcox. So do you.

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,000
Raise the red flag.

22
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you going to do the honours?

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
Ready?

INSECTS BUZZ

25
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
SAM: So how's your new billet?

26
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
FARNETTI: Better than the old one.

27
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
We're staying in this duke's place.

28
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Never seen a place so big
in my life. Or so damp.

29
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,480
It rained a lot last month.

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Yeah? Well, it looks like it rained
a lot for the last 1,000 years.

31
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
I have to tell you, I can't wait to
get back to California.

32
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,800
Do you mean that?

33
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,400
War can't last for ever.

34
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,280
I mean, specially
now that we're here.

35
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,280
You know - everything that's
happening in France.

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Things don't look too good for
Rommel in Africa.

37
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,760
Looks like things might work out
in Dieppe.

38
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm telling you, it's not going to
last much longer.

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,160
And then you'll shove off home,
I suppose?

40
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,880
You bet. Aw, man, I'm on the first
boat out of here.

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,200
Provided, that is, that you come
with me.

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Me?

43
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Come on, Sam.
You know how I feel about you.

44
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
You've only known me a short while.

45
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,800
Well... the best while of my life.

46
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
Come on. You've been cold and damp
and miserable.

47
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,880
Yeah. Cold and damp and miserable -

48
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,520
and more than a little grateful
to the Jerries

49
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
because without them,
I'd never have met you.

50
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Joe...
I mean it.

51
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I want you to marry me.

52
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,840
I want you to come home with me.
I want you to meet my family.

53
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,000
You got to meet my mom.

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
She's gonna love you.

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,400
I want you to have kids with me.
And I want to never let you go.

56
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,200
Is this a proposal?

57
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Well... I suppose...

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
I suppose it is.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,800
You want me to do it properly?

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,760
No.

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,880
No, it's too late.

62
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,360
Will you marry me, Sam?

63
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
I don't have a ring.

65
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
OK.

66
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,880
This sea shell will have to do,
right?

67
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,880
You're the most beautiful girl
I ever met

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,080
and I want to marry you.

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
What do you say?

70
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,080
Get up, Joe.
No.

71
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Not until you give me an answer.

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Is that a yes or a no?

73
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Morning, sir.

74
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Morning. What um...?

75
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
Orders from the Assistant
Commissioner, sir.

76
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,760
Forget the spivs, the racketeers
and all the rest of it.

77
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,520
What really matters is these new
fuel targets. Light bulbs.

78
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,080
I see.
You won't for much longer.

79
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Meant to be taking out half
the lights in the building.

80
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,320
So far, we're up to 40.

81
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Couldn't we just um...

82
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,800
not turn them on?

83
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
Need the bulbs, sir.

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Oh, right. Right. Tried my office?

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Wouldn't go in without your say-so,
sir. But if you can help...

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll take a look.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,040
Afraid that's not the end of it,
sir.

88
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,960
From now, the canteen will only
serve hot food three times a week.

89
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
So we can look forward to Spam
sandwiches all round.

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,520
Wonderful (!)

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,880
Mr Milner. Young lady to see you.

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Paul.

93
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,280
Edith. Edith Ashford.

94
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Yes.

95
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,400
You are still Miss Ashford?

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Yes. I'm not married.

97
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Gosh. I haven't seen you for what?
Eight years?

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,400
Nearly ten, I think.

99
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
I heard you were in the forces.

100
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,040
Yes, I was.

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,760
And then you came here. You always
said you wanted to be a detective.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
I did.

103
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,080
I... didn't know whether to come
or not.

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,040
The truth is...

105
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
I didn't have anyone else
to turn to.

106
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
Are you in trouble?

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
No. Not me. My brother.

108
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,920
Martin.

109
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
I didn't know if you'd remember him.

110
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,200
Of course I would. He was
the smallest boy in school.

111
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,360
He was only, what? Six or seven?
He was just starting when I left.

112
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
You were very kind to him.

113
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
That's one of the reasons I thought
of you.

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
Why? What's happened to him?

115
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
He's been arrested.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,440
He's been accused of murder.

117
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
My brother would never hurt anyone.

118
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,320
I mean, that's one of the reasons
he refused to fight.

119
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,480
He's a Quaker.
A conscientious objector.

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,640
That hasn't stopped him doing
his bit.

121
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,960
He's done firewatching,
and ambulance driving.

122
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,680
Now he's helping down at Foxhall
Farm.

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Well, I'm not entirely familiar
with the circumstances here,

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
but I gather it's a war hero

125
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,520
that your brother is accused
of murdering?

126
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,040
Tom Jenkins.

127
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,600
Royal Navy. Serving on the Navarino.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
Part of the convoy was sunk.

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,320
Martin didn't kill him.

130
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,640
I understand he was arrested
very shortly afterwards?

131
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Wrongfully arrested.

132
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,760
Have you spoken to him?

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,360
That's the trouble. He won't talk to
me. He won't talk to anyone.

134
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
Which might suggest

135
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,240
he's not quite as innocent as you
believe him to be?

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,800
I know Martin didn't do it.

137
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,880
He's three years younger than me.

138
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,960
I've looked after him all my life.

139
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,840
There's nothing I wouldn't do
for him.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,360
I know him.

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,600
And I know he wouldn't do this.

142
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm begging you to help.

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,320
Would you talk to him?

144
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, if he's not talking to anyone,

145
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
what makes you think he'll talk to
us?

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, he knew Paul.

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,480
I mean, Mr Milner.

148
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,040
We were close once. The two of us.

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,160
And he knew...

150
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,040
This might not be quite as easy
as you think. Um...

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,760
Martin was arrested further down
the coast, at Hythe.

152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,280
That's not in our jurisdiction.

153
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,360
But you must know people.

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
There's a policeman called Fielding.

155
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
DCS Fielding. Can't you talk to him?

156
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
Please.

157
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,520
I've got no-one else to turn to.

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,320
Please, tell me at least you'll try.

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm leaving, then.

160
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
Where are you going?

161
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,440
I had a call from Brian Jones.

162
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,120
Something's wrong with his cattle,
so I'm going to go to Foxhall.

163
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,440
You could come if you like.

164
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,560
No.

165
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
So what are you going to do?

166
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't know, Dad.

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,480
Are you just going to mope
around here all day?

168
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't know, Dad.

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Maybe I'll go out for a walk.

170
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,880
Don't worry about me.

171
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll see you, then.

172
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,160
Morning, Brian.

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
You made it, then.

174
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,320
I said ten o'clock, didn't I?

175
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,080
Where are they?
This way.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Come on, love. Come on, girl.

177
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,080
So what is it, then?

178
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm not sure.

179
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,600
That's not very good.

180
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,040
I'd say it's some sort of flu.
Not flu.

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,960
We don't know that.
Don't know anything very much, Ted.

182
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,040
And you say they all got it
at the same time?

183
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Within 24 hours.

184
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,560
It's unusual, a whole herd being
affected like this.

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
A herd? There are only six of them.

186
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,880
Let me look at the samples,
and I'll get back to you.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,760
All right.

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,480
You haven't had any other animals
here, have you?

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
No-one passing through?

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
Visitors?

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
Hm.

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,840
She's very sick.

193
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,000
I can see that.

194
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
You're unusually quiet.

195
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
Yes, sir.

196
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,920
Does that mean you're thinking?

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Yes.

198
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,240
Need any help?

199
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,840
No, thank you.

200
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,800
I just have to make up my mind about
something, and it's rather awkward.

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
I feel as though I've come
to a crossroads

202
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,000
and I'm afraid of making the wrong
turn.

203
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,760
We just have.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,160
You should have gone that way.

205
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,240
Hythe is left.

206
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,040
Oh. Sorry.

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,320
Someone get a stretcher,
for heaven's sake.

208
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Why isn't it here?
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,520
Foyle.

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,640
They told me at the station
this was where I'd find you.

212
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Who did you speak to? Henderson?

213
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,280
And he suggested you walk into the
middle of a murder investigation

214
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,920
without so much as a by-your-leave?

215
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,360
When did you find her?

216
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,960
Ten minutes ago.

217
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Then he wouldn't have known what
he was sending me into, would he?

218
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,280
You know her?

219
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
Who is she?

220
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,440
Her name is Joan Chaplin.

221
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,120
Prostitute. She works down the docks
in Dover.

222
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
Or used to.

223
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,160
Stupid bloody waste of life.

224
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,520
All right.

225
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
Get her out of there.

226
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,960
Where the hell have you been?

227
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,680
Well, if you're not interested in
her, what can I do for you?

228
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,320
Martin Ashford?

229
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,360
Oh, another murder case.
Local lad. Lives up your way.

230
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,080
The killing took place down here.
What do you want him for?

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,360
I don't. It's a personal connection.
The sergeant here knows his sister.

232
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,920
What's your name?

233
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Milner, sir.

234
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
I see, Milner.

235
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,680
So you know his sister.

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
Are you close?

237
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,880
We were childhood friends.

238
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,880
She came to me because she believes
Martin is innocent.

239
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,080
You want to reinvestigate the case?

240
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,120
I wouldn't put it like that exactly.

241
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,840
Have you nothing better to do
than rake over old ground?

242
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,800
Far from it.
I just wanted your opinion.

243
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,040
Milner's connection might be useful

244
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
if only to reassure the sister,

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,600
but if you don't want us under your
feet, I quite understand.

246
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
(COUGHS) It's getting a bit nippy.

247
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,800
The wind gets on my chest.

248
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,880
Do you mind if we talk inside?

249
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
Just the two of us.

250
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,320
What the hell you do think
you're doing?

251
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,560
I haven't seen you for the best part
of two years,

252
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,960
and you walk in here and show me up
in front of my men.

253
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
I haven't done anything of the sort.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
Look, I spoke to Edith Ashford
not once, but several times.

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
She gave me all that stuff
about her brother's innocence.

256
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,680
I didn't trust her.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,840
I didn't believe her, and frankly
I'm surprised that you do.

258
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Let me give you the facts.

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Thomas Jenkins and Martin Ashford

260
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,960
argued publicly and violently

261
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
and then they arranged to meet
that evening on the beach

262
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,280
to settle their differences.

263
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,320
That's where Jenkins was killed.

264
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,320
We know that Ashford was there.

265
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,480
He claims that he came upon
the body,

266
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,840
that Jenkins had been stabbed
by some sort of knife.

267
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,400
It took us a while to find it,

268
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,440
and the MO is trying to work out
what it is.

269
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
But I tell you where we found it.

270
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,080
It was half buried in woodland

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,560
not 200 yards from where Martin
Ashford lived.

272
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,720
Seems pretty straightforward.

273
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,280
Didn't find anything.
The prints had been wiped clean.

274
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,240
But we did find blood stains
on Ashford's clothing

275
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,960
and it matched those of the dead
man.

276
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,840
He didn't confess.

277
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,600
He hasn't denied it either, which
is more or less the same thing.

278
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
So, there you have it.

279
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,240
Pretty straightforward, I agree.

280
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,560
Now, would you tell me

281
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,840
what gives you the right
to drive over here

282
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,280
and question my judgement?

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,320
Not my intention.
No?

284
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,520
No. I told you I don't know
anything about this

285
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,160
apart from what the sister told me.

286
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,320
I came over here to ask if you,
as a friend,

287
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,520
would mind me speaking to the man,
to put her mind at rest

288
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
even if it meant telling her
that he's guilty.

289
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,280
But as you say, at the same time,

290
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
he hasn't confessed,
so it's possible I can help.

291
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,960
As a friend?

292
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,840
As a friend.

293
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
Do you remember me, Martin?

294
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,400
No.

295
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,600
Paul Milner.

296
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,880
We were at school together.
Ten years ago.

297
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,520
Your sister Edith came to see us.

298
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,280
Why?

299
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,040
Because she wants us to help you.

300
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
You can't help me.

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,840
Martin, did you kill Tom Jenkins?

302
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,040
No.

303
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,280
But you were there with him
on the beach?

304
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,800
Why won't you talk to us?

305
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,960
I've got nothing to say.

306
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Your sister thinks you're innocent.

307
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
She believes in you.

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,720
I'd say at the very least
you owe it to her to talk to us.

309
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,480
What rank are you, Milner?

310
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,560
I'm a sergeant.

311
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,600
Well, Sergeant Milner, I don't care
what Edith thinks,

312
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,120
and I don't know why you're here.

313
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
But I've just told you -
I've got nothing to say.

314
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,480
Someone perhaps
that you're... protecting?

315
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,960
Some argument with Jenkins?
What was that about?

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
The war.

317
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
You're a pacifist, aren't you?

318
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
That's not what he called me.

319
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,000
What did he call you?

320
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,120
Whatever it was, no good reason to
kill him, as far as I'm concerned.

321
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,280
I didn't kill him.

322
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Do you know who did?

323
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,480
You're working on a farm,
is that right?

324
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,280
Why are you asking me?

325
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,920
It's all in the report.

326
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Your sister doesn't believe
the report.

327
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,120
She doesn't know anything.

328
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,880
Neither do you.

329
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,720
I just want you to leave me alone.

330
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
DOG WHINES

331
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Edith!

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
Paul!

333
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Have you seen him?
Have you seen Martin?

334
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,760
Yes. We spoke to him earlier.

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
And?

336
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,360
I'm afraid he didn't have very much
to say.

337
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
But we're still looking into it.

338
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,720
How did you find me here?

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
I saw where you worked.
It's in the report.

340
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,000
And I thought it would be nice to
speak to you again

341
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,040
after all this time.

342
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm absolutely famished.

343
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
You can take me out for tea.

344
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,680
The Russians are losing,
aren't they?

345
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
The Germans have taken Sebastopol

346
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,040
and that other place -

347
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,960
I can never remember the names.

348
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,080
They say Stalingrad will be next.

349
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,120
Looks as if Joe's finished.

350
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,840
I'm sure it's not all bad news.

351
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
Africa is going our way.

352
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
I just want the war to be over.

353
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,320
It's so awful.

354
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,000
We get a lot of sailors in.

355
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,000
Merchant seamen.

356
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,560
They're burned.

357
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,480
They're half-drowned.

358
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,200
It's horrible, the things that have
happened to them.

359
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,920
When did you become a nurse?

360
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,600
Before the war.

361
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,760
My mother was sister-in-charge
at the same hospital.

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,760
Yes, I remember.

363
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
And you went straight
into the police?

364
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,280
More or less, yes.

365
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,280
I remember you after school.

366
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
You were always playing
Bulldog Drummond.

367
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Sniffing around in people's
back gardens.

368
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,960
The Lindens at No.27 - you were
convinced they were Bolsheviks.

369
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Was I?

370
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Martin used to keep lookout for me.

371
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,800
He didn't do it, Paul.

372
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
You believe me, don't you?

373
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
Mr Foyle thinks
he might be protecting someone.

374
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,120
Edie? Can you tell me? Is there
anyone he might be involved with?

375
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
No.

376
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,880
Are you sure?

377
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,520
Of course I am.

378
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
Then why won't he talk?

379
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Is that why you asked me out?

380
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,280
To question me?
No.

381
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,280
I wanted to see you again.

382
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,480
Tell me about California.

383
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
I've no idea what it's like.

384
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,120
What do you think?

385
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't know.

386
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,240
Oranges and movie stars?

387
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,280
(CHUCKLES)

388
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Everybody in huge cars.

389
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,760
Sure.

390
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,840
Even Lassie has his own limousine.

391
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,640
Tell me about the street
where you live.

392
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,720
No. I don't want to talk about it.

393
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,480
I haven't been home in nine months.

394
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,440
Why so long?

395
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,520
They trained us at Fort Benning,
Virginia,

396
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,520
and they shipped us out here.

397
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,360
Have you spoken to your parents?

398
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
They give us six minutes a week.

399
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
War is hell, right?

400
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,920
Hey, let's get an iced soda.

401
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,160
You'll be lucky. We haven't had
ice cream here since 1940.

402
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,920
And none of the pubs are open,
so don't ask for a beer.

403
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,720
I love this country, you know?

404
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,160
Everything about it is so...

405
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
What?
Impossible.

406
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
So have you thought about
what I asked you?

407
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,800
Of course I have.

408
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,680
I haven't thought about anything
else.

409
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,280
And?

410
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,560
You know I'm very fond of you, Joe.

411
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
But I hardly know you.

412
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
My mother would have a fit if I just
upped and left

413
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,720
without even introducing you first.

414
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,520
Well, we could get a horse and buggy

415
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
and have a dance
and invite all the neighbours.

416
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,720
You've been reading too much
Jane Austen.

417
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Yeah, well...

418
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,440
I would be exceedingly obliged,
Miss Stewart,

419
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
if you would be the next
Mrs Farnetti.

420
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh, stop it.

421
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Is that a yes or a no?

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,280
I don't know.

423
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,600
You'll have to give me more time,
I'm afraid.

424
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
You can have all the time you want.

425
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,880
Good.

426
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,480
Yeah?

427
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,160
Sir.

428
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,640
Is he after yours as well?
Yes, sir. He's got two of mine.

429
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
What does he do with them?
I have no idea.

430
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
Read that?

431
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,080
Yes, sir. Last night.
And?

432
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,680
I have to admit
DCS Fielding is right.

433
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
It does look pretty cut and dried.

434
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,760
Thomas Stephen Jenkins aged 26.

435
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,080
He was a fisherman before the war.

436
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,680
He joined the navy

437
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,640
and was a petty officer on convoy
duty on the Navarino

438
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
when it was sunk just
off the Kola Peninsula.

439
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,720
He was awarded the DSM.

440
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,600
He managed to break down
a burning door -

441
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,800
chopped the hinges off,

442
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,680
got 12 men to safety. They would
have died if it wasn't for him.

443
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,400
After that, he jumped overboard

444
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,640
and spent six hours
in freezing water.

445
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,240
He only survived because he managed
to cling to a piece of wreckage.

446
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,040
If you ask me, he deserved a medal
for that alone.

447
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,600
'He's married.

448
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,920
His wife is Elsie Jenkins, aged 23.

449
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,160
They have one child,
a boy of 18 months.

450
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,320
What about Martin Ashford?

451
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
Single.
Unattached as far as we know.

452
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,720
He used to work with Jenkins
before the war.

453
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,160
The two of them argued the evening
Jenkins got back from the palace.'

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
Not going to join us?

455
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,760
To be fair to Jenkins, he was drunk.

456
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,080
See that, Martin?

457
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,880
That was given to me by the King.

458
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,440
Now. Are you going to buy me
a drink?

459
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
You've had enough.

460
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
Are you ashamed to drink with me?

461
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,200
I understand that.

462
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,720
I mean, what have you ever done
for the war? Bloody conchie.

463
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,840
Leave him, Tom.

464
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,600
Leave him? Why should I leave him?

465
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,360
You know...

466
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,200
All those years I knew you,

467
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,160
I never put you down as a coward.

468
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,120
You're drunk.

469
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,960
In the morning I'll be sober.
You'll still be a bloody coward.

470
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,720
You don't know anything about me.

471
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,680
Half of my friends are dead.

472
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,000
They drowned.

473
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,560
They burned.

474
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,600
You, you're skulking away
up at Foxhall Farm

475
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
as if the war's nothing
to do with you.

476
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,760
If everyone was like you,
Jerry would be here.

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,120
Tom!

478
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Come on, Martin. Let's go home.

479
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,960
You may have a medal,
but I know you for what you are.

480
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,320
I don't give a damn about you.

481
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,840
You want to step outside?

482
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,920
I'll meet you any time, anywhere.

483
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm not afraid of you.

484
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,680
All right, then.

485
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,440
Midnight tonight.

486
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Down by the boat on the beach.
You and me.

487
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,080
Don't be silly. You don't have any
reason to fight.

488
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Getting your big sister to look
after you? That's brave.

489
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
I'll meet you.
No.

490
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,720
You heard what he called me.
So?

491
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,120
I'm not a coward.
Just forget it, Tom.

492
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Come and have another drink.

493
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,840
I'm waiting for an answer.

494
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,240
You want someone to take you down
to size, I'll do it.

495
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,040
I'm fed up with you, Jenkins.

496
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,360
We all are.

497
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,920
"I'm fed up with you, Jenkins.
We all are."

498
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,560
Half a dozen people heard him
say it.

499
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Not exactly proof of his guilt,
is it?

500
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
No. I agree.

501
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,920
Did Jenkins regularly accuse him of
cowardice

502
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,680
or did this come out of nothing?

503
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
Well, sir, they were both very
drunk.

504
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
So they met?

505
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
Yes.

506
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,000
'Martin Ashford left Foxhall Farm
just after 11 o'clock.

507
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,360
He was carrying something.
It may have been a knife.

508
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,760
He was seen leaving by the farmer,

509
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
a man called Brian Jones.

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
He is Thomas Jenkins' father-in-law.

511
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,280
Elsie Jenkins is his daughter.

512
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,120
We know that Thomas Jenkins
was on the beach at about 11:15.

513
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,000
He was seen by a warden
on his way home.

514
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,600
As to what happened next...'

515
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
Well, well, well...

516
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
So you turned up.

517
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,840
Now there's a surprise.

518
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,840
According to the police doctor,

519
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,880
the knife - whatever it was -

520
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
entered between the third and fourth
rib,

521
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
slanting upwards into the heart.

522
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Very precise. Could have been someone
with medical knowledge.

523
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,560
And the evidence against Ashford
again, in a nutshell, is...?

524
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
He was seen running away from the
beach.

525
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,440
Jenkins' blood was found later on
his clothes.

526
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,840
And the weapon was found in the
woodland at Foxhall Farm.

527
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,000
Right.

528
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,640
It doesn't look too good, does it,
sir? No.

529
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,600
Sure you want to go on with this?
Yes, sir.

530
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
KNOCKING

531
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,720
Sorry to disturb you, gentlemen.

532
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,960
I thought you might like to look
at this.

533
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,320
When they moved me out of London,

534
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,400
I never expected anything like it.

535
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,720
It's like something out of
the Wild West. Cattle rustling.

536
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Six animals were taken
while the farmer was in Hastings.

537
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
Do you want me to send someone up
there?

538
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,320
Er, no, we'll look into it.
Thank you.

539
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,320
Whatever you say, sir.

540
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,600
Are they for me?
Certainly are.

541
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,360
Oh, well done, sir.

542
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,280
What does he do with them?

543
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,160
Foxhall Farm.

544
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,680
Where's Sam?

545
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,360
Get off!

546
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,400
Go on, off! Go on. Shoo!

547
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,040
Shoo!

548
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,520
You took your time.
I'm sorry?

549
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,120
I was in Hastings yesterday.

550
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
I wasn't there more than a few hours

551
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
and here's something you need to
know.

552
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,600
There was a car parked as I left.
There were two men in it.

553
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
Now I think about it I get
the feeling

554
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,040
they were waiting for me to leave.

555
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,960
Mr Jones, I'm not here about that.

556
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
I thought you were the police.

557
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Yes, this is about the death
of Mr Jenkins.

558
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,800
What, you're here about Ashford?

559
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,200
That's right. He worked here?

560
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,880
He helped out. He had a room.

561
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,040
What more do you want to know?

562
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,000
He was quiet, he was a very good
worker.

563
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,000
He kept himself to himself, really.

564
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,760
You saw him leaving that night with
some knife or other, apparently?

565
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,560
He was carrying something long and
narrow.

566
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't know what it was,
it was dark.

567
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,960
Right.

568
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,560
What about Thomas Jenkins? Your
son-in-law, is that right? Yes.

569
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,040
Did you get on with him? Look, I've
just had six head of cattle

570
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,920
lifted from me in broad daylight.

571
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,760
Jenkins is dead, Ashford's in jail.
What more do you need?

572
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,480
Did you get on with him?

573
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,000
Of course, he was married to my
daughter.

574
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,680
You don't seem...very affected

575
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
by the death of your son-in-law, if
you don't mind me saying.

576
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
You don't know what I feel,
Mr Foyle,

577
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
and I'm not going to tell you.

578
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,360
Jenkins died out there on that
beach,

579
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,360
I suppose because somebody had
a grudge against him.

580
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,000
Now, what I'd like to know is, what
are you going to do about my cows?

581
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,720
DOOR OPENING

582
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,920
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Leonard Cartwright.

583
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,520
Cartwright, yes. The desk sergeant
told me.

584
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,880
I served with Tom Jenkins on the
Navarino.

585
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,280
Well, that's very nice for you,
Mr Cartwright,

586
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
but have you brought me any new
information?

587
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,720
Are you the officer in charge of
the investigation? Yes.

588
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,520
You're the one who arrested
Martin Ashford. Yes.

589
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,080
Well, you've made a mistake.
Have I?

590
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,080
Please, Mr Fielding, hear me out.

591
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,920
I owe my life to Tom Jenkins.

592
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,080
You know he was decorated for
bravery?

593
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,240
I was one of the people that he
saved.

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,080
Go on.

595
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,160
I was floating in the water
after we'd been torpedoed

596
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,520
and he helped me onto a raft.

597
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,120
If he hadn't,
I'd have frozen to death.

598
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,640
I'd imagine, then, that you'd have
every interest

599
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,800
in wanting his killer brought to
justice.

600
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,400
That's exactly the point, yes,
of course,

601
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,720
but the thing is, you see, I know
Martin Ashford.

602
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,720
I mean, Hythe is a small place.

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Everyone knows everyone,

604
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,120
and I know he couldn't possibly have
committed this crime.

605
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,280
Were you with him at midnight on
August 5th? No.

606
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,600
Well, were you on the beach?

607
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,720
Did you see who did it?

608
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,280
No! Ashford and I are both Quakers.

609
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,160
We went to the same meeting house.

610
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,800
You fought? Yes, I gave up my
religion when the war began.

611
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
With what was happening in the
world,

612
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,040
it just didn't seem relevant any
more.

613
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,880
But he didn't.
He's a pacifist.

614
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
Surely you can see what that means.

615
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,680
He doesn't have it in him to kill.

616
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,560
Thank you for coming in,
Mr Cartwright.

617
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,560
You haven't listened to me.

618
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,880
It doesn't matter what I just said.
I have listened to you.

619
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,600
You're wasting my time.

620
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,800
GOAT BLEATING

621
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,280
Do you like it?

622
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,000
Ow!

623
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,560
Six calves gone, disappeared into
thin air.

624
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,120
No-one cares! I think
it's a disgrace.

625
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,320
There's a war on. They're not just
cattle, they're a vital resource.

626
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,680
I understand. This place certainly
attracts a lot of traffic.

627
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,280
What are you talking about?
Do you know who that is?

628
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,480
Who? Is that the car you've been
talking about?

629
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,480
It might be.

630
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,920
Thank you.

631
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,760
Can you see that number?
BKR...721, sir.

632
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
Well done.

633
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,880
Oh, it could have been 712, I'm not
sure. That's helpful.

634
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,880
Check them both. Are you all right?
What have you done?

635
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,800
It's just a scratch, sir.
It's nothing.

636
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,480
ENGINE STARTING

637
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,760
DOG BARKING

638
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,480
Thank you for seeing me.
My door's always open, Wilcox.

639
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,760
How's Higgins?
No change, I'm afraid.

640
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,360
So, what can I do for you?
Captain Halliday,

641
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,720
this business at Foxhall Farm.
Oh, yeah.

642
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,640
I've seen the results of the test.
Four of the animals were infected.

643
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
Four out of six, yes.
That's unfortunate.

644
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,800
It's a little more than that.
What have you done with them?

645
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,840
We burned them.
Good.

646
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,000
But the farm may still be infected.
He had only the six cattle.

647
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,440
He had chickens, dogs, God knows
what else,

648
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,720
but there are people there, too.
We need to warn them.

649
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,760
You know that's out of the question,

650
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,080
unless you want to start a flap.
Won't that happen anyway?

651
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,760
The situation's under control,
Wilcox, that's all that matters.

652
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm sorry, sir, I don't agree.

653
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,360
This thing started because of
complete incompetence.

654
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,520
I think you should be careful what
you say.

655
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,760
I am your commanding officer.

656
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,360
Look, there's no need for us to fall
out.

657
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,720
We're on the same side, we have the
same aims.

658
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
We're keeping an eye on Foxhall.

659
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,200
I grant you we may have made a
mistake but we got away with it.

660
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,680
Terrible about Higgins. Is he going
to be all right?

661
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,480
I'll let you know...sir.

662
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,280
Mrs Jenkins?
Yes.

663
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,600
I'm a police officer.
Could I have a word?

664
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,880
You'll have to excuse me, Mr Foyle.
I'm not feeling at all myself.

665
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,840
I think I've picked up a summer
cold.

666
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,600
Are you on your own here?
I've sent Danny away.

667
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,360
He's my son. He's staying with my
mum.

668
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,600
(STIFLES COUGH)
Are you seeing a doctor?

669
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,680
No, it'll pass.

670
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,000
How can I help you?

671
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,760
This is about Tom, isn't it?
It is, yes.

672
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
Have you found the man who did it?

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,720
Well, a man's been arrested.

674
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,920
Martin Ashford didn't kill
my husband.

675
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,920
I told the other policeman that.

676
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,720
I know him. His sister's a friend
of mine, a good friend.

677
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
I've known her all my life.

678
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,720
Look, I was there when they had that
stupid row in the King's Arms.

679
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,200
It was all Tom's fault.

680
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,200
He'd had a bit too much to drink,
and he could be like that sometimes.

681
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,640
Didn't Ashford threaten him?
Not really.

682
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,960
If anything it was the other way
round.

683
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,480
But neither of them meant anything
by it,

684
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,840
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

685
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,160
It was all just talk.

686
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,440
Tell me about your husband.

687
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,440
He was very good to me.

688
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
Kind.

689
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,840
Generous.

690
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,720
Did you go to the Palace with him?
Of course I did.

691
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,360
They say that 12 men were saved,
thanks to him.

692
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
I was very proud.

693
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm sorry, Mr Foyle, I think I need
to lie down.

694
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes, I understand.

695
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,680
You should see a doctor.

696
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,600
Thank you. Goodbye.

697
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,960
Mr Foyle, you have
Chief Superintendent Fielding
waiting for you, sir.

698
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,040
I put him in your office.
Thank you.

699
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,760
Not the most friendly of chaps,
I wouldn't have said. Neither am I.

700
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,520
Just tipping you the wink, sir, if
you catch my drift. I understand.

701
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,200
Sir, the car you saw outside
Foxhall Farm

702
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,880
belongs to a man called Henry
Styles. Anything on him?

703
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,080
Nothing on record.
Might be a government connection.

704
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,640
There aren't many cars around now
there's no basic petrol ration.

705
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Did you get an address?
He's here in Hastings.

706
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,840
Good evening.

707
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I haven't been here for a very long
time.

708
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,920
No, you used to drop in a lot more
often.

709
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,080
Drink?
What have you got?

710
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,360
Well, half an inch of Scotch.
I'll take it.

711
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,400
I thought you might.

712
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,480
I wanted to know how
the investigation's going.

713
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Do you still think I've got
the wrong man? Did I say that?

714
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,240
No, I told you exactly
how I got involved

715
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,240
and, quite frankly, I'm beginning to
regret it.

716
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,720
Why?

717
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,560
Well, it's clearly irritated you.

718
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,880
You still haven't answered
the question.

719
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,440
Do I still think you've got
the wrong man?

720
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,840
Well...

721
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,920
Do sit down.

722
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,200
There are certainly one or two things
about it that struck me as odd.

723
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,560
Yes? No-one seems to give a damn
about the murdered war hero.

724
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,560
They're all far too concerned

725
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,760
about it not being Martin Ashford
who did it. That's true.

726
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,640
The father-in-law, the wife - They
said the same when I spoke to them.

727
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,040
I was with the wife earlier,
Jenkins's wife.

728
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,240
Not a photograph of her husband
to be seen.

729
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Well, it's too painful. She can't
bear to see him. Perhaps.

730
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,200
Are you going to stick with it?
Would you rather I stopped?

731
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,080
I'm retiring, you know.

732
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,280
I didn't know.

733
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,680
End of the year.

734
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,040
I'm fed up with it, if you want
the truth.

735
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,080
Fed up with the whole thing.

736
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,080
(STIFLES COUGH)

737
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,120
I've been in this job too long.

738
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,320
20-odd years, same as you.

739
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,480
I don't see the point any more.

740
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,240
So, it's time to go.

741
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,640
I thought you might like this.

742
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,240
It's the murder weapon.

743
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,320
It's called a trocar.

744
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,360
Vets use them on cattle.

745
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,240
Do we know any vets?

746
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,600
I had a visit earlier today from a
young man called Leonard Cartwright.

747
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,880
He served with Jenkins on
the Navarino

748
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,520
and he's saying exactly the same
thing...

749
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,880
Jenkins was a good man, but Ashford
didn't kill him,

750
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,960
I've got it wrong.

751
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,600
And...?

752
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,000
His father's a vet.

753
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,640
Mr Foyle. Good evening.
Are you waiting for Sam?

754
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,160
Yes, sir. We're supposed to be
seeing a movie,

755
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,040
but we're going to be late.

756
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
What are you going to see?
Saboteur.

757
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,200
I would have preferred a comedy
but Sam likes a good mystery.

758
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
I've noticed.

759
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,520
Joe.
Hey!

760
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,200
We're going to be late.
Are you all right?

761
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,760
No, I'm not. Joe, I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to stand you up.

762
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,480
I feel rotten. I think I've got flu.

763
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
Let me walk you home.
It's all right,

764
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,560
I'll...drive Mr Foyle home and then
I'll drive myself.

765
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,920
Are you all right to drive?
Absolutely.

766
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,440
Then drive yourself home and go
to bed, I'll walk.

767
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,680
Are you sure, sir?
Of course.

768
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,320
Joe -
It's OK, don't worry about it.

769
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,280
Erm... I'll see you tomorrow.

770
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
Which way are you going?

771
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,560
We're making good progress now,
with the weather clearing up.

772
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,520
It helps that the locals have
stopped shooting at us.

773
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,720
So, are you getting used to
the English?

774
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,880
I don't know if I'll ever do that,
sir.

775
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,880
One of these days I'll come back
here

776
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,760
and open a business selling heating
and plumbing appliances.

777
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,840
I think I'll make a fortune.

778
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,120
People being kind to you?
Yes, very kind they are, sir.

779
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,080
I should tell you, sir, my
intentions towards Miss Stewart

780
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,480
are completely honourable.
You don't need to tell ME that.

781
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,520
Her father might be interested,
though.

782
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,600
The way she talks about you
sometimes,

783
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,880
you could almost be her father.
Well...

784
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,040
She very much admires you, sir.
Yeah...

785
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,400
So, you've been seeing a lot of each
other, yeah?

786
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,400
I've asked her to marry me.

787
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,840
Right.

788
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,160
The crossroads!

789
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,360
She hasn't given me an answer,
but...

790
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,320
Well, the very best to both of you,
whatever she decides. Thank you, sir.

791
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,440
This is me.

792
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,400
I'd better get back to base.
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye.

793
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Good evening, Christopher. Did you
get the book? I did, thank you.

794
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,600
Doctor, how is Mrs Jenkins?

795
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,760
You know her?
She's a friend of mine.

796
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,840
She is not at all well, I'm afraid.

797
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,400
She didn't look well when I saw her
this morning.

798
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,480
She said she had a cold.
What's wrong?

799
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,160
At this stage I can't be sure.
Emphysema, perhaps.

800
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,320
I'll examine her again in the
morning.

801
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,920
Has her father been to see her?

802
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,320
He spent an hour with her
this afternoon.

803
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,200
He's worried sick, poor man.
I can't blame him.

804
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,000
I wish I knew what was wrong with
her

805
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,240
but I've never seen anything like it
before. Can I see her?

806
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,240
Two minutes, no more.

807
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,120
(I've come to see Mrs Jenkins.)

808
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,760
Elsie.

809
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,560
Can you hear me?

810
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,720
Edie...

811
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,760
They only told me just now
you were here.

812
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,520
Have you seen him?

813
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,560
Who?

814
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,840
Martin.

815
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,880
Don't worry about him, Elsie, not
now.

816
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,960
(WHEEZING)
Where's Danny?

817
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,960
With my mum.

818
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm so ill.

819
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,520
I don't know...

820
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,800
I can't breathe.

821
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,720
You're going to be fine.
I've spoken to the doctor.

822
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,120
He's going to have another look at
you tomorrow.

823
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,720
I'm frightened.
Don't be.

824
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,760
I'll stay with you.

825
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,040
What is it, Edie?

826
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,880
What's wrong with me?

827
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,920
It's flu.

828
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,960
It's nothing.

829
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
It's nothing serious.

830
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,120
Miss Stewart didn't sound at all
good this morning, sir.

831
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,640
Very under the weather. I told her
not to worry about anything.

832
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,520
Suits me to get out from behind
a desk once in a while.

833
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,080
Settling in?
Not really.

834
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,960
It's a bit too quiet down here,
if you want the truth.

835
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,120
But there you go.

836
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,240
Next left.

837
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,680
Yes, of course I heard about the
death of Tom Jenkins.

838
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,360
It's a dreadful business,

839
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,760
but I'm not sure how I can help you.

840
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,720
Do you recognise this?

841
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,720
Why, yes, of course,
it's a... It's a trocar.

842
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,840
Hang on.

843
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,680
It's mine. Or it damn well looks
like it. I lost it weeks ago.

844
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,320
Where did you find it? I'm afraid it
was used to kill Tom Jenkins.

845
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,200
No?!

846
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,640
Where did you last see it?
I don't know.

847
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,040
I suppose it would have been
Foxhall Farm, Brian Jones's place.

848
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,600
One of his cows had bloat.

849
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,640
A few days later I noticed
it wasn't in my bag.

850
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,280
DOOR OPENS

851
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,000
Len, this is a police officer.
He's asking questions about Tom.

852
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,080
This is my son.

853
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,960
How do you do?
Hello.

854
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,920
You were on the Navarino together,
I gather. Yes. Who told you?

855
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,920
Is that how you got that?

856
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,520
Yes, it happened when we went down.

857
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,320
How did it happen?

858
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,080
Uh... A piece of shrapnel, I think.
I don't really know.

859
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
It was all a bit of a mess.
Len.

860
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,760
You don't have to talk about it.

861
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,560
No, it's all right, Dad, I want to.

862
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,920
Um... We'd set off from Iceland,
heading north.

863
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,840
We were on damage duty, assigned to
protect merchant ships.

864
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,800
30 ships.

865
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,160
Convoy PQ17.

866
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,640
We were heading for Murmansk,

867
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,720
but the...

868
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,400
Well, the Jerries were at us
more or less at once...

869
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,440
and er...we managed to keep them off
for a while

870
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,720
but...on the third day they hit us.

871
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,760
A Yank ship, the Christopher
Newport,

872
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,320
was one of the first to go down.

873
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,440
I er... I saw it.

874
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,280
I didn't realise that we'd be next.

875
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,440
It was late in the day and a whole
bunch of planes just came at us,

876
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,600
firing God knows how many torpedoes,

877
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,480
one of which hit the Navarino.

878
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
(HEARING EXPLOSION) I managed to
make my way onto the deck.

879
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,400
Tom had been on the bridge,

880
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,480
and er...

881
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,360
the next thing I knew I was in
the water and it was...

882
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,400
..it was dark and it was cold.

883
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,160
Ice... Ice-cold.

884
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,880
I've... I've never been so cold.

885
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,240
They say that you can last half an
hour in the water if...

886
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,480
Well, if you weren't pulled out
after that, you'd freeze to death.

887
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,480
Erm...

888
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,560
And Tom found me.

889
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,240
He managed to get me onto
a life-raft and that was that.

890
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,720
Did you mention that to the police?

891
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,080
Oh, yes, to Superintendent Fielding.
Mm.

892
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,800
We want to know who killed Tom,
we all do.

893
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,560
But at the same time, I know it
can't have been Martin.

894
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,600
It just doesn't make sense.

895
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,480
Excuse me, I understand you have
a patient here,

896
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,400
a young woman from Foxhall Farm.

897
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,440
I don't -
Elsie Jenkins.

898
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,560
Oh, yes, she works on a farm,
I believe. She lives in Hythe.

899
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,160
I wonder if I might see her.
Are you a relative?

900
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,640
A friend. I'm afraid she's not well
enough to see anyone at the moment.

901
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,160
Can I at least look in on her for
a moment? It is very important.

902
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,360
I'm sorry, I've just explained. Mrs
Jenkins is too ill to see anyone.

903
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,800
Here we are, sir.

904
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,440
He rents this place, does he?
Yes, sir, just the ground floor.

905
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,600
Good morning. Mr Styles?
Yes.

906
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,960
Could we have a word?
We're from the police.

907
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,000
Check the back, sir?
Yeah.

908
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,880
Hold on, you!

909
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,720
Awwww!

910
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,480
What happened?
He got away. I wasn't expecting...

911
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,720
Are you hurt?
Just my pride, sir.

912
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,720
Sorry, I'm a bit off my patch.

913
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,720
Yes, it's a bit quiet here, isn't it?

914
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,800
Where did he come from?
The back door.

915
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,160
A writer.

916
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,280
A journalist, perhaps?

917
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,440
I'll check the local papers.

918
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,520
Scientist, maybe?

919
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,680
"Science And War",
"Science And World Order".

920
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,920
I wonder what he was so afraid of.

921
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Well, he won't get far.

922
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,080
The same meeting house as...
Martin Ashford?

923
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,360
They're both Quakers.

924
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,680
Styles was watching the farm where
Ashford lived.

925
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,400
He may have been there when the cows
were stolen.

926
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,360
German.

927
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,120
"Luftgas Angriff..."

928
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
We should find this man.

929
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,000
(DESPERATE WHEEZING)

930
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,600
Dead...
Elsie.

931
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,920
Dead! Dead in the...
It's all right.

932
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,200
In the road.
What's in the road?

933
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,080
The sheep.

934
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,320
Don't talk.

935
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,440
Dead in...

936
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,680
Doctor Brindley!

937
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,280
Any word?
From Sam, sir? No.

938
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,520
I'm getting worried. Get somebody to
check she's all right.

939
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,520
Sir, I found this out the front,
it's addressed to you.

940
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,600
See who delivered it?
No, sir, slipped under the door.

941
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,760
Right, thank you.

942
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,160
What do you make of that?

943
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,760
"I saw Tom Jenkins die. It was
a tall man on the beach,

944
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,720
blond hair. He had a knife."

945
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,440
Not exactly a description of
Martin Ashford.

946
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,560
It's some sort of chemical. Ether,
perhaps?

947
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,400
It could be from a hospital.
Edith's a nurse, isn't she?

948
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,360
Edie, is there somewhere we can
talk?

949
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,800
I didn't send this.
Why would I have sent it?

950
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,520
Well, if it's true, it exonerates
your brother.

951
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,680
Why can't it be true? Maybe it is.
I'd like to think so.

952
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,480
But...?

953
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,320
The description. Tall, blond hair.

954
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,840
The exact opposite of Martin.
It's as if someone

955
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,160
was deliberately trying to throw us
off track.

956
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,320
You think it was me?

957
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,200
The paper's been in contact with
some sort of chemical. Ether.

958
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,760
It's not just hospitals that use
ether.

959
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,200
Edie, when you first came to me

960
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,480
you said that you'd do anything for
Martin.

961
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,520
It's true, I would. Then why
don't you tell me the truth?

962
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,560
I have!
No, you haven't.

963
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,680
I asked you if Martin was involved
with anyone and you said he wasn't.

964
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,360
Are you calling me a liar?

965
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes, I am.

966
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,880
I could tell, Edie. People lie to me
all the time, it's part of my job.

967
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,640
You've changed.

968
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,680
You came to me for help.

969
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,920
You knew how I felt about you and
you used me.

970
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,920
No!

971
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,880
Was Elsie Jenkins having an affair
with your brother?

972
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,800
The way that Tom and Martin argued
at the King's Arms,

973
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,880
there was no reason for it.

974
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,040
It just sprang up out of nowhere

975
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,520
and suddenly they were threatening
each other.

976
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,280
There had to be something else,
some other animosity between them.

977
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,000
It's the only way to make sense of
what happened.

978
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,000
Yes.

979
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,480
For how long?
A year.

980
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,560
While Tom was away.
And why didn't you tell me?

981
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,640
I thought...

982
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,200
I thought you'd think that was why
Martin killed him.

983
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,680
Did you write this?

984
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,680
No.

985
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,360
I promise you.

986
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,600
That's all I need to know.

987
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Where will you go now?

988
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,320
I have to speak to Elsie Jenkins.
You can't.

989
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,200
I thought you knew. I assumed that
was why you were here. Knew what?

990
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,280
Elsie was ill.

991
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,800
She had some kind of pneumonia.

992
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,880
She came in last night.

993
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,960
And this morning...

994
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,200
..she died.

995
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,040
What did she die of?
We still don't know.

996
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,440
It was a respiratory illness.
Pulmonary fever, perhaps.

997
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,200
But there were also blisters on the
skin which I didn't recognise.

998
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,880
Woolsorter's disease is
a possibility.

999
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,080
There will have to be a full
inquest.

1000
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,400
There have been no other cases?
No, thank God.

1001
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,680
Can you tell me anything she might
have said

1002
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,880
that will tell you how she
contracted it?

1003
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,880
No.

1004
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,840
Right at the end, she was saying
something about a sheep.

1005
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,280
That's what made me think of
woolsorter's disease.

1006
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,560
Her father has a farm, I believe.

1007
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,840
Can you tell me exactly what she
said?

1008
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,640
There was nothing exact about it.

1009
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,400
She mentioned a sheep in the road.

1010
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,280
She said she tried to lift it, I
think.

1011
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,840
That's about all there was to it.

1012
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Right. Thank you.

1013
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
I have some very bad news for you.

1014
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Elsie Jenkins...er...
I understand you were close.

1015
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,960
She became very ill

1016
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,480
and was admitted to hospital.

1017
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,760
She died this morning.
What?

1018
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,680
And I'm sorry.

1019
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,760
What happened to her?
They don't know.

1020
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,680
Dead?
They did what they could.

1021
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,240
Elsie.

1022
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,920
When did your affair begin?

1023
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,360
Your sister told us.

1024
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,360
A year ago in the summer.

1025
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,840
Starting an affair with a woman whose
husband's away fighting a war

1026
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,000
is not exactly the sort of behaviour

1027
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,480
that endears people to pacifists,
is it?

1028
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,760
I knew the truth about Tom Jenkins.

1029
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,840
I knew what he was doing to Elsie.

1030
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,640
He was a brute.

1031
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,120
He drank. He was a bully.

1032
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,920
He beat her.

1033
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,920
Even when she was expecting his
baby.

1034
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,240
It is his?
Yes.

1035
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,760
She's not really dead?

1036
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,120
You're lying to me.
This is some sort of trick.

1037
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,520
Listen, we don't have to talk about
this now. We can come back.

1038
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,600
No.

1039
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,480
I've been sat in this stinking room
long enough.

1040
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,320
I'll tell you.

1041
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,480
She didn't want me to fight.

1042
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
She tried to stop me.

1043
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,200
Don't go to the beach.

1044
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,200
He's just looking for the excuse.
We can't go on like this.

1045
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,360
We've got to have it out.
Please, Martin.

1046
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,280
I'm begging you. I know him.
I know what he's like.

1047
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,680
If you fight him, you won't walk
away. I can look after myself.

1048
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,600
He'll kill you.
He can try.

1049
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,400
Oh, God. Why did I have to meet him?

1050
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,480
How could I let myself -

1051
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,000
MARTIN: I went back to Foxhall Farm
and got a torch.

1052
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,920
I didn't want to go there in the
dark.

1053
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,800
It must have been about twenty past
eleven when I arrived.

1054
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,880
I started making my way over to the
boat

1055
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,880
and I heard someone running away.

1056
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,640
Jenkins!

1057
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,640
(LOW MOAN)

1058
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,080
Elsie.

1059
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,480
Elsie.

1060
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,680
That was all he said.

1061
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,320
So, you thought she'd killed him.

1062
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,320
He spoke her name.

1063
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,640
And then you took the knife?
Yes. I wanted to protect her.

1064
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,680
Is that how you got the blood on
your clothes?

1065
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,280
Yes.
And you hid it -

1066
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,280
At Foxhall Farm.

1067
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,920
Leonard Cartwright - Know him?

1068
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,440
Yes, of course I know him.
He went to the same meeting house.

1069
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,720
But then he left. He joined up.

1070
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,640
Still friends? Yes. We had different
beliefs, that's all.

1071
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,960
Henry Styles mean anything to you?
I remember seeing him.

1072
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,920
I don't think we ever spoke.

1073
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,960
Listen, can I see her?

1074
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,840
Well...

1075
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,160
You've been obstructing a police
enquiry

1076
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,240
but I'll see what I can do.

1077
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,160
I wasn't gonna let them rest.

1078
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,520
I'm sorry.

1079
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,240
So, where are you going, sir?

1080
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,560
To London.
On what business?

1081
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,640
Er... It's... It's private.

1082
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,360
I'm afraid that's not good enough,
sir. Can I see your identity papers?

1083
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,120
Er...no, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

1084
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,440
Sir, could you get out of the car?

1085
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,600
(GASPS)

1086
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,040
Are you all right?
I think I need to see a...doctor.

1087
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,520
She's very seriously ill,
I'm afraid.

1088
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,080
I should warn you that we had
another young woman in here

1089
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,960
just 24 hours ago, seemingly with
the same condition,

1090
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,000
and I'm afraid she didn't make it.

1091
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,560
Hello, sir.
Don't. Don't. Don't move.

1092
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,080
How are you?

1093
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,920
I think I'm going to need a couple
of days off work, sir.

1094
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,080
Oh, as many as that?

1095
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,160
I think I've got flu.

1096
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,280
I don't know about these, though.

1097
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,320
Do you remember doing that?

1098
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,680
At Foxhall Farm.
How did you do it?

1099
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,520
I cut my wrist on some barbed wire.

1100
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,920
Do you think I've got an infection?

1101
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:06,200
Well, just rest and erm...
let these people look after you. Hm?

1102
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,520
Righto, sir.

1103
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,880
A couple of days, no more,
all right?

1104
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,760
I only just got word.
Now, where is Sam?

1105
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,080
Well, I've just been with her.
She's erm... And?

1106
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,160
Well, she's very ill. Speak to the
doctor. What's wrong with her?

1107
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,600
Er, they don't seem to know.

1108
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,520
Mr Foyle?

1109
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,320
Am I gonna lose her?

1110
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,280
Speak to the doctor.

1111
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,840
Sir, they found Styles.
He was trying to leave Hastings.

1112
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,040
Picked up by the Home Guard.
Where is he?

1113
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,000
He's at the station.

1114
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,120
I need your help.

1115
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,960
I'm not saying anything.

1116
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,760
There's a woman very ill in hospital.

1117
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,560
I think you know what's wrong with
her.

1118
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,640
She's very ill as a result of cutting
herself on barbed wire at Foxhall
Farm.

1119
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,480
She's got a fever and
she has difficulty breathing.

1120
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,920
And I need your help because another
woman at the same hospital

1121
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,080
with the same symptoms has just died.

1122
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,840
This is some sort of ploy to get me
to talk. No, it's not.

1123
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,600
I know who you are.

1124
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,600
You want me to disappear.

1125
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,400
I know why you came to my house.

1126
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,880
I came to your house because a man
had been murdered

1127
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,400
and although this has nothing to do
with you,

1128
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,520
we believe you could well know
the person arrested for it.

1129
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,520
You're a Quaker, aren't you?

1130
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,920
We think you use the same meeting
house as this person. Martin Ashford.

1131
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,000
Look, whether you did or you didn't,
it's irrelevant.

1132
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,720
The only reason you're here is
because we need your help.

1133
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,400
How did you know where I lived?

1134
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,400
I saw your car at Foxhall Farm.
We got your address
from the registration.

1135
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,040
What were YOU doing there?

1136
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,320
I was there for the same reason I was
at your house. Martin Ashford.

1137
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,960
He was having an affair with a woman
who worked there.

1138
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,760
The same woman that just died from
the same condition

1139
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,240
contracted at the same farm as this
woman who now needs your help.

1140
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,520
Erm...

1141
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,800
..Does she...have black sores on her
face or her arms? Yes.

1142
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,280
Anthrax.

1143
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,280
Anthrax?
It's a living bacterium.

1144
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:12,160
A spore-forming microbe found in the
soil.

1145
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,160
It can be cultivated and then used.

1146
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,440
It's an invader. Put it into
a hostile environment

1147
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,400
and it curls itself up into a little
ball and protects itself.

1148
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,480
It... It develops an outer skin.

1149
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,240
It's very stable.

1150
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,000
Heat and light can't hurt it.

1151
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,000
It survives for years.

1152
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,640
Also, it kills.

1153
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,840
That's why they want it.
Who?

1154
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,440
They wanted me to work for them
but I said no.

1155
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,000
I wasn't having any of it.

1156
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,400
What's the world coming to if
we allow such things, hm?

1157
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,640
Death by disease and invisible
killers. It's less than human.

1158
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,160
It makes us worse than the Nazis.

1159
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,680
These two women have been infected
at the same farm.

1160
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,880
Could they have a laboratory?
Some sort of base nearby?

1161
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,400
I've been watching them.

1162
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,640
I followed them up to that farm.

1163
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,920
They can't even control
the infection.

1164
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,000
They're incompetent.

1165
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,680
Where do I find them?

1166
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,080
I'm sorry. There's no admittance
beyond this point.

1167
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,280
You have a commanding officer name of
Halliday. I want to speak to him.

1168
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,400
I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.

1169
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,440
There's been an outbreak of anthrax
in Hastings and he's responsible.

1170
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,640
If I'm not in his office in two
minutes, I'll be back with the army,

1171
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,160
police, Home Guard and press.

1172
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,240
Do you want to convey this to him at
your earliest opportunity?

1173
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,960
Sir.

1174
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,440
I don't need to tell you that if you
repeat anything you hear,

1175
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,040
the world will fall in on you
from a very great height.

1176
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
Will it?

1177
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,560
No, no, you don't understand.

1178
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,400
This is not just classified. It's
not just another secret of the war.

1179
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,560
Not even the Prime Minister knows
what we're doing here. It's true.

1180
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,360
They haven't told him yet. Hopefully
they'll never have to.

1181
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,080
Well, what you don't understand

1182
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,000
is that I don't care what falls on me
from a very great height.

1183
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,240
Neither do I care who doesn't know
what.

1184
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,800
I know that you're responsible for
the death of one young woman and the
potential death of another

1185
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,080
and unless you tell me what's
happened,

1186
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,800
everybody's going to know at least
as much as I do.

1187
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,360
There was an accident. We were
experimenting with a flock of sheep.

1188
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,920
What does that mean, exactly?

1189
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,440
We killed them. We were then asked
to send the carcasses to another
establishment for testing.

1190
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,240
I was against it from the start.

1191
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,600
Hardly relevant.

1192
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,600
One of them fell off the lorry.

1193
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,360
We knew at once what had happened
when a count was made

1194
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,480
but by then the infected animal had
been taken to a farm.

1195
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,840
We kept the farm under observation
and when the cattle fell ill,

1196
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,520
we moved in and removed them.

1197
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,600
We wanted to stop the infection
spreading.

1198
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,320
And what infection is this?

1199
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,280
We're talking about a toxin that
goes by the name of anthrax.

1200
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,880
If you breathe it in, you're 99%
certain to die almost at once.

1201
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,440
Cutaneous infection, through the
skin, is less rapid.

1202
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,800
But still fatal?

1203
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,120
Well, that depends.

1204
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,880
On what?
We're not sure.

1205
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,440
The general health and fitness of
the victim can make all the
difference.

1206
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,160
This stuff is being developed for
what? For the war?

1207
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,920
The French were developing it before
us. When the Germans invaded France,

1208
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,120
all their expertise fell into Nazi
hands.

1209
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,120
The Germans were experimenting with
bacteriological weapons

1210
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,520
on the Paris Metro and London
Underground almost ten years ago.

1211
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,120
At least, that's what we believe.
Retaliation.

1212
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,840
They do it to us, we must be
prepared to do it to them.

1213
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,360
Right. You've developed this stuff.
What's the cure?

1214
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,760
Higgins may be able to help you.

1215
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,120
Who's he?

1216
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,720
Simon Higgins.
He's an epidemiologist.

1217
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,880
He knows more about this
than almost anyone.

1218
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,120
Is he here? You're not speaking to
Higgins, not without my authority.

1219
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,800
Oh, I see. Why would that be?

1220
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,800
And let you go ploughing in

1221
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,680
with your damn fool questions
and moral outrage?

1222
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,280
Maybe you should try and understand
us a bit more.

1223
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,520
The Germans bombed London.

1224
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,560
They bombed London for months and
months.

1225
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,240
They smashed buildings, churches,
hospitals, totally indiscriminate

1226
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,640
and what about the victims? If they
weren't killed immediately,

1227
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,360
they lay there in the wreckage
burnt, limbs missing,

1228
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,960
in terrible pain
and what happened to them?

1229
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,400
The sewage and water systems were
smashed up and not surprisingly,

1230
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,680
a great many of them got blood
poisoning. The point being what?

1231
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,960
Why not go straight to the blood
poisoning?

1232
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,360
Easier all round.

1233
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,400
Less expensive.
Less long-term damage.

1234
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,000
I think if people knew what we were
trying to do here, they might be
grateful.

1235
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,160
Where's Higgins?

1236
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,920
Streptomycin.
What's that?

1237
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,080
If there are any traces of anthrax
left on her skin, it will kill her.

1238
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,880
She should be washed,
thoroughly washed

1239
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,840
and she needs a large dose of
streptomycin.

1240
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,800
It's not infallible but it has
occasionally done the trick.

1241
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,080
Are they'll have this stuff
at the hospital?

1242
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,880
Maybe not.

1243
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,640
We keep supplies here.

1244
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,600
Mark?
I'll be right back.

1245
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,680
Mr Foyle?
Yes.

1246
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,240
I'm very sorry.
This is all MY fault.

1247
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,560
Is it?
Well, I'm team leader here.

1248
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,040
But I was a little careless.

1249
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,440
I was testing a new compound,
what we call organophosphate.

1250
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,520
Nerve gas.
What? On yourself?

1251
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,680
Yes. Ten minutes in the gas chamber.

1252
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,320
But I must have been in there
a couple of minutes too long

1253
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,240
cos I seem to have blinded myself,
temporarily, I think.

1254
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,960
Although it has been two weeks now.

1255
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,160
Anyway, it means I wasn't on hand
to oversee the anthrax trials.

1256
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,960
Halliday is a complete BF.

1257
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,440
The carcasses should never have left
the area.

1258
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,320
Are you going to try
and expose us, Mr Foyle?

1259
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,640
We tried to recruit Styles.

1260
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,560
He was with us at the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

1261
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,840
But it drove him mad.

1262
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,960
I expect they'll make him disappear
in the end.

1263
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,120
I wouldn't want them to do the same
to you.

1264
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,320
DOOR OPENS

1265
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,960
Here you are. It's fairly
straightforward. The doctors will
know what to do.

1266
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,000
I hope your friend's all right.

1267
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,040
It's a nasty world, isn't it?

1268
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,880
But we are doing this for our
country, you know.

1269
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,960
The same as everyone else.

1270
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,280
I'll show you out.

1271
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,840
Thank you.

1272
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,680
I've already given her a shot of
streptomycin.

1273
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,360
Where did you get it, by the way?
How long before we know it's worked?

1274
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,800
I'll wait a few hours then give her
another one.

1275
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,480
I'll double the dose if I have to.

1276
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,600
And then?
There's nothing more I can do.

1277
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,360
I've got to be honest with you, Mr
Foyle, at this point it could go
either way.

1278
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,080
Either the fever will break

1279
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,200
and she'll begin to breathe properly
or...

1280
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,920
It doesn't seem to be the sort of
thing we should be doing, given the
circumstances.

1281
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,680
Well, we might as well.
There's little else we can do.

1282
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,880
I can't believe she might die.
She'll pull through, won't she, sir?

1283
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,760
Please come in.
Thank you.

1284
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,160
Afternoon.
Afternoon.

1285
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,800
You know why I'm here?

1286
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,000
No. I've no idea.

1287
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,640
Is this about Tom Jenkins?
Amongst other things, yes.

1288
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,720
We wondered why you wouldn't have
bothered to have signed this.

1289
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,680
It would have been perfectly
reasonable information. Tall man on a
beach.

1290
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,680
Blond hair.
I just couldn't understand

1291
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,320
why you wouldn't want to take credit
for that.

1292
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,200
That's not...
It's yours, isn't it?

1293
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,760
How can you be so sure?
Well, you sent it to ME.

1294
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,200
Only very few people know that I'm
connected with this investigation

1295
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,120
and it wasn't any of them

1296
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,200
unless, of course, it was...
No, no, it's not.

1297
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,320
There are also traces of ether on it
which we assume meant it had come
from a hospital.

1298
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,480
But we understand you, as a vet,
use ether regularly.

1299
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,960
One good reason, of course,
for not signing it

1300
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,560
is because you didn't give this
information to the police,

1301
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,680
isn't that right? Look, all right,
I wrote that letter but -

1302
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,040
Why did you go to see them?

1303
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,000
Well, Martin Ashford being arrested
was all wrong.

1304
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,040
He wouldn't kill anyone.

1305
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,760
I just knew that they'd got the
wrong man.

1306
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,320
How could you be sure of that?
Because you're the right one?

1307
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,240
Why did...

1308
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,160
Jenkins try to kill you?

1309
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,360
Did he? He tried to shoot you,
didn't he? When you were both on
board the Navarino?

1310
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,200
That's how you got that, isn't it?

1311
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,320
I told you that this was -
This was shrapnel.

1312
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,360
Well, I think we both know what
a shrapnel wound looks like.

1313
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,200
It's not a shrapnel wound.

1314
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,280
How do you know it was him?

1315
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,120
Because he was the only one on board
with a gun.

1316
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,320
I mean, no-one on board merchant
vessels,

1317
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,240
including Royal Navy officers on DEMS
duty, is permitted to carry firearms.

1318
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,800
Only one small firearm is kept on the
bridge which is where, as you said,
he was on duty.

1319
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,320
I mean, he shot hinges off a door
with it, he got a medal for using it

1320
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,760
and he tried to kill you with it,
didn't he?

1321
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,240
Yes.

1322
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,520
Is that why YOU killed HIM?

1323
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,200
Yes.

1324
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,000
Len.

1325
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,480
It's all right, Dad.

1326
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,720
(SIGHS)
This has gone on long enough.

1327
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,800
Jenkins was a bastard.

1328
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,000
He was a bully and a coward

1329
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,120
and he nearly killed me
when the Navarino went down.

1330
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,680
All he wanted
was to save his own skin.

1331
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,200
But they gave him a medal.

1332
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,720
He used his gun
to shoot down a door.

1333
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,760
He wouldn't have done it if he
hadn't been trying to save himself.

1334
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,600
And it was worse than that.
You have no idea.

1335
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,680
After the ship went down,
it was... Oh, it was hell.

1336
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,440
I suddenly found myself in the water
and it was cold.

1337
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,520
It was ice.

1338
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,680
I could feel myself freezing.

1339
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,440
And then I... and then I saw him.

1340
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,480
He was out of the water.

1341
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,680
You had to be out of the water
if you were gonna survive.

1342
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,600
Jenkins! Help me!
I can't. I can't move.

1343
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,760
It's going to overturn. Go away.

1344
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,320
Give me a hand,
for God's sakes, man!

1345
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,760
Help me!
Move! It's going to overturn.

1346
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,640
Get me out of the water!

1347
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,640
Get away.

1348
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,440
Help me!

1349
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,440
Get off me!

1350
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,440
That's the last thing I remember.

1351
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,640
I should have died.

1352
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,840
I don't know why I didn't.

1353
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,360
Someone pulled me into a lifeboat
and that's how I made it home.

1354
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,680
He did that?
Yes, Dad.

1355
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,040
Why didn't you tell anyone? Why
didn't you go to the authorities?

1356
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,960
It was his word against mine.
No-one else saw.

1357
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
Well, you could have told me.

1358
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,920
I wanted to, Dad, but I couldn't.

1359
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,800
You thought the world of him
just like everyone else.

1360
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,480
The DSM, Buckingham Palace.

1361
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,080
Oh, everyone pretending when they
knew all along he was a swine.

1362
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,720
So, you killed him?

1363
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,200
Yes, Dad.

1364
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,400
I took a knife,
the trocar, out of your bag.

1365
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,440
Erm...I didn't care if you found out
it was me. I...

1366
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,120
I knew where he drank
and I followed him when he came out.

1367
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,080
You.
Bastard!

1368
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,560
(GROANS)

1369
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,680
Of course I couldn't let another man
hang for what I'd done.

1370
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,560
Especially not Martin.

1371
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,640
That's erm...why I went to see
Fielding and...

1372
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,160
that's why I wrote you that letter.

1373
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Len...
Dad.

1374
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,080
Please, don't make this any harder.

1375
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,280
I'm ready to go with you.

1376
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,280
There's a car waiting outside.

1377
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,040
Mr Foyle...

1378
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,720
They gave the medal
to the wrong man.

1379
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,120
My son was serving his country.

1380
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,440
He was nearly killed in action.
And this man, this...

1381
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,520
this Jenkins...

1382
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,120
If any man on this planet
got what he deserved, it was him.

1383
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,120
Perhaps.

1384
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,280
So what's the point
in arresting him?

1385
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,360
He's had his orders.

1386
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,400
He's meant to report
to his new ship in two days' time.

1387
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,160
What good is it going to do...

1388
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,520
locking him up
when his country needs him?

1389
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,160
None at all.
None at all, Mr Cartwright.

1390
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,600
Any news about Miss Stewart?

1391
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,360
Still no change.
Are you seeing her this weekend?

1392
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,440
Tomorrow.
Say hello for me.

1393
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,800
Paul.

1394
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,800
Edie.

1395
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,880
I hoped I'd find you.

1396
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,680
Can I have a word?

1397
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,520
Of course.

1398
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,600
They've released Martin.

1399
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,680
Good. I'm glad.

1400
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,520
What will happen to him -
the man who really did it?

1401
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,560
I can't say.

1402
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,600
But I don't think he'll be hanged.

1403
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,600
Tom Jenkins was a horrible man.

1404
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,640
I know what he did to poor Elsie.

1405
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,680
Why didn't you tell me?

1406
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,680
I don't know.

1407
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,920
Maybe because
you're with the police.

1408
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,280
Maybe I was afraid to.

1409
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,320
I mean, he was a hero.

1410
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,280
Anyway, that's why
I've come to see you now.

1411
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,360
To apologise.

1412
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,640
And not just for that.

1413
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,000
There's something else
I wanted to say.

1414
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,880
I wanted to tell you
at the hospital, but...

1415
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,560
We got it wrong, didn't we...

1416
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,560
all those years ago?

1417
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,520
Don't.
Why not?

1418
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,600
I knew Jane was wrong for you.

1419
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,040
I didn't understand
why you went with her.

1420
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,120
But I didn't say anything because...

1421
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,360
Well, I was too young...

1422
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,440
and I was shy...

1423
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,480
And I watched you walk away from me.

1424
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,640
But I'm not going to
let you leave me again.

1425
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,320
Thank you for coming.

1426
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,240
I owe you an apology.

1427
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,400
Do you?
Yes. I arrested the wrong man.

1428
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,960
And when you turned up I treated
you like you were the inept one.

1429
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,160
You know, there's one thing
I couldn't understand.

1430
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,720
Why did Jenkins say his wife's name
when he died?

1431
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,800
Did he?
Yeah.

1432
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,840
It seems...

1433
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,400
..odd.
There was no love lost between them.

1434
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,400
And yet his dying words were...

1435
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,080
"Elsie."

1436
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,200
Elsie...

1437
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,200
or...

1438
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,240
LC?

1439
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,280
LC...

1440
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,480
Leonard Cartwright. Of course!

1441
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,440
It's just a thought.

1442
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,560
Yes...

1443
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,560
How long ago was it when I met you?

1444
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,800
How old were we?

1445
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,880
21? 22?

1446
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,880
Young soldiers off to the war.

1447
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,800
It was a different world then.

1448
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,680
Of course, we... we didn't know
what we were going to go through.

1449
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,560
We won. And we got through it.

1450
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,600
You may have. Not me.

1451
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,280
I never told you.

1452
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,400
April, 1915.

1453
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,440
Ypres.

1454
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,520
I was there with
a bunch of Canadians.

1455
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,440
It was just a day like any other.

1456
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,440
Which is to say,
pretty hellish at the best of times.

1457
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,200
And then I saw it coming towards us.

1458
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,080
A cloud...

1459
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,000
Green...

1460
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,080
Almost...

1461
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,040
luminescent.

1462
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,160
It was completely silent...

1463
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,000
moving as if it had
a life of its own.

1464
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,840
We didn't run.

1465
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,800
Nobody even moved.

1466
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,880
We had no idea what it was.

1467
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,840
And then the pain.

1468
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,280
There were people screaming.

1469
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,600
Coughing blood,
tearing at their own faces.

1470
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,600
Blind.

1471
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,160
Nobody knew what was happening.

1472
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,120
I mean, how could we?

1473
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,160
You see, that was the first time.

1474
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:46,200
The Bosch released
170 tons of chlorine gas.

1475
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,120
Do you know what
the operation was called?

1476
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,120
"Disinfection".

1477
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,000
Well, they disinfected us...

1478
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,360
all right.

1479
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,960
I was one of the lucky ones.

1480
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,960
I still feel it inside now.

1481
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,240
Still burning inside me.

1482
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,680
Well, we won. And we came through it.

1483
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,760
Did we?

1484
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,760
Look around you, Christopher.

1485
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,840
There's so much evil,

1486
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,840
so much...bad blood.

1487
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,400
Humanity stinks.

1488
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,920
I just want to go somewhere quiet...

1489
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,920
and watch the sunset.

1490
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,040
You'll go on fighting,
I know you will.

1491
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,640
I've had enough.

1492
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,640
Joe.

1493
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,080
Mr Foyle, sir.
How long have you been here?

1494
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,080
A while.

1495
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,160
Have you seen her?

1496
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,200
No. I've been here a few times,
but she's been asleep.

1497
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,920
Sir, I really can't stay any more.
I gotta get back to base.

1498
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,440
No, that's all right. Go.
I'll stay with her.

1499
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,680
Hello.

1500
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,520
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

1501
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,560
I wasn't asleep.

1502
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,600
Well, um...

1503
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,440
Joe's out here. He just left.
Do you want me to...?

1504
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,480
No.

1505
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,160
He's been so kind and everything
but...

1506
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,200
I really can't see him just now.

1507
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,360
Right.

1508
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,040
How are you feeling?

1509
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,360
Pretty awful, actually.

1510
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,960
The doctor seemed to think
you're on the mend.

1511
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,040
Really?
Mm. Good.

1512
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,360
Because...

1513
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,480
I've been thinking, sir.

1514
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,560
What, again?

1515
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,160
You should try and resist, you know.
You can see where it gets you.

1516
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,240
Yes. Perhaps.

1517
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,480
But...no, really,

1518
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,520
I have been thinking.

1519
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,320
About whether...

1520
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,760
Crossroads?

1521
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,800
Yes, sir. That's right.

1522
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,680
Would you say I'm...

1523
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,680
sort of...

1524
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,840
quite a useful sort of person
to have on the team, sir?

1525
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,400
I would.

1526
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,520
Would you?
Yes. I'd go as far as to say

1527
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,880
you are a...

1528
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,520
you are an invaluable
part of the team.

1529
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,160
You think so?

1530
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,720
I do.

1531
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,200
Good.

1532
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,360
Well, in that case
I think it's better

1533
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,800
that I go straight through
the crossroads

1534
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,600
and don't take any turns at all.

1535
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,000
Right.

1536
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,000
Well, I'm pleased.

1537
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,240
So, are you here
to take me back to work, then?

1538
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,440
Absolutely.

1539
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,440
Good.

1540
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,720
Can't go anywhere without you.

1541
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,400
Jolly good.
