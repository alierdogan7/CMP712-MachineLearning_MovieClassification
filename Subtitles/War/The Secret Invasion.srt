I was in command
of Balkan Intelligence in 1942.

My brother was an officer
under my command.

364

He was captured
and placed in Dubrovnik Fortress.

I wanted from inside.

367

to get it out to me.

368

370

I waited too long before getting him out.

an extremely stubborn Englishman.

He never spoke one word

Well, what do you know?

551
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:12,430
The fellow that built this place
really used his head.

552
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,465
He figured one day he might
get himself caught in here,

553
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,267
because you can get out from the inside.

which I haven't got.

I didn't tell him anything.

566
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,359
I just told him who I was.

567
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:29,864
I wanted the Kommandant to know
why he was going to die.

568

The corridor leading past
the infirmary to the seawall.

573

Probably.
