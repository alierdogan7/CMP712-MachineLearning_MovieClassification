1
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,728
We thus have the occasion
2
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,292
to discuss questions

3
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,289
of international width,

4
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:54,773
in this year 1936.

5
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:02,048
Guards!

6
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,286
My name is Stephan Lux.

7
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:10,410
I am Jewish.

8
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:14,369
The Jews are persecuted in Germany

9
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:17,013
and the world lets make...

10
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:24,335
I see only one means
to touch the heart of the men.

11
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,092
Soon, we will have England!

12
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:02,407
Go ahead.

13
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,965
Truth!

14
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:13,013
It will be necessary to return, lieutenant Gerstein.

15
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,248
We fight typhus

16
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,847
by eliminating the parasites
and by purifying water.

17
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:32,217
You put clothing,
covers, cloths

18
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,692
in a place hermetically closed.

19
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:37,253
By the external openings,

20
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,768
you introduce crystals
of hydrocyanic acid.

21
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,330
Here the formula.

22
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,489
Does one have to manufacture them ourselves?

23
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,292
Not, the Institute will provide them.

24
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,928
All the details are here.

25
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:59,212
It is a dangerous product.
Proportionings etc should be respected.

26
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:01,770
As for water...

27
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:06,526
that intended for the troops
must be treated.

28
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:10,127
And if water is drinkable, Dr. Gerstein?

29
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,532
It will be it still more
after treatment.

30
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,568
What is drinkable for Slavic

31
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:18,255
is not it inevitably
for a human being.

32
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:23,646
You sit.

33
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:29,733
We must fight typhus
like our enemies, on all fronts.

34
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:31,247
Continue.

35
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,648
Let us continue our talk.

36
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,569
It conceived this program?

37
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:42,575
It is in Wehrmacht?

38
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:47,134
One has it to them piqué
thanks to his/her father who is a friend.

39
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:51,728
THE FÜHRER ORDERS,
WE OBEY

40
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:03,012
Father! I return from Vienna,
I had your message.

41
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,531
What did it occur?

42
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:07,126
God recalled to him small Bertha.

43
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,171
It is all that it remains of it.

44
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,330
What did it occur?

45
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,689
It was sick?

46
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:40,976
The letter known as: "Cooling,

47
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,492
then pulmonary abscess ".

48
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,291
Why did they anything say us?

49
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,409
"why"
do not make return deaths,

50
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:51,692
especially in times of war.

51
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:55,094
It is my niece, I could
to have drugs at the Institute.

52
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:58,334
My friends at the Institute praise your work

53
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:01,336
and say that you eliminate typhus.

54
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,687
I serve my country of my better.

55
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,730
An idealist like you
its place in the S.S has.

56
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,575
even if your wife disapproves.

57
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:09,812
Excuse us...

58
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:19,896
Pose the flower.

59
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,693
- do not do that.
- Why?

60
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,935
And your uniform?

61
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,334
Deaths are not accompanied
in behaviour of work.

62
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,208
Kurt is upset.

63
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,087
Bertha was his/her preferred niece.

64
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,653
It remains how long?

65
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,894
I would like the knowledge.

66
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,132
And you?

67
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:43,646
Say to him.

68
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,095
One speaks...

69
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:51,210
thousands of case through the country.

70
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:55,245
One of my parishioners received two ballot boxes
for his/her handicapped sister

71
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,288
and two official letters.

72
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,648
One speaks about heart failure,
the other of pneumonia.

73
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,009
It is a plan of the S.S.!

74
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,889
Not to kill out of the children...

75
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,327
The S.S. deal with all.

76
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,736
Pasteur, I disinfect the barracks
and I purify water.

77
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:14,725
It is not contrary
neither with my conscience nor with my faith.

78
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:16,968
If you discover something,
warn us.

79
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:19,374
I have nothing to do with all that.

80
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:23,774
Like Christians,
we condemn the euthanasy.

81
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,927
- What will you make?
- To protest.

82
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:28,326
Who will protest?

83
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,086
Christian authorities
must react.

84
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,571
You allow?

85
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,935
What do they still want?

86
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,254
Pasteur told me an atrocious thing.

87
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,606
Does that astonish you?

88
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,370
It is a passeist.

89
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:51,207
To propagate rumours in times of war,
it is high treason.

90
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,814
That that means it,

91
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,368
Monseigneur von Galen?

92
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:48,410
You did not take action pursuant
with my registered letter,

93
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:51,934
I deposit felt sorry for against X

94
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:55,174
for the assassination
"unproductive citizens".

95
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:59,496
We have the facts, the names
patients, their families

96
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:00,806
and their addresses.

97
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:02,735
If you do not take action pursuant,

98
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:07,055
Catholic I' Eglise
will have to inform its faithful.

99
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,330
Dad returned!

100
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,092
Heil!

101
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:33,853
- a gift of France.
- It is what?

102
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:36,133
Open, you will see well.

103
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,688
How are we?

104
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:46,046
It gigote.

105
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,215
I believe that one will have
another lieutenant.

106
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,569
What is there?

107
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:57,495
We have very difficult
problem of arithmetic.

108
00:11:58,577 --> 00:11:59,646
I see...

109
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:04,249
Hello, Mrs. Hinze.
Not, initially your duties.

110
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,175
Read the statement.

111
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:11,730
If you do not have the solution,
read again it still and still.

112
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:16,173
"Knowing that a house
cost 15000 marks

113
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,286
"for a family of workmen

114
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,087
"and that one needs 6 million marks

115
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:25,249
"to build and manage
a lunatic asylum,

116
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:29,496
"how much can one build
working residences

117
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:33,292
for the price of an asylum?"

118
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,697
They are considered
like not-values,

119
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:42,728
like a broken machine,

120
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,969
a crippled horse,

121
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,371
or a cow

122
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:49,973
who does not give any more milk.

123
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:53,566
If you set up in theory

124
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,415
right

125
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:58,370
to remove its next unproductive...

126
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,535
Von Galen knows it
how much were eliminated?

127
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,368
Several thousands.

128
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,325
One day,

129
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:09,811
you will be,

130
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:13,168
we all will be unproductive.

131
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:18,410
What will become our soldiers then
with the return of the war,

132
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:21,654
seriously wounded, mutilated,

133
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,085
invalids...

134
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,376
unproductive?

135
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:33,055
These monks do not know anything
with the economy nor with the eugenism.

136
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,212
Ni with the compassion.

137
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:38,695
I would give a lesson well
in this von Galen after the victory.

138
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:40,615
Why not now?

139
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,614
God decides,

140
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,688
we carry out.

141
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,855
Enter, Gerstein!

142
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,490
Our specialist in purification.

143
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,928
Rest, lieutenant.
Tea, coffee, cognac, cakes?

144
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,092
Not, thank you.

145
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:03,526
You leave to inspect
our units of disinfection.

146
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:08,173
To the return, you will pass to Poland
to control the use

147
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:12,450
of the 500 cans of hydrocyanic acid
that we dispatch to them.

148
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:14,450
500 ?

149
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,332
We build an industrial complex...

150
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:21,734
giant. They need
a specialist in chemistry.

151
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,571
Wehrmacht
has excellent specialists.

152
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,735
Wehrmacht is occupied
to gain the war,

153
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,167
we, we prepare
post-war period.

154
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:38,770
Not a long time ago
that you are ours.

155
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,889
You will see that the S.S.
like to remain between them.

156
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:47,693
This human heat
exaltée by our Reichsführer Himmler.

157
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,651
Thank you to have come.

158
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,256
I leave on mission.

159
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,925
One gained! They moved back.

160
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:02,374
The euthanasy campaign is suspended.

161
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:03,896
You are sure?

162
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:07,134
- Definitively?
- By fear of the public opinion.

163
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:11,250
The army of Jesus
the army of the evil overcame.

164
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,773
Warn Dibelius!

165
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:16,252
- You go where?
- A is!

166
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:24,168
You see this dirty water?

167
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,727
And that can be worse!

168
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,132
Go ahead!

169
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,327
If the pump is broken down,

170
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,251
there is the manual pump.

171
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,969
If you do not have any,
take buckets.

172
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,495
If not,
use your helmets.

173
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,413
No the helmet, that becomes serious!

174
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,450
But impossible to happen
this travelling filter.

175
00:15:58,937 --> 00:15:59,926
And here!

176
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,249
You want to taste?

177
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,486
And you?

178
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,052
Health!

179
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:17,171
That refreshes, that does not make sick,
but it is disgusting!

180
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,092
A jumper of lady would be said!

181
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,976
You had the cross or the jumper,
with the combat?

182
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,129
A combat with the body with body,
I imagine!

183
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,730
I had both
in an engagement of night.

184
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:57,765
One needs more courage
for the cross or the jumper?

185
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,848
I was afraid in both cases...

186
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:04,730
but for the jumper, alas,
no bloodshed!

187
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:08,336
You went there à.fond each time!

188
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,215
Obviously!

189
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,051
As à.fond as I could.

190
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,807
Kurt Gerstein, of the Institute of hygiene.

191
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:26,249
You have 500 cans of hydrocyanic acid
in a not-protected place.

192
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,776
Only 500?

193
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:30,730
Vermin pullulates
between Berlin and Moscow.

194
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,656
With a can,
I disinfect a barracks.

195
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:36,331
If you are bombarded,
any life will disappear here...

196
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,175
They never bombard here.

197
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,731
They leave us quiet.

198
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,934
What do you hope to make some?

199
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,651
- It is what?
- Astispumante. Italian.

200
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:55,486
To conquer half of the world
to drink this wee of cat!

201
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:59,736
I raise this filth to Kurt Gerstein
who joint with us.

202
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,726
First visit of one of our camps?
Not, of course!

203
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:28,133
This one is special.

204
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,486
How much?

205
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,446
300.

206
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,253
400 units to be treated.

207
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:56,489
It is rather horrible...

208
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:15,369
Not even ten alive beings
saw what you have just seen.

209
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:34,496
Let pass to me!

210
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,446
You did not reserve,
captain?

211
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,369
All is complete.

212
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,132
You are sick?

213
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,096
You are sick?

214
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,567
Even a S.S. can be sick!

215
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:16,290
I am sorry.

216
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:19,889
The ambassador of Sweden
is also in the corridor.

217
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:23,617
The whole world is in the trains.

218
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:29,176
I am only the embassy attaché.
Baron von Otter.

219
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:39,015
Can you grant to me
a maintenance tomorrow in Berlin?

220
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:40,366
I must speak to you.

221
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:43,808
Why not here?
We have all the night.

222
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,014
I saw something...

223
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,855
of appalling.

224
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:56,725
Of absolutely appalling.

225
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,691
Whole families are exterminated.

226
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:03,536
Prisoners of war?

227
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:04,653
Jews.

228
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,377
One exterminates them by whole families.

229
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,216
They are stripped,

230
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,374
one mows the head to them...

231
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,249
even women.

232
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,575
They are mowed?

233
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:17,892
But why?

234
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:20,971
Draw the curtains, please!

235
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:25,405
Lit train,
assured enemy bombardment.

236
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:31,009
Hold, invoices of Zyklon B.

237
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,366
To eliminate the parasites.

238
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:36,728
I in provided them.

239
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:40,373
And they use it for...

240
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,132
My papers.

241
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:45,210
Not need.

242
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:49,576
Your government must prevent
Americans and English.

243
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,250
That they release leaflets
on Germany.

244
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,571
Once informed,
the Germans will raise themselves.

245
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,733
It is necessary to act quickly.
Each day which passes...

246
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,256
A few minutes of stop.

247
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,856
Remain in your places.

248
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:07,096
A short stop,
one lets pass a priority train.

249
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:13,729
If you want references on me,
ask Otto Dibelius,

250
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:16,451
superintendent of the Protestant Church.

251
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:38,846
You sit.

252
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:46,968
Prevent them from following me!

253
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,732
They miss you.

254
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,810
They see you whether little.

255
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,931
Better is worth than you are unaware of
what I will say to Pasteur.

256
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,571
I discovered a horrible thing.
Jews...

257
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,927
- Not here.
- It is unimaginable!

258
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,092
Later...

259
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,733
They are not expelled
like we thought but exterminated.

260
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:10,416
- What?
- Exterminated!

261
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:11,845
Enter.

262
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:15,047
I return from the camps of Poland.

263
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:18,007
They exterminate the Jews.

264
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,365
Most robust
are sent to the forced labour.

265
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:23,727
Women and children...

266
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:25,336
are gazés.

267
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:29,135
I saw it my eyes.
The Church must alert the Christians!

268
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,612
The first thing to be made
is to leave the S.S.!

269
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:34,251
I saw what should not be it.

270
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:36,015
A witness is needed.

271
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,814
I will be the eyes of God
in this hell.

272
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:43,248
That can be terrible
for you and your family.

273
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:53,051
One must denounce the assassins!
I will testify with the service to today.

274
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:54,815
We can start.

275
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,166
We arrive.

276
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,972
Undoubtedly, it is necessary to react,

277
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:01,691
but in a reflected, responsible way.

278
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,775
The Dibelius superintendent
can advise you.

279
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:07,616
It celebrated your marriage, not?

280
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:10,413
Leave the S.S.

281
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,495
Remain far from all that!

282
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,086
We said...

283
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:18,689
you said that the Jews are
a foreign body that one must expel,

284
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:23,288
that one can discriminate them
but not to persecute them.

285
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:26,296
Let us admit the massive executions.

286
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:28,893
- What do you suggest?
- To protest!

287
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:32,806
Protest which will be taken again
by the propaganda of the enemy.

288
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,326
Us will be shown treason.

289
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,016
We are in war.

290
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:40,129
The Church reacted
against the extermination of handicapped...
291
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,772
Euthanasy, not extermination.

292
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,330
The public clamour
the euthanasy stopped.

293
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,609
Let us protest for the Jews.

294
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:54,809
The handicapped people were
baptized members of our Church.

295
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,775
You are soldier,

296
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:00,251
far from daily realities.

297
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:05,090
Our people are bombarded,
in prey with cruel deprivations.

298
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:10,687
Majority of our faithful
and of our pastors

299
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,606
support Mr Hitler.

300
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:15,854
Nobody will protest,

301
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,534
nobody will believe you.

302
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,975
Führer and Himmler
also attended a test.

303
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,606
Order to accelerate the output.

304
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:56,772
The Institute sends to me in the east
to purify water...

305
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:59,009
I cannot take part in that.

306
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:03,369
That is not contradictory,
our installations are in the east.

307
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:08,249
Von Rotta, Hoess and yourself
had accepted the plans.

308
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:10,288
I speak about output.

309
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:14,206
I had announced the risk
of thermal distortion which...

310
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:17,853
Brought into service on March 22,

311
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:21,926
25, after having treated
a convoy of 3000 units,

312
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,605
Ies furnaces burst by overheating!

313
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:28,213
- You drew on the costs.
- labour is free!

314
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,647
Use the model of countryside.

315
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:34,167
It should unceasingly be clogged
and the tar is rationed.

316
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,210
Lieutenant Gerstein,
expert in destruction of vermin...

317
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,736
in any kind.

318
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,928
One needs you.

319
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,807
I am not qualified
for this type of operation.

320
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,452
According to its superiors,

321
00:28:47,657 --> 00:28:51,366
Gerstein excels
where it is not qualified.

322
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,528
Not so sure...

323
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:59,729
Here a new generation
installations...

324
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:05,095
who can treat 10000 units per day.

325
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:08,213
10000 ?

326
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:10,172
But...

327
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:11,526
it is impossible!

328
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:12,852
It will be needed.

329
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:17,013
In Europe, it is necessary to eliminate
11 to 12 million units.

330
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:19,493
Führer wants to finish some before 1948.

331
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:23,606
We will devote 1949
with the rest of the world.

332
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:26,331
The Fifty will be sabbatical.

333
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:30,895
The problem, it is that...

334
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:34,653
during the operation,
the crystals evaporate partially.

335
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:38,609
Evaporation begins again
after clearing of the places.

336
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,415
That slows down cleaning.

337
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:46,128
The crystals do not evaporate
that in contact with the air.

338
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:49,854
And while falling,
do the bodies choke the crystals?

339
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,565
It is that.

340
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,725
Sometimes, crystals exposed to the air

341
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,768
evaporate into 40 to 50 mn

342
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,610
instead of 5 to 10.

343
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:04,088
That slows down rate
and any estimate prevents.

344
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,974
Two factors can play:

345
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:11,653
The bad quality of the product
or a low temperature.

346
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,297
The number will raise the temperature.

347
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:18,126
Famous human heat...

348
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,973
Latticed conduits
the crystals will protect.

349
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:27,375
You will provide crystals
of quality in great quantity.

350
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:31,490
- My work at the Institute...
- We will divide you with them.

351
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:37,770
You will fill your duty of S.S.
and of Christian:

352
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:41,293
you will reduce to five minutes
anguish of the units

353
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:43,692
and you will accelerate rates.

354
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:46,934
- Lieutenant...
- Professor would be righter.

355
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:52,091
How long is necessary it
before intervening without mask?

356
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:55,096
- the filters are too expensive.
- Two hours.

357
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,372
Two hours!

358
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:59,012
Without ventilation, it is a minimum.

359
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,690
Which ventilation?

360
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,496
Which cubage?

361
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,693
1250 m3 on average.

362
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:10,446
With a pulsor of air of 1 CV,
you will gain one hour.

363
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,535
We will put two of them.

364
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:16,173
Turn over to your work
of cleansing

365
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:20,052
without forgetting your mission
Christian woman of public utility.

366
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,489
- the Nuncio does not receive!
- 5 mn! It is very significant.

367
00:31:26,697 --> 00:31:29,450
Its Eminence does not see anybody.

368
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:31,488
Announce to me!

369
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:35,007
Excellence,

370
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:36,815
it is necessary that I speak to you.

371
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,689
- I must speak to you.
- What do you make here?

372
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:50,817
Lt Kurt Gerstein, Excellence.

373
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,886
I have information for the Vatican.
Its gravity justifies my intrusion.

374
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:59,055
I am shocked by your intrusion!

375
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:00,485
I call the police force.

376
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,892
If my superiors learn my visit...

377
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,093
It is an effraction, Mister.

378
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,893
I have a message for the Vatican.

379
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:11,929
I arrive from Poland,

380
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,613
camps of Auschwitz and Belzec.
Thousands of Jews are gazés.

381
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:16,727
Enough!

382
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,928
Leave from here! Come, Count,

383
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,287
we cannot listen to that!

384
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:25,053
I saw all of my own eyes,
Excellence...

385
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:29,609
convoys of all Europe
arrive in these factories of death.

386
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:32,892
Only the Vatican
can stop these atrocities.

387
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:36,971
Only the Pope, while alerting
the world opinion and Christians...

388
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:39,645
Thank you to trouble you
action of Its Holiness!

389
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,376
Catholic Etes you?

390
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,455
Excellence...

391
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,009
what I saw

392
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:04,766
haunt me day and night.

393
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:14,694
Even in death
the families are recognized.

394
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:18,126
They remain intertwined
ones with the others.

395
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:24,130
Naked mothers
tighten their baby on the chest.

396
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:28,296
One said to me

397
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:30,089
that after death,

398
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:33,326
one is not able to separate them,

399
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,216
even with hooks.

400
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,295
I then to contact the German army.

401
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:40,646
Renew it.

402
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,210
Leave us.

403
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:51,095
A provocation of Gestapo.

404
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:55,051
A S.S. which defends the Jews!
They take to us for idiots.

405
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:32,208
Is Mr. the baron von Otter there?

406
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,248
Not, I am his assistant.
Who are you?

407
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:35,856
Kurt Gerstein. It knows me.

408
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,376
It travels.
I can help you?

409
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,329
- It returns when?
- One does not know.

410
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:49,052
Elfriede!

411
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:50,292
Kurt!

412
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:55,931
Do not do that.

413
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:58,051
Stop!

414
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,135
I said to you to stop!

415
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:10,687
I said to you to remain there!

416
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,490
What does it occur?

417
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,972
You cannot remain any more here.

418
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,089
They bombard everywhere.

419
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:25,734
It is not that.
Goes in Tübingen, with the children.

420
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,252
Let finish them the school year.

421
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:30,647
I said not, it is not!

422
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,416
You are right undoubtedly.

423
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:36,535
Adelheid, takes along your brother to play.

424
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,568
If you explained me...

425
00:35:48,137 --> 00:35:49,889
It is necessary to leave

426
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:51,650
As soon as possible.

427
00:35:52,737 --> 00:35:54,136
I can nothing say moreover.

428
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:59,728
There is another woman?

429
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,489
You make me laugh...

430
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:12,535
You make me laugh.

431
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:17,652
At least, I am still used for that.

432
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,531
Who will deal with you?

433
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:26,167
Mrs. Hinze will make the deal.

434
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,455
It is Jewish?

435
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,770
It said it to you?

436
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:33,412
Someone else?

437
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:37,376
T'en do not make.

438
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,007
You take too much in heart.

439
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,928
Do not forget that you have a family.

440
00:36:58,137 --> 00:36:59,775
It is what counts...

441
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:02,647
more than all in the world.

442
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,172
Mrs. Hinze,

443
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:20,015
prepare my business.

444
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,014
I will call the carpenter.

445
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,253
The bombs still shook it.

446
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:26,449
You lead us to Tübingen?

447
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:30,095
My father will take you along.
I do not have time.

448
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:42,892
Y has a large black car!

449
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:51,251
I am relieved to find you.
An atrocious thing arrived.

450
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:58,172
What a beautiful German family!

451
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:05,251
You do not know?

452
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:10,054
The plane of Führer
exploded on takeoff.

453
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,210
And was Führer inside?

454
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:15,097
With Goebbels, Göring and Himmler.

455
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:17,011
And did nobody survive?

456
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:18,013
If.

457
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:19,606
Germany!

458
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,255
I had you! I had you!

459
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:28,091
I will denounce you to hawk
false good news.

460
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:32,168
The stage of my father.
The bombardments damaged it.

461
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,891
The house of my friend
was puffed up.

462
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:37,372
Only the wall with the portrait
of Führer is intact.

463
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,371
The portrait of Führer
is always intact.

464
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,450
You are right.

465
00:38:43,377 --> 00:38:47,893
You impressed
our colleagues specialists in...

466
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:51,046
If, impressed.

467
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:54,052
I leave...

468
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,532
for Theresienstadt.
I take you along.

469
00:38:57,817 --> 00:39:02,129
Then you will see your manufacturer
of Czech hydrocyanic acid.

470
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,328
On the way, we will chatter.

471
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:07,847
You are only
with which that is worth still the sorrow...

472
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:09,450
to chatter.

473
00:39:10,657 --> 00:39:11,931
Why only?

474
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:14,811
Our colleagues
have an intelligence technician

475
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:18,327
but it is is the boasting ones,
maybe of the drunkards,

476
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,449
maybe of degenerated.

477
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,048
Often, three at the same time.

478
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:26,291
Your children
make natural science?

479
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,530
They are too young.

480
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:31,535
I have a splendid specimen

481
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:33,415
of cranium judéo-Bolshevik.

482
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:34,333
A cranium?

483
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:42,287
There is no age to be informed.
I will show them.

484
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,407
For the anniversary of Darwin,

485
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,247
pure Swiss chocolate...

486
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:51,808
One did not have...

487
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:54,453
To give pleasure is my pleasure.

488
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:00,965
Let us see...

489
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,813
The man goes down from the monkey,

490
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:07,566
but the Negro and the Jew
stopped with middle height.

491
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:09,125
Delicious!

492
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,088
Not thank you.

493
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:15,766
Stop.

494
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:26,291
Control better
your facial muscles.

495
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,852
In the S.S. as with the poker,

496
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:33,090
combined and adversaries
do not have to read your thoughts

497
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,406
or your play.

498
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:36,056
You read my thoughts?

499
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:39,772
As an opened book,
this is why I appreciate you.

500
00:40:41,737 --> 00:40:43,409
What a treasure you have there!

501
00:40:43,617 --> 00:40:44,811
Take great care.

502
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:47,094
At the day after tomorrow morning.

503
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:50,135
6h30 precise.
I delighted in advance!

504
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:12,292
I am Riccardo Fontana.
We saw ourselves with nonciature.

505
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:13,725
I am Jesuit.

506
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,131
Jesuit...

507
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:18,215
Must I present to you thus
if this man returns?

508
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,135
That of the black car?

509
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,533
Present to me like...

510
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:25,774
a "Spy of God",
according to Kierkegaard.

511
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:28,845
Spy of God...

512
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:30,891
or of the Vatican?

513
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:33,527
Of The Vatican
would hardly be plausible.

514
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:38,968
- What do you want?
- I was ashamed of the attitude of the Nuncio.

515
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:42,492
You upset me.
Known as-me moreover it.

516
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:44,806
More?

517
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:48,731
On what?

518
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:53,056
If what you say is true,
the Holy Father must be informed.

519
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:54,975
But it will ask me evidence.

520
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,612
The Pope is unaware of
what do we make the Jews?

521
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:00,895
With its priests,
its parishes, its bishops,

522
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:04,487
it has the best service
of information in the world.

523
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,767
It is informed
persecutions of catholics.

524
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:10,856
That it thus gets information
fate of the Jews and Gypsies.

525
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:13,935
Gypsies
move much.

526
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:16,691
And one moves much the Jews!

527
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:19,936
The Pope does not wonder
where do the deportees go?

528
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:24,365
Nor the Pope,

529
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:27,045
nor my father, who is close for him,

530
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:29,407
do not have of regard for Mr. Hitler.

531
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:34,688
But they see that it succeeded
what nobody had dared:

532
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:38,687
to overcome Communism
in Germany and Russia.

533
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,806
And this man whom we do not estimate...

534
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,086
became a myth.

535
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:44,571
Your myth

536
00:42:44,777 --> 00:42:46,733
makes acts of cruelty

537
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:50,407
that only the Pope, vicar of Christ,
can denounce,

538
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:54,212
so that the world
and the Germans know.

539
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:57,849
Dice that the Holy Father
will know these atrocities,

540
00:42:58,097 --> 00:43:00,053
he will react with firmness.

541
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:02,452
But it is necessary all to say to me.

542
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,448
That will not be enough to convince it.

543
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:15,886
You sit.

544
00:43:19,737 --> 00:43:22,854
People who betray their country

545
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:28,730
are always suspect.

546
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:42,649
Biscuits for Monseigneur.

547
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:46,372
It is very annoyed that you
you are gone away without preventing.

548
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:49,933
Monseigneur confers
with the minister of religion.

549
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:52,446
He wants that I introduce you
constantly.

550
00:43:52,657 --> 00:43:54,852
It counts on your talents of speaker.

551
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,935
It has negotiators Nazis
very difficult.

552
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,412
- Why this meeting?
- Always similar.

553
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:04,769
To level the small divergences
between Reich and us.

554
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:06,296
Small divergences?

555
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:10,172
They refuse to pay the tax
intended for the Church.

556
00:44:10,937 --> 00:44:12,495
I introduce you?

557
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,487
Already of return?

558
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:46,928
- I seek my father.
- How is Mr. Hitler charming it?

559
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:48,013
He greets you.

560
00:45:48,217 --> 00:45:50,128
Your father is not here.

561
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:52,016
He will be there when?

562
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:07,327
Kurt, Führer was mistaken
about the Jews.

563
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,654
Still one of your jokes?

564
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:11,774
He presented them
as very dangerous

565
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:15,686
because very organized
on the international, exact level?

566
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:20,005
However, we note
that it is easy to reduce them in smoke.

567
00:47:21,737 --> 00:47:26,015
Even our lunatics
were defended better.

568
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:27,776
Our Churches...

569
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:29,126
I am...

570
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:30,891
a little catholic.

571
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:34,285
Our Churches saved our insane.

572
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:37,097
Nobody moves for the Jews.

573
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,695
American Jews
are powerful, says one.

574
00:47:40,897 --> 00:47:43,092
But Roosevelt is keep silent.

575
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:47,049
If Führer were mistaken,
like you say,

576
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:49,212
why continue?

577
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:52,970
It was mistaken in diagnosis,
no the remedy.

578
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:54,895
One must get rid of them.

579
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:58,537
But I believe
that we are lost.

580
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,091
Forgiveness?

581
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:02,805
This idiot turns in round.

582
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:06,375
Straight!

583
00:48:09,897 --> 00:48:11,171
I awoke it.

584
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:19,407
Reich needs
men like us.

585
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:22,530
Men who know
to subject their conscience,

586
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:26,412
like these rough décervelées
who feel higher

587
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,812
because one them known as Aryan.

588
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:32,653
It is splendid! Splendid!

589
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:34,006
A Raphaël truth!

590
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:49,006
The press is interested in your father!

591
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:55,210
The Pope dedicated the world
in the immaculate heart of the Virgin Mary

592
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:56,896
to restore peace.

593
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:59,248
It is a significant celebration.

594
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:01,455
And I must present it.

595
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,334
Still a celebration...

596
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:08,292
You have the tended air.
Does the Nuncio send to you on mission?

597
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:10,215
I came from my own initiative.

598
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,055
Of your own initiative!

599
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:16,372
The Jews are exterminated
countries occupied by Germany.

600
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:18,488
We will finish tomorrow.
Leave us.

601
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:19,812
Leave us!

602
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:22,527
I came to inform the Holy Father of it.

603
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:24,853
It does not need you
to get information.

604
00:49:25,057 --> 00:49:27,093
If it were it,
it would have banished these atrocities.

605
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,412
Change tone!

606
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,972
Its Eminence, the cardinal...

607
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:32,885
Make enter it.

608
00:49:35,377 --> 00:49:37,891
- It can see you here?
- Yes.

609
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,727
Of my garden.

610
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,212
Thank you. They are ravissantes.

611
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,376
Riccardo, my boy,
you are superb!

612
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:53,213
- How is abominable Mr. Hitler?
- Always abominable.

613
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:56,606
And our American friend?

614
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:58,694
I await it, Eminence.

615
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:02,890
The Nuncio did not announce your arrival.

616
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:04,246
I came without...

617
00:50:04,457 --> 00:50:09,372
It would seem that the German army
that is to say blocked in Stalingrad.

618
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:13,493
I have secret information
on the death camps.

619
00:50:13,697 --> 00:50:14,686
Thus hold,

620
00:50:15,497 --> 00:50:17,533
we have a secret agent there

621
00:50:18,297 --> 00:50:21,016
who leaves his station
without warning the Nuncio.

622
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:23,336
The Holy Father must be informed.

623
00:50:23,537 --> 00:50:27,530
The Holy Father does not have as a Mr. Hitler
that a quite poor regard.

624
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:30,809
Since it signed this infamous pact

625
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:32,496
with this Stalin,

626
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,653
nothing coming from him
will not surprise it.

627
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:38,327
I had warned the Holy Father
that it was about a trick.

628
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:39,606
It attacked too late

629
00:50:40,057 --> 00:50:43,288
and it is found blocked
by the Russian winter.

630
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:45,807
The Holy Father is worried.

631
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:47,776
Hitler must crush Stalin

632
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,291
and to sign peace with the Americans

633
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:53,169
so that all these horrors,

634
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:56,016
who break the heart of the Holy Father,
cease.

635
00:50:56,577 --> 00:50:58,727
Allies
will not sign with Hitler.

636
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:02,134
While waiting, one kills the Jews.
The Holy Father must protest.

637
00:51:02,657 --> 00:51:03,885
"It must"?

638
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:05,809
The Jews are gazés
tous.les.jours.

639
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:08,770
We are accustomed
with the moanings of the Jews.

640
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:11,977
I hold this information
of an officer S.S.

641
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:16,333
Does count, your son attend a S.S.?

642
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:20,373
This is divine Providence
who sends this S.S. to you?

643
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:23,567
The American Mister arrived.

644
00:51:27,257 --> 00:51:28,406
Welcome.

645
00:51:28,657 --> 00:51:29,646
Count...

646
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:32,811
My Riccardo son,
it arrives from Berlin.

647
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:35,247
We crossed
this morning, not?

648
00:51:35,457 --> 00:51:36,446
The Pope
did not receive me.

649
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,530
He received Germans.

650
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:41,490
But I met
many Eminences.

651
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:43,576
Your Eminence!

652
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:47,249
Here the answer
that your government waits.

653
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:49,254
Perfect, that goes...

654
00:51:49,457 --> 00:51:51,652
It was a holy woman.

655
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:54,571
You did not know it,
Mr. Tittman?

656
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:57,735
The Fontana countess
us left too early.

657
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:21,970
You drink something?

658
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,294
We train a good team.

659
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:34,813
It's a pity that you do not remain,
Prague has a splendid Jewish cemetery.

660
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,936
Dear Luigi...

661
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:50,372
Monseigneur,

662
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:52,455
this has just arrived.

663
00:52:58,177 --> 00:53:00,008
The Pope claims me.

664
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,574
The duty before the pleasure...

665
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:06,614
When returns the Taylor ambassador?

666
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:08,525
Not before two months.

667
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,567
We will be happy to re-examine it.

668
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:16,286
Count,

669
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:19,176
Berlin is not any more
a pleasant place, but...

670
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:21,208
it is a good school

671
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:23,726
to learn
moderation and patience.

672
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:25,655
We wish that Riccardo

673
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:28,087
y turns over as fast as possible.

674
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:36,525
Berlin is a punishment
or a promotion?

675
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:40,446
What thinks your government
massacres of Jews?

676
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:42,767
We test
to check these rumours

677
00:53:42,977 --> 00:53:44,729
at the Vatican, precisely.

678
00:53:44,937 --> 00:53:47,895
And the Vatican,
having had wind of the same rumours,

679
00:53:48,177 --> 00:53:49,974
us asks to check them.

680
00:53:50,737 --> 00:53:55,174
While you check,
10000 Jews are exterminated each day.

681
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:59,047
If you want to be believed,
avoid these figures.

682
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:00,736
Known as a few hundreds.

683
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:05,974
I know somebody
who saw functioning the gas chambers.

684
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:13,211
Our host came to lunch.

685
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:15,125
Forgiveness, father.

686
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,373
You have finally your answer.

687
00:54:17,577 --> 00:54:19,408
It is not signed.

688
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:23,175
The adviser of the Pope
you gave it in person.

689
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:24,366
It is a signature.

690
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:38,252
"Our congratulations
with lieutenant S.S. Kurt Gerstein

691
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:42,689
"for its nomination with the head
of our medical and technical service.

692
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:45,610
We thank it
for the excellence of its work."

693
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:47,734
Signed Heinrich Himmler.

694
00:54:49,377 --> 00:54:50,730
For my part,

695
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:54,813
I name you
the worst enemy of vermin

696
00:54:55,017 --> 00:54:56,814
whatever it is, where that it is,

697
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:59,611
and I join my congratulations
with those of Himmler.

698
00:54:59,857 --> 00:55:00,767
Thank you.

699
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:05,214
An ambulance awaits your inspection.
It is urgent.

700
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:07,089
Continue, one returns.

701
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,374
On the other face...

702
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:15,965
you were right.

703
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:19,408
But the doctor and others
are content with you.

704
00:55:32,657 --> 00:55:34,056
There are escapes!

705
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,813
Close the doors, there are escapes!

706
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:40,526
Masks! All!

707
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:45,214
It is very toxic!

708
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,169
Do not look at me like a calf!

709
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:49,532
Put your mask!

710
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:53,574
Bury the loading!

711
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:55,649
I do not feel anything.

712
00:55:56,177 --> 00:55:58,611
One said to me to remove
irritating markers.

713
00:55:58,857 --> 00:56:01,325
The escapes are difficult to detect.
Your mask!

714
00:56:03,537 --> 00:56:04,413
Leave the car!

715
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:06,246
Bury the loading!

716
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:12,937
I do not want any more a this product here.

717
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:15,973
You clear up!

718
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,291
You know everyone.

719
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:27,250
- In permission?
- Not, in convalescence.

720
00:56:31,817 --> 00:56:33,694
A good small Bordeaux wine.

721
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:39,936
I said to them
that there is a plan S.S.

722
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:43,092
of extermination of the Jews.

723
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:45,575
I saw it functioning.

724
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,931
In the name of the fights
Protestant youths,

725
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,605
I joined together you
to discuss the actions...

726
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:55,136
Good evening, father.

727
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:59,527
You know everyone,
Armin was wounded in the East.

728
00:57:00,057 --> 00:57:02,127
- Nothing low register?
- I set out again soon.

729
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:03,326
Such an amount of better.

730
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:09,936
I can speak to you?

731
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:21,568
Why did you anything say me?

732
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:23,449
You do not believe me concerned?

733
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,054
thanks to my friends in the S.S.
I know all.

734
00:57:28,497 --> 00:57:30,567
All on all?

735
00:57:30,777 --> 00:57:32,733
All on you!

736
00:57:34,377 --> 00:57:36,937
Congratulations for your promotion!

737
00:57:37,337 --> 00:57:39,373
I would have preferred
to learn by you.

738
00:57:39,577 --> 00:57:42,489
What you with this Pasteur make
and these troublemakers?

739
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:43,891
Father...

740
00:57:45,577 --> 00:57:47,613
Your friends S.S.

741
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:51,253
the monstrosities said to you
what do they hide with the Germans?

742
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:53,175
Do not start again.

743
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:57,856
Our country was raised
thanks to the Hitler chancellor.

744
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:00,216
And thanks to the people,

745
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:03,927
less sophisticated than Thomas Mann
or this humanistic Pasteur.

746
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:08,210
They make us accessory to a crime
who will damnera Germany forever!

747
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:10,328
Do not listen to English propaganda.

748
00:58:10,577 --> 00:58:13,887
Where are your knowledge
and Jewish ex-colleagues?

749
00:58:16,137 --> 00:58:18,856
They are isolated public life.

750
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:23,172
In times of war,
one draws aside those which are claimed

751
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:27,131
of International
directed by Moscow then by New York.

752
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,374
And if I said to you
what don't they exist any more?

753
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:34,297
What does it have says exactly?

754
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:38,531
That thousands of Jews
were off-set and gazés.

755
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,975
He was the witness.

756
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:44,567
The Jews left for America
for a long time!

757
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:47,291
They are the Jews of Europe.

758
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:49,095
Obeyed the orders!

759
00:58:49,497 --> 00:58:53,376
The S.S. are degenerated,
but exceeds them to him.

760
00:58:54,217 --> 00:58:56,173
One sends them to work, of course!

761
00:58:56,377 --> 00:58:59,289
Which employment requires
million workmen?

762
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:02,256
Do not work
for the safety of your heart,

763
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,692
but for safety
of our people!

764
00:59:04,897 --> 00:59:08,173
It is what I do, father!
Harms and day.

765
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:13,690
Once and for all,

766
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:16,969
cease these sentimental sillinesses.

767
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:31,736
You lie. The Germans are unable
such atrocities.

768
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:34,296
Helmut, I t'en request!

769
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,409
Our fights against the Nazis,
it is past.

770
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:44,926
You are in the S.S.
and me in Luftwaffe

771
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:47,128
and our children are bombarded.

772
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,087
Afflicted.

773
00:59:53,577 --> 00:59:54,771
And you?

774
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:59,571
I swore never not to raise the arm,

775
01:00:00,617 --> 01:00:02,448
never not to say Heil.

776
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:03,806
Up to now, I succeeded.

777
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:08,731
"Happy that which forgets

778
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:11,816
what cannot be changed."

779
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:14,447
The Bat, Johann Strauss.

780
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,850
Forgiveness, Pasteur, I have work.

781
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:21,329
It still remains
many Jews with gazer!

782
01:01:54,484 --> 01:01:57,681
Mercy, the Holy Father,
for the people of Christ.

783
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,273
Mercy for the Jewish people.

784
01:02:01,604 --> 01:02:04,516
I know the sufferings of the world,
Riccardo.

785
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:26,998
My heart bleeds for the victims.

786
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:29,082
I request for them

787
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:31,235
and for you also, my child.

788
01:02:32,884 --> 01:02:36,593
The world waits
that the vicar of Christ decides.

789
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:51,123
You were given in spectacle.

790
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:52,837
Somebody was to speak to him.

791
01:02:53,044 --> 01:02:56,719
Its Holiness will employ words of fire
against the crimes Nazis

792
01:02:56,924 --> 01:02:59,154
at the time of sound homélie of Christmas.

793
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:02,115
Why did you anything say me?

794
01:03:02,364 --> 01:03:04,195
I say it now to you.

795
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:05,593
God is rented!

796
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:09,353
As well as the diplomacy
and perseverance.

797
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,635
Trust me.

798
01:03:46,284 --> 01:03:48,752
The crematory ones are overflowed.

799
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:56,037
Why you do not have them
checked front?

800
01:03:56,244 --> 01:03:59,759
This stock is ventilated and unusable.
It should be buried.

801
01:03:59,964 --> 01:04:03,639
Contrary to the other deliveries,
your gas always poses problem.

802
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:06,039
The doctor wants not gas irritating.

803
01:04:06,244 --> 01:04:09,554
All that is unusable.
It should be buried.

804
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:12,676
I cannot stop.
I will use it.

805
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:16,473
- That will not go!
- Even badly, it goes.

806
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:19,161
It détroussait the corpses,

807
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:20,797
and it bavassait.

808
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:27,237
I cannot work any more
without drinking.

809
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:30,752
What did he say?

810
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:34,838
Corpses howl
once in the furnaces.

811
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,039
Slip by!

812
01:04:38,604 --> 01:04:40,754
Your Zyklon spends 60 minutes to be operated

813
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,159
instead of 10.

814
01:04:42,364 --> 01:04:44,241
That slows down rates.

815
01:04:44,444 --> 01:04:46,116
That irritates us.

816
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,643
All the robbers.

817
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,716
Berlin congratulates us for our results

818
01:04:58,484 --> 01:05:00,918
and asks us to increase our efforts,

819
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:06,123
but a catastrophe
be likely to block our mission.

820
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,315
Problems of transport?

821
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:11,800
Our convoys have priority.

822
01:05:12,404 --> 01:05:15,396
It is about the provisioning
in Zyklon of quality.

823
01:05:15,604 --> 01:05:17,595
Treblinka is in out-of-stock condition!

824
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:22,273
If we do not use
what only one point of storage?

825
01:05:22,484 --> 01:05:24,076
Too much risky!

826
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:26,275
Our camps were never bombarded.

827
01:05:26,484 --> 01:05:30,113
The Convention of Geneva prohibits it.

828
01:05:32,644 --> 01:05:36,478
Can one rationalize
this problem of provisioning?

829
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:40,999
The forecasts are established
for 10000 units per day.

830
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:44,193
10000 for all the camps?

831
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:47,284
I receive 6000 units per day!

832
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:49,082
Me too!
I cannot treat them

833
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,234
nor to place them.

834
01:05:50,444 --> 01:05:52,674
I receive from them 7 to 8000 per day.

835
01:05:52,884 --> 01:05:54,761
A true chaos.

836
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:58,162
There are some who make the war
from their offices!

837
01:05:58,724 --> 01:06:00,442
And one asks us to accelerate!

838
01:06:00,684 --> 01:06:02,754
Give us the means!

839
01:06:02,964 --> 01:06:06,274
Ask the co. Schriever
grinding stones to crush them.

840
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:08,202
One will never leave oneself there!

841
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:09,962
I have nightmares of them!

842
01:06:10,244 --> 01:06:11,233
Silence!

843
01:06:11,764 --> 01:06:13,641
A little order, please.

844
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:17,235
- You evaluate your needs with how much?
- I do not evaluate.

845
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:22,114
I want enormous stocks of Zyklon
in only one place, underground.

846
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:23,956
Spend an even little money.

847
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:27,394
The suppliers will have evil to follow.

848
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:31,802
They shout Heil Hitler
and fill the pockets.

849
01:06:32,124 --> 01:06:36,242
That they are wary.
One can aryaniser the aryanisateurs!

850
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:40,118
Gerhard will be your intermediary.

851
01:06:40,324 --> 01:06:41,643
It can make there.

852
01:06:42,084 --> 01:06:45,360
It is well introduced in Switzerland
and in the neutral countries.

853
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:50,356
I do not want only any fair
of gas or installations.

854
01:06:50,564 --> 01:06:52,555
They are your estimates?

855
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:19,433
Then?

856
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:20,633
Caution!

857
01:07:20,844 --> 01:07:24,075
I awaited you.
I am wary of the telephone.

858
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:27,482
The Allies must act.
The situation worsens.

859
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:30,152
It is necessary to bombard
the ways which lead to the camps

860
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:31,922
and places of extermination.

861
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:33,477
I informed my government.

862
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:37,512
Insist! The machine of death
go day and night!

863
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,601
You over-estimate
capacity of the heads of State.

864
01:07:39,804 --> 01:07:42,682
We negotiate
with the United States since 7 months

865
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:45,444
so that they accept
2000 Jewish children.

866
01:07:45,684 --> 01:07:48,357
2000, it is a water drop
in the ocean.

867
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,794
It arrives from there ten times more per day.

868
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:52,198
For your family...

869
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,679
A friend will inform the Pope.

870
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,602
I am sure that it will react.

871
01:07:56,804 --> 01:08:00,433
The Allies must be ready
to inform the German people.

872
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,475
I will let it know.

873
01:08:02,764 --> 01:08:04,914
I can obtain passports to you...

874
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,433
I will not leave my country.

875
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:10,755
I must testify.

876
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:28,516
A French dinner
for German Christmas!

877
01:08:29,444 --> 01:08:32,720
I will have a farm in Normandy
with horses.

878
01:08:32,924 --> 01:08:34,437
After our victory.

879
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:39,838
I found a farm in Poland.

880
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:43,713
Not in Poland,
my wife and me let us hate the cold.

881
01:08:43,924 --> 01:08:47,314
I will have an island in Greece.

882
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:49,833
And your dream, Kurt?

883
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:54,034
I want to be a German in Germany

884
01:08:56,724 --> 01:08:59,363
to testify on what I saw.

885
01:08:59,684 --> 01:09:02,881
Alas, you will not be able all to say.

886
01:09:03,324 --> 01:09:04,518
Excuse me.

887
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,442
A German in Germany!

888
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:16,837
You are there! It is well.

889
01:09:17,044 --> 01:09:18,636
You receive, I can set out again...

890
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:20,994
Remain! You must translate.

891
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:24,122
- It will start.
- Mrs. Hinze, the radio!

892
01:09:24,324 --> 01:09:25,598
I return.

893
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,003
It was the promised surprise?

894
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:38,035
Not, it arrives.

895
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:41,963
There will be precise rules
to respect.

896
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:45,201
The Germans comply with the rules,
if they are precise.

897
01:09:45,884 --> 01:09:48,318
No gifts before...

898
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,436
to sing!

899
01:10:17,204 --> 01:10:19,513
- did That start?
- It is imminent.

900
01:10:39,324 --> 01:10:41,076
I will get rid of them.

901
01:10:52,244 --> 01:10:54,553
Now, the surprise.

902
01:10:55,404 --> 01:10:58,282
I have a small play
for your Christmas presents.

903
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:01,235
When I whistle,

904
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,876
you enter there, I extinguish the lights

905
01:11:06,884 --> 01:11:08,158
and I close the door.

906
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:11,397
You will have one minute
for hunting for the treasure.

907
01:11:11,724 --> 01:11:13,362
With the second whistle,

908
01:11:13,804 --> 01:11:15,601
you will stop Net.

909
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,601
All that you will have taken

910
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,317
will be with you.

911
01:11:24,644 --> 01:11:25,679
With your marks,

912
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:28,113
loans...

913
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:40,081
You can amuse the idiots.

914
01:11:40,284 --> 01:11:42,752
Why so many efforts
to like?

915
01:11:44,684 --> 01:11:47,357
I am very attached to the traditions.

916
01:11:50,284 --> 01:11:53,560
- Which gripped me the buttocks?
- Christmas present!

917
01:11:58,724 --> 01:12:00,396
Interdict to collect!

918
01:12:09,444 --> 01:12:11,958
Our friends like your small gifts.

919
01:12:14,884 --> 01:12:16,875
I will telephone my family.
Excuse me.

920
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:19,996
"Family",
a so soft word of our language.

921
01:12:20,204 --> 01:12:21,922
Present to them my wishes.

922
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:28,520
Do not let anybody enter.

923
01:12:30,204 --> 01:12:33,002
It calls the people
to bring back the divine law

924
01:12:33,204 --> 01:12:35,718
in the centre of gravity of the company.

925
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,323
"This wish,

926
01:12:38,564 --> 01:12:40,520
"humanity owes it

927
01:12:40,964 --> 01:12:42,522

933
01:12:54,724 --> 01:12:55,759
"This wish,

934
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,633
"humanity owes it

that the hurricane of the war
tore off with their fatherland... "

936
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:17,393
- What to make?
- Known as that I speak to my children.

937
01:13:17,604 --> 01:13:19,959
Put music,
that they dance.

938
01:13:20,164 --> 01:13:22,314
Mrs. Hinze... smile.

939
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:23,753
I will test.

940
01:13:30,844 --> 01:13:32,960
It speaks to his children.

941
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:38,319
"... of non-combatant

942
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:42,955

Ies asylums of charity

951
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:05,673
It is all?

952
01:14:06,164 --> 01:14:07,313
It is all.

953
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:15,196
It did not pronounce the words "Jew"
or "concentration camp".

954
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:23,153
You can leave Germany?

955
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:29,753
The Pope is protected too much.
He must hear a witness.

956
01:14:52,604 --> 01:14:54,401
The Holy Father arrives.

957
01:14:54,604 --> 01:14:58,233
Washington is astonished
homélie of Christmas of the Pope.

958
01:14:58,444 --> 01:15:01,277
Not to condemn the atrocities Nazis

959
01:15:01,484 --> 01:15:04,999
the authority of the Pope weakens
and confidence in the Church.

960
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:07,240
One cannot condemn Hitler

961
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:09,719
without condemning Stalin,
who is your ally.

962
01:15:09,924 --> 01:15:11,960
You cannot compare them.

963
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:19,203
Greetings and good wishes
that President Roosevelt

964
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:24,155
us sent to the occasion
Holy season of Christmas

965
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:27,954
were for us
source of rejoicing.

966
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:32,802
Our heart is saddened with the thought

967
01:15:33,044 --> 01:15:37,242
that the light which emanates from Bethlehem

968
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:43,278
illuminate a world
ensanglanté by the war.

969
01:15:44,644 --> 01:15:47,363
Nobody appreciates better
that President Roosevelt

970
01:15:47,564 --> 01:15:51,159
Ies constant efforts of Your Holiness
to prevent the war

971
01:15:51,404 --> 01:15:53,520
and to limit its contagion.

972
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:58,236
Your Holiness knows
ceaseless efforts of Pdt Roosevelt

973
01:15:58,444 --> 01:15:59,593
for the victory.

974
01:15:59,804 --> 01:16:01,157
A total victory.

975
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:05,077
Your moral assistance
in this effort

976
01:16:05,564 --> 01:16:08,476
will be highly appreciated
by the President.

977
01:16:24,604 --> 01:16:27,482
You have this time
the agreement of your superiors?

978
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:31,313
One refuses nothing with your sons,
protected from the Pope.

979
01:16:31,524 --> 01:16:33,276
The Holy Father loves you.

980
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:35,196
Yesterday, he said to me

981
01:16:35,444 --> 01:16:39,323
that Berlin will be a great experiment
diplomatic for you.

982
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:42,561
Diplomacy and Gospel
do they go together?

983
01:16:42,844 --> 01:16:43,959
In Christmas, one waited

984
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:45,796
its words of fire
against the crimes Nazis.

985
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:49,838
One needs evidence to the Pope for...

986
01:16:50,044 --> 01:16:53,798
I have an eyewitness
loan to come to testify.

987
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,313
An officer S.S.

988
01:17:00,004 --> 01:17:01,756
I have friends to lunch.

989
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:04,842
If you hold your language, you are welcome.

990
01:17:05,404 --> 01:17:07,440
Thank you, I will eat in my room.

991
01:17:07,644 --> 01:17:10,716
I wanted to present to you
with the American ambassador.

992
01:17:12,804 --> 01:17:14,681
Then, I come with pleasure.

993
01:17:26,884 --> 01:17:28,954
Arnulf! What a big boy!

994
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:31,679
I have something for you!

995
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:34,159
- It is what?
- Look at.

996
01:17:37,204 --> 01:17:38,956
I visited a factory not far.

997
01:17:39,164 --> 01:17:41,962
I made a turning to see you.

998
01:17:42,164 --> 01:17:43,153
Does that go?

999
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:45,924
Better than yesterday and less although tomorrow.

1000
01:17:46,804 --> 01:17:48,874
- Hello, Pasteur.
- Hello, Kurt.

1001
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:52,360
Small gifts of Ukraine.

1002
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,318
Forgiveness,

1003
01:17:55,524 --> 01:17:57,321
but there are rumours...

1004
01:18:00,804 --> 01:18:02,237
on Russia.

1005
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:04,560
It is said that a marshal of Reich
capitulated

1006
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:07,403
with its men
in a place named Stalingrad.

1007
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:10,514
You listen to the English radio?

1008
01:18:10,844 --> 01:18:12,641
Me? God keeps me! Not!

1009
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:14,641
It is a rumour...

1010
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:15,919
Propaganda,

1011
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,796
tall stories, defeatism.

1012
01:18:19,204 --> 01:18:21,843
Thank you, Kurt.
You remove me a great weight.

1013
01:18:22,044 --> 01:18:23,318
Goodbye, Pasteur.

1014
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:29,600
200000 died, 90000 prisoners.

1015
01:18:30,324 --> 01:18:33,521
We collect what Hitler sowed.

1016
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:35,996
200000 dead?

1017
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,596
I cannot remain a long time.

1018
01:18:39,724 --> 01:18:41,077
Go...

1019
01:18:41,604 --> 01:18:42,923
enter all!

1020
01:18:52,084 --> 01:18:54,598
This war destroyed our values...

1021
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:58,319
and the Church is the victim.

1022
01:18:59,964 --> 01:19:03,320
We had a warlike Pope,
he died.

1023
01:19:03,524 --> 01:19:06,721
Providence gave us
a Pope of peace,

1024
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:09,040
and the war burst!

1025
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:12,959
How are you?

1026
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:15,112
Sit down.

1027
01:19:15,724 --> 01:19:17,442
Here the American ambassador.

1028
01:19:17,644 --> 01:19:20,033
My son arrives from Berlin.

1029
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,559
Which news of Berlin?

1030
01:19:22,764 --> 01:19:24,356
This, Your Eminence.

1031
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:27,032
A S.S. gave me
this chart of Poland.

1032
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:31,476
It is the names and necessary
concentration camps.

1033
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:35,120
In red, the number of gazés perjury.

1034
01:19:35,364 --> 01:19:38,162
In black, estimates:

1035
01:19:38,564 --> 01:19:40,839
400000 of Hungary,

1036
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:42,318
200000 of Romania,

1037
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:45,275
80000 of Greece.

1038
01:19:47,804 --> 01:19:49,760
What can we make?

1039
01:19:50,004 --> 01:19:51,722
To negotiate to save them.

1040
01:19:51,924 --> 01:19:53,073
To negotiate with the Nazis?

1041
01:19:53,364 --> 01:19:55,514
Never we will negotiate
with these criminals.

1042
01:19:55,764 --> 01:19:57,243
To even save
a million lives?

1043
01:19:58,644 --> 01:20:01,681
Only our victory will save them.

1044
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:04,597
They will be reduced in front ashes.

1045
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:25,839
If the Holy Father interceded
near the Nazis for the Jews...

1046
01:20:26,604 --> 01:20:27,923
Out of question!

1047
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:31,753
The Holy Father must remain neutral
in order to act for peace.

1048
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:34,957
And there will not act to remain neutral.

1049
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:38,117
It could intervene in the name of Christ...

1050
01:20:38,324 --> 01:20:41,953
Germans
would occupy the Vatican then

1051
01:20:42,164 --> 01:20:43,961
and would plunder it.

1052
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,793
The Vatican should be saved
or Christianity?

1053
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:49,472
If by miracle it saved them,

1054
01:20:49,684 --> 01:20:51,754
your government
would it accomodate these Jews?

1055
01:20:52,004 --> 01:20:53,801
Why Hitler would it accept?

1056
01:20:54,004 --> 01:20:58,555
To carry a fatal blow
with the democracies which would accomodate them.

1057
01:20:58,924 --> 01:21:03,714
Goebbels said: "That those which like
the Jews take them, but naked ".

1058
01:21:04,004 --> 01:21:06,472
That would create an internal agitation,

1059
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:09,198
and a gigantic wave of anti-semitism.

1060
01:21:09,404 --> 01:21:10,439
Your desire

1061
01:21:10,764 --> 01:21:14,439
to save these unfortunate
fact of you an agent of Goebbels.

1062
01:21:14,764 --> 01:21:19,838
Since its rout with Stalingrad,
Hitler counts on our weaknesses.

1063
01:21:20,604 --> 01:21:24,882
To save Jews
our effort of war would slow down,

1064
01:21:25,084 --> 01:21:26,483
what would arrange it.

1065
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:31,312
While we lunch,
trains run towards the camps.

1066
01:21:31,524 --> 01:21:35,961
And our children die in the combat
to save the free world.

1067
01:21:37,604 --> 01:21:39,959
The world is sick...

1068
01:21:42,044 --> 01:21:44,035
Riccardo, my small,

1069
01:21:45,004 --> 01:21:48,280
I' Eglise is made of patience,

1070
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,514
of patience, faith

1071
01:21:51,724 --> 01:21:52,873
and of hard labour.

1072
01:21:54,044 --> 01:21:58,913
With the end, time
always give reason to the Church.

1073
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,716
Always.

1074
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:07,193
One should celebrate Easter
at the same date, each year.

1075
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:11,113
There are two great dates
for the Christians:

1076
01:22:11,644 --> 01:22:13,396
the festival of the Blessed Virgin,

1077
01:22:13,604 --> 01:22:15,993
August 15,

1078
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,956
and Christmas,

1079
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:20,280
December 25.

1080
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:23,442
Easter does not have fixed date.

1081
01:22:23,644 --> 01:22:27,273
The Christians need reference mark,

1082
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,634
if not they are lost,
they are mislaid...

1083
01:22:51,204 --> 01:22:54,833
Even the contrition
can be pride.

1084
01:22:58,524 --> 01:23:01,084
I feel guilty like witness

1085
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:03,559
and even more as priest.

1086
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:06,752
By pride and obstinacy,

1087
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:09,440
you trowels your future.

1088
01:23:10,764 --> 01:23:13,119
As long as I testify
love of Christ

1089
01:23:13,324 --> 01:23:17,317
for the men, all the men,
my future is assured.

1090
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:21,001
Hitler can destroy us,

1091
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:24,360
us, men of God

1092
01:23:24,764 --> 01:23:27,153
and all Christians of Europe.

1093
01:23:27,724 --> 01:23:30,636
If all Christians of Europe
became Jewish for a time,

1094
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:32,800
the time of persecutions,

1095
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:35,362
what would make the torturers?

1096
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:38,437
Reality is that there is
on a side Nazis,

1097
01:23:38,644 --> 01:23:39,997
other, Communists.

1098
01:23:40,404 --> 01:23:42,713
The Americans are still far.

1099
01:23:42,924 --> 01:23:45,313
If my friend from Berlin came to Rome,

1100
01:23:45,724 --> 01:23:47,396
would you meet it?

1101
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:50,157
If you think...

1102
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:53,158
that it of it is worthy, yes.

1103
01:23:54,044 --> 01:23:55,796
If you it judges worthy,

1104
01:23:56,684 --> 01:24:00,313
can you try to obtain to him
an audience with the Holy Father?

1105
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:06,154
Yes.

1106
01:24:06,644 --> 01:24:07,633
Thank you.

1107
01:24:16,644 --> 01:24:18,953
There is what is

1108
01:24:20,164 --> 01:24:22,883
and what should be.

1109
01:24:23,844 --> 01:24:25,197
Alas,

1110
01:24:25,724 --> 01:24:27,680
we must live with...

1111
01:24:29,004 --> 01:24:30,562
what is.

1112
01:24:35,524 --> 01:24:37,958
That made an eternity!
Bring to drinking.

1113
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:41,474
It did without the things from there
since our campfires!

1114
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:47,673
Sit down.

1115
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,957
What can I for you?

1116
01:24:58,164 --> 01:25:00,359
Can you organize me
a voyage to Rome?

1117
01:25:00,564 --> 01:25:03,032
- For you and your family?
- Me only.

1118
01:25:03,644 --> 01:25:04,963
An outward journey and return?

1119
01:25:05,724 --> 01:25:06,952
You want to leave when?

1120
01:25:07,404 --> 01:25:09,235
I do not have the date.

1121
01:25:12,244 --> 01:25:14,519
What do you think of the situation?

1122
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:18,994
I think that we were right,
the continuation will confirm it.

1123
01:25:19,884 --> 01:25:23,923
God thank you, my myopia
led me in this sinister place.

1124
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:26,035
Here, I can serve my fatherland

1125
01:25:26,244 --> 01:25:27,962
without disavowing my convictions

1126
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:30,242
nor to betray my faith.

1127
01:25:33,844 --> 01:25:34,993
Where did you land?

1128
01:25:35,324 --> 01:25:36,598
With disinfection.

1129
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:38,317
Vast program.

1130
01:25:39,364 --> 01:25:42,083
I make you a priority master key.

1131
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:44,514
You will travel when you want.

1132
01:25:46,404 --> 01:25:47,519
I do it with your name?

1133
01:25:47,804 --> 01:25:49,442
Of course, thank you.

1134
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:52,196
In these heroic times,

1135
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:55,760
you obtained a title
or a rank?

1136
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:59,235
Lieutenant of Waffen S.S.

1137
01:26:05,564 --> 01:26:07,919
Address yourself to transport of the S.S.

1138
01:26:08,404 --> 01:26:09,883
It is a private voyage.

1139
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:11,597
Thank you for your visit.

1140
01:26:13,484 --> 01:26:16,601
You must send
more and more of trains in the East,

1141
01:26:16,924 --> 01:26:18,152
goods trains.

1142
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:21,433
Do you know what you transport?

1143
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:22,520
Goods.

1144
01:26:23,564 --> 01:26:24,633
Men too.

1145
01:26:25,324 --> 01:26:26,598
Labour.

1146
01:26:26,804 --> 01:26:29,637
Industry develops much
in the East.

1147
01:26:33,204 --> 01:26:34,557
Put your photograph...

1148
01:26:35,084 --> 01:26:37,473
in S.S., it will go better.

1149
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:39,757
And if I said to you

1150
01:26:39,964 --> 01:26:43,752
that families there are piled up
to lead them to the slaughter-house?

1151
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:48,883
Leave from here,
if not I call the police force or Gestapo.

1152
01:26:52,644 --> 01:26:53,838
I did not change, Karl.

1153
01:26:54,044 --> 01:26:55,318
Me either.

1154
01:26:55,524 --> 01:26:57,640
These trains carry out us in hell.

1155
01:26:57,844 --> 01:26:59,641
I do not deal with freight.

1156
01:27:01,964 --> 01:27:06,242
- You am the rotation of the trains?
- I help my country to gain the war.

1157
01:27:06,444 --> 01:27:09,197
And if these trains were slowed down?

1158
01:27:10,244 --> 01:27:11,962
Will you leave from here?

1159
01:27:12,204 --> 01:27:14,513
Or you prefer
what do I call the police force?

1160
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:16,877
Make leave it!

1161
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:20,396
You can join to me
at the Institute of Hygiene.

1162
01:27:20,604 --> 01:27:23,437
That Christ
take care on you and hold them.

1163
01:27:25,644 --> 01:27:27,680
Bastard of S.S.

1164
01:28:00,724 --> 01:28:02,237
I must set out again tomorrow evening.

1165
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:06,400
It is short, but I think
that my father will obtain the audience.

1166
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:09,914
I learned that 400 S.S.
arrived to Rome,

1167
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,398
a special unit.

1168
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:14,072
The Allies approach Naples.

1169
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:16,876
More than 3 million were gazés.

1170
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:18,278
Three million?

1171
01:28:18,484 --> 01:28:19,712
Here are them...

1172
01:28:19,924 --> 01:28:23,314
Ies delivery orders of gas Zyklon.

1173
01:28:23,724 --> 01:28:26,113
On these charts
all the camps appear.

1174
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:28,121
It is what it is necessary
to convince them.

1175
01:28:28,324 --> 01:28:29,393
There is a stopping.

1176
01:28:33,884 --> 01:28:35,363
What is it?

1177
01:29:01,404 --> 01:29:04,123
Saturdays, they are sure
to find them on their premises.

1178
01:29:12,204 --> 01:29:13,603
One can nothing make.

1179
01:29:45,204 --> 01:29:48,401
- What does it occur?
- Count, can you lodge us?

1180
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:54,073
Lead them to the house of friends. Go!

1181
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,158
- They are in your street.
- I know.

1182
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:30,438
The Holy Father rose very early
this morning.

1183
01:30:30,644 --> 01:30:32,157
It awaits you.

1184
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:41,397
- Principessa!
- the Germans stop the Jews!

1185
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:44,164
Here even, with the corner of the street.

1186
01:30:54,484 --> 01:30:57,920
Not, my sister, it should be found.
Please...

1187
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,273
Say to me...

1188
01:31:01,484 --> 01:31:02,439
What?

1189
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:04,760
Why your father
is it so close to the Pope?

1190
01:31:04,964 --> 01:31:08,161
We are auxiliaries
papal throne.

1191
01:31:11,044 --> 01:31:12,238
Thank you, my sister.

1192
01:31:12,524 --> 01:31:14,196
My father is with the Pope.

1193
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:29,238
We learned
that they also stop converted.

1194
01:31:37,244 --> 01:31:39,883
Convene the Weizsacker ambassador.

1195
01:31:40,084 --> 01:31:42,279
We require explanations.

1196
01:31:42,524 --> 01:31:45,561
Make starts to him from Our anger
and of Our sorrow.

1197
01:31:47,244 --> 01:31:48,472
Not...

1198
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:52,397
Of Our sorrow and Our anger.

1199
01:32:14,164 --> 01:32:15,438
Mgr Hudal!

1200
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:19,434
Is eminence, my father here?

1201
01:32:20,684 --> 01:32:22,276
The Count is with the Main thing.

1202
01:32:22,484 --> 01:32:23,963
Gerstein, a friend.

1203
01:32:25,644 --> 01:32:27,839
- It one is converted?
- Forgiveness?

1204
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:31,320
That does not change anything,
but we separate the two sensitivities.

1205
01:32:31,804 --> 01:32:35,194
Not, Kurt is Aryan.
We must see my father.

1206
01:32:35,684 --> 01:32:38,835
It discusses provisioning
with the Main thing.

1207
01:32:40,444 --> 01:32:42,799
We have 56 refugees:

1208
01:32:43,004 --> 01:32:45,074
11 children, 5 gitans,

1209
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:49,243
3 Communists and 12 old men
requiring medical care.

1210
01:32:49,444 --> 01:32:52,083
I will send a doctor,
flour...

1211
01:32:52,284 --> 01:32:55,196
Meat and pastes are hard to find.

1212
01:32:55,564 --> 01:32:57,555
There is many refugees.

1213
01:32:57,884 --> 01:33:00,717
- Your son is there with a friend.
- Really?

1214
01:33:06,884 --> 01:33:09,603
- Kurt Gerstein.
- Delighted by you meet, Count.

1215
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:12,364
- You obtained the audience?
- Forgiveness...

1216
01:33:12,564 --> 01:33:13,917
In the current situation,

1217
01:33:14,124 --> 01:33:17,400
it is unthinkable
that the Pope meets a German,

1218
01:33:17,604 --> 01:33:19,560
especially an officer S.S.

1219
01:33:20,724 --> 01:33:22,316
And the Cardinal?

1220
01:33:23,644 --> 01:33:25,999
- Go ahead. I prevent it.
- You accompany us?

1221
01:33:26,204 --> 01:33:30,322
I must make sure that the convents
accomodate these unhappy.

1222
01:33:30,524 --> 01:33:31,673
By here.

1223
01:33:47,604 --> 01:33:50,641
Wait there,
an authorization is needed.

1224
01:33:56,244 --> 01:33:58,314
It is out of question...

1225
01:34:00,364 --> 01:34:01,922
that a S.S...

1226
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,521
who betrays his country

1227
01:34:06,244 --> 01:34:07,597
enter here.

1228
01:34:08,044 --> 01:34:11,320
Certain treasons
are the last weapon of right.

1229
01:34:14,884 --> 01:34:16,715
We all love you.

1230
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,514
The Pope, your father

1231
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:21,472
and myself

1232
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:24,956
let us include/understand the distress of your heart

1233
01:34:25,444 --> 01:34:27,594
but it overpowers us

1234
01:34:28,324 --> 01:34:30,884
and the life poisons us.

1235
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:37,159
Put yourself there,

1236
01:34:38,244 --> 01:34:40,678
you will replace my secretary.

1237
01:34:41,724 --> 01:34:43,362
You will take notes...

1238
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,761
and you will include/understand

1239
01:34:46,084 --> 01:34:48,552
how the diplomacy functions.

1240
01:34:55,764 --> 01:34:58,119
The Vatican
has the largest masterpieces.

1241
01:34:58,324 --> 01:35:00,758
And no division to defend them.

1242
01:35:01,004 --> 01:35:04,713
Mr. I' Ambassadeur,
I would be grateful to you to order

1243
01:35:04,924 --> 01:35:08,519
that one ceases immediately
these arrests in Rome.

1244
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:13,594
Twenty days ago,
the commander S.S. Kapler,

1245
01:35:14,004 --> 01:35:15,881
required 50 kilos of gold

1246
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:17,995
not to off-set the Jews.

1247
01:35:18,204 --> 01:35:21,321
The Jewish community gave to him

1248
01:35:21,524 --> 01:35:24,721
and now, they are stopped!

1249
01:35:26,324 --> 01:35:28,997
Must one think that your government

1250
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,562
does not respect its word?

1251
01:35:33,084 --> 01:35:34,199
Alas...

1252
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:39,232
I wait until you say to me:
"Why you do not resign?"

1253
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,952
It is painful for the Holy Father,

1254
01:35:43,164 --> 01:35:44,916
beyond what one can imagine,

1255
01:35:45,124 --> 01:35:47,763
that in Rome, under its eyes,

1256
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:50,359
one makes suffer so much from people

1257
01:35:50,564 --> 01:35:53,124
because they are of another race.

1258
01:35:54,524 --> 01:35:57,641
What would make the Holy See
if that continued?

1259
01:35:58,124 --> 01:36:02,834
The Holy Father would not like
to have to express its disapproval.

1260
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:06,396
This is an official request
of the Holy Father?

1261
01:36:07,564 --> 01:36:11,000
It wishes not to have to do one of them.

1262
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:16,798
Until now,

1263
01:36:17,164 --> 01:36:21,521
it did not say anything but the Germans
can take as a hostile act.

1264
01:36:21,724 --> 01:36:23,521
But there are limits.

1265
01:36:23,804 --> 01:36:27,877
If the Holy Father were
in the need for protesting,

1266
01:36:28,124 --> 01:36:32,402
it would go back from there
with Divine Providence.

1267
01:36:34,844 --> 01:36:36,277
One says to me

1268
01:36:36,484 --> 01:36:39,794
that one also stops converted!

1269
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:43,841
Protest, Monseigneur.

1270
01:36:44,964 --> 01:36:45,919
Protest.

1271
01:36:58,444 --> 01:37:01,242
- What do you make in Rome?
- Rolf Grober, what a surprised!

1272
01:37:01,444 --> 01:37:03,719
You came to disinfect the Vatican?

1273
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:06,752
I seek a means
to return to Berlin.

1274
01:37:06,964 --> 01:37:08,920
Who is in load of transport?

1275
01:37:09,124 --> 01:37:10,523
Lieutenant Nitzel.

1276
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:12,601
I will present to you.

1277
01:37:13,484 --> 01:37:14,917
There is an insane world!

1278
01:37:15,724 --> 01:37:17,237
Still not enough.

1279
01:37:17,524 --> 01:37:19,799
Italian is kosher fascists.

1280
01:37:20,004 --> 01:37:22,518
Without them, we would have the double of it!

1281
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:24,960
They only think of flying.

1282
01:37:25,884 --> 01:37:28,682
- I present to you in Nitzel.
- What will you make them?

1283
01:37:28,924 --> 01:37:32,758
Why one is there?
One is converted since two generations.

1284
01:37:42,244 --> 01:37:43,643
Good return in Berlin.

1285
01:37:46,564 --> 01:37:49,840
A thousand leaves tomorrow evening
by the station of Tibertina.

1286
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:52,353
Tiburtina. Trastevere.

1287
01:37:59,004 --> 01:38:00,881
Nothing any more will stop them.

1288
01:38:03,404 --> 01:38:05,360
There is still a means.

1289
01:38:14,124 --> 01:38:16,319
What must we know
on Cassino Goes up?

1290
01:38:16,524 --> 01:38:19,243
The Americans bombard without respite.

1291
01:38:19,844 --> 01:38:22,597
The Germans always hold.

1292
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:27,277
Part of the monastery is destroyed,
especially the southern wing.

1293
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:29,353
The library...

1294
01:38:29,564 --> 01:38:32,954
It is surely destroyed.

1295
01:38:33,884 --> 01:38:36,034
They also bombarded the vault.

1296
01:38:36,444 --> 01:38:41,279
Mr. Weizsäcker said to me that the Germans
will never leave Monte Cassino.

1297
01:38:41,484 --> 01:38:43,839
We solicited
the American representative

1298
01:38:44,564 --> 01:38:47,237
to make cease
bombardments but...

1299
01:38:47,764 --> 01:38:49,720
there is little hope.

1300
01:38:50,364 --> 01:38:52,559
We received the gifts
of the Spelmann Cardinal

1301
01:38:53,364 --> 01:38:56,515
and of the company of the Jesuits.

1302
01:38:57,124 --> 01:38:58,034
The Holy Father...

1303
01:39:00,244 --> 01:39:01,996
1000 Jews will be off-set

1304
01:39:02,204 --> 01:39:04,160
if your Holiness does not act.

1305
01:39:04,644 --> 01:39:07,477
We consider your zeal with love.

1306
01:39:08,124 --> 01:39:11,036
Who defends persecuted
speak in Our Office.

1307
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:12,802
But, in fact,

1308
01:39:13,004 --> 01:39:15,438
only moderation
can make us honor.

1309
01:39:17,444 --> 01:39:19,878
But they will be off-set this night!

1310
01:39:20,444 --> 01:39:22,514
If the Holy Father shows himself at the station,

1311
01:39:22,804 --> 01:39:25,841
as in San Lorenzo
after the American bombardments,

1312
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:26,999
The train will not leave.

1313
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,517
Mister the Secretary,

1314
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:34,401
I' Eglise opened its convents
and its monasteries with oppressed.

1315
01:39:34,804 --> 01:39:37,443
Many Jews
are under our protection.

1316
01:39:37,724 --> 01:39:40,557
The German ambassador
ensured me that the others

1317
01:39:40,764 --> 01:39:42,959
are led to a camp of work.

1318
01:39:43,164 --> 01:39:46,122
- With women and children?
- You want to separate the families?

1319
01:39:46,324 --> 01:39:48,315
Are off-set they to kill them!

1320
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:51,402
It is up to the Christians
and of the Vatican to save them...

1321
01:39:51,604 --> 01:39:53,435
Leave from here, how you dare!

1322
01:39:53,644 --> 01:39:55,123
Count, make conceal it.

1323
01:39:55,324 --> 01:39:57,076
Very the Holy Father,

1324
01:39:57,364 --> 01:40:00,436
with all the respect
had with those which impose silence to Us,

1325
01:40:00,644 --> 01:40:04,398
I beseech Your Holiness
to act personally.

1326
01:40:04,604 --> 01:40:05,832
In Germany,

1327
01:40:06,244 --> 01:40:07,518
in Austria,

1328
01:40:08,164 --> 01:40:12,077
many are the Christians
who have hope only in Us.

1329
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:14,317
Can we overpower them

1330
01:40:14,564 --> 01:40:16,555
with a new burden

1331
01:40:16,884 --> 01:40:20,797
whereas they undergo
terrible bombardments?

1332
01:40:23,764 --> 01:40:25,277
At the proper time,

1333
01:40:26,044 --> 01:40:30,435
we will intercede
in order to restore an equitable peace

1334
01:40:32,404 --> 01:40:34,713
who will link all the Christians.

1335
01:40:35,924 --> 01:40:37,437
Our prayers,

1336
01:40:38,404 --> 01:40:40,793
our cries of pain...

1337
01:40:45,924 --> 01:40:46,834
Withdraw that!

1338
01:40:47,044 --> 01:40:49,274
You do not know what you do!

1339
01:40:49,484 --> 01:40:51,156
It is a blasphemy!

1340
01:40:51,364 --> 01:40:54,401
On the dress of a servant of Christ!

1341
01:40:59,884 --> 01:41:01,203
Forgiveness, father...

1342
01:41:20,884 --> 01:41:24,479
I request Your Holiness
to raise me of my functions.

1343
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:41,356
Who would know better than Us
is what it to be Père?

1344
01:41:44,684 --> 01:41:46,959
It is a crown of spines.

1345
01:43:34,284 --> 01:43:35,683
The baby died.

1346
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:41,193
The priest!

1347
01:43:55,084 --> 01:43:57,200
A priest among the Jews?

1348
01:43:57,404 --> 01:43:58,519
What?

1349
01:44:11,484 --> 01:44:14,237
- Coffee or schnapps, captain?
- both.

1350
01:44:17,164 --> 01:44:18,995
Isn't the doctor descended?

1351
01:44:19,924 --> 01:44:22,040
It is too early for him.

1352
01:44:39,684 --> 01:44:40,275
What?

1353
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:42,998
They took on board a priest
with the Jews.

1354
01:44:43,244 --> 01:44:45,599
It says being secretary
of the Nuncio in Berlin.

1355
01:44:45,804 --> 01:44:49,638
- Which did that?
- idiots, to undoubtedly have fun.

1356
01:44:49,884 --> 01:44:52,079
I fear that it is
a spy of the Vatican.

1357
01:44:52,284 --> 01:44:54,752
To convert the Jews
during the voyage?

1358
01:44:54,964 --> 01:44:56,443
To see what one does here.

1359
01:44:56,644 --> 01:44:58,396
What did it see?

1360
01:44:58,884 --> 01:45:01,398
Here nothing, but it made the voyage.
Four days.

1361
01:45:01,604 --> 01:45:04,880
In its coach,
there were 8 died including 5 children.

1362
01:45:05,244 --> 01:45:06,472
What of other?

1363
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:09,603
It is said that it is the cousin of the Pope.

1364
01:45:10,324 --> 01:45:11,643
It denies.

1365
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:13,841
It is here by error.

1366
01:45:15,884 --> 01:45:18,239
Fritsche, they all are to it!

1367
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:26,082
If he is a secretary of the Nuncio,
it should be released.

1368
01:45:26,284 --> 01:45:27,876
It is sure that it is not Jewish.

1369
01:45:28,084 --> 01:45:30,552
I issue that it is Jewish.

1370
01:45:36,324 --> 01:45:38,121
You, over there!

1371
01:45:38,564 --> 01:45:39,713
Your Holiness...

1372
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:42,597
Approach.

1373
01:45:44,724 --> 01:45:46,715
It is said to me that you are not Jewish?

1374
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,357
I am like the different ones.

1375
01:45:49,124 --> 01:45:51,797
One needs volunteers
and priests

1376
01:45:52,004 --> 01:45:53,995
if somebody dies.

1377
01:45:54,564 --> 01:45:58,273
Work is hard,
it is our Ruhr news.

1378
01:45:58,844 --> 01:46:00,800
Factories of death,

1379
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:02,719
this odor...

1380
01:46:02,964 --> 01:46:04,920
Pharmaceutical factories.

1381
01:46:05,124 --> 01:46:06,842
That feels the nitrogen, the gum...

1382
01:46:07,084 --> 01:46:08,483
I know what it is.

1383
01:46:08,684 --> 01:46:10,481
It came espionner!

1384
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:16,033
You want to be crucifié?
I have another project.

1385
01:46:16,244 --> 01:46:18,041
You will learn the tolerance.

1386
01:46:18,644 --> 01:46:22,159
Your Church, formerly,
purified by roughing-hew it.

1387
01:46:24,364 --> 01:46:27,356
The Nazism makes in the same way
on a large scale.

1388
01:46:27,564 --> 01:46:30,522
In a direction,
we are the new elected people.

1389
01:46:31,524 --> 01:46:32,752
Amen!

1390
01:46:33,244 --> 01:46:35,474
I am a little catholic myself.

1391
01:46:35,684 --> 01:46:37,800
Not as excessively pious person as him...

1392
01:46:38,484 --> 01:46:39,200
Fritsche,

1393
01:46:41,444 --> 01:46:44,004
you fall into the sentimentality.

1394
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:45,639
Leave us.

1395
01:46:47,004 --> 01:46:49,518
And send to me a kapo
for our canon.

1396
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:53,440
It is very believing.
It does not like that one speaks religion here.

1397
01:46:53,644 --> 01:46:55,202
But it is a good soldier.

1398
01:47:05,964 --> 01:47:07,682
In six months or a year,

1399
01:47:09,004 --> 01:47:10,596
we will lose the war.

1400
01:47:10,804 --> 01:47:13,557
It will be our turn
to enter the catacombs.

1401
01:47:13,764 --> 01:47:17,120
Find-me of comfortable in Rome
and I leave you...

1402
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:19,753
from where nobody never left.

1403
01:47:20,124 --> 01:47:24,675
You will hang your testimony
with the bells of Saint-Pierre.

1404
01:47:26,884 --> 01:47:28,442
You are pitiful.

1405
01:47:29,044 --> 01:47:30,477
The world knows already.

1406
01:47:30,924 --> 01:47:34,633
I know, but note it
that divine anger

1407
01:47:34,844 --> 01:47:38,314
do not thunder in the sky,
nor allied bombers.

1408
01:47:38,764 --> 01:47:43,042
They crush our cities,
but here, the sky is serene and empty.

1409
01:47:43,924 --> 01:47:47,075
The sky is never empty.

1410
01:47:50,164 --> 01:47:52,075
Put it at Probing Kommando.

1411
01:47:52,284 --> 01:47:55,003
It my is protected.
Do not touch one of its hair,

1412
01:47:55,204 --> 01:47:57,593
nor its star
nor a wire of its cassock.

1413
01:47:57,844 --> 01:47:59,641
You will work with the crematory ones.

1414
01:47:59,844 --> 01:48:03,120
If God is some share here,
you will find it.

1415
01:48:03,324 --> 01:48:03,961
Goes...

1416
01:48:29,804 --> 01:48:31,203
I need a car.

1417
01:48:33,044 --> 01:48:35,797
One needs a priority order,
my lieutenant.

1418
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:38,479
Hold.

1419
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:40,833
Immediately.

1420
01:48:58,684 --> 01:49:01,835
Afflicted, my Lt.
There is a priority convoy.

1421
01:49:27,484 --> 01:49:29,998
Construction will be finished
in December 45.

1422
01:49:30,204 --> 01:49:32,957
The production will start into 46.

1423
01:49:33,204 --> 01:49:35,479
- I fear that...
- What?

1424
01:49:35,684 --> 01:49:38,835
The labour which arrives
is of worse into worse.

1425
01:49:39,044 --> 01:49:41,194
Does all go from worse into worse, not?

1426
01:49:47,724 --> 01:49:50,636
Startup in 1946,
yes or not?

1427
01:49:51,124 --> 01:49:52,352
Yes, of course.

1428
01:49:54,524 --> 01:49:55,320
Enter!

1429
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:57,721
I must speak to you into private.

1430
01:50:10,764 --> 01:50:11,958
It is necessary to make quickly.

1431
01:50:12,244 --> 01:50:14,917
Fritsche wanted to release it
dice its arrival here.

1432
01:50:15,124 --> 01:50:18,355
To joke,
the doctor put at Probing Kommando.

1433
01:50:18,564 --> 01:50:20,077
It has all considering.

1434
01:50:20,324 --> 01:50:22,679
The Nuncio requires explanations.

1435
01:50:22,884 --> 01:50:24,522
Himmler is afraid of the consequences.

1436
01:50:24,724 --> 01:50:26,442
Is Himmler... afraid?

1437
01:50:26,644 --> 01:50:29,078
This priest will go to Berlin.

1438
01:50:29,484 --> 01:50:31,395
Never in Rome, all is envisaged.

1439
01:50:31,604 --> 01:50:33,196
Fritsche, you occupy in.

1440
01:50:35,604 --> 01:50:39,483
One will make him sign
that it saw only floors of flowers.

1441
01:50:41,924 --> 01:50:43,994
Wait the canteen.

1442
01:50:48,364 --> 01:50:51,436
Known as In Berlin
that I do not have nothing to do there.

1443
01:51:05,604 --> 01:51:07,481
It will be there in five minutes.

1444
01:51:07,684 --> 01:51:08,878
What of other?

1445
01:51:09,604 --> 01:51:12,072
Known as In Berlin
that I do not have nothing to do there.

1446
01:51:12,284 --> 01:51:13,683
Do not make any you.

1447
01:51:48,084 --> 01:51:49,563
Corporal, lay out.

1448
01:51:58,884 --> 01:52:00,112
My God...

1449
01:52:03,404 --> 01:52:05,998
Your father was sure
that you were in this train.

1450
01:52:10,324 --> 01:52:11,882
I take you along.

1451
01:52:21,684 --> 01:52:24,437
God leaves his children...

1452
01:52:25,604 --> 01:52:26,957
to be made devour.

1453
01:52:30,884 --> 01:52:32,795
I want to include/understand...

1454
01:52:33,644 --> 01:52:34,713
why.

1455
01:52:37,644 --> 01:52:39,680
Why sacrifice you?

1456
01:52:42,404 --> 01:52:43,473
You are wrong...

1457
01:52:43,684 --> 01:52:45,436
You are wrong.

1458
01:52:45,924 --> 01:52:48,882
It is necessary to go to say to the world
what occurs here.

1459
01:52:49,524 --> 01:52:51,242
I cannot leave.

1460
01:52:53,444 --> 01:52:54,274
Gerstein!

1461
01:52:55,404 --> 01:52:56,962
The world knows all.

1462
01:52:58,244 --> 01:53:00,633
Look at,
it does not have any more the air of a priest!

1463
01:53:00,924 --> 01:53:03,677
Put it with those which he likes so much!

1464
01:53:03,884 --> 01:53:06,682
It is a diplomat of the Vatican,
it is here by error.

1465
01:53:06,884 --> 01:53:08,920
Me also, I am here by error.

1466
01:53:13,164 --> 01:53:15,394
It is the martial court...

1467
01:53:16,364 --> 01:53:18,480
Falsification of an order of Himmler.

1468
01:53:18,684 --> 01:53:19,673
You were in Rome

1469
01:53:20,444 --> 01:53:21,923
pleurnicher for your safety.

1470
01:53:23,124 --> 01:53:25,319
And me which trusted you...

1471
01:53:25,844 --> 01:53:27,197
By the chimney!

1472
01:53:28,844 --> 01:53:30,596
It will go more quickly to the sky.

1473
01:54:06,804 --> 01:54:09,682
I spoke in Himmler, on the telephone.

1474
01:54:10,724 --> 01:54:14,683
It wants to make disappear
all traces of the mass graves.

1475
01:54:15,844 --> 01:54:17,721
Do not make not astonished.

1476
01:54:19,004 --> 01:54:22,758
Tomorrow, it will ask
to dismount the showers and the furnaces.

1477
01:54:23,244 --> 01:54:25,963
It tries to exchange
Hungarian Jews

1478
01:54:26,164 --> 01:54:28,758
but it does not find taking.

1479
01:54:30,444 --> 01:54:34,198
The priest found you
good contacts in Rome?

1480
01:54:34,404 --> 01:54:35,393
Yes.

1481
01:54:36,044 --> 01:54:38,797
If you want to benefit from it,
it is needed alive.

1482
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:40,073
Too much late.

1483
01:54:41,564 --> 01:54:43,634
I will only manage.

1484
01:54:58,684 --> 01:55:01,244
The most glorious page
German history

1485
01:55:01,444 --> 01:55:03,321
will never be written.

1486
01:55:13,764 --> 01:55:15,994
Did Rome remain a pleasant city?

1487
01:55:19,444 --> 01:55:21,833
I will not leave my country.

1488
01:55:22,044 --> 01:55:24,638
They will hang to us, Kurt.
You before me.

1489
01:55:25,244 --> 01:55:28,475
Your name is on the invoices
of Zyklon.

1490
01:55:31,684 --> 01:55:32,958
Return on your premise,

1491
01:55:33,164 --> 01:55:35,314
at the Institute, where you will want...

1492
01:55:37,444 --> 01:55:40,834
One does not need more your competences.

1493
01:55:42,684 --> 01:55:45,960
Your God will have problems
with you, Gerstein.

1494
01:56:09,804 --> 01:56:10,919
What does it occur?

1495
01:56:11,124 --> 01:56:12,921
Pasteur, I am in a hurry.

1496
01:56:13,764 --> 01:56:15,561
What will we make?

1497
01:56:23,084 --> 01:56:24,278
You returned!

1498
01:56:25,964 --> 01:56:27,158
I must set out again.

1499
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:39,393
Dad is there!

1500
01:57:24,004 --> 01:57:28,395
You will know finally what I did,
what I know. I will be the witness...

1501
01:57:28,644 --> 01:57:30,794
You will not be listened to.
The S.S. are...

1502
01:57:31,004 --> 01:57:33,837
I have evidence,
figures, of the names.

1503
01:57:34,324 --> 01:57:35,677
I will go...

1504
01:57:36,764 --> 01:57:38,322
The Americans will include/understand.

1505
01:57:38,924 --> 01:57:41,802
The French are more meadows.
The Americans are far.

1506
01:57:42,004 --> 01:57:46,202
- You cannot cross the lines.
- the face is ploughed up.

1507
01:57:46,404 --> 01:57:48,918
Pasteur said to me that you were there.

1508
01:57:49,844 --> 01:57:51,800
What did it arrive to us, Kurt?

1509
01:57:52,084 --> 01:57:53,802
All that one does say is true?

1510
01:57:54,724 --> 01:57:55,918
All.

1511
01:57:56,924 --> 01:57:57,800
I knew it,

1512
01:57:58,084 --> 01:58:00,803
but will it be lends in time?

1513
01:58:01,444 --> 01:58:02,320
What?

1514
01:58:03,364 --> 01:58:05,002
The secret weapon.

1515
01:58:07,324 --> 01:58:08,234
Yes.

1516
01:58:09,564 --> 01:58:10,553
I knew it.

1517
01:58:10,764 --> 01:58:11,879
One will stop them.

1518
01:58:12,084 --> 01:58:13,756
Give your uniform, my son.

1519
01:58:14,284 --> 01:58:15,558
Father...

1520
01:58:16,564 --> 01:58:18,122
I leave on mission.

1521
01:58:39,604 --> 01:58:40,957
Wait there.

1522
01:58:45,044 --> 01:58:47,877
That it waits.
Gerstein did not finish.

1523
01:58:57,444 --> 01:59:00,754
The friend written Gerstein
the French version of his report/ratio.

1524
01:59:00,964 --> 01:59:02,113
Another version?

1525
01:59:05,284 --> 01:59:06,683
What do you think of him?

1526
01:59:06,884 --> 01:59:09,603
It says to have resisted
with the policy of the atrocities.

1527
01:59:09,804 --> 01:59:13,558
It resisted
while being inside up to that point!

1528
01:59:14,404 --> 01:59:15,723
I do not believe it guilty.

1529
01:59:16,004 --> 01:59:18,916
His report/ratio is a significant document.

1530
01:59:20,644 --> 01:59:23,158
Here is the bill of indictment against him.

1531
01:59:43,724 --> 01:59:47,160
"... that it was not
neither comprehensible nor excusable

1532
01:59:47,524 --> 01:59:49,799
"that a Christian convinced like him

1533
01:59:50,004 --> 01:59:52,074
"did not make
all that was in its capacity

1534
01:59:53,124 --> 01:59:56,753
to keep away
criminal system... "

1535
02:00:13,604 --> 02:00:16,960
One found the S.S. Gerstein
hung in its cell.

1536
02:00:18,124 --> 02:00:20,035
It was hung or it was hung?

1537
02:00:20,244 --> 02:00:21,563
I do not know.

1538
02:00:22,564 --> 02:00:24,361
I want a report/ratio written.

1539
02:00:51,444 --> 02:00:52,877
Mgr Hudal?

1540
02:00:56,924 --> 02:00:59,677
Your friends suggested me the United States.

1541
02:00:59,884 --> 02:01:03,843
They take only specialists
in chemistry, aviation, physics...

1542
02:01:04,044 --> 02:01:04,920
biology...

1543
02:01:05,404 --> 02:01:07,998
I am a doctor, simple doctor.

1544
02:01:08,204 --> 02:01:10,513
Then, it will be Argentina.

1545
02:01:10,844 --> 02:01:12,914
There is a boat in six days.

1546
02:01:13,284 --> 02:01:16,003
While waiting, I put to you over there.

1547
02:01:38,428 --> 02:01:44,776
The Report/ratio of Gerstein contributed
with the authentification of the Holocaust.

1548
02:01:47,028 --> 02:01:52,148
Kurt Gerstein was rehabilitated
20 years later

1549
02:01:52,149 --> 02:02:59,149
translated from Greek to English
