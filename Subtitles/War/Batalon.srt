Батальонъ

Battalion

3
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,911
Russia.
Spring 1917.

4
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,672
The First World War has waged for three years.
The Emperor has obdicated. The empire is crumbling.

5
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,380
Political dissent has wrecked the country.
The army has been demoralized.

6
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:15,224
A Provisional Government headed
by Alexander Kerenskiy has taken charge.

7
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:19,860
Times are tough, chaotic and desperate...

8
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:58,924
- Thanks!
- Good luck, Lieutenant.

9
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,553
- To the city. Palace Street.
- Three rubles...

10
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,887
That fare is apalling.
It used to be one ruble.

11
00:03:58,043 --> 00:04:01,168
It looks like you haven't been in
St. Petersburg a while, Sir.

12
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,179
One ruble is worthless since February.

13
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,471
Go!

14
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,977
- Did you come from the front?
- Yes, yes, from the front.

15
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:17,784
Kerenskiy is in charge,
and it is a chaos here.

16
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,326
Many prisoners were released...

17
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,849
Political prisoners, thugs, murderers...

18
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,787
And they roam the streets.

19
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,868
There is no law.

20
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:34,608
And there is a new police.

21
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:37,212
They are called Militia.
And they bring no bnefit!

22
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:41,527
- How is the front?
- Just like at the front.

23
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:32,424
Nadya, you sound a bit apathetic.

24
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:36,106
You pause for too long.

25
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,692
Mom, I sing the way maestro Piccoli taught me.

26
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:43,154
I'm your mother and I know not less.

27
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,394
And...

28
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:49,353
Miss, Miss...

29
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,008
A letter from the front.

30
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,563
Mom...

31
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,699
What happened?

32
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:04,096
- Nadya... Nadenjka, what happened?
- Petya was killed in combat.

33
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,065
They were engaged.

34
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,826
...Vera..

35
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,795
I'll make them pay for this.

36
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,879
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm off to war.

37
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,326
I'm going to the Bochkareva women's battalion.

38
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,295
I will have revenge.

39
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:26,077
Me too.

40
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,681
Nadya, what are you talking about?

41
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,494
I'll join Vera, Mom.

42
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:42,015
Frosya... Frosenjka, bring her back!

43
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:45,714
Frosenjka, bring her back!

44
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,475
Madam, but what can I do? Where?...

45
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,652
Wait, wait...

46
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:01,242
- Dear, take anything. Just bring her back, please! Hear me?
- I'll do it! Will force her back!

47
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,196
- Bring her back!
- I'll do it Madam. Thank you, thank you very much...

48
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,966
I will, ma'am.
Thank you very much...

49
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:22,643
- Here and thank you.
- You're welcome.

50
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:28,269
Lieutenant... Commander meeting has started
Where were you?

51
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:32,279
Hell knows.
The train only went to New Peterhof.

52
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:35,509
Then I had to improvise.

53
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:40,317
So, gentlemen.

54
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,029
Our main attack will be
on the Southwestern front.

55
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:47,645
The Eleventh and Seventh Army will go to Lviv.

56
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,458
The Eighth Army...

57
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,843
Please excuse me, gentlemen...

58
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:03,944
Please excuse me, gentlemen...
But we need to discuss thisgng more important than the attack plan.

59
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:07,073
We need to develop a plan of attack.

60
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:14,001
I am skeptical about the
combat readiness of our army.

61
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,189
What are you trying to say?

62
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:17,647
I'll say it as it is.

63
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:23,741
The soldiers have been seduced by idiotic
slogans, a false freedom.

64
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,387
They don't want to fight.

65
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,523
What are you talking about?

66
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,928
"False freedom"?

67
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:34,106
Our department prepared a report on...

68
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,754
the state of combat readiness
at the moment.

69
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,367
- May I show you the report.
- Go ahead, Colonel. Proceed.

70
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:43,197
- Don't beat around the bush.
- Sure.

71
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,659
Please, open the curtains!

72
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:49,888
If you don't mind.

73
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:53,847
Wow! A movie!
Turn off the lights, please!

74
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:56,555
Go!

75
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,046
This is part of the 256th St. Elisabeth Guardian Regiment.

76
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:17,390
The soldiers refuse to fight.

77
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:21,348
They organize meetings
and hang out with the Germans.

78
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:24,838
The Germans encourage them to revolt.

79
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:30,881
They offer them alcohol...
Their pamphlets are written in correct Russian.

80
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,475
And this is the 525th Regiment,
of First Siberian Corps.

81
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:44,279
The idea of freedom,
together with a German Schnaps,

82
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:47,539
leaves them completely unfit for combat.

83
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:55,810
They duty to defend the Homeland is gone,
Soldier Commetees corrupt the Army.

84
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,121
Stop!

85
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:02,080
That's enough!
Turn on the lights!

86
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,394
Colonel, I don't like this.

87
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:12,445
To me, this looks like a skillfully
shuffled material and nothing more.

88
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,257
Mr. Kerenskiy, please remember...

89
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:20,573
I'm an officer, and not a cheating thief.

90
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,279
Open the curtains, please!

91
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:27,238
If you want to save the Army and the State,

92
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,936
reinstate the death penalty to field courts.

93
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,957
for desertion, mingling with the enemy...

94
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,875
and insubordination - death penalty.

95
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,426
- Bravo, Colonel.
- Be quiet!

96
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,854
Only a miracle can save us.

97
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,343
No, not a miracle...

98
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,417
but concrete actions of the Provisional Government.

99
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,959
On my command,

100
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,615
the Bochkareva women's battalion is being formed.

101
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:59,844
This will raise the morale in the Army.

102
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,282
These women will die in first battle!

103
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,574
Is that what you want?

104
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,397
Of course not.

105
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:13,439
That is why, Mr. Polovtsev,
I order you to oversee..

106
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:17,033
preparations and deployment of this battalion.

107
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,367
Next!

108
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,619
Excuse me, please...

109
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,380
Name? Age?
Do you have children?

110
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:08,599
- I left him with my brother's family.
- Go away! ... Next!

111
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,839
Vera!

112
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,589
Next!

113
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,600
How nice...

114
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,777
Please, request a medical examination.

115
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,017
Next!

116
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,328
<i>Application form.</i>

117
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,644
Kolokolchikova Evdovkiya Efimovna.

118
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,080
What are you doing here? (his wife)

119
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,736
18 y.o., no children.

120
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:39,017
You are too short for the service.

121
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:44,539
The medics will decide if I'm fit.
Please type: Evdovkiya Efimovna...

122
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:48,133
Are you crazy?
We can't have women.

123
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,768
I'll stay here without you.
I go whereve you go. Type!

124
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,592
Nadezhda Petrovna!

125
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,655
- Froska!
- I'm here for you!

126
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,259
My dear!

127
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,239
I went with Vera.

128
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,478
Hello, Vera Dmitrievna!

129
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,853
Frosenka!

130
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,291

131
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,635
Baikina Nadezhda Sergeyevna.
36...

132
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,874
I'm from the pesant folk...

133
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,365
Full Name, Age!

134
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,272
Medical Examination.

135
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:53,709
- I serve Countess Tatishcheva.
- You will serve the Fatherland.

136
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,492
Ma'am, step aside.
You were rejected.

137
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,263
I don't understand...

138
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,658
Svistunova Galina Mikhailovna.

139
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:06,054
Why am I rejected?

140
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,075
It's obvious, you're too fat.

141
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,982
Me?
I'm fat?

142
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,002
26.
Do you have children?

143
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,232
- I'm fat...
- Where are you going?

144
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,753
So I'm fat?
Well, I'm not just fat...

145
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,775
I'm strong!

146
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,587
Look at that.

147
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,412
Why did you come here?

148
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,641
To destroy our property?

149
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,089
No. I hurt all men in my vilage

150
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:10,405
 who tried to touch me.

151
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:13,389


152
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:16,579
I can do the same with the Germans, right?

153
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:18,506
What's your name?

154
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:20,746
Dusya Grinyova.

155
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:26,945
Evdovkiya Grynyova,
I appoint you as my Deputy.

156
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,174
- Nikolai Alexandrovich!
- Yes!

157
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,143
- Issue he an aiguillette!
- Aye!

158
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:38,248
Mariya Leontiyevna!
The general arrived. He wants to see you.

159
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:42,466
Come on!
Let's fill out the paperwork.

160
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,461
Mr General.

161
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:50,489
Recruitment for the Women's Battalion is underway.

162
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,999
Commander - Non-commisioned Officer Bochkareva.

163
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,175
At ease.

164
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:57,8
God give not give me a son.
This is all I can offer.

165
00:16:57,9 --> 00:17:02,853
My only daughter.

166
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,125
I will receive your report.

167 
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,895
Ms. Senior Lieutenant,

168
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:11,271
The recruit Natalya Tatishcheva awaits her orders.

169
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,709
- Can you shoot weapons?
- I can.

170
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,477
I got my training in summer camps.

171
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,052
I traveled with my Father since I was 5.

172
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,219
My maid Serafima Pluzhnikova
also can shoot.

173
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,459
She should be already here.

174
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:27,001
- Welcome to the Battalion.
- Thank you!

175
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,073
This way, please.

176
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,981
Go!

177
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,835
I hope you know what you're doing.

178
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,440
Mariya Leontiyevna.

179
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:59,607
May God preserve you.

180
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:06,587
- Miss...
- No more Miss. Cut it!

181
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,327
Sit down.

182
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,103
Line up!

183
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,687
At ease!

184
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:48,520
Everyone but the left wingman
must turn their head left..

185
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:53,833
and should see the chest of
the fourth man down the line.

186
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,959
Line up!

187
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,052
What are you looking at?

188
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,0
I can't see anything!
Her tits are small and
her tits are huge!

189
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:11,750
Line us up by our tit size, Commander!

190
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,491
Silence!

191
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:26,335
Ok. You should see the shoes
of the fourth man down the line.

192
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:51,545
- Live long, recruits!
- Live long!

193
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:59,305
From now on you must call me
"Madam Chief"!

194
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,983
This is my Deputy,
Lieutenant Seleznev.

195
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,744
These are the Instructors:

196
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,442
Alexei Kolokolchikov and 
Yefim Zadorozhnyy.

197
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,036
They will train you in soldier science..

198
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,484
and prepare you for the final test.

199
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,245
Because you are not yet a battalion,

200
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:23,214
but just ordinary women.

201
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,835
Therefore, I order you,

202
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:29,309
set aside all that makes you a woman.

203
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,746
Fool around or disobey orders -- be expelled.

204
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,412
- I need soldiers. Is that clear?
- Yes, clear!

205
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:52,174
Nyura! Come here!

206
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:53,736
Hey, Jew! get out of here!

207
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:56,237
Beat it, I said!

208
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,132
This is your bed.

209
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,164
Girls, look!

210
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,645
Look at you!

211
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:33,791
What are you doing?

212
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,834
Bitch!

213
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,042
Chill out!
We didn't come here to quarrel.

214
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,521
Listen, you, nobel one.

215
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:59,783
Just walk to those beds, okay?
We're all simple here.

216
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,855
You don't fit here with us?

217
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:06,970
Evdovkiya...
You're in charge here.

218
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,679
Restore the order!

219
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:14,522
Dusya, look!

220
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,752
This bed is just for you.

221
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:23,462
There's no draft here
and it's away from the door.

222
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:29,159
And you, noble one, you move there!

223
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,545
Am I right, Dusya?

224
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,077
Well yeah.

225
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:41,503
Will you divide us into nobles and others
when we're in the trenches?

226
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,004
Listen, your clever one...

227
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:46,296
I'm in charge.

228
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,265
So pack your your rags
and get out of here.

229
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:52,389
Okay, I'll go.
But you're lying.

230
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:55,827
You just want this bed
because it seems convenient.

231
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,119
Are you contradicting me?

232
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,912
- You will stand on a chair for two hours!
- I will not do it!

233
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,411
- What did you say?
- Punch her, Dusya!

234
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,693
Be so kind and punch me, too.

235
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:20,152
I heard everything.

236
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:26,142
This is solved easily.

237
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,433
You want her bed?

238
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,715
You are welcome.

239
00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:35,674
You... go to her bed.

240
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:38,487
And you... go to her bed.

241
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:44,164
But lets be consistent.

242
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,435
You are demoted to a private.

243
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:53,279
And you are my Deputy.

244
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,279
Surrender the aiguillette.

245
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,374
Surrender the aiguillette!

246
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,303
At ease!

247
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,159
Get up!

248
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:08,596
Faster!

249
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:10,940
Get dressed!
Fast!

250
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,505
Why did you stop?

251
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:49,797
Forward!

252
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,026
Those who are afraid, can go home.

253
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:04,694
First row, go!

254
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:07,246
Go!
Come on!

255
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:27,820
Continue!
Jump!

256
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,820
Give me your hand!

257
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:42,405
Dusya, what is it with you?
The Germans won't wait.

258
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:45,738
It's nothing.
I can take it my way.

259
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:52,926
Grinyova! You, pest!
What are you doing?

260
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:57,457
You said the Germans won't wait.

261
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,146
Natasha...

262
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:14,490
- What happened?
- I'm dizzy.

263
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:16,730
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I didn't.

264
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:19,230
It's nothing.

265
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,355
Come on, Yevdokiya, faster!

266
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:29,647
Bravo!

267
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,564
Come on, jump!

268
00:28:33,553 --> 00:28:35,637
Wait!

269
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,398
478...

270
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,472
I'll buy a cow...

271
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,754
Easy, easy...

272
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,608
Get up!

273
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:29,651
If you smell almonds,
apples or rotten hay,

274
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:31,526
the enemy just commenced a gas attack.

275
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,637
This is a gas grenade launcher,

276
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:36,630
It can shoot gas grenades.

277
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:40,589
Aim!
Fire!

278
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,704
- These are my shots, Lieutenant.
- No...

279
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,152
These are yours.

280
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:50,485
- Poor shooting.
- I will improve, Lieutenant.

281
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:54,705
- Bad attempt.
- I aimed at the head.

282
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:56,267
Fire!

283
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:58,038
Down!

284
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:00,902
Get up!

285
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,133
Fire!

286
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,373
Here it is...

287
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:17,623
You are...
a beautiful... sh-sho--shooter

288
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,748
I'm glad striving.

289
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:30,488
Keep moving!

290
00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:32,780
They'll kill you if you get tangled.

291
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,062
Stay down, I'll cut the wire.

292
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:41,478
Keep lower or they will blast you bottom off.
I don't want a woman with no bottom.

293
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,552
Go, go, go...

294
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,791
Recruits, attention!

295
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,531
You...

296
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,896
And you...
Come here!

297
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,969
Face each-other!

298
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:03,146
Puch her!

299
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:06,271
- Where?
- In her face.

300
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,898
Now you.

301
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,950
I can't.

302
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,346
Hit her!

303
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,628
- I can't.
- Then you'll hit.

304
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:40,388
With the fist!

305
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,014
Hit her!

306
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,764
- I can't.
- Do it!

307
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:58,775
- Enough!
- Do it!

308
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:06,275
- I can't..
- Hit her in the stomach!

309
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:09,661
Hit her!

310
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,401
- I can't.
- Hit her!

311
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:17,578
- I can't.
- Hit her!

312
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:24,402
Come on, everyone!
Fight!

313
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:25,756
Come on, fight!

314
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,047
Hit! I hit you!

315
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,569
You have to learn to fight.
Like this...

316
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:48,570
Tonya!

317
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:52,684
- What happened?
- Come with me!

318
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:18,259
Help me!

319
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,634
That's not allowed.

320
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,958
He's my husband, 
we are crowned (married in Church).

321
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,572
Don't close the window.
Okay.

322
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:35,969
Easy, easy...

323
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,220
First row forward!

324
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,669
Second row forward!

325
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,607
Smells like feeb soup.

326
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:23,472
- How do you know?
- I can smell it.

327
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:26,441
I've always had a good sense of smell.

328
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,711
It's good to have a goo sense of smell.

329
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:51,078
Comrade Commander woman,
I need to talk to you. 
(speaks familiarly)

330
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:56,130
- What do you want?
- I ask to step aside.

331
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:04,829
Well. Let's go.

332
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:31,861
I miss my boyfriend.

333
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,559
Let me out for one night, Leontiyevna...

334
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,799
Because...

335
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,091
we'll soon go in combat.

336
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,904
No.

337
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:47,227
Why not?
Don't you understand?

338
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,071
You're a woman. Are you not?

339
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,237
No.

340
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,301
So that's the pecking order here?

341
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,437
Why can she leave?

342
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:10,197
Every night she escapes out of
the window to join her boyfriend.

343
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:14,364
And what about the boyfriend. What king of officer is he?

344
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,604
So you're telling on others...

345
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,626
Are you okay?

346
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,118
Get lost!

347
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:38,998
- Who is it?
- It's her!

348
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,293
Her?

349
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,887
Who did you visit?

350
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:48,897
I asked who did you visit?

351
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:51,919
No one.

352
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,669
Listen here, officer woman!

353
00:36:56,294 --> 00:37:01,086
With some soldier comrades we will create a Soldier Committee.

354
00:37:01,398 --> 00:37:07,805
Yes... we want freedom and equality.
No beatings.

355
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,201
Get up!

356
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:16,088
If I see you again,
you'll shoot you.

357
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:18,014
Take your demands back home!

358
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:21,140
Get out!
Out, I said!

359
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:23,378
There's your freedom!

360
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:27,910
- You haven't seen the last of me!
- Yes, and of me!

361
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:30,775
Anyone else is partisan?

362
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:35,046
Eat your lunch before it's cold.

363
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,139
You know, Mariya Leontiyevna.

364
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:40,575
We have waited for years...
We need to travel

365
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:45,516
She will perform abroad.

366
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:50,151
My Nadyenka is a singer.

367
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,652
She's not a soldier.

368
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:57,183
She must preserve her voice.

369
00:37:57,913 --> 00:38:00,568
That's why I paid Froska...

370
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:03,694
to take care of my Nadyenka,

371
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,194
to bring her home safely.

372
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,663
I see.

373
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,413
Business.

374
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,841
Mr Lieutenant!

375
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,986
Pvts Yurasova and Lantsova
must report to the Chief.

376
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:31,040
Pvts Yurasova and Lantsova reporting.

377
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:41,248
You ran out of money.

378
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:45,520
You will no longer be paid to take care of Miss.

379
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,415
I discharge her.

380
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:57,187
Frosenjka, you can keep what I gave to you.

381
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,083
The circumstances changed.
Nadya has to travel.

382
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,021
Excuse me, miss.

383
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:13,021
Mom, did you really pay her?

384
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:17,813
Nadyenka, I just wanted
you to be okay.

385
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,512
We have waited a long time for this.

386
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,032
Nadya!

387
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,324
This is La Scala!

388
00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:37,293
Permission to return to combat training.

389
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,992
Permission granted.

390
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:46,461
- You raised a good daughter.
- Thank you.

391
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,138
Madam!

392
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:06,202
Here... These are yours.
I did not keep anything.

393
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:08,389
All this is yours.
I'm sorry, Madam!

394
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:12,140
Frosenjka, what...
Thank you.

395
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,661
Permission to fall back.

396
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:20,630
Is it your own decision to stay?

397
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,182
Yes... it is.

398
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,880
Then go!

399
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,474
Thank you!

400
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,381
Farewell, Madam!

401
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,558
Farewell!

402
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,672
And your wench is alright.

403
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:25,895
- Second lieutenant  Bochkareva?
- Yes, correct, how I can help you?

404
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:29,436
By the order of the District Commander
General Polovtsov,

405
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:31,728
you are under arrest.

406
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,074
Surrender your weapon.

407
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:48,500
Gentlemen officers.

408
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:54,177
You're ordered to return to headquarters,
where you will be reassigned.

409
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:01,053
Follow me.

410
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,161
- Do you understand why you were arrested?
- No.

411
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,036
I don't understand.

412
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:11,630
- How can you allow a stupid woman...
- Please...

413
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,443
Be quiet.

414
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:21,498
You, a senior officer of the battalion,

415
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:24,491
arrested for beating a subordinate.

416
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:29,288
The comrades have agreed to resolve this peacefully.

417
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:32,256
There is just one condition.

418
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,486
Tell her.

419
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:41,841
St. Petersburg SOVDEP demands that
the Bochkareva women's battalion

420
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,476
to establish a Soldier Committee,
chaired by comrade...

421
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:49,966
... I mean...

422
00:43:50,643 --> 00:43:52,727
... Svistunova.

423
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,414
Please excuse me.

424
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:01,581
Here's to destroying the Army!
Here! Bitch!

425
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:04,811
- Here!
- Attention!

426
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:11,165
The battalion will be discharged tomorrow.

427
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:13,405
You are demoted

428
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:15,280
for insubordination.

429
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:16,999
You will lose your rank.

430
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,822
And you are fired from the Russian Army.

431
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:21,165
Until then, you remain under arrest.

432
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,739
- Forgive me, Peter Alexandrovich.
- Take he away!

433
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:56,325
Battalion, halt!

434
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,814
To the left!

435
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:23,837
Halt, you can't go there!

436
00:45:25,662 --> 00:45:29,256
Sorry, Peter Alexandrovich,
she forced her way in.

437
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,431
At ease!

438
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:42,994
I'm listening.

439
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,702
Mr General, Peter Alexandrovich...

440
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,89
The Mariya Bochkareva Battalion arrived in full force 

441
00:45:48,984 --> 00:45:51,484
to recieve explanations about the Commander's arrest.

442
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:55,599
Deputy Commander,
Natalya Tatischeva.

443
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:59,661
Countess?

444
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,516
Ilya Vladimirovich's  daughter?

445
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:05,443
Affirmative!

446
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,892
But it's irrelevant.

447
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:11,902
Well...

448
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,402
I am informing you.

449
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:18,882
Second lieutenant  Bochkareva was arrested
for disobeying the order..

450
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,903
to establish a Soldier Committee
in your Batalion

451
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:25,222
Mr General, they did not inform you.

452
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:28,034
A Soldier Committee was created.

453
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:32,320
The Committee demands Mariya Bochkareva released and  acquitted.

454
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:35,080
Don't be silly.

455
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:38,831
- Where is your Committee?
- Outside, Mr General.

456
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:56,749
The Committee consists of the entire battalion peronnel.

457
00:46:59,613 --> 00:47:01,592
You're dismissed.

458
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,041
Give my bow to your Father.

459
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:07,114
I will not be able to.

460
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:51,031
Such women we have!

461
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,906
Battalion, line up!
Attention!

462
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:16,6
Mr General. The Soldier Committee of the
Bochkareva female battalion rank is formed.

463
00:50:17,0 --> 00:50:21,5
We dema--... Forgive me. We ask

464
00:50:21,8 --> 00:50:27,492
a release of Commander
and her return back to active Army service.

465
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,972
Get back to ranks.

466
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,161
Non-commissioned officer, retake the command.

467
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:08,119
Battalion examination is tomorrow.

468
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:10,879
Aye, Sir!

469
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:13,328
Hooray!

470
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:16,453
But keep in mind...

471
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,828
If only one of you

472
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:24,005
fails the exam,

473
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,766
noone will go to the front.

474
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:30,932
The battalion will be discharged.

475
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,330
What will happen tomorrow? 

476
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:54,112
Quiet, Serafima!
You'll wake up everyone.

477
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:57,340
But what should I do?

478
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:00,674
My dear...
Lord, save and have mercy.

479
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,706
Serafima...

480
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:04,841
What is it, Natasha?

481
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,132
Well...

482
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:10,310
If you tell them,
I won't forgive you.

483
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:29,062
What's wrong?

484
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:31,717
Why don't you sleep?

485
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:38,333
What happened?

486
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:40,677
Tell her!

487
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:44,479
What I have to say is...

488
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:47,552
that her father is dying, her husband killed.

489
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,625
She has nobody left...

490
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,428
Why should a child die?

491
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:02,449
What?
What child?

492
00:53:03,355 --> 00:53:05,439
I'm pregnant.

493
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:21,721
For standing up for us...
Thank you very much.

494
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:28,597
But tomorrow the entire battalion 
could be in jeopardy.

495
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:34,482
I felt that. You had a child aroma...
the aroma of the future.

496
00:53:38,337 --> 00:53:40,993
Form the rank.

497
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:57,244
Are you all packed?

498
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:01,984
Fall in!

499
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,578
Private Tatischeva,

500
00:54:10,995 --> 00:54:13,495
Surrender the aiguillette.

501
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,497
Niklyudova...

502
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:53,810
Take it!

503
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:59,070
You will be my Deputy.

504
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:01,935
Instead of Natalya.

505
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:05,738
At your orders.

506
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:09,176
Fall in back.

507
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:25,114
Go home!

508
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:29,750
Give birth to child.

509
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:33,032
We're going out there to die for their sake.

510
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:37,042
Go away.

511
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,970
Dismissed.
Get some sleep.

512
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,046
Battalion!

513
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:04,439
Today we'll see what kind of soldiers you are!

514
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:10,065
If one of you fails, the entire battalion
will be declared unfit.

515
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,039
Forward!
Faster! Faster!

516
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,237
The first and third row left,
and the other to the right!

517
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:15,778
March!

518
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:11,528
Nadya!

519
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,163
What happened?

520
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:20,070
Don't pick up the wounded!

521
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,882
Run! Run! Forward!

522
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,997
- Come on!
- I think I sprained my ankle.

523
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:31,789
Fire!

524
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,665
Come on, Nadya!

525
00:58:11,427 --> 00:58:14,084
Madam Chief,

526
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,156
Lavancova, Gerasova and Neklyudova
have passed the obstacle course.

527
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:20,407
Permission to join the ranks
No, I will not allow it.

528
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:25,699
You have failed and stained the honor of the entire battalion.

529
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:32,678
It's unfair!, Madam Chief.

530
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:35,908
We were ordered to pass the obstacle course and we did.

531
00:58:36,064 --> 00:58:38,617
You arrived too late.

532
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,574
We stood here waiting for you!

533
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,002
So what?
We weren't told there was a time limit.

534
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:49,971
Or was it there, Mr. General?

535
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:53,617
A Commander has a duty to follow orders.

536
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:56,430
Or else she would no longer be a Commander, right?

537
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:03,566
She is right, this pest.

538
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:06,638
She's right!

539
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:10,858
You have not left your wounded comrade,

540
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:14,140
and I commend you for that. Get back in line.

541
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,733
- Does your leg hurt much?
- Only a little.

542
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,077
Come on, get in line.

543
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:27,891
After testing the combat readiness of the battalion.

544
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:31,588
I declare that you have passed the examination!

545
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:38,016
I allow the batallion to take an oath and
join the regular Army.

546
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:44,058


547
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:48,152
Thank you, Peter Alexandrovich.
... Hurray! ...

548
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:10,236
In the Name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit... Amen!

549
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:15,237
Battalion... forward, march!

550
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,070
Attention! Left!

551
01:00:29,717 --> 01:00:31,748
Stop! Stop!

552
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:33,988
Tonka!

553
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,113
Tonka, I will not let you go.

554
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,770
My daughter, how will I live without you?

555
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:42,322
You'll get killed in this war.

556
01:00:42,479 --> 01:00:44,874
Mom, don't embarrass me.

557
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,875
Forgive me...

558
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:05,053
Farewell.

559
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:28,414
Be careful with the wounded...

560
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,815
Prepare the next one!

561
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,753
- Duty Guard!
- Yes!

562
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:37,419
- Look, more carts.
- I'll take care of it.

563
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:56,129
Vera!

564
01:01:56,285 --> 01:01:59,045
Heard the second signal? We'll leave soon.

565
01:01:59,254 --> 01:02:01,337
I can't believe it.
It's a miracle!

566
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:04,879
Not a miracle.
We're juts going to the front.

567
01:02:05,713 --> 01:02:07,953
Wait, wait...

568
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:12,432
Nadya!

569
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:38,058
Petya, Petya...
It is I -- Nadya.

570
01:02:38,215 --> 01:02:41,392
Load here.
Nikolai Alexandrovich, help her.

571
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:44,570
Well girls, let's go.

572
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,674
All aboard!
The train is leaving!

573
01:02:56,029 --> 01:02:59,830
Miss. Miss...
we have to take him away.

574
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,435
Wait...

575
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:05,717
Who is he to you?

576
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,873
He is my fiancé.

577
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,352
Open your eyes...

578
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:19,832
Please, open your eyes.

579
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:25,405
I love you so much.

580
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:39,521
Here is your medallion.

581
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:51,396
Nadya, we're leaving!

582
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:54,053
Nadya!

583
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:57,178
No, let her stay.

584
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,860
Misses-soldiers, look at me.

585
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,505
Well done...

586
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:03,432
Convoy, stop!

587
01:05:04,786 --> 01:05:06,870
Rest!

588
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:01,249
Battalion, to arms!

589
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:15,572
On hand!

590
01:06:41,563 --> 01:06:44,064
Come on, beauty.
Give me a kiss.

591
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:52,918
Or stab the heart, it wont hurt. You broke it already.

592
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:05,367
Just one kiss, honey.

593
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:11,409
Bitch!

594
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:13,753
Am I a bitch!?

595
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:22,868
Was I a bitch after 1914, when I
carried the wounded on my back?

596
01:07:23,493 --> 01:07:25,994
What do you think I was?

597
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,025
Why do you think we're here?

598
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:31,046
Do you think we came here
to tumble and squeez with you ?

599
01:07:31,202 --> 01:07:33,025
We came to fight.

600
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:36,515
To help you fight the Germans for our land.

601
01:07:36,828 --> 01:07:38,599
You are our brothers.

602
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:42,609
A bitch with propaganda... Really bitch.

603
01:07:42,817 --> 01:07:45,838
Your brain is swallen with foolishness.

604
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,078
All of you!

605
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,943
How can you allow this to happen?

606
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,338
Women are ready to fight instead of you!

607
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:55,683
While you are partying!

608
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,548
Brothers!
She is our Bochkareva!

609
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:01,360
She once rescued me and Pankrat.

610
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:04,694
Pankrat, Pankrat!
Where the...?

611
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:06,933
I'm here, I'm here...

612
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:11,986
Comrades..
This woman is one of us.

613
01:08:12,403 --> 01:08:16,830
A warrior, not a woman...
but a comrade and a friend.

614
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:19,226
I remember you.

615
01:08:24,695 --> 01:08:27,560
How can one forget a 103 kilo man?

616
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:30,945
Enough brothers... it's decided then.

617
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:34,435
We'll treat the women with respect...

618
01:08:34,852 --> 01:08:37,352
Besides they vote for it with bayonets.

619
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:42,977
But remember you women.
The Soldier Committee has decided,

620
01:08:43,342 --> 01:08:45,425
that it's pointless to continue the war.

621
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:48,290
We want to live return to our homes alive.

622
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:51,728
But feel free to visit.

623
01:08:51,937 --> 01:08:54,384
The air is fresh here.

624
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:05,844
Hey fungus!
Do you think?

625
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:09,073
Did we walk here from St. Petersburg,

626
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,260
just for fun? To dump our country like you have?

627
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:17,105
If you squeal against the Committee,
you'll get a led seal in your face.

628
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:30,168
It's over brothers!
Let's go!

629
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:46,731
Battalion, at ease!

630
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:51,576
Disperse.

631
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,254
Battalion, halt!

632
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:26,161
Lieutenant, where is Colonel Borozdin?

633
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:29,182
- Inside.
- Take me there!

634
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,505
Welcome, Madam Second Lieutenant.

635
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:53,351
Complete disintegration.

636
01:10:53,507 --> 01:10:56,580
- They refuse to fight.
- I ask...

637
01:10:56,841 --> 01:11:00,851
to send the battalion
to the defense line.

638
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:03,299
It's urgent, do it now.

639
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:05,018
That's fine with me.

640
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:09,445
No need to walk around
my wild soldiers.

641
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,351
wild soldiers?

642
01:11:13,872 --> 01:11:16,685
You call them wild soldiers?

643
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:21,478
Soldiers?
Where did you see any real soldiers?

644
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,810
These are no longer my soldiers.
Swallen of Schnaps criminal mash.

645
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:29,238
You'd better stay away from them as far as possible.

646
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:31,999
How many are on the defense line?

647
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:36,790
On the defense line, Madame Second Leutenant, I have  nobody.

648
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:40,333
Only the German couriers who bring German Schnaps.

649
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:48,093
- May I be dismissed?
- Dismissed.

650
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:32,628
Seleznyov!

651
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:36,898
My dugout is on the left
and yours is on the right.

652
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:42,212
Understood. Mariya Leontiyevna,
We should check the machine guns.

653
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,399
Go ahead.

654
01:12:44,556 --> 01:12:46,639
Continue.

655
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:11,641
Mother!

656
01:13:27,631 --> 01:13:31,225
The Germans wanted to talk.
They could not believe that...

657
01:13:31,694 --> 01:13:34,038
I picked flowers in front of their noses.

658
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:36,590
You should have taken
the broom to clean up a bit.

659
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:43,517
And what's the problem?
They're our flowers - Russian.

660
01:13:45,549 --> 01:13:47,841
The Germans are coming!

661
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,352
- Hands up!
- Hello! We come to bring gifts.

662
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:01,591
Gifts. Podarok.

663
01:14:01,956 --> 01:14:03,362
Salami, meat, brandy...

664
01:14:03,518 --> 01:14:05,602
- For you.
- Freeze!

665
01:14:07,686 --> 01:14:08,780
You should be ashamed.

666
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,530
We are regular soldiers like you.

667
01:14:13,311 --> 01:14:15,759
We are brothers.
We do not want to fight.

668
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:18,780
We are your brothers.

669
01:14:19,197 --> 01:14:21,853
I'm not your brother or sister.

670
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:26,593
As long as you're on our land, you're our enemies.

671
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,301
Hands up!

672
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,354
Get the Commander.

673
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:52,428
- How many machine guns do we have?
- Eighteen.

674
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:54,772
Write:
Eighteen machine guns.

675
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:59,356
Madam Commander, excuse me..
We have prisoners.

676
01:15:07,325 --> 01:15:11,232
Brothers... with knives under belts.

677
01:15:25,503 --> 01:15:27,586
What's this?

678
01:15:30,555 --> 01:15:35,764
"Kan" und "Panz." Are they abbreviations
for guns and armored vehicles?

679
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:41,181
No.
Nyet.

680
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:45,296
What?
Came to visit?

681
01:15:46,702 --> 01:15:48,942
Madam Second lieutenant, we caught two Germans.

682
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:51,026
With brandy and with this.

683
01:15:53,161 --> 01:15:55,557
This is what it says in German:

684
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:03,831
Meaning cannons, armored vehicles,
soldiers, officers...

685
01:16:04,411 --> 01:16:06,287
They are spies.

686
01:16:45,456 --> 01:16:47,956
Tie him down!

687
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:23,010
Calm down, girl.
Come on, calm down...

688
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:25,928
You're my girls.
Everything will be fine.

689
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:30,354
Yes, you killed him.
It was the only thing you could do.

690
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:34,730
You did what was needed.
Everything will be fine.

691
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:37,178
He's not breathing.

692
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:40,564
- Take him to the headquarters.
- I'll take him.

693
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:43,376
I'll join her.

694
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:45,876
I permit.

695
01:17:47,179 --> 01:17:49,835
Come on, darling. Calm down. You did right. Good for you...

696
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:12,701
Halt!

697
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,129
Come on!

698
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,902
- Are you alive?
- I can't continue.

699
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:56,090
I sprained my ankle.
We must return.

700
01:18:56,142 --> 01:18:59,110
I'll bring him by myself.

701
01:19:07,445 --> 01:19:10,725
My name is Josef Zepp.

702
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,382
What's your name?
Go!

703
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:18,447
Listen, I did nothing wrong.
And neither did you or the other Russian soldiers.

704
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:22,966
What are you mumbling?
I don't understand anything anyway.

705
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:25,987
I have two daughters in Bavaria.

706
01:19:26,664 --> 01:19:31,613
They are like you. Gudrun and Helga.
Do you understand?

707
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:37,238
You're just a a little girl. A child.

708
01:19:37,446 --> 01:19:41,040
Children should stay home.

709
01:19:41,561 --> 01:19:43,957
At home. Do you understand?

710
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,405
Where do you live?

711
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:52,708
In St. Petersburg.
In Martyshkino district.

712
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,052
Ah... 'martishka'..

713
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:59,374
- Like a tiny monkey.
- Yeah! a tiny monkey.

714
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:13,021
Help me.

715
01:20:13,419 --> 01:20:15,503
Please.

716
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:03,962
Why didn't you go home?

717
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:27,713
- Thanks, Glasha.
- To your health!

718
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:53,236
Gobbling?

719
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:00,268
See you don't choke. (sarcasm)

720
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:15,737
She's still a child.

721
01:22:21,676 --> 01:22:25,009
Why did you bring these girlschild?

722
01:22:26,259 --> 01:22:30,686
To die?
To perish?

723
01:22:36,937 --> 01:22:38,499
No!

724
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:40,635
Don't touch her!

725
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:42,875
Take here.

726
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:45,240


727
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:16,470
Forgive me. Kill me.

728
01:23:19,023 --> 01:23:21,263
It's my fault.

729
01:23:24,192 --> 01:23:28,358
It's my fault.
Forgive me.

730
01:23:31,836 --> 01:23:34,805
Forgive me.
It was my fault.

731
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:04,702
What a beautiful thing is machine gun,

732
01:24:06,109 --> 01:24:08,401
works smart

733
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:11,422
a cartridge belt..

734
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:13,975
firing rate...

735
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:18,505
of six hundred bullets...

736
01:24:18,922 --> 01:24:22,464
per minute.

737
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:27,726
Six hundred Germans could die in a minute.

738
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:30,642
And in two minutes?

739
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:32,597
Vera.

740
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,263
How many Germans can you kill
in two minutes?

741
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,894
If you shoot, -- the entire regiment.

742
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:40,226
I've always been lucky.

743
01:24:40,382 --> 01:24:43,820
I could spend my life like a simple woman,

744
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:47,206
not knowing such a thing as a machine gun...

745
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:49,862
Your Nobelty desided to 

746
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,363
put me here with it, so 

747
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:56,164
if there is a German,
I will sting him with a bullet.

748
01:24:57,414 --> 01:24:59,758
We've been here for a month.

749
01:24:59,915 --> 01:25:02,155
And no war.

750
01:25:09,915 --> 01:25:12,207
Nadenjka, who are you writing?

751
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:15,701
I wrote to Petya in the hospital.
Now I'm writing my mother.

752
01:25:16,322 --> 01:25:18,405
Wish him all the best.

753
01:25:32,052 --> 01:25:34,448
What a strange smell.

754
01:25:57,991 --> 01:26:00,439
It smells like apples.

755
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:30,390
Gas attack!

756
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:37,994
Girls, here!
Put on your gas masks.

757
01:27:19,428 --> 01:27:21,511
Fire!

758
01:27:26,397 --> 01:27:28,697
Forward!

759
01:27:32,549 --> 01:27:34,997
Battalion, attack!

760
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:20,091
Are you okay?
Did you go to the hospital?

761
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,383
No... it's just a little scratch.

762
01:30:25,716 --> 01:30:28,581
Here you go, here's your...

763
01:30:31,499 --> 01:30:35,875
Here you go, here's your...

764
01:30:40,563 --> 01:30:45,981
Here you go, here's your...
Here you go, here's your...

765
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:49,155
What happened?
Come on!

766
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:53,427
Here it is, here it is...

767
01:30:54,677 --> 01:30:57,385
Here you go, here's your...

768
01:30:58,324 --> 01:31:03,636
Here you go, here's your...
Here you go, here's your...

769
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:06,867
Here it is, here it is...

770
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:10,251
Enough!

771
01:31:45,722 --> 01:31:50,410
I'm proud of your bravery.
I'm going to nominate for decoration.

772
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:53,430
You and ramarkable soldiers as well.
Give the list to the Lieutenant

773
01:31:55,566 --> 01:31:58,275
We didn't come here for medals.

774
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:02,139
The Germans are afraid of us.
My unit is ready for an offensive.

775
01:32:03,795 --> 01:32:05,879
Your men will help us.

776
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,171
Who?

777
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,015
Soldiers.

778
01:32:13,557 --> 01:32:16,317
I don't have authority to order offensives.

779
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:20,849
Thank your battalion for everything.

780
01:32:21,714 --> 01:32:23,797
You're dismissed.

781
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:52,153
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God,
save and have mercy on us...

782
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:12,623
What do you want?

783
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:17,863
You know what happened.
The people have spoken.

784
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:22,980
There's been a revolution.
The Tsar was overthrown.

785
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:24,543
So what?

786
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:29,751
Soon the Russian land will be
divided to the people.

787
01:33:30,324 --> 01:33:33,553
Why should we expose our heads to bullets?

788
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:37,967
We, you, the Germans.
They have children, too.

789
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:46,584
Dear women, return home
to your husbands' sides.

790
01:33:47,448 --> 01:33:50,469
Beauty, have got a husband?

791
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:55,659
Look at you. So caring...

792
01:33:57,032 --> 01:34:02,137
Stuck my husband here, and pitied German children.

793
01:34:03,147 --> 01:34:07,262
But don't you care if the Germans
are standing on Russian soil?

794
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:14,659
- Didn't I convince you?
- No. You didn't convince me.

795
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:30,263
Afanasij.
Afanasij.

796
01:34:37,868 --> 01:34:40,733
Hello, my wife.

797
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:44,066
Loose woman!

798
01:34:47,817 --> 01:34:52,024
Hello. Why am I a loose woman?

799
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,232
And why am I a bandit?

800
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:01,724
You ran off to a jew bandit.

801
01:35:02,036 --> 01:35:07,401
You beat me and tortured me...
Do you remember?

802
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:14,589
Ok, ok. You've wandered around a bit. I will teach you a lesson. We'll go back home.

803
01:35:14,745 --> 01:35:17,454
I'm not going.

804
01:35:19,329 --> 01:35:22,506
I did not beat you enough...

805
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:12,926
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

806
01:36:14,749 --> 01:36:17,875
You. Bitch!

807
01:36:25,427 --> 01:36:29,959
You called me! You called me!

808
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:33,521
Are you happy now?

809
01:36:36,521 --> 01:36:38,657
Go to...!

810
01:38:33,196 --> 01:38:39,654
We have 4 hours of footage like this.
It's evident.

811
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:45,071
The analysis leads us to the conclusion..

812
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,186
that there are no units capable of offensive.

813
01:38:49,342 --> 01:38:53,457
- There are no units at the frontline?
- Only one remains.

814
01:39:21,011 --> 01:39:23,095
Nadya!

815
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:28,251
Lieutenant! You'e dumb!

816
01:39:29,553 --> 01:39:31,845
Yes Sir!
Forgive me!

817
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:37,574
If you look at the facts,
I think the attack will be impossible.

818
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:44,971
Colonel, I know best
what the Army can or cannot do.

819
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:50,856
Stop.

820
01:39:51,846 --> 01:39:53,930
Turn on the light, please.

821
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:59,191
Forgive me.
In other words I am discharged?

822
01:40:00,754 --> 01:40:02,888
I do not hold you.

823
01:40:23,411 --> 01:40:27,890
Mr Colonel, Alexei Leonidovich...

824
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:32,370
I have recovered. Please, let me go to the frontline.

825
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:35,235
Or I'll go anyway.

826
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:40,860
We'll go together.

827
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,620
Tomorrow.

828
01:40:46,329 --> 01:40:48,986
We'll attack.

829
01:40:49,142 --> 01:40:52,839
The Army Commanders have three days..

830
01:40:52,996 --> 01:40:56,173
to come up with the plan of operation.

831
01:41:53,885 --> 01:41:56,281
With God's help.

832
01:42:34,534 --> 01:42:37,086
Vera, you're in charge. I am setting fire to block our retreat.

833
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:40,003
As soon as ablaze, you attack.

834
01:42:40,368 --> 01:42:42,389
This battle will be worse than the first.

835
01:42:42,926 --> 01:42:45,184
Girls, follow me!

836
01:43:03,682 --> 01:43:05,765


837
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:42,799
Lieutenant!

838
01:43:46,757 --> 01:43:52,383
- What's that noise?
- The battle, Mr Colonel.

839
01:43:55,248 --> 01:43:59,101
- How long?
- For a long time.

840
01:45:46,556 --> 01:45:48,640
Give me your hand!

841
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:14,370
Nadya, take the flag!

842
01:47:01,925 --> 01:47:04,322
Cadet Yevdokiya Grinyova!

843
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:07,343
Come here!

844
01:47:19,635 --> 01:47:21,927
I thank you for your service!

845
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:24,791
I serve Fatherland!

846
01:47:38,282 --> 01:47:41,980
- Are you the one who can smell poison gas?
- Yes, mom.

847
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:46,460
Don't say "Yes, Mom,"
Say "Aye!"

848
01:47:47,085 --> 01:47:48,908
Lieutenant!

849
01:47:49,064 --> 01:47:50,977
Take the smeller to a secret post.

850
01:47:51,014 --> 01:47:54,405
Sniff. Soon the Germans will gas us out againa.

851
01:47:54,442 --> 01:47:57,242
Aye!

852
01:47:58,388 --> 01:48:01,773
- Vera, report to headquarters!
- Yes!

853
01:48:03,388 --> 01:48:06,096
And you, singer go with her,
and sing about our victory.

854
01:48:06,253 --> 01:48:07,347
Understood!

855
01:48:07,451 --> 01:48:11,253
Tell them that we won't
hold out here for much longer.

856
01:48:11,462 --> 01:48:14,117
Let them send the men.

857
01:48:17,055 --> 01:48:21,118
Clean up! Higher-up will see you.

858
01:48:24,793 --> 01:48:28,439
The rest of you, clean your weapons
and rest.

859
01:48:37,088 --> 01:48:39,320
I have no-one to send.

860
01:48:39,357 --> 01:48:41,690
An entire regiment
and there is no one to send?

861
01:48:41,727 --> 01:48:44,380
This is not a regiment.

862
01:48:47,349 --> 01:48:51,880
This is a bunch of despicables, animals and traitors.

863
01:48:52,037 --> 01:49:04,867
- It's impossible.  You are lying!
- What? 
- Forgive me, but all cannot be despicable. It's impossible.

864
01:49:05,904 --> 01:49:15,098

865
01:49:01,934 --> 01:49:04,798
Gather the men.

866
01:49:09,799 --> 01:49:12,195
Follow me.

867
01:49:23,289 --> 01:49:25,685
Soldiers!

868
01:49:27,976 --> 01:49:32,144
The women of the Bochkareva battalion 
have followed the order to attack.

869
01:49:32,717 --> 01:49:38,499
They have hit the Germans out of their positions.

870
01:49:39,332 --> 01:49:44,332
They need reinforcements.

871
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:50,895
They need our help.

872
01:49:51,052 --> 01:49:53,759
What is this circus, Comrade Colonel?

873
01:49:54,176 --> 01:49:57,406
As for the offensive,
I think we made the right decision.

874
01:49:57,614 --> 01:50:02,458
Or maybe you don't remember?
Batwomanlion is batwomanlion...

875
01:50:02,615 --> 01:50:05,479
They have stirred the pot,
now they can eat it.

876
01:50:05,635 --> 01:50:07,302
Shut up, Zubov!

877
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:10,219
You're an animal.

878
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:14,360
Our women are out there.

879
01:50:14,397 --> 01:50:16,677
You lie the moment you open your mouth.

880
01:50:18,605 --> 01:50:20,805
Our women are at home.

881
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:23,327
Awaiting our return.

882
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,866
You're dismissed, comrades!

883
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:38,763
No volunteers?

884
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:44,440
This is impossible!

885
01:50:58,555 --> 01:51:01,160
Forgive me.

886
01:51:09,598 --> 01:51:16,369
Men are like children.
They love tenderness, to eat...

887
01:51:16,994 --> 01:51:19,702
someone to listen to them...

888
01:51:22,046 --> 01:51:25,588
What?
Have you had it with someone?

889
01:51:26,161 --> 01:51:29,287
What are you talking about?
How could you think such a thing?

890
01:51:30,849 --> 01:51:34,651
That's something...

891
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:33,457
Stop!
We have arrived.

892
01:52:34,134 --> 01:52:36,218
I'm here.
This way.

893
01:52:38,874 --> 01:52:42,156
Live long!
Where are you going?

894
01:52:42,729 --> 01:52:45,697
- Colonel Ceplyayev from the General Staff.
- No, no, no...

895
01:52:45,906 --> 01:52:47,208
I can't let you pass.

896
01:52:47,364 --> 01:52:50,646
I have to report to
the Soldier Committee first.

897
01:52:51,427 --> 01:52:54,605
- Wait here until I'm back.
- Get out of my way!

898
01:52:56,635 --> 01:52:59,448
That... That's all!

899
01:52:59,657 --> 01:53:03,095
Who does he think he is?
Damn dog...

900
01:53:05,647 --> 01:53:08,980
Colonel Tseplyayev from the General Staff.

901
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,397
Excuse me. They din't 
tell me about the inspection.

902
01:53:14,554 --> 01:53:19,002
We did not come for an inspection.
We came to fight.

903
01:53:19,158 --> 01:53:22,491
How come there's no one in Russia,
except officers from the General Staff..

904
01:53:22,548 --> 01:53:24,996
to fight at the frontline?

905
01:53:25,752 --> 01:53:28,200
Prepare the horses.
I want to go to the frontline.

906
01:53:28,357 --> 01:53:30,597
Horses?

907
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,318
That's not possible.

908
01:53:33,354 --> 01:53:35,391
This is no time for jokes.

909
01:53:35,857 --> 01:53:38,565
Shut up!

910
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:43,775
Would you like horses?

911
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:53,567
That's him!
He's the one that hit me.

912
01:53:55,494 --> 01:54:00,025
Karpenko, Glachko, Sasurin!

913
01:54:01,952 --> 01:54:05,338
- Get horses for the officers.
- I will ask one question.

914
01:54:05,494 --> 01:54:07,578
What for?

915
01:54:07,786 --> 01:54:09,610
What for?

916
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:12,890
- Do not argue! Horses!
- There are no horses.

917
01:54:13,047 --> 01:54:15,547
Get out of my way!

918
01:54:15,755 --> 01:54:19,989
Just a remider,
officers don't take part in combat.

919
01:54:20,026 --> 01:54:23,152
If they do, they're to be executed.

920
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:27,371
Second lieutenant, follow me!

921
01:54:31,694 --> 01:54:34,454
Put the gun down!
There's no need.

922
01:54:40,695 --> 01:54:45,018
Not bad...
Let's see...

923
01:54:47,736 --> 01:54:50,705
Move a little!

924
01:55:00,029 --> 01:55:05,238
- Only officers are forbidden?
- That's right. Finally.

925
01:55:18,937 --> 01:55:23,624
We're no longer officers.

926
01:55:41,698 --> 01:55:46,960
You know... One was looking at me 
  in such a way...

927
01:55:48,469 --> 01:55:50,657
Germans!

928
01:56:08,917 --> 01:56:11,001
- Vera, quickly!
- Yes, I get it!

929
01:56:12,523 --> 01:56:14,607
Kolya!
Kolya, Kolya...

930
01:56:15,919 --> 01:56:18,888
Kolya, please!
Kolya, breathe, breathe, Kolya...

931
01:56:19,045 --> 01:56:21,128
Breathe, breathe, Kolya...

932
01:56:48,891 --> 01:56:50,973
Fall back!

933
01:57:11,704 --> 01:57:15,141
Girls!
This way!

934
01:57:16,652 --> 01:57:18,475
Damn!

935
01:57:18,684 --> 01:57:21,288
Fall back!

936
01:57:43,164 --> 01:57:46,133
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

937
01:57:54,884 --> 01:57:57,124
Wait!

938
01:57:58,009 --> 01:57:59,820
- Where are you going?
- Let me take a look.

939
01:57:59,878 --> 01:58:01,962
Nadya!

940
01:58:27,126 --> 01:58:29,157
- And...?
- They're approaching.

941
01:58:29,365 --> 01:58:31,969
From two sides.

942
01:58:36,085 --> 01:58:41,553
My girls... Forgive me.

943
01:58:43,637 --> 01:58:46,085
Say farewell to each other

944
01:58:50,252 --> 01:58:54,627
Lord God Almighty.
All who trust in Thy mercy.

945
01:58:55,096 --> 01:58:58,378
Do not abandon them.
Protect them.

946
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:03,170
Be merciful to me and protect me by Thy protection from my enemy's seduction 

947
01:59:03,235 --> 01:59:05,698
Let me not fall before my enemies

948
01:59:05,735 --> 01:59:07,797
let not mine enemy rejoice over me.

949
01:59:08,455 --> 01:59:12,441
Lift me up, my Savior
and empower me for Thy Name's sake

950
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:16,504
Give us the spirit and strength to stand for Thee.

951
01:59:16,769 --> 01:59:21,456
And the courage to offer 
our blood and soul for the love of Thy Name.

952
01:59:21,712 --> 01:59:26,609
For Thou loved us and laid down Thy
Soul on the Cross for us.

Amen!

953
02:00:50,885 --> 02:00:54,535
<i>This was the last battle
 of the women's battalion.</i>

954
02:00:54,572 --> 02:00:58,219
<i>Inspired by the example
of the Bochkareva battalion,</i>

955
02:00:58,256 --> 02:01:00,120
<i>women have established new battalions.</i>

956
02:01:00,156 --> 02:01:05,730
<i>But Russia was on the brink of a new civil war.</i>

957
02:01:34,533 --> 02:01:35,821
<i>Maria Bochkareva</i>

958
02:01:35,857 --> 02:01:43,546
Was executed in 1920 by the Bolsheviks
for aiding the White Movement

958
02:01:56,305 --> 02:02:01,496
The Batallion prayed a Soldier's Prayer 
handed down to us by 
Greatmartyr Theodore Stratelates “the General”
