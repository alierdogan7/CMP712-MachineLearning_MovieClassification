1
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,763
Man: The court
is open.

2
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,434
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,865
Captain Leland,

4
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,706
this court has carefully
considered your case

5
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,922
and has reached its conclusions
based solely upon the evidence

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,210
introduced in open court
while you were present.

7
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,017
At the close of the evidence,
the court was closed,

8
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,514
and by secret written ballot

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,790
in which at least 2/3 of the
members of the court concurred,

10
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,475
the court has reached
its findings,

11
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,990
which are, of all specifications
and of all charges, guilty.

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,373
And again by
secret written ballot

13
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,789
in which at least
2/3 of the members

14
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,923
of the court concurred,

15
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,291
the court has decided upon
your punishment,

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,040
which is that you be
sentenced to dismissal

17
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,261
from the United States army

18
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,900
and to forfeit all pay
and allowances

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,434
now due or to become due,

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,580
this subject to the approval
of the reviewing authority.

21
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,082
Any further business
before the court?

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,306
Man: No, sir.

23
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,111
Do I hear a motion
for adjournment?

24
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,573
Man: I move that
the court adjourn.

25
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,821
Second man:
I second the motion.

26
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,712
Any objections?
Apparently not.

27
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,207
Court is adjourned to meet
at the call of the president.

28
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,095
How about a game?

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,639
All right, Hansen,
but you and me

30
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,344
against Greer and Parsons.

31
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,236
Man: I'll take a cue.

32
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:06,889
Well, captain...
Anything bothering you?

33
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,604
There used to be a custom
in the British army

34
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,822
when a man disgraced
his uniform.

35
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,461
Too bad we can't do it.

36
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,607
[Knock on door]

37
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,308
Come in.

38
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,915
Well, Rick...

39
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,925
An officer shouldn't
associate with one

40
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,292
who's been
dishonorably dismissed.

41
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,755
The regulations say so.

42
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,834
The adjutant gave
his permission.

43
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,634
In spite of the evidence,
I just can't believe.

44
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,671
Or if you did do it,
you must have had a reason--

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,937
well, one that you thought
was important.

46
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,536
Tell me.
I'm your friend.

47
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,009
It's all in the testimony.

48
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,646
Rick, I could have loaned you
the money, or part of it,

49
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,353
and there were others
who would have been glad.

50
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,893
Oh, I just can't believe.

51
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,023
You, of everybody I know.

52
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,025
Well, I guess nobody ever
really knows anybody.

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,095
What are you going to do, Rick?

54
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,804
I'll probably go up to Canada.

55
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,366
They need artillerymen there.

56
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,595
But, Rick...

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,075
Well, anyway, good luck.

58
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,312
Thanks.

59
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,690
Good-bye.

[Band playing march]

61
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,345
Man: Sit down.

62
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,823
I see you're an
artilleryman, Mr. Leland.

63
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,459
Now what exactly
is your experience,

64
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,994
and with what type of ordnance?

65
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,328
All types and calibers

66
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,904
of both fixed and mobile
coastal guns,

67
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,631
including one year
in an antiaircraft battery.

68
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,808
Now, where were you stationed?

69
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,172
Two years at fort MacArthur,

70
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,943
one year and 8 months
Fort Totten,

71
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,302
one year and two months
fort Kamehameha,

72
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,141
4 years in the
Panama canal zone.

73
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,606
Your full name?

74
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,984
Richard Lomas Leland.

75
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,483
Richard Leland?

76
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,705
That's right, sir.

77
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,249
Why, I'm sorry,
Mr. Leland,

78
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,164
but I believe at this time
we have a full complement

79
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,622
of coast artillery
officers of all ranks.

80
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,615
I thought the Canadian army
needed men of experience.

81
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,488
Oh, regardless of
his qualifications,

82
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,757
no one man is indispensable.

83
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,904
Maybe Chiang Kai-Shek
won't be so particular.

84
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,573
I'm aware neither of
the exact desperation

85
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,928
of the generalissimo's needs

86
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,269
nor how good are his
sources of information.

87
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,735
Good day, Mr. Leland.

you were talking about?

tonight for Yokohama

95

by way of New York, the
Panama canal, and Honolulu.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,580
It's for me.

97
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,941
Excuse, please?

98
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:49,939

00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,861
Vacation?
Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,193
I'll try to make the trip
as pleasant as possible.

188
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,828
Thank you.
Good night, Mr. Leland.

189
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,255
Oh, no. Don't go.

190
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,959
Let's go into
the salon and talk.

191
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,601
Sorry. Hope I'll see you
around again soon.

192
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,666
Oh, we'll probably
bump into each other.

193
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:57,796
Good night.

194
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,211
Good night.

195
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,080
Thick night out.
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,405
You can't open the liquor

197
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,959
till you get outside
the 12-mile limit, can you?

198
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,851
That is so.

199
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,947
Silly rule, huh?

200
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,389
Yes, sir.
Excuse, please.

201
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,363
Yes, sir.
Yes.

202
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,242
I presume you're Mr. Leland.
That's right.

203
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,574
I'm Dr. Lorenz. Not
much chance of mistaking

204
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,180
one's fellow voyagers
on this passage.

205
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,342
Not much.

206
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,789
May I inquire where
you're bound for?

207
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,310
Across the pacific--
the orient.

208
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,409
Excellent. I, too.
The Philippines, that is.

209
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,321
I hold the chair
of sociology at
the university there.

210
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,654
[Speaking Japanese]

211
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,422
[Speaking Japanese]

212
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,432
My man. He doesn't
speak English.

213
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,325
That would be "T. Oki"
of the passenger list?

214
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,128
I take him everywhere.

215
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,500
The Japanese make
great servants.

216
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,069
Will this be your first trip
to the orient, Mr. Leland?

217
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,938
Never been further than Hawaii.

218
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,907
Indeed? I have
lived and worked

219
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,086
in the far east
going on 30 years.

220
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,580
That's a long time.

221
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,224
The oriental way of life
holds a great appeal for me.

222
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,122
I'm going to take a turn
about deck before retiring.

223
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,015
Would you care to join me?

224
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,946
That's a good idea.

225
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,562
You're an American,
are you not, Mr. Leland?
Yes.

226
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,765
You probably don't share my
enthusiasm for the Japanese.

227
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,164
Oh, I don't know. I never
thought much about them.

228
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,170
Wonderful little
people, wonderful.

229
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,102
Greatly misunderstood,
believe me.

230
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,567
To know them--that is,
to really know them

231
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,306
is to feel the deepest
affection toward them.

232
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,943
I understand we have

233
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,349
a charming young lady
passenger aboard.

234
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,006
Yes, a creature of
rare loveliness, doctor.

235
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,949
She walks in beauty.

236
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,745
I'm a very, very
happy man--but very.

237
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,847
Usually, on a freighter--

238
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:52,988
I know, but not this one.

239
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,523
A fellow couldn't do
half as well

240
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,187
on a transatlantic liner.

241
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,766
I have no objection
to your discussing me,

242
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,700
but would you mind doing
it a little farther off?

243
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,826
I'm trying to sleep.

244
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,534
You're fortunate--
fortunate and young.

245
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,667
Occasionally, I wish
I were young again.

246
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,774
Ha ha! Good night.

247
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,035
Good night, sir.

248
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,414
[Lorenz chuckles]

249
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,751
[Bell ringing]

250
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,223
[Man speaking Japanese]

251
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,815
Good morning.

252
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,346
Ah, Mr. Leland.
Good morning.

253
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,191
I hope and trust
you had a good night.

254
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,656
I don't remember,
so I must have.

255
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,494
You missed something
by sleeping so late.

256
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,099
We dropped the pilot
a little while ago.

257
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,798
No. What I came to see,
I didn't miss.

258
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,874
Are your legs always blue?

259
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,243
They're not blue.

260
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,752
Oh, shoulda be, give me
that blanket, will you?

261
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,609
I don't want a blanket.
I want the sunshine.

262
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,471
Your teeth are chattering
like a crap game.

263
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,740
This is November,
and it's winter sunshine.

264
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,880
Thank you.

265
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,554
Pure selfishness on my part.

266
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,483
If you catch pneumonia,
what will happen to our romance?

267
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,469
What will happen to it
anyway if you don't shave.

268
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,048
I shall enjoy
listening to you two,

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,250
if you'll permit me.

270
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,721
You can referee.

271
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,388
Relationships between
modern young Americans

272
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,928
seem most peculiar
to a man of my years.

273
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,463
You give your lovemaking
an assault-and-battery twist.

274
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,341
Living so long in the far east
has perhaps given me

275
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,666
a more or less
oriental view of things.

276
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,435
We were discussing
Philippine economics

277
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,943
when we were so
rudely interrupted.

278
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,274
My own field.

279
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,920
Miss Marlow was kind enough
to listen to me.

280
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,981
They're going to be free
in 1946, aren't they?

281
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,953
They are, provided
America doesn't insist

282
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,511
on fighting a war with Japan.

283
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,980
It's my opinion, however,
that that contingency

284
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,289
is going to keep the Philippines

285
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,787
from ever being free.

286
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,252
Won't Japan gobble them up?

287
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,490
No offense, but Japan
or Canada or anybody else

288
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,366
can have the Philippines,
as far as I'm concerned.

289
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,391
It's hot in Manila.

290
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,400
Might be even hotter
before long.

291
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,362
Hot enough to go
around in shorts?

292
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,470
Ah, there's a Canadian for you.

293
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,532
Let them take their clothes off,
and they're happy.

294
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,701
Look, an American warship.

295
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,140
Oh, yes--
a 1918 flush Decker.

296
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,736
44-inch .50 caliber guns,

297
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,737
one 3-inch .23 caliber
antiaircraft gun.

298
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,010
Not very formidable.

299
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,448
Don't you find, Mr. Leland,

300
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,193
that the United States
is inclined to forget

301
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,115
that most of the world
is at war already

302
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,254
with more war to come,
perhaps in the pacific?

303
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Well, if it comes, it'll
have to do without me.

304
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,520
Indeed, Mr. Leland?

305
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,331
You seem about the right age.

306
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,532
I'll see you later.

307
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,800
A very interesting young man.

308
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,836
Very.

309
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,639
[Speaking Japanese]

310
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,106
Lorenz: I don't
believe our captain

311
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,681
will mind my
explaining his words.

312
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,089
What he just said
means in English,

313
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,417
"permit me to take."

314
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,125
Something like saying
grace before a meal.

315
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,923
It also expresses
his thankfulness
to his ancestors.

316
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,489
That is right.
Excuse, please.
I like that.

317
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,829
I come from a long
line of grace Sayers.

318
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,304
Excuse, please.

319
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,673
Miss Marlow, Mr. Leland,
chief engineer Mitsuko.

320
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,303
How do you do?

321
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,837
[Speaks Japanese]

322
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,571
Excuse, please.
Chief engineer has no English.

323
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,768
Chief engineer has a good grip.

324
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,710
Ha ha! Some joke.

325
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,847
I think I'll skip
the bread pudding.

326
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,282
Just bring me some coffee.

327
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,978
I hope you're a good sailor,
miss Marlow.

328
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,319
The Genoa Maru has her
moments when a blow comes on.

329
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,756
I wonder if it will
really get rough.

330
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,587
This is rough.

331
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,755
Not nearly rough enough.

332
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,092
I want to go through something

333
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,657
I can talk about afterwards.

334
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,655
You probably will,

335
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,656
but you may not want
to talk about it.

336
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,869
I think there's something
elemental in a storm.

337
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,231
It appeals more
to women than to men.

338
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,131
They're more
elemental--

339
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:02,941
than what?

340
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,202
Than women--men.

341
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,172
I hope so, honey.
I'm your friend.

342
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,340
Ha ha ha.

343
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,678
Ha! Some joke.

344
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,213
I suppose I shouldn't smoke
my cigar right now.

345
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,980
No. Let her be happy
for a little while...

346
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,318
A little while.

347
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,564
Do you know what I'd like to do?

348
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,665
I'd like to go up in the bow

349
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,519
if I had a man to hang on to.

350
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,058
I'm your man anyplace, even
the crow's-nest. Let's go.

00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,664

gentlemen.

352
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,226

00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,255
Better bring your coat.

356
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,565
Whoo!
This is wonderful!

357
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,965
What a figurehead you'd make.

358
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,507
Look at the stern, the way
it goes up and down.

359
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,983
It goes down so far you'd think
it would never come up again.

360
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,082
And look at the way
the masts are going.

361
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,714
Don't look too long.

362
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,479
Keep your eyes off
the water below.

363
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,078
Oh, I feel wonderful.

364
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,679
You are wonderful.

365
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,191
I wish I had a better suit.

366
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,363
It doesn't matter
about the suit.

367
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,888
You have a kind face.

368
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:30,886
You think so?

369
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,787
Yes, I do, Rick.

370
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,529
That's the first time
you ever called me Rick.

371
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,095
Is it?

372
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,873
Yes.

373
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,609
What's the matter?

374
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,212
Look, I didn't mean that.

375
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,977
I did. Why didn't you?

376
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,781
A fella with a suit like mine

377
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,849
shouldn't go around
kissing girls.

378
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,425
See, I--
are you getting sick?

379
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,828
I don't know.

380
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,839
How do girls usually act
when you kiss them?

381
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,242
They don't turn green.

382
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,714
Then I'm sick.
Get me out of here.

383
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,572
Everything was going
so beautifully.

384
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,811
Why did you have to eat
that bread pudding?

385
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,748
Oh, shoulda be,

386
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,275
the lady's been stabbed
by a bread pudding.

387
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,390
Do what you can for her.

388
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,052
Bread pudding?
Too bad.

389
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,885
Shoulda be.

390
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,734
Ah, Mr. Leland.

391
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,599
Beating it?

392
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,998
Patience is a game one
only plays out of boredom,

393
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,670
which condition of mind
it does nothing to relieve.

394
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,011
Will you have a drink with me?

395
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,035
Thanks. I will.

396
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,534
Have another.

397
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,466
I shouldn't.
I'm strapped.

398
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,871
Sorry to hear that,
Mr. Leland,

399
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,902
but what possible
bearing can that have?

400
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,378
If the fella I'm
counting on in New York

401
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,572
doesn't kick through,

402
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,467
I won't be able
to buy you a drink.

403
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,909
That doesn't alarm me greatly.

404
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,751
Miss Marlow dying.
Want to see Rick.

405
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,693
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

406
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,930
I understand you're dying.

407
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,829
Yes.

408
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
You want to be buried at sea?

409
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,637
They have a very nice service.

410
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,613
They stitch you up in a bag,
and you wouldn't like that.

411
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,508
I'll have shoulda be
put you on ice.

412
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,713
Very amusing.
A woman suffering.

413
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,535
Stop being such a baby.

414
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,781
Even if I do live,

415
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,805
I'll never be the same again.

416
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,590
It happens to everybody
that eats bread pudding

417
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,846
and looks at a mast.

418
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,687
The mistake I made
was in kissing you.

419
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,522
I was all right till then.

420
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:15,957
I resent that.

421
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,522
I'll never let you
kiss me again.

422
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,060
We won't argue.
You're not well,

423
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,985
and you don't know
what you're saying.

424
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,930
I do too.

425
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:23,895
Stop that!

426
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,073
Don't tell me you're the kind

427
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,827
that goes to bed
with your shoes on.

428
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,739
I need them on for suddenly
have to run down the hall.

429
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,974
All right, darling.
I'll humor you.

430
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,481
Humor me?! Ha!

431
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:38,854
When you're sitting
at the table tonight

432
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,308
eating your head off,

433
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,079
think of the girl whose
happiness you wrecked.

434
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,079
Yes, darling.

435
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,350
I pity the woman you ever marry.

436
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,718
I'll never get married.

437
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,187
The kind of a lover I am,
it wouldn't be fair.

438
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,426
Any wife of mine would spend
her life running down hallways.

439
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,702
You aren't married,
are you, Rick?

440
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,097
No. Does that
make you feel better?

441
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,233
You make me sick.

442
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,397
And if you stay here
one minute longer,

443
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,996
I'll prove it to you.

444
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,812
I take it our lovely
traveling companion

445
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,314
has a touch of mal de mer.

446
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,635
It was only a matter of time.

447
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,210
She speeded things up
by looking at the mast.

448
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,649
What a pity.

449
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,024
Yes. She doesn't look too
well with a green face.

450
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,865
From certain remarks
you dropped on deck

451
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,210
this morning,
Mr. Leland,

452
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,884
I gather you're
quite well-informed

453
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:47,313
in matters pertaining to
the United States Navy.

454
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,079
Yes, I know
a little bit about it.

455
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,448
You were perhaps in the Navy?

456
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,287
No, coast artillery.
Army.

457
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,163
How interesting.

458
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,722
Not so interesting.

459
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,460
Were you ever
stationed in Panama?

460
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,956
Part of the time.

461
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:05,358
I hope you don't think
I am too inquisitive.

462
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,701
Not at all.
Not at all.

463
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,396
You're furnishing the liquor.

464
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,597
It's hardly an excuse

465
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,439
for asking a man his history.

466
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,643
I haven't got any history.

467
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,706
I was in the army.
I got kicked out.

468
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,476
I went up to Canada
and tried to enlist,

469
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,484
and they wouldn't have me.

470
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,005
I can't understand that.

471
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
It's perfectly simple.
They don't want men that--

472
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,879
have been kicked out
of another army.

473
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,151
You're Frank, anyhow.

474
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,149
I admire that quality.

475
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,590
Why shouldn't I be?
So-called facts.

476
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,129
I'm known on every army post
in this hemisphere.

477
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,904
I understand how you feel,

478
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,403
but you can't afford
to be bitter

479
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,704
against your own countrymen,

480
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,626
particularly in
these troubled times.

481
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,901
Can't I?

482
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,299
How do you know
what I can afford?

483
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:46,811
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,913
I didn't mean to intrude
an unwanted opinion.

485
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,847
OK, doc.

486
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:57,023
I'll hire out to whoever
will pay for my services.

487
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,423
Chiang Kai-shek,
Hirohito...

488
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,186
Anybody that will pay.

489
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,394
I can't tell you how
I sympathize with you.

490
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,256
Were you stationed long
in the canal zone?

491
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,085
Quite a while.

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,330
I served at Fort Amador
and fort Sherman.

493
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,226
I was attached to staff.

494
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,038
Amador guards the pacific
approach, doesn't it?

495
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,302
Yeah.

496
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,471
I think I've had
too much to drink.

497
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,510
Have you?

498
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,335
Can I help you,
Mr. Leland?

499
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,450
Sick. Need help.

500
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,849
Go away.

501
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,487
Tea? Hold head?

502
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,756
Beat it.

503
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,130
Too much whiskey.
Very sick. Shoulda be.

504
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,196
Beat it.

505
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,845
Ha ha ha ha!

506
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,553
This is the happiest
moment of my life.

507
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,875
My prayers have been answered.

508
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,521
Close the door when you leave.

509
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,856
They have a nice burial at sea.

510
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,022
Go away, will you?

511
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,660
I want to die alone,
without a friend.

512
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,155
You will. Is there
anything I can do--

513
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,797
something to make you sicker?

514
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,503
Just hang around.

515
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,995
Keep your shoes on.

516
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,097
I hope you'll need them.

517
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,399
Ha ha ha ha!

518
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,114
Rick, before I get off
the gangplank,

519
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,107
are there any stray
hayseeds in my hair?

520
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,059
Now, look, angel, I've got
to see a friend of mine.

521
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,585
I think I can borrow some money.

522
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,430
You wait here for me.

523
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,242
Only be a few minutes.

524
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,306
Ok.

525
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,476
Man: Here you are, folks,

526
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,891
the collected ingenuity

527
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,993
of the 4 corners of
the earth for a quarter.

528
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,555
25 cents apiece.

529
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,532
Each and every article is
unconditionally guaranteed.

530
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,998
If you get them home
and they don't work,

531
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,996
bring them back.
I won't be here.

532
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,262
Here's something nice.

533
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,569
Take it home
to scare your friends.

534
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,067
You won't have many friends.

535
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,742
What's the matter, Buddy?
You taking root there?

536
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,537
Step right up, folks.
25 cents. 1/4 of a dollar.

537
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,444
It amuses the kiddies.
It amazes the old folks...

538
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,493
Eighth floor.

539
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
Eight, please.

540
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,093
[Telephone rings]

541
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:29,962
Atlas finance company.
One moment, please. Yes, sir?

542
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,592
I'd like to see
Mr. hart.

543
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,667
May I have your name, please?

544
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:33,861
Leland.

545
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:37,456
He's expecting you.
Go right in. Yes.

546
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,473
Well, glad to see you,
captain Leland.

547
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,268
Colonel hart.

548
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,309
Sit down.
Thank you.

549
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,875
Say, I had to duck a fellow
on the way up here--

550
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,254
white man, tall, thin,

551
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,953
wore a long black
overcoat, derby hat.

552
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,076
I think I know the man.

553
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,920
We may soon pay him a visit.

554
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,016
How did it go up north?

555
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,817
Everything went
about as expected,

556
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,958
but I must say
that their rejection

557
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,234
of my army application

558
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,202
was just a little bit
on the insulting side.

559
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,341
By the way, how did you manage
to get me on the boat?

560
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,573
Your story was told
in the right quarters.

561
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,772
Dr. Lorenz was
well informed about you

562
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,574
before you even came aboard.

563
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,966
Now, there's a girl--

564
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,668
yes, I know. We've been
checking on her,

565
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,869
but from what I hear, I
don't think she's the type.

566
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,341
Would she be there
if she weren't?

567
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,380
Possibly, but I doubt it,

568
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,175
however, that's up
to you to find out.

569
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,917
What's she like, captain?

570
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,423
Well, uh...

571
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,904
Remember the girl you
used to dream about

572
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,689
when you were 19?

573
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,524
Why, very well.

574
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,229
This is her in the flesh.

575
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,861
I see.

576
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,426
How are you
and the genial doctor

577
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,064
getting along?

578
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,499
Famously, I'd say.

579
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,633
Well, don't take
too much for granted.

580
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,998
Lorenz is no chump,

581
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,377
or he wouldn't
have lasted so long.

582
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,201
He may be just
giving you enough rope.

583
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,021
Another thing, captain,
remember, on shipboard,

584
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,970
anything
can happen to a man--

585
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,042
a box drops on your skull,

586
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,150
a wave washes you overboard.

587
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,578
I'll be careful.

588
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,056
You're going to have
a new shipmate tonight.

589
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,321
Getting aboard is a young man

590
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,552
by the name of Totsuiko,
Joe Totsuiko,

591
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,458
a member of the
Kokuryu-Kai, and tough.

592
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,521
A jap gunsel,

593
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,656
so watch out
if you bump into him.

594
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,894
Yeah, I'll do that.

595
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,259
There's one other item.

596
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,527
The details of your disgrace

597
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,995
have been widely circulated

598
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,534
in Panama and
across the pacific,

599
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,568
so you won't be
welcomed, exactly,

600
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,473
with open arms.

601
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,104
I'll be on my own down there?

602
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,340
Smith is expecting you.
No one else knows.

603
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,906
Some big things
are brewing, captain.

604
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,184
We have reason to believe
they'll boil over soon.

605
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,453
We don't know how soon
or what side of the pot,

606
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,312
but they're sure
to involve the canal,

607
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,751
and that's where you come in

608
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,845
because Lorenz may or
may not be the key man.

609
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,618
It's up to you to find out.

610
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,347
Success.

611
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,821
Thank you.

612
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,459
I hope you and the girl

613
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,464
I wanted to marry when I was 19

614
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:51,156
have a nice lunch together.

615
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,160
Good-bye, sir.

616
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,401
Good-bye.

617
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,194
Who's your friend?
I don't know.

618
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,893
I hate to complain, but
he's been pretty nasty.

619
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:17,955
Yeah? About what?

620
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,393
The usual thing.

621
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,098
Do you want to meet this lady?

622
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,097
No.

623
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,068
She was under the impression

624
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,666
you wanted to talk to her.

625
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,607
Not me. I guess I was just
reciting something to myself.

626
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,813
Why don't you recite
something to me?

627
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,805
I don't know what
you're talking about.

628
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,377
I got to get going.

629
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,877
It's not polite to walk out

630
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,548
on a lady like that.

631
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,876
First you say you're sorry,

632
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,851
then
you say good-bye.

633
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,659
I beg your pardon, lady.
I guess I mistook you

634
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,072
for a girl who
used to come in here

635
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,660
and sit all the time.

636
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,855
It won't happen again.

637
00:34:58,897 --> 00:34:59,727
Why didn't you really hit him?

638
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,798
Were you afraid of him?

639
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,002
No. He had my number.

640
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,397
Did you get your money?

641
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,639
Yeah. More than I expected.
Did I talk fast!

642
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,814
In that case, you're going
to get yourself a new suit.

643
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,010
This has been
some day for a girl
from medicine hat.

644
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,309
Is that a gag, or do you really

645
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:16,491
come from a place
called medicine hat?

646
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,615
What's wrong with medicine hat

647
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,634
it's hot in summer
and cold in winter,
nothing ever happens there.

648
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,822
You happened there.
That's good enough for me.

649
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,458
By any chance, are you
a woman of means,

650
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,963
by any chance, I hope?

651
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,294
My father's a farmer.

652
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,159
I work in a 10-cent store.
I sell peanut brittle.

653
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,595
Oh, I see, you whipped up
the gaudy garments you wear

654
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,998
on the family sewing machine.

655
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,209
I suppose I'm on
your blacklist now.

656
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,608
Oh, no. I'm used
to bad luck.

657
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,342
It'll probably end up
with captain higoto

658
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,438
marrying us on the boat.

659
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,379
Oh, no. I want
a church wedding

660
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,854
and a groom who has
more than two suits.

661
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,115
How long were you
in Panama, Rick?

662
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,315
About 4 years.

663
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,586
Did you ever hear of a man

664
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,794
by the name of Morton--
Dan Morton?

665
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,287
Yeah. Yeah. He's
a planter, isn't he?

666
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,961
Lot of dough. Why?

667
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,269
He's related to some
friends of mine.

668
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,402
You'd better look him up.

669
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,546
He might take a fancy to you

670
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,300
and leave you all his money.

671
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,850
I'm not so obsessed with
money as you seem to be.

672
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:13,871
I can do without it.

673
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,339
You stick around with me,

674
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,807
and you're going to get
plenty of practice.

675
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,545
We can walk to the pier.
You ought to
save your money.

676
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:25,623
This is no time to
be a pinchpenny.
I'm wooing a girl.

677
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,654
Pier 16.

678
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,427
Someone should tell
our little friend

679
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:36,192
that tight overcoats
and guns
don't go together.

680
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:38,262
He's liable to get
picked up by a cop.

681
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,867
Pier 16.

682
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,813
If we'd known
he was coming here,

683
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,674
we could have given him a lift.

684
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,712
What's up, Rick?

685
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,545
You stay here.

686
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,557
You can't dump me
like this. Something's
going to happen.

687
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:38,715
Now, go back. Don't be
an innocent bystander.
They always get hurt.

688
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,991
You all right, doc?

689
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,516
Yes.

690
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,342
You know him?

691
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,277
I don't think so.

692
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,942
At any rate, he isn't
a close friend.

693
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,050
OK, then, we better
send for the police.

694
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,622
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer that you
didn't. Miyuma.

695
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,024
[Speaking Japanese]

696
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,087
If the police were
called in, there might
be an investigation.

697
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,000
Might not be able to sail.

698
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,202
It's none of
my business what
you do with him.

699
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,704
He wasn't shooting at me.

700
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,566
I can never
thank you enough,
Mr. Leland.

701
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,345
Oh, skip it, doctor.
I was just coming on board

702
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,870
and practically
stumbled over the guy.

703
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,539
How you doing, angel?

704
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:06,208
I think I got pushed
in the face by somebody.
My lipstick smeared.

705
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,907
Aw, you look cute.

706
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:11,449
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'll go to my cabin...

707
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,077
And faint.

708
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,416
I hope no more of
your homicidal friends
are on the pier.

709
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,660
Standing so close to you
might be bad luck.

710
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,496
First officer miyuma
is taking care of that.

711
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,550
[Gunshot]

712
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,083
You weren't kidding.

713
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,378
I suppose you're wondering

714
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,630
about this
little incident,
Mr. Leland.

715
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,221
No, not particularly.

716
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,085
As you know,
I'm a resident of
the Philippines.

717
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,820
In fact, I consider
myself a Philippine
national.

718
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,790
And what do the Filipinos
consider you?

719
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,859
It's unfortunate
that some of
my fellow citizens

720
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,857
resent my
realistic attitude
toward Japan.

721
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,830
A few of them
even go so far as
to call me traitor.

722
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,970
That misguided
little man in
the long overcoat

723
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:08,565
undoubtedly believed
he was acting on
patriotic principles.

724
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,248
Whatever he believed,

725
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,346
he believed pretty strongly.

726
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,418
If I were you,
just from a health
standpoint,

727
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,218
I think I'd give up the japs.

728
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,189
I'm afraid my ties with
the Japanese are rather
too close for that:

729
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,258
Financially, spiritually,
ideologically,
and otherwise.

730
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,698
If those ties involve
some personal danger,
I don't mind,

731
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,574
considering the ultimate reward.

732
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,513
Well, then,
if you don't mind,
I shouldn't mind either.

733
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,535
I'm being Frank with
you, Mr. Leland, because
you saved my life.

734
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,205
Naturally, anything I say
is in confidence.

735
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,083
Naturally.

736
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,658
All that worries me
is that I came
on this trip

737
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,116
for my health and pleasure,

738
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,957
but I seem
to have come to
the wrong place.

739
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,363
I never saw such
a gunned-up boat
in my life.

740
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,855
Really?

741
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,857
Yes. Your little
Filipino friend
had a gun.

742
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,859
Sugi's got a gun,
and that wasn't
an apple

743
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,531
the first officer
was holding
in his pocket.

744
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,370
You got a gun?

745
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,765
Even I, Mr. Leland.

746
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,583
Mine's bigger than yours.

747
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,312
I usually like
to keep this locked
up in my suitcase,

748
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,747
but with all these
guns around, what's
a fella going to do?

749
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,584
I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you.

750
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,090
In fact, I wouldn't even
think about it.

751
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,347
Thanks for the tip.

752
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,498
Did you and miss Marlow
have a good time in New York?

753
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Wonderful.

754
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,955
Saw your man, got your money?

755
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,492
I got it. Miss Marlow
made me spend it
on a new suit.

756
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,860
It's very handsome.

757
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,427
Yes. She seemed to think
it made some improvement.

758
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,866
Well, I'll be hitting the hay.

759
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,381
If anybody else
starts throwing
slugs at you, doc,

760
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,099
don't forget to duck.

761
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,368
I believe I'll be
a little better
prepared. Thank you.

762
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,237
Good night.

763
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,305
Good night.

764
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,151
Hey.

765
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,475
Am I nuts, or did I
hear some shooting
a few minutes ago?

766
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,791
Did I miss anything?

767
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,822
Firecrackers.
Chinese new year's.

768
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,758
Maybe I am nuts,
but it sounded to me

769
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:07,133
like those firecrackers
were shot from a muzzle.

770
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,232
My name's Joe Totsuiko.
Rick Leland.

771
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,155
I'm sure glad
there's someone around
that speaks my language.

772
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,501
I'm rooming with
that dope named T. Oki.

773
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:19,367
He's got his lip
buttoned up for good
as far as I can figure out.

774
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,567
Where you bound for?
The orient.

775
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,340
Me, too. My old man's
sending me down there

776
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,208
to work for one of my uncles.

777
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,676
Say, I wonder if those
Panamanian mamas are all
they're cracked up to be.

778
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,617
Terrific, Joe, simply terrific.

779
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,832
Well, I'll see you
around, Ricky.

780
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,250
Yeah. Take it
easy, Joe.

781
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,642
Without knocking.
Where's your modesty?

782
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:56,907
What's going on on this boat?

783
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:57,675
Nothing's going on on this boat.

784
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,413
Shh! Not so loud.

785
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,607
Well, that is, nothing
except an attempted
assassination.

786
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,421
But why get so excited
about a little thing
like that?

787
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,093
Who are you after?
Are you a g-man
or something?

788
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,223
What if I was?

789
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,057
I just wondered.

790
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,222
Look, I'm just
a private citizen,

791
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,891
and I happened
to be passing a room

792
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,460
where one guy was trying
to bump off another guy,

793
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,698
which, as you know,
happens to be
against the law.

794
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,165
Happened to be passing.

795
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,112
You followed
our little friend
in the tight overcoat,

796
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,914
and then you lied to
Dr. Lorenz about happening
to stumble over him,

797
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,106
you can't do that to me.

798
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,982
If it'll make you happy,
I'm J. Edgar hoover.
Here's my badge.

799
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,141
Some joke. Mr. Leland,
I believe that a man

800
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,710
should tell the woman
he's going to marry
everything.

801
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,750
Oh, in that case,
I'll come clean.

[Bell ringing]

803
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:40,446
I look old,
but that's because
I've worried a lot.

Actually, I haven't
yet reached the age
of legal consent,

805
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:45,168
and if you don't
get out of here, I'm
going to yell for help.

806
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,930
All right.
You can get yourself
another heiress.

807

Powder, angel, and when
you go, stop thinking
and keep your mouth shut.

808

I never saw anybody
like you--you never
have any clothes on.

809
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,977
Well, if anybody
heard you complaining
about it,

810
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,873
they'd put you in
the psychopathic ward.

881
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:27,639
Mr. Leland,
may I come in?

882
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,935
Yeah, come ahead.

883
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,239
Who won the gin rummy?

884
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,950
As Mr. Totsuiko put it,
I was skunked 4 times.

885
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,790
Have a drink, doc?

886
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,891
Thank you.

887
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:46,724
Amusing fellow--
Joe.

888
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,331
Quite.

889
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:51,533
A little of him goes a long way.

891
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,298
Your health.

892
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,640
No. To yours.
Younger men always
have more to live for.

893
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,277
That is if they're lucky.

894
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:07,782
In my experience,
one has to be smart
to be lucky.

895
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:10,545
I hope I'll be smart.

896
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,275
I'm interested
in you, Mr. Leland,

897
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,660
especially since
you saved my life.

898
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,624
Ah.

899
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,985
You're too modest.

900
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,994
Look, if you
feel that calls
for some dough...

901
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,496
That isn't exactly my
idea, though it might
be worth some help.

902
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:21,955
Such as?

903
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:24,427
One night you told me
about your troubles
in the army.

904
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,775
I'd like to hear more
about that.

905
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,753
I got in a jam with a dame.

906
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,951
Yes?

907
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,454
I needed some dough,

908
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:48,085
had access to
the regimental funds,
so I borrowed it,

909
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:49,993
intending to put it
back, of course.

910
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:50,885
Of course.

911
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,515
They found out first.

912
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,641
The brass hats could've
given me a chance
if they'd wanted to,

913
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,030
but they didn't.

914
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:01,725
They tied me up
with pink ribbons
and threw me to the wolves.

915
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,769
You can write your own finish.

916
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,144
Whatever that
is to be, you'll
need some money.

917
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,151
You can have more
when you want it,

918
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,453
within reason, of course.

919
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:25,518
What's my part of the deal?

920
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,530
I never discuss being
a traitor with a man.

921
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:32,463
You'll find it easier
if you don't think
about that part of it.

922
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,460
Go ahead.

923
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,571
Very well.

924
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,072
In a day or two,
you'll talk to me

925
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,504
about certain installations

926
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,868
in the vicinity of both
balboa and Cristobal,

927
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,038
with particular reference

928
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:43,307
to antiaircraft emplacements,

929
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,484
railway guns,
and ammunition dumps.

930
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,783
All you have to do is
to remember accurately.

931
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,152
That ought to be worth
quite a lot.

932
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:54,788
You'll find me quite generous.

933
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:03,334
You're not only
interesting to me now,
you're also valuable.

934
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,734
That shouldn't cause you
any anxiety.

935
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,467
You mind if it does?

936
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:12,303
If, uh...If you
were to apply
for life insurance

937
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,310
stating all the facts,

938
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,112
the company's actuaries
might decide

939
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:19,314
there were certain
imponderables existent
in your position--

940
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,407
for instance, having
committed yourself,

941
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,749
I wouldn't want you
to change your mind.

942
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,524
It might turn out
to be most unfortunate.

943
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,120
All right.

944
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,125
Remember what I said,
Mr. Leland,

945
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:39,834
that it would be easier
not to entertain
certain thoughts?

please come quick,
put out fire.

948
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:56,853

Ooh.

You certainly are
a girl of many colors.

953
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,584
then your face
turns green, and now
you're red all over.

suffering was until I
came on this pleasure trip.

you always know
all the answers

till the results are posted.

resist at least one
"I told you so."

It's true. Seeing me
in pain does give you
pleasure.

Oh, no, precious, it isn't that.

961
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,203
Well, then, what are you
so happy about?

962
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,895
Well, I just got some
money from Dr. Lorenz
for saving his life.

963
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,369
Rick, you didn't
actually take money
for saving a man's life?

964
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:57,851
Is there any other
reason you know of

965
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,605
why I should
take money
from Dr. Lorenz?

966
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,909
But, Rick...

967
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,715
Oh, Rick, you're not much
account, are you?

968
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:10,624

a career out of
saving lives.

so much,

a real shock when
we get to Panama.

going to hear
some things about me

975
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,206
I believe I'll leave that

who'll get fun
out of telling you.

What's all that about?

985
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,531
Judo is more
than a mere contest.

986
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,533
Its devotees form a brotherhood,

987
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,695
similar in many respects
to our western freemasonry.

988
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,925
It, too, has its degrees
and its secrets

989

as well as its

Leland: Come again?

992
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,235
It's an oriental concept

993
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:38,577
that destructive force
acts upon itself,

994
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:41,383
and there you have
the principle of jujitsu--

995
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:44,146
to turn the power
of one's antagonist
upon himself

996
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,584
and by so doing, vanquish him.

997
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,221
That's the art of the thing.

998
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,985
How would all that
stack up against
a right cross?

All right.
You asked for it.

1006
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,014
You better get rid
of those glasses.

to sail around the horn.

What are you doing back here?

1053
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,810
You ought to have
more sense than to
come back here again.

1054
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:56,973
Free country, isn't it?

1055
00:57:57,041 --> 00:58:00,141
It sure is, for guys like you.

1056
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:22,627
Sam, this is miss Marlow
and Dr. Lorenz.

1057
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,600
Very nice you come here.
Panamerican need beauty.

1058
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,440
Sam, this lady is very poor.

1059
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,414
You don't mind my
parading your poverty?
Not if it does the trick.

1060
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,544
I told her that I had
a pull with you.

1061
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,140
Can you take care of her cheap?

1062
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,081
Can do.

1063
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:38,715
[Speaking foreign language]

1064
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:39,983
I would like a room

1065
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,690
with a northern
exposure,
if you please.

1066
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:46,693
All the same floor,
all close together.

1067
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,127
Your room not quite ready.

1068
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,292
Maybe so have tea while wait.

1069
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,930
Maybe so.
I'll be right along.

1070

1071
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,870
What's the matter you, Rick?

1072
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,769
What's the matter you
"what's the matter" me?

1073
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,081
All the time people
say you're no good.

1074
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,653
Big smell from up north.

1075
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,482
What's the matter you come back?

1076
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,446
Too much army here.
Everyone know.

1077
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,556
You're through with Panama.

1078
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:15,048
Panama through with you.

1079
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,259
Well, Sam, maybe
I won't be here long.

1080
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:24,626
Maybe so you need money
go other place.

1081
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,665
No, Sam.
I don't need money.

1082
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,802
You no need money?

1083
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:31,737

1084
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:34,372
Sam keep nose clean,
Sam no smell fish.

1085

No catchee trouble.

1086

All the time you like trouble.

1087
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,209
Maybe so
Dr. Lorenz trouble?

1088
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,208
Maybe so.

1089

Girl, too?

1090
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:46,451
I don't know, Sam.
I hope she's all right.

1091
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,586
She got your bad.

1092

Sam...

1095
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:58,059
You can help me.
People tell you things.

1096
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,598
People tell me
because I don't tell.

1097
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:03,365
I tell, they don't
tell me anymore.

1098
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,302
Ok, Sam, if you don't
want to help me,

1099
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,241
you don't have to.

1100
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:10,536
Can do.

1101
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,777
I knew you would,
Sam. Thanks.

1102
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:14,183
Be careful.

1103
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,514
If I get any more careful,
I won't be any good.

Thanks, señor.

Mr. Leland,
may I pay you a visit?

Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

1112

1113
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,375
Very.

Ice water.
Room 24, please.

1115
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,686
Well, doc, what's on your mind?

1116
01:00:58,756 --> 01:00:59,986
Now that we're in Panama,

1117
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,327
I think it's time you began

1118
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,861
to earn your money.

1119
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,868
Ah, hot!

1120
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:21,482
Ok, doc, where do we begin?

1121
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:22,705
Pedro Miguel locks

1122
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,650
will be a good place
for a starter.

1123
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:25,835
How many batteries are there?

1124
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:27,283
What are their caliber?

1125
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,523
Antiaircraft or heavy stuff?

1126
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,317
Begin with
the 16-inch guns.

1127
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:33,689
Now, let's see.

1128
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,858
The last time I was
down here 2 years ago,

1129
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:36,826
there were double railway guns

1130
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:38,504
east and west,

1131
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,802
two twin concrete
embrasures half a mile
to the north,

1132
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:43,365
one 4-gun turret of
shore-mounted navies

1133
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,333
back of hill 14.

1134
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:45,241
But what's the idea?

1135
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,272
You know all that already.

1136
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:48,507
Testing me, eh?

1137
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:49,942
You examined the money
I gave you?

1138
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:52,377
That's right.
Do we go on?

1139
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,512
We go on.

1140
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,007
What specific knowledge have you

1141
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,409
of the military plane patrol
over the canal area?

1142
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,323
Well...2 years ago--

1143
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,546
what happened 2 years ago
doesn't interest me.

1144
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:07,221
What I want is the current
schedule of the patrol planes.

1145
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,861
When the flights take off,
exactly what areas they cover,

1146
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,708
what altitude they conduct
their reconnaissance,

1147
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,629
and the precise time
of their return.

1148
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,868

01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,266
Ice water, sir.

1150
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,022
That's going
to take some getting.

1151
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,690
I'll pay generously for it.

1152
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,558
How much?
Shall we say $500?

1153
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,728
Shall we say $1,500?

1154
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,227
I said I'll pay generously,

1155
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,028
not foolishly.

1156
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,229
Now, just a minute.

1157
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,580
The only place I can
get that information

1158
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,541
is air force headquarters,

1159
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,772
and that won't be easy.

1160
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:55,268
It may take almost
a week of trying

1161
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:56,899
before things begin
to break just right.

1162
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:58,111
I'll make you a deal--

1163
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:01,445
1,500 if you get it
by 5:00 today.

1164
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,651
5:00? Why all the rush?

1165
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,713
There's no rush.

1166
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,378
Just $1,000 worth, eh?

1167
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,890
Remember, Mr. Leland,

1168
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,192
it's your place to answer
questions, not to ask them.

1169
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,664
Sorry. I--I'm
a little new

1170
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:12,661
at this game.

1171
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,032
Of course, of course.

1172
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,762
Oh, and by the way,

1173
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:19,097
don't get the ingenious
idea of selling me out

1174
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:21,473
to the American authorities.

1175
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,531
It wouldn't pay...

1176
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,900
In the long run.

1177
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:51,033
Marlow: Wait a minute!

1178
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,127
Who is it?

1179
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:56,168
It's me.

1180
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,873
How you doing?
All right.

1181
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:58,865
You happy?
Very.

1182
01:03:58,936 --> 01:03:59,736
What's the program?

1183
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,143
I'm free as a bird.

1184
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,615
I've got a couple of
things to attend to.

1185
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,019
I'll meet you at
the international bar

1186
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,281
at 1:00.
How do I get there?

1187
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,252
Tell any cab driver.
Come as you are.

1188
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,746
What can I do for you, sir?

1189
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,137
I want to open an account.

1190
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,079
Sit down, please.
Thank you.

1191
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,345

1192
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,612
Savings.

1193
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,680
And, uh, what is the name?

1194
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:48,149
Leland.
Richard Leland.

1195
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,788
Will you sign there, please?

1196
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,194
Mm-hmm.

1197
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:02,403
There you are.

1198
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:04,936
How much did you wish
to deposit?

1199
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:08,242
$1,241.00

1200
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:11,035
no one can get close
enough to hear us
without our seeing them.

1201
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,108
Go ahead with your report,
captain Leland.

1202
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:18,351
Lorenz is hooked.
I'm on his payroll--
$350 worth.

1203
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,345
He must think
you're very valuable.

1204
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,917
What have you got?
Not much.

1205
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,186
Lorenz seems to be head man.

1206
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,193
They switched his valet
in New York.

1207
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,515
The new T. Oki could
be a naval officer.

1208
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,831
He is.

1209
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,372
Have you any idea
what Lorenz is up to?

1210
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:31,864
No, but I've got a hunch

1211
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,968
that whatever is going to happen

1212
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:34,297
will happen soon.

1213
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,934
He offered me the family jewels

1214
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,340
for the canal patrol
flight schedule,

1215
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:38,367
and he wants it quick.

1216
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,772
Well, we could
hardly afford--

1217
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:40,876
I think it's worth the gamble

1218
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,014
to keep his confidence.

1219
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:44,012
Hmm. We could make up
a fake schedule.

1220
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,584
Yes, we could,
but all he'd have to do

1221
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,412
would be to get
a pair of binoculars

1222
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,547
and a watch to find out
he'd been tricked.

1223
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,523
No. I think we'd better
give him the real dope.

1224
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,261
I'll phone you if things
get to looking dirty,

1225
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,453
and you can always
change the schedule.

1226
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,920
Very well.

1227
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,158
Under the circumstances,

1228
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:01,493
I suppose it wouldn't be
too dangerous.

1229
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,558
We hardly think

1230
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,066
they'd keep those two men
in Washington

1231
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,104
I they intended
to pull a fast one.

1232
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,068
Shoulda be.

1233
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,174
I beg your pardon?

1234
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:12,465
Now, about the schedule.

1235
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:14,076
Oh, yes. I'll have
a copy of the schedule

1236
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,344
at your hotel this afternoon.

1237
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:18,736
Any more dope about the
girl from medicine hat?

1238
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,778
Yes. She never
lived there.
She's a new yorker,

1239
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:22,654
a buyer for Rogers fifth Avenue.

1240
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,152
She's made 8 trips abroad
in the last 2 years.

1241
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,275
Of course, that could
be part of her work.

1242
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:28,751
Hmm.

1243
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,358
Well...

1244
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:35,091
I guess that slams
the door on miss Marlow.

1245
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:36,529
Funny thing, though.

1246
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,303
She pointed out
the oki switch to me.

1247
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:41,772
Sometimes the best way
to gain a confidence
is to give one.

1248
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,481
What have you got
on a fella
named Dan Morton?

1249
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,300
Owns a plantation here
called "bountiful."

1250
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,041
Morton.

1251
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:54,811
Age: 55 to 60.
Came here in '31.

1252
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,808
Heavy drinker.
Bit of a dipsomaniac.

1253
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,350
May be a little cracked.

1254
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,445
His plantation
has been profitable.

1255
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,087
Has substantial accounts
in 3 banks.

1256
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,823
Apparently no entanglements,

1257
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,318
either political or feminine.

1258
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,860
Seems all right.
Why do you ask?

1259
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:08,964
She asked me about him.

1260
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,065
Said some people in Halifax

1261
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:11,304
told her to look him up.

1262
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,841
Personally, I don't
believe that anyone

1263
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,662
with as much money as Dan Morton

1264
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,511
would bother with the small
profit that treason pays,

1265
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,903
and he's hardly the type
to go in for the excitement.

1266
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,398
However, you never can tell.

1267
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,110
And now I think you've
been here long enough, captain.

1268
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,481
I'll check with you later.

1269
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,412
You send a schedule over
to my hotel at 5:00.

1270
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,808
Of course you'll phone me

1271
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,909
at the first suspicion

1272
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,920
that they're making use of it.

1273
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,181
And, uh, your book, captain.

1274
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,421
Of course.

1275
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,192
Thank you very much,
Mr. Smith.

1276
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:41,457
Good day, sir.

1277
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:50,174
I'm sorry to be late,
angel. I was held up.

1278
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,544
I like waiting for you, Ricky.

1279
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,041
Wouldn't I make a splendid wife?

1280
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,244
What'll it be?

1281
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,265
Something cool and long.

1282
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:58,711
Something cool and long.

1283
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,475
How about a couple
of planter's punches?

1284
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:01,454
Fine.

1285
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,511
Si, señor.

1286
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:07,048
Rick, I had
the funniest feeling
coming over here.

1287
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:09,047
I felt as though
I were being followed.

1288
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,419
A cab stayed right behind mine

1289
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,287
all the way over from the hotel.

1290
01:08:12,356 --> 01:08:14,816
I may be imagining things,
but I don't think so.

1291
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,731
Who do you think
would be following you?

1292
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:19,203
I wouldn't know.
Would you?

1293
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:21,633
All that funny business
on the boat.

1294
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,698
What did it mean, Rick?

1295
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:26,866
Who is Dr. Lorenz,
and what is he up to?

1296
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,436
You're good, angel.
You're very, very good.

1297
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:31,707
Don't you think it's about time

1298
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,411
we got together on a few things?

1299
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:34,307
Such as?

1300
01:08:34,378 --> 01:08:36,048
Who we are and what we are.

1301
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,222
I've told you
everything about me.

1302
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,617
Now, look, angel,

1303
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,292
we can play this dumb,
or we can play it smart.

1304
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:41,917
I'm in this for what
I can get out of it,

1305
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,625
and I don't think
I'm getting half enough,

1306
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,407
and we can really make
Lorenz pay off plenty

1307
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,715
if we throw in together.

1308
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,830
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1309
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,387
Come off it, angel.

1310
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,899
I don't know how you got
in with Lorenz's crowd,

1311
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:53,097
but you're in it up
to your beautiful neck.

1312
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:54,933
I didn't know Lorenz
had a crowd.

1313
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,868
Oh, yes. I forgot.

1314
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,973
You're the little lady
from medicine hat.

1315
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:02,105
It was your twin sister
who was the buyer for
Rogers fifth Avenue.

1316
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,212
Couldn't be that
she held that job

1317
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,514
so that she could conveniently

1318
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:07,105
take trips abroad, could it?

1319
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:08,747
Let's see.

1320
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,812
How many did she make
2 years ago?

1321
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,420
3, wasn't it?

1322
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,662
You must have gone
to a lot of trouble
to find out all this.

1323
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,154
Sometimes it pays to go
to a lot of trouble.

1324
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,256
Rick, I don't know
what you're thinking,

1325
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:25,668
but whatever it is,
you're mistaken.

1326
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:29,095
Yes? In what way
am I mistaken?

1327
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,565
All right, Rick.
I'll tell you.

1328
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,374
Well, well, well.
Look who's here--

1329
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:33,366
the happiness kids.

1330
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:34,697
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Joe.

1331
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:37,241
Pull up a chair, Joe.
Thanks, I will.

1332
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,047
What's that you're knocking
yourselves out with?

1333
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,375
Hey, waiter! I'll have
one of those.

1334
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:44,105
Well, how are we doing?

1335
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,020
All right until this moment.

1336
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,082
Waiter:
Miss Marlow?

1337
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,016
I'm miss Marlow.

1338
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,254
A telephone call.

1339
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:50,949
That's funny.
Who could it be?

1340
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,790
It's easy enough to find out.

1341
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,287
This way, please.

1342
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,229
You know what
I think I'll do, Rick?

1343
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,544
I think I'll take
the train into Panama City,

1344
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,962
and catch a coastline freighter.

1345
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,869
The next boat through here
is 3 or 4 days from now.

1346
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,198
It's a Chinese boat,

1347
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:05,167
and I'm not so keen
on taking a Chinese boat.

1348
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,095
So I figure I'll be saving
time in the long run

1349
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,510
if I catch a coastline freighter

1350
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,972
to Los Angeles or San Francisco

1351
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,579
and make new connections there.

1352
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:12,581
What do you figure on doing?

1353
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,442
Me? I--I
don't know yet.

1354
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:15,861
Why don't you string
along with me?

1355
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,449
We could share a cabin.

1356
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:19,224
That's not
a bad idea, except--

1357
01:10:19,283 --> 01:10:20,983
oh, I get it--
the little lady.

1358
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,890
Can't say that I blame you.
She sure is a swell dish.

1359
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,190
It's too bad about
the Genoa Maru

1360
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,128
not being let through.

1361
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:30,462
She wasn't a bad ship,

1362
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,927
even though you did grab
the only dame on board.

1363
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,296
I got to hand it to you, Rick.

1364
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,334
You sure are a fast worker,
if there ever was one.

1365
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,140
Miss Marlow--
did she go?

1366
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,838
Si, señor.
Just now.

1367
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,550
The party that called--
any name?

1368
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:49,482
No, señor.

1369
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,476
Anything the matter?
No, not a thing.

1370
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:53,148
Where did she go?

1371
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,376
Oh, I get it.

1372
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,351
Do me a favor.

1373
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,760
If she comes back within
the next 10 minutes,

1374
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,117
ask her to phone the hotel.

1375
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,418
Let me know where she'll be.

1376
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,530
You take care of the check.

1377
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,358
Sure thing, Rick.

1378
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,760
Mr. Leland.

1379
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,501
Has miss Marlow come back?

1380
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,736
No. There's
something for you.

1381
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:12,741
Dr. Lorenz?

1382
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:13,972
Upstairs.

1383
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:14,967
Any calls for him?

1384
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,268
No call.

1385
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,140
Hey, Sam. Give me
a passkey, will you?

1386
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,677
Can do.

1387
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,884
When she gets back,
ring twice, her room.

1388
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:23,946
Will do.

1389
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,042
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Leland.

1390
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,638
Oh, that's all right.

1391
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,380
Has your search
revealed anything?

1392
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:31,445
Yes.
You'd be surprised

1393
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,345
how little
girls wear these days.

1394
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,717
I was shocked.

1395
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:36,524
It's 5:05,
Mr. Leland.

1396
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,986
I believe
you said 5:00.

1397
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,985
You're a little fast.

1398
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,287
But anyway.

1399
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,599
I would consider it
prudent of you,

1400
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:45,788
Mr. Leland,
if you would cease

1401
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,029
your attentions to miss Marlow.

1402
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,256
Why so, doc?

1403
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,531
Your interest in her

1404
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,039
is unqualifiedly
romantic, is it not?

1405
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,771
Between the two of us,
I'm nuts about the lady.

1406
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:59,309
I suggest that you find
a safer romance,

1407
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,375
something more permanent.

1408
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:04,705
And now, Mr. Leland,
the schedule.

1409
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:05,651
Look, doc--

1410
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,515
that is it in the envelope,

1411
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:08,624
isn't it,
Mr. Leland?

1412
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,715
Oh, yes. That's it,
all right.

1413
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,418
1,500.

1414
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,560
Now, hold on.
I know I said 1,500,

1415
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,985
but it cost me that much.

1416
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,460
Almost, anyways.

1417
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,158
I'll only get
a few bucks out of it.

1418
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,399
That's your business.

1419
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:23,125
My business is
to take care of myself.

1420
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,199
How much more do you want?

1421
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:25,497
Let's say 500.

1422
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:26,669
Very well.

1423
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,536
But bear in mind,
Mr. Leland,

1424
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:29,965
that such
extraordinary procedure

1425
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:31,439
doesn't dispose me

1426
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:33,138
towards further dealings
with you.

1427
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,979
You got me all wrong, doc.

1428
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,394
It isn't that I don't
want to play ball.

1429
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,652
I do, but for all I know,

1430
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,824
you'll hand me the 1,500
and wave good-bye.

1431
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,183
I'll be left out in the cold

1432
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,350
with nothing to show for it.

1433
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,618
If I were
on the inside--

1434
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:45,657
I shall have to make out a check

1435
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:47,262
for the 500,
Mr. Leland.

1436
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,233
Then it is a kiss-off.

1437
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,092
For the moment, yes.
Perhaps in time to come--

1438
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,440
look, doc, I've got
another proposition--

1439
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:54,502
sorry. Not interested.

1440
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:58,735
No checks, doc.
I'm a cash-and-carry man.

1441
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:00,742
But, Mr. Leland,
it's after 5:00.

1442
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,114
The banks are closed.

1443
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,311
I'll never be able
to get any such sum.

1444
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:08,083
Well, then, it's no dice.

1445
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,144

bigger than yours.

1448
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,628
You overestimate

1449
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,866
your value to us,
Mr. Leland.

1450
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:30,432
Actually, we have on file

1451
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,370
any information you can give us.

1452
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:34,636

1453
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,244

never at any time

01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:45,602
Yeah. Looks like
you boys

1579
01:26:45,668 --> 01:26:47,468
are planning
to knock over the canal.

1580
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,966
You said it, brother.

1581
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,077
When those
8-foot torpedoes

1582
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,338
hit the Gatun locks,

1583
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:52,417
it'll make the johnstown flood

1584
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:53,511
look like something

1585
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:54,836
that happened in a bathroom.

1586
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,910
Don't be too sure, Joe.

1587
01:26:55,978 --> 01:26:58,248
Maybe your plane will
never reach the locks.

1588
01:26:58,314 --> 01:26:59,654
Maybe you overlooked something.

1589
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,215
Could you suggest anything, sir,

1590
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:03,494
that we might have overlooked?

1591
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,292
What about your getaway?

1592
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:07,724
We have a rendezvous
with an undersea boat.

1593
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:10,160
I think you'll discover,
captain, that nothing--

1594
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,225
absolutely nothing--
has been left to chance.

1595
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:13,925
[Thump]

1596
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:33,553
Maybe you're right, doc.
It seems you are.

1597
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:34,876
Would you mind telling me

1598
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,890
how you got the plane
and torpedo parts

1599
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,122
into the canal-zone area?

1600
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,056
Not at all--
piece by piece

1601
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:40,962
and bit by bit.

1602
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:42,123
We brought them in cases

1603
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,860
of otherwise-innocent
farm equipment,

1604
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:47,596
addressed to "D. Morton,
bountiful plantation."

1605
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:48,463
D. Morton?

1606
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:50,871
Mr. Marlow,
alias D. Morton.

1607
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,643
Her father.

1608
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,741
Where do you figure in all this?

1609
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:57,213
I don't, Rick.
I never did.

1610
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,672
I told you that, remember?

1611
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,541
I didn't know what
was going on down here.

1612
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,849
I felt that something was wrong.

1613
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,280
His letters were so strange.

1614
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:04,906
I wrote him that
I would come down.

1615
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,280
He said that I shouldn't,
that I might be followed.

1616
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,390
Then I got a telegram
to go to Halifax

1617
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:11,252
and take the Genoa mar...

1618
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,600
I was going to tell you
this afternoon

1619
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,961
when I got the telephone call.

1620
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,722
It was father.
He said to come quickly

1621
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,161
and to make sure
that I wasn't followed.

1622
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,056
That's why I left the way I did.

1623
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:22,804
Nice timing, doc.

1624
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,495
I take my hat off to you.

1625
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:25,897
Thank you, sir.

1626
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:29,138
Americans are famous
for good sportsmanship.

1627
01:28:29,204 --> 01:28:30,614
Tell me, captain,

1628
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,173
would your attitude
remain the same--

1629
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,580
impersonal, objective--

1630
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,512
were you to know that Smith,
Mr. a.V. Smith,

1631
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:38,949
was unable to act
on your last words?

1632
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,024
Stay put, Rick.

1633
01:28:40,082 --> 01:28:41,482
I see the knowledge
does affect you.

1634
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,890
[Airplane engines starting]

1635
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,551
It's nothing, captain.
Nothing at all.

1636
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,990
They're only tuning up
the motors.

1637
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,194
We have a few minutes yet.

1638
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,456
You better sit down, Rick.

1639
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,772
What do you want?

1640
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,102
I want--

1641
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,668
pathetic, is he not, sir?

1642
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:04,467
There's a rugged individual.
Look at him!

1643
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,110
Eyes without focus.
Flesh without feeling.

1644
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,906
Lips with no tongue.
Utter decay.

1645
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,019
He stinks.

1646
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:14,321
Mr. Marlow is a thief--

1647
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:16,693
a lazy, comfortable,
drunken thief.

1648
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:18,552
He absconded with
his company's funds,

1649
01:29:18,621 --> 01:29:19,961
escaped to Panama with his loot,

1650
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,862
assumed another identity,
felt conscience-stricken.

1651
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:25,385
Mr. Marlow's dipsomania
enabled us

1652
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:27,901
to introduce our nationals
into his employ

1653
01:29:27,963 --> 01:29:30,403
under the guise of workers
and servants.

1654
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:32,436
In due time,
he became a prisoner on

1655
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:35,171
rather than the master
of this plantation.

1656

[Speaking Japanese]

1657
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:39,711
Get up!
Get up!

Lorenz: His
imperial highness

the prince Gazuo
Takemitsu Inoue.

1662
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,490
Yeah. We've met before.

1663
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,500
You the pilot, oki?

1664
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:00,612
His highness asked permission

1665
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:01,699
from the emperor himself

1666
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:03,134
to perform this mission.

1667
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,468
As you see, captain Leland,
I, too, was only kidding.

[Speaking Japanese]

1669
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,880
They have no wish to kill you,

1670
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:17,754
captain Leland, unless...

1671
01:30:17,813 --> 01:30:20,223
Ok, doc, I'll be good.

1674
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:32,359
You can sit down now, folks.

1675
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,827
Nobody's going anywhere.

1676
01:30:41,203 --> 01:30:44,143
You guys been looking
for a war, haven't you?

1677
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:45,306
That's right, Rick.

1678
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:46,783
That's why we're starting it.

1679
01:30:46,842 --> 01:30:50,352
You may start it, Joe,
but we'll finish it.

1680
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:52,312
We'll see, Rick.

1681

[Airplane engines]

1682
01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:56,123
Don't get nervous, Rick.

1683
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:59,194
I might lose control of this.

1684
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:04,428
You know something, angel?

1685
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:05,893
Miss Marlow: What?

1686
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,431
Wish you'd stayed
in medicine hat.

1687
01:31:08,497 --> 01:31:09,827

Now, take it easy, angel.

1693
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,696
Have you seen Lorenz?

1694
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:02,038
Yes. He was running
toward the house.

1696
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:30,731
Go ahead.

1697
01:34:34,837 --> 01:34:36,797
What's the matter, doc.
Haven't you got the nerve?

1698
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:39,736
You're a soldier, sir.

1699
01:34:39,808 --> 01:34:41,738
I appeal to you.

1700

Bullet. Here.

1701
01:34:44,546 --> 01:34:45,846
Some other time.

1702
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:48,554
I ask you again.

1703
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:50,186
Do me the honor.

1704
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:51,152
No, I can't do it.

1705
01:34:51,219 --> 01:34:53,389
You got a date with
army intelligence.

1706
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:04,471
Come on, doc.

1707
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,637
You know, you're
a great disappointment to me

1708
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:15,939
after that big speech you made

1709
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:18,211
about weakness and decay.

1710
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,262
Right on time, eh, doc?

01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:31,955
