B, I, M...

10
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,093
Cover your right eye.

11
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,902
Enough.

12
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,955
Fit to serve.

13
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,061
- Can I go?
- Sure, there's no use sitting here.

14
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,587
Comrade Major, where will we be stationed?

15
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,557
Wherever your country sends you.

16
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,891
Hands up. Down.

17
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,597
Rotate. Good.

18
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,234
Do a sit-up.

19
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,373
- Does it hurt?
- No.

20
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,040
- Stand still.
- It tickles.

21
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,581
Wake up, guys!

22
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,201
Here is your grenade!

23
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,332
Thanks.

24
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,016
- Commander, I'm back!
- At last.

25
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,646
I've been waiting.

26
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,987
To your health!

27
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,799
Why are they shouting?

28
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,839
Stop.

29
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,645
Non-Russians, halt!

30
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,117
Halt, I said!

31
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,391
We have been ambushed! Action!

32
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,158
Get down!

33
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,798
Hurry up, run!

34
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,005
Damn it!

35
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,585
Alex got hit!

36
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,874
Abdul...

37
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,812
you wanted one Russian and got two.

38
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,672
Finish one off.

39
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,452
And if the first croaks?

Dina, bring some water!

54
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,370
Did any of our men make it?

55
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,507
Nobody.

56
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,985
Did you shoot?

57
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,686
Did not get a chance.

58
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,891
What is your name, again?

59
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,567
Private Gilin.

60
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,765
You are a rotten soldier, Private Gilin.

61
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,946
Wow!

62
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,875
You want to puke?

63
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,018
Not really.

64
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,687
Lucky devil.

65
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,288
I got a...

66
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,754
concussion.

67
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,806
See what is going on out there.

68
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,354
Hasan, check the prisoners.

69
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,589
Go fuck yourself.

70
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,470
Praise Allah! They are alive.
Bring the shackles.

71
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,515
Bastards!

72
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,680
You'll pay for this.

73
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,591
Dina, bring some water.

74
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,693
They have pigs' blood.

75
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,360
Dirty bastards.

76
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,668
- Comrade Sergeant?
- Keep pouring.

77
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,955
Can you help me now?

78
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,752
No.

79
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,394
Can I ask you something?

80
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,731
Shut up.

81
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,514
Father, are you hungry?

82
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,419
I will fix something.

83
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,401
Sure, we could sit in silence.

84
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,403
What?

85
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,280
When I'm sitting and thinking...

86
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,949
don't fucking bug me!

87
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,091
I forgot. What is your name?

88
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,061
Gilin...

89
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,696
Vanya.

90
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,474
Being on a chain with me, Vanya,
will be fucking tough on you.

91
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,950
<i>We're the children of the mountains</i>

92
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,597
<i>We have been here for years</i>

93
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,198
<i>The wind</i>

94
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:21,204
<i>frightens the heart</i>

95
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,873
<i>of any stranger here</i>

96
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,557
<i>Nobody understands us</i>

97
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,961
<i>The mountains will protect us</i>

98
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,172
<i>The wind frightens the heart</i>

99
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,138
<i>of any stranger here</i>

100
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,947
<i>"Dear Mom, this is my first letter.</i>

101
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,450
"We have sea on one side
and mountains on the other.

102
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,820
"Everything is okay with me.

103
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,062
"Do not worry.

104
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,497
"Your loving son, lvan."

105
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,035
Such a short letter.

106
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,389
Got a cigarette?

107
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,334
I get it.

108
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
If you are waiting for the john...

109
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,478
tough luck.

110
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,416
It'll take a while.

111
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,388
Souvenir.

112
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,598
How was it?

113
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,451
Why did he bring these Russians
to the village?

114
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,057
I want to talk to him.

115
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,518
You know how he is...

116
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,125
always hardheaded.

117
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,310
Hey, old bandits!

118
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,952
What's up?

119
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,948
What did you shoot them with?

120
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,357
- Who?
- Our men.

121
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,786
With every kind of weapon.

122
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,862
Keep those Russians away from the village!

123
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,860
What are they going to do?

124
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,200
Kill us?

125
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,402
I don't think so.

126
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,608
These chains cost money, stupid.

127
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,406
They'll sell us.

128
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,077
Give us some bread, please!

129
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,277
We're starving.

130
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,364
How much did you pay for the soldiers?

131
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,266
Nothing. Osman was sure they would die.

132
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,882
Don't keep the Russians here.

133
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,219
Everybody wants you to kill them.

134
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,951
I had no choice.

135
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,521
My son is in prison in town.

136
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,830
I brought money to buy my son back...

137
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,604
but the Commander was afraid to take it.

138
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,242
I'll trade these Russians...

139
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,574
for my son...

140
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,383
in two days.

141
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,587
Don't let them...

142
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,959
pull a fast one on you.

143
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,587
It's better...

144
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,427
if you kill them.

145
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,768
If they try to trick me, I'll suck their blood.

146
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,373
Sergeant?

147
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,249
I don't understand.

148
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,620
Who will want to buy us?

149
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,382
You? Nobody will.

150
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,788
The Commander will pay for me, though.

151
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,490
It's my third war with him.

152
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,626
But who needs you?

153
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,232
I can learn how to kill, too.

154
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,409
It's too late.

155
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,680
To tell you the truth, they can't afford it.

156
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,315
Our army is too poor...

157
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,250
to pay for both of us.

158
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,695
What about me?

159
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,093
They'll kill you.

160
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,970
Please, wait as long as you can...

161
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,278
before telling my mom.

162
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,657
Okay, I'll make a deal.

163
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,494
They'll pay for you, too.

164
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,732
That will be a little bit expensive, though.

165
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,303
By the way...

166
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,335
there's a little detail I forgot to mention.

167
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,069
Say good-bye to your balls.

168
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,305
What do you mean?

169
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,379
These guys don't think twice.
They just cut your balls off.

170
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,854
Have you ever fucked someone?

171
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,728
- Sure.
- Why worry then?

172
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,798
You already had a good time.

173
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,169
- Still, it's too bad.
- "Too bad."

174
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,843
I've had enough of you!

175
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,839
"Too bad."

176
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,953
By the way, my name is Sasha Sly.

177
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,850
I get it.

178
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,182
What do you get?

179
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,434
<i>Report your altitude.</i>

180
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,669
<i>200 meters.</i>

181
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,941
<i>Going along the river, everything is quiet.</i>

182
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,705
<i>Get to 500 and proceed to the site.</i>

183
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,276
<i>Roger. Get to 500 and proceed to the site.</i>

184
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,248
<i>How does it look?</i>

185
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,187
<i>Looks normal.</i>

186
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:43,398
I met a girl in town last week.

187
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,873
We went to her house,
had some champagne.

188
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,847
I had my condom on...

189
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,749
when she suddenly falls asleep.

190
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,784
I couldn't wake her up, she was out cold.

191
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,519
I ran over to her neighbors.

192
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,659
They said she gets those
lethargic spells sometimes.

193
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,862
Then what happened?

194
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,763
I took off the condom...

195
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,964
and returned to base.

196
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,971
Did she ever wake up?

197
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,572
How should I know?

198
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,177
They sleep for years sometimes.

199
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,361
Where is the sack?

200
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,671
Put your hands behind your back.

201
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,810
Walk straight ahead.

202
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,780
If you hear any shots...

203
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,551
roll over to the rock...

204
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,213
and don't move.

205
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,447
Yes, sir.

206
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,417
Stay alert. Still a half hour to go.

207
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,402
I can't believe they'll trade us.

208
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,037
Don't count on it.

209
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,402
They got no choice.

210
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,107
We might even get a vacation.

211
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,812
For what?

212
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,621
We'll say we captured...

213
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,119
five guerrilla fighters.

214
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,757
And where are they?

215
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,923
They escaped.

216
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,163
Make it 10, then.

217
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,837
Sounds better.

218
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,478
What if they're really holding
two of our men?

219
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,405
They never take prisoners.

220
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,014
- It doesn't look good.
- Why?

221
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,648
Shut up.

222
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,464
Did you kill them?

223
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,193
Where are they?

224
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,235
Those bastards didn't even bring my son!

225
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,825
I'll give you one last chance.

226
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,491
Write your mothers...

227
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,636
to come to the Commander...

228
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,871
and trade you for my son.

229
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,305
And no tricks!

230
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,878
I won't write.

231
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,976
Write, or I'll cut your throat.

232
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,385
The watch doesn't work again.

233
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,221
What did I tell you?

234
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,032
Get me some matches in town...

235
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,629
neighbor!

236
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,170
You had better marry again.
Your daughter needs a woman's care.

237
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,945
- These Russians are dangerous.
- It's none of your business!

238
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,255
You're a fool.

239
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:03,516
Dead Patima was the fool
when she agreed to come into your house!

240
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,502
Who are your parents?

241
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,005
Mom's an actress, and Dad is a general.

242
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,647
Where do they live?

243
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,519
In the north.

244
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,414
That's far away.

245
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,820
And yours?

246
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,820
I have no father. Mother is a teacher.

247
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,694
She will surely come.

248
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,328
How do you spell "deodorant"?

249
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,098
D-E-O-D-O-R-A-N-T.

250
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,747
I want them to send me a package.

251
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,248
Do you need anything?

252
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,416
- No.
- That's all, then.

253
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,892
Stop!

254
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,830
Papers!

255
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,836
- Where are you going?
- To the Commander.

256
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,598
How long does the mail take?

257
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,241
About 10 days.

258
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,954
- Who empties the postbox?
- Him.

259
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,028
I do.

260
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,229
Come with me.

261
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,536
- Make sure they get there.
- Don't worry.

262
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,553
- Hello, Uncle Boris.
- Hello, Uncle Abdul.

263
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,793
What's new? How is your health?

264
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,727
What brought you here?

265
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,003
Do you need your boots repaired?

266
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,301
No, thank you.

267
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,899
- I have a favor to ask.
- Ask.

268
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,774
If a Russian woman asks for me...

269
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,881
tell her how to find me.

270
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,878
I know where to find you.

271
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,084
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

272
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,034
I have a good friend. Will you marry him?

273
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,404
Yes or no?

274
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,137
I will marry him.

275
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,310
Do you have a dowry?

276
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,917
This silver necklace and two Russian slaves.

277
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,482
And dust of three roads...

278
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,957
and a rat's tail!

279
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,963
- No one wants to marry you?
- No.

280
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,992
It's a present...

281
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,564
for you.

282
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,741
Thank you.

283
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,415
It's time to get out of here.

284
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,936
We have to get the chains off, or we'll die.

285
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,803
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up.

286
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,546
That is enough, Hasan.

287
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,746
Let's take a break.

288
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,991
You are not deaf.

289
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,104
What is this "mm-mm"?

290
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,740
Don't you have a tongue?

291
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,772
Did they cut your tongue off?

292
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,711
And your balls, too?

293
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,959
Gilin, would you rather keep
your balls or your tongue?

294
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,748
Fucking bandit!

295
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,195
He could have killed us.

296
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,713
Good! Here comes lunch.

297
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,881
- Why did that man shoot at us?
- He wants to kill you.

298
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,452
We are not too popular here.

299
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,198
Two of his sons died in the war.
The third works for the Russian police.

300
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,975
- Who cut out Hasan's tongue?
- Russians.

301
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,147
Of course, Russians.

302
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,555
His wife left him for a geologist.

303
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,422
Hasan went after her...

304
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,993
found her and killed her.

305
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,200
He served time in prison in Siberia.

306
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,069
But he couldn't keep his mouth shut.

307
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,640
So they cut his tongue out.

308
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,112
He loves to sing.

309
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,247
Is he your relative?

310
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,146
His wife was my sister.

311
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,629
I hear you loved to sing.

312
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,532
So sing for us, why don't you?

313
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,035
I will sing along.

314
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,910
I've heard the tune before.

315
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,018
But I can't remember the words. Do you?

316
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,160
Why are you sad?

317
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,434
Father said if your mothers
are not here within 10 days...

318
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,502
he will kill you.

319
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,814
They will come.

320
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,247
You are a good man, Hasan.

321
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,894
Why don't you let us go?

322
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,171
<i>"Dear Mom, I've been captured.</i>

323
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,642
<i>"Don't worry.</i>

324
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,878
<i>"Abdul Murat wants to trade us for his son.</i>

325
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,344
<i>"He treats us well.</i>

326
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,216
<i>"But if you can, come here soon.</i>

327
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,892
<i>"Don't tell anyone about my letter. "</i>

328
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,507
Abdul, you have kept the Russians too long.

329
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,137
I know.

330
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,338
People don't approve of you.

331
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,786
Sasha, my mom will get the letter.

332
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,794
And then what?

333
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,196
Then you will get a screwdriver up your ass.

334
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,138
Would you come back here?

335
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,562
No.

336
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,139
I would come back.

337
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,274
In new camouflage.

338
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:02,683
You'll have your flame thrower...

339
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,652
and I'll have my submachine gun.

340
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,017
We'll enter this courtyard...

341
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,788
Abdul and Hasan will come to meet us...

342
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,556
and they will remain forever
in that courtyard.

343
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,862
The girl will invite us into the house.

344
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,462
We have never been inside the house.

345
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,933
I don't want to kill them.

346
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,075
You have to, Vanya.

347
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:32,810
It's war.

348
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,664
She waits on the two Russians.

349
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,763
Keeps bringing them water.

350
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,814
If you say that again, you will be sorry.

351
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,074
What's going on?

352
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,627
Sasha, let me go to the window.

353
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,397
Now what do you want?

354
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,872
You're always in my face!

355
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,602
- I want to look out the window.
- Do whatever you want!

356
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,274
What's so interesting out there?

357
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,671
Why are you such a psycho?

358
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,286
It's my birthday today.

359
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,980
Happy birthday!

360
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,521
Maybe we should try to get out of here.

361
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,926
I'm ready.

362
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,468
Fuck!

363
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,489
- I think that's it.
- I see that.

364
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,015
What do you like, red or white?

365
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,263
- I prefer vodka.
- Right.

366
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,234
I have a great idea.

367
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,872
After the war, we open a bar here.

368
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,108
We will call it "Hasan's Bar."

369
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,514
God, it stinks here.

370
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,990
I joined the army because I was stupid...

371
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,325
Ioved guns, and needed money.

372
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,729
Then I began...

373
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,566
to like it.

374
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,067
Everyone told me I should be an actor.

375
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,036
I am very talented.

376
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,882
The Bolshoi Theatre
invited me to play Hamlet.

377
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,316
Look what else I found.

378
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,056
We won't get out of here today.

379
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,154
I'm totally fucked up.

380
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,929
I will get you out of here.

381
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,915
Hasan, come here. Let's have a drink.

382
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:43,382
- It's against their traditions.
- Then why are these bottles here?

383
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,155
Drink, or we will be upset!

384
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,472
I never thought you would do it.

385
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,100
What a surprise!

386
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,844
Can you dance, Hasan?

387
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,284
Watch us while we're still alive!

388
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,139
Vanya, are you a soldier?

389
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,345
At attention!

390
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,086
Draw your swords!

391
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,892
Here, I fixed it.

392
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,934
It really works.

393
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,087
<i>If our country calls us all as one</i>

394
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,155
<i>we will go to war</i>

395
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,556
<i>And we will fight to the last drop of blood</i>

396
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,326
<i>for our homeland</i>

397
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,805
Hit me.

398
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,382
Look me in the eye.

399
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,115
You have to yell louder, Vanya.

400
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,759
My mom probably got the letter...

401
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,124
and is on her way.

402
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,330
Maybe so.

403
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,670
When I was 4...

404
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,771
I fell into an abandoned well.

405
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:34,278
Everybody looked for me,
but it was my mom who found me.

406
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,618
She cried all day.

407
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,851
Then she spent the next week...

408
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,496
filling up the well with sand.

409
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,064
Can you imagine that?

410
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,566
She's so emotional.

411
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,603
What about yours?

412
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,514
Who knows? She might be.

413
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,782
I am from an orphanage.

414
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,153
Who did you write the letter to?

415
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,960
To the cook.

416
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,427
What a gal!

417
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,328
Died 15 years ago.
Otherwise, she would have come.

418
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:31,035
She fell and her head split open.
Just like that.

419
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,669
Come on.

420
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,541
You think I'm lying?

421
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,882
Why didn't you tell me before?

422
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm telling you now.

423
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,580
Where did you get this bird?

424
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,418
Ivan gave it to me.

425
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,156
Is living with me so hard?

426
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,166
Do you know that I love you?

427
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,005
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

428
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,121
My son is here in prison.

429
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,723
I must see the Commander. Get him.

430
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,672
They are bandits.

431
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,766
You think I didn't try to arrange a trade?

432
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:49,838
I did.

433
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,710
I took a platoon, a helicopter...

434
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:56,441
but they never showed up.

435
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:01,857
They didn't want to trade.
They wanted to ambush us.

436
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,786
You think I'll let you and the prisoner...

437
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,956
go for a stroll, arm in arm?

438
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,662
They'll dupe you.

439
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,343
You can't trust anyone here,
not even children.

440
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,411
Soldiers traded grenades for hash...

441
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,983
and kids threw the grenades back at them.

442
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,479
Calm down. Mother!

443
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,987
Try to understand.
We have casualties every day.

444
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,211
How do I get to Soviet Street?

445
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,544
- Hello.
- Hello. Please sit down.

446
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,379
You need your shoes repaired?

447
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,546
No, thank you. I'm looking for Abdul Murat.

448
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,423
I know him.

449
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,325
Come here.

450
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,626
Take her to the teahouse.

451
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,304
Abdul Murat will find you there.

452
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,270
Thank you. Good-bye.

453
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,853
Give me two bottles of vodka.

454
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,361
Soldier...

455
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,462
give me the money.

456
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,141
Keep the change.

457
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,270
Where are your prisoners?

458
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,648
Don't you know our laws?

459
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,978
They are mine.

460
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,749
Those are your laws. These are mine.

461
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,518
Give me the prisoners!

462
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,118
Take out the prisoners.

463
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,828
Hasan...

464
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,324
take them out.

465
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,208
Move!

466
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,846
You look familiar to me.

467
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,190
Recognize me now?

468
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,588
Move.

469
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,691
I remember.

470
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,500
Give me the rifle.

471
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:26,951
Why don't you ask me
where they are taking us...

472
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,781
what they will do with us?

473
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,863
It figures. Probably nothing good.

474
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,511
Keep walking.

475
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,758
There are Russian mines here.

476
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,057
Go find them.

477
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,756
But it's dark.

478
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,103
Go, or I will shoot you.

479
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:17,966
Abdul...

480
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,207
take off the chains or we will blow up!

481
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,735
The keys are at home.

482
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,393
They will blow up.

483
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,635
Who cares? We need to get through.

484
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,707
Quiet.

485
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,258
It's here.

486
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,528
Is that all?

487
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,094
No.

488
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,400
It's only the first one.

489
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,207
Good job!

490
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,680
Take it.

491
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,188
Well, guys...

492
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,593
I was sure you would blow to pieces.

493
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,191
It's your second birthday.

494
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,957
Drink, relax, be my guests.

495
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:32,438
Nobody touches you. My word.

496
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:23,248
Kid! You want to wrestle my nephew?

497
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,520
Let me.

498
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,955
You are old. Let's see the young one.

499
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,596
Take off his chains.

500
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,856
What should I do?

501
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,164
Yell louder.

502
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,056
Come here!

503
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,901
Come on.

504
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,216
I give up! Take him away!

505
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,644
- For you.
- Thank you.

506
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,515
They make a beautiful sound.

507
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,392
It's my grandmother's. It's very old.

508
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,759
Wolf faces, horns...

509
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:33,207
apple seeds...

510
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,735
poppy buds.

511
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,511
You are very pretty.

512
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,380
Dina.

513
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,451
Go home.

514
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:57,123
Take care of the house.
I will be back tomorrow.

515
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,572
The Russian's mother wants to meet you.

516
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,374
I told her to wait.

517
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,560
45...

518
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,496
46...

519
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,836
47...

520
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,772
48...

521
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,338
Turn it up.

522
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,012
...49.

523
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,306
Wake me up in an hour.

524
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,760
Tell me where we will meet.

525
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,395
I will tell you when everything is ready.

526
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,332
I know your son is a teacher.
I am a teacher, too.

527
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,504
It doesn't matter now.

528
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,434
We are enemies.

529
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,347
I understand.

530
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,248
But can I trust you?

531
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,587
You have no choice.

532
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,134
I could only open one lock.

533
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,401
We'll figure it out later.

534
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,099
Just in case.

535
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,191
I have a son in Chita. He's not well.

536
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,601
I send him money.
The Commander will give you the address.

537
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,936
All right.

538
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,603
Private Gilin, good luck.

539
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,671
Give it to me!

540
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,038
Let's go.

541
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,628
- How are the nuts?
- Fine.

542
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,411
Watching after a herd with one bullet!

543
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,369
It looks so old.

544
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,013
Can it fire?

545
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,181
Better than a new one.

546
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:02,183
Put it down before anything happens.

547
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,760
I didn't do anything.

548
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,567
Remind me never to run off with you again.

549
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,266
Don't turn around.

550
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,664
Sanya!

551
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:21,970
Shut up!

552
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,172
Put the rifle on the ground.

553
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,904
Put your hands behind your head.

554
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,113
Who killed the shepherd?

555
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,608
I did.

556
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,593
Take the young one back to Abdul.

557
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,797
I'll take the other one.

558
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,431
Gilin!

559
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,185
Thank you.

560
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,027
Don't come here anymore.

561
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,322
Why not?

562
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,861
Ask the old lady, your neighbor.

563
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:25,990
Why?

564
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,736
Because it stinks here.

565
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:37,444
You are like a dog now.
It's not a shame for a dog to smell bad.

566
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,848
Were you cold last night?

567
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,040
Yes.

568
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,385
Luckily, it didn't rain.

569
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,982
It won't rain today.

570
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,315
Lots of fireflies are out tonight.

571
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,624
So, did you get married yet?

572
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,027
No.

573
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,059
I would marry you.

574
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,859
We cannot marry.

575
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,933
I can get married next year.

576
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,143
We marry early here.

577
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,609
Did you like that?

578
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,527
How are you doing?

579
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:48,769
Pretty shitty.

580
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,238
How about you?

581
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,270
What about me?

582
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:56,605
I'm dead.

583
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,070
But I like it.

584
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,807
Everything is peaceful now.

585
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,078
Sanya.

586
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,217
How will I make it without you?

587
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,786
You can come with me.

588
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,556
No, thanks.

589
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:17,797
As you wish.

590
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,840
By the way, I forgot again.
What's your name?

591
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,393
Are you the Russian who fixes clocks?

592
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,532
Or is he the one who is already dead?

593
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,038
I'm the one.

594
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,037
Can you fix my clock?

595
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,050
I won't have the time.

596
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,186
What kind of life is this?

597
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,485
Nobody has time to fix clocks.

598
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,228
Stop.

599
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,765
Papers?

600
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,076
Where are you going?

601
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,774
To see my son. He's a policeman here.

602
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,614
All right.

603
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,300
Hello. I brought the money.

604
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,397
This one.

605
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:36,967
Over here.

606
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:39,803
Stay here.

607
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,573
Really good caviar.

608
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,279
Fishermen brought it.

609
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,550
I'll tell you what else is good here.

610
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,151
Lots of fruit.

611
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:04,431
Yes, we have many different fruits.

612
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,561
But I don't want to live here.

613
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,027
Nobody likes us here.

614
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,901
And after this war...

615
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,067
they will like us even less.

616
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,872
Who likes each other in a war?

617
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,108
You call this a war?

618
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,507
Attack, retreat.

619
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,574
Make peace, make war.

620
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,517
No army can take this.

621
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:34,820
- What do you want?
- I want to see my son, Mamed.

622
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:36,191
Wait here.

623
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,437
The old man here says he's Mamed's father.

624
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,773
Send him in!

625
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,771
Mamed, take charge of the prisoners.

626
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,349
There's one guy I want to keep aside.

627
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,146
Two of our men have been taken hostage.

628
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:01,716
The mother of one of them came here
and says she's made a deal.

629
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,121
Let her try. Sometimes it works.

630
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,658
How are you, Father?

631
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:12,727
Get him!

632
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,663
Everybody get down!

633
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,663
Mother, get out of the way!

634
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:21,967
Stop!

635
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,678
Where are you going?

636
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,015
Get the others into the van!

637
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,078
Shoot, or he'll escape!

638
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,258
I have bad news, Abdul.

639
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,519
Your son is dead.

640
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:43,557
My brother, Dzarahmat, is dead.

641
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,956
You have one more night to live.

642
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,355
Help me.

643
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,392
I cannot. You have to die.

644
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,765
I don't want to.

645
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,975
Usually they throw the enemy's body
to the jackals.

646
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:05,909
But I will bury yours.

647
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,249
Bring me the key. Nobody's here.

648
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,120
I will dig a wide grave for you.

649
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,088
And you will see...

650
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,586
the Angel of Death.

651
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,094
I'll put my necklace in the grave...

652
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,333
as your wedding gift.

653
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:34,336
Maybe your soul will find a bride in heaven.

654
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,336
I don't think so.

655
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,427
Don't cry, Mother.

656
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:39,168
We'll make them pay, I promise.

657
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,171
Are you glad to see me?

658
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:46,464
Yes.

659
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,132
Don't kill any more people, promise?

660
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,693
Hurry!

661
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,566
Go! Don't stay here.

662
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,766
I can't.

663
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:25,074
They'll never forgive you for helping me.

664
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,263
Come here.

665
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:52,595
Don't kill him.

666
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:58,504
Why aren't you crying over your brother?

667
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:02,413
They killed him. Now I'll kill this Russian.

668
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,446
Go home!

669
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,486
Let's go.

670
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:02,400
Keep walking, and don't look back.

671
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:35,367
Vanya, what's the matter with you?
Look back!

672
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,532
I'm here!

673
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:47,165
Stop!

674
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:51,242
Don't do it!

675
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:27,277
<i>When it was over,</i>
<i>I spent two weeks in the hospital.</i>

676
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:30,439
<i>Then I was discharged and sent home.</i>

677
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,578
<i>Mom cried all the way home.</i>

678
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:37,185
<i>She kept telling the woman next to her...</i>

679
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:39,118
<i>how lucky she was.</i>

680
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,754
<i>I want to see them in my dreams...</i>

681
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,522
<i>all those people whom I grew to love...</i>

682
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,624
<i>and will never meet again.</i>

683
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:50,900
<i>But they just won't come to me.</i>
