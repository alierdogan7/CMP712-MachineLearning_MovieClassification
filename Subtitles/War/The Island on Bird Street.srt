Now you don't have
your mezuza for protection.

110

Snow.

716
01:35:45,787 --> 01:35:47,152
Goodbye, Snow.

717
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:09,466
[slow pounding]

718
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:34,926
[softly]
Alex.

719
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:47,872
<i>Alex.</i>

720
01:37:55,149 --> 01:37:58,585
[indistinct noise]

721
01:38:15,203 --> 01:38:16,636
Alex?

722
01:38:18,573 --> 01:38:20,006
Dad?

723
01:38:23,444 --> 01:38:24,536
Are you real?

724
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:31,448
Yes.
I'm real.

725
01:38:58,112 --> 01:38:59,670
(Alex)
I knew you'd come.

726
01:39:05,453 --> 01:39:08,422
<i>(Alex) At first, it
seemed like a mirage.</i>

727
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:11,458
<i>A strange sort of
shimmering on the horizon.</i>

728
01:39:11,525 --> 01:39:16,986
<i>Slowly, bit by bit, it
got closer and clearer.</i>

729
01:39:17,064 --> 01:39:20,261
<i>Then, there it was.</i>

730
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:22,302
<i>The most beautiful ship.</i>

731
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:26,306
<i>Full sail, with
all its flags flying.</i>

732
01:39:26,374 --> 01:39:29,866
<i>It was coming
to my island.</i>

733
01:39:29,944 --> 01:39:32,344
<i>Coming to my rescue.</i>

734
01:39:32,413 --> 01:39:35,177
<i>It was going to
take me home.</i>

735
01:39:56,971 --> 01:39:59,997
<i>[classical music]</i>
