the year of '48,
when I rose with comrades brave and true.

1573
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:14,259
It's...

1574
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:20,056
I was hunted through the hills by slaves
who served a foreign queen.

♪ (ALL CONTINUE SINGING "SKIBBEREEN") ♪

1576
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:39,284
Say it to me, kid.

1577
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:40,785
Put it away, Joe.

1578
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:42,704
BOY: Who the fuck are you?

1579
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:44,623
(MICK SCOFFS)

1580
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:47,709
Who the fuck am I?

1581
01:56:48,043 --> 01:56:49,586
(CHUCKUNG)

1582
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:52,631
I'm the fucker that asked to meet Dev.

1583
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:54,424
And who's Dev when he's at home?

1584
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:55,884
And who are you?

1585
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:57,594
Huh?

1586
01:56:58,386 --> 01:57:01,264
But if I did know this Dev,
what would you say to him?

1587
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:10,106
Tell him that
Harry Boland's death was enough.

1588
01:57:12,234 --> 01:57:15,570
Tell him that Mick Collins says
he wants to stop this bloody mayhem.

1589
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:21,117
Tell him I'm sorry
I didn't bring back the Republic.

1590
01:57:21,493 --> 01:57:23,036
But nobody could have!

1591
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:32,170
He was my chief, always.

1592
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,132
I would have followed him to hell
if he'd asked me.

1593
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:40,262
And maybe I did.

1594
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,938
But it's not worth fighting for anymore.

1595
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,651
We've got to learn to build
with what we have!

1596
01:57:55,944 --> 01:57:57,445
You tell him that.

1597
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:02,200
Where can he find you?

1598
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:03,827
Here.

1599
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:06,746

(GASPS)

1601
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:24,014
So, I take it you heard?

1602
01:58:26,224 --> 01:58:28,351
(GROANS) Jesus, Mick.

1603
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,773
God forgive us, Harry.

1604
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:36,192
Have you got any reply?

1605
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:45,535
He's come all this way.

1606
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:49,164
Be kind of rude not to give him an answer.

1607
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:16,024
Well?

1608
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:17,984
He says he'll meet you tomorrow.

1609
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:20,403
What's wrong with now?

1610
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:22,739
(SCOFFS) His nerves are at him.

1611
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:27,369
Beal na mBléth, there's a farmhouse
to the left on the Bandon side.

1612
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:29,913
Around 12:00.

1613
01:59:31,122 --> 01:59:34,376
Hey kid, what's your name?

1614
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:40,256
Little snot.

1615
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:21,464
Béal na mBléth?

1616
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:38,982
Go, will you!

1617
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:08,344
Should I ask the whole bunch
to the wedding, Joe?

1618
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:10,013
Do you think that'd fix it?

1619
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:12,182
Be a big bloody wedding, Mick.

1620
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:16,895
We'll invite the whole country.
Call it marital diplomacy.

1621
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:19,564
Dev as best man. Lloyd George,

1622

- Winston Churchill as bridesmaids.

- What's up?
'WhYd he stop?

1624
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:49,969
Why'd we stop?

1625
02:01:51,763 --> 02:01:53,056
Roadblock.

<i>Come on!</i>

1630
02:02:04,192 --> 02:02:05,193
How long?

1631
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,611
- LIAM: Two minutes.

They're trying to fucking kill me.
Get down!

1633
02:02:24,712 --> 02:02:26,297
Keep firing!

1634
02:02:28,049 --> 02:02:30,343
Give it to me, give it to me!
Here, get off!

No! Jesus! Mick!

Mick. Aye, Mick.

1638
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:13,428
Come on, talk to me.

1639

No, no, no, Mick. Don't go!

Don't go, don't go on me! Mick!

02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:20,810
Come on, Mick!

1642

Fuck, Jesus, don't go on us, Mick!
Please! Don't!

Miss Kiernan?

02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:52,175
Miss Kiernan? Miss Kiernan!

1646
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:56,721
I'm sorry.

1647
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,767
I just heard.

1648
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,603
I'm sorry.

1649

(SOBBING)

1650
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,401
No!

1651
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:13,279
No!

1652
02:04:17,909 --> 02:04:19,786
<i>JOE". That's why he died, Kitty.</i>

1653
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:23,164
<i>He knew the risk he was taking
when he went down there.</i>

1654
02:04:24,082 --> 02:04:26,209
But he thought them worth taking.

1655
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:29,712
He took them for us.

1656
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:33,299
For every gob-shite in this country,
no matter what side that we're on.

1657
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:38,972
And if he saw you now,
do you know what he'd say?

1658
02:04:41,307 --> 02:04:43,476
"Get up off the parliamentary side
of your arse,

1659
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,895
"and get a bit of color in your face."

1660
02:04:47,522 --> 02:04:50,149
But he would have said it better, Joe.

1661
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:54,570
"No regrets, Kit." That's what he'd say.
