2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,560
He looks like me.

3
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,170
Precisely like you.

4
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,550
I have impersonated you for a
long time but he is a miracle.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,960
Where did you find him?

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,670
At the execution grounds.

7
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,420
The execution grounds?

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,930
He was going to be crucified.

9
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,940
I thought he would be
useful as a double for you.

10
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,380
What did he do?

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,720
They found him sneaking around
the grounds. He's a thief.

12
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,160
A thief?

13
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,730
And a tough one. Torture
failed to make him talk.

14
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,530
Possibly, aside from
stealing, he's also killed.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,520
What did the prosecutors say
about his resemblance to me?

16
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,820
Nothing.

17
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,860
Only I, your brother,
could see it from the first.

18
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,930
His hair, clothes, the way
he talks... all so different.

19
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,440
No one has the least idea of
his resemblance to our lord.

20
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,760
Even I, who recognized
the resemblance,

21
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,300
am doubly amazed at the likeness
once we dressed him like you.

22
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,250
Where is he from?

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,660
As you see,

24
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,970
he is very much like you.

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,170
Our father might have
had a son somewhere else.

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,380
But do not fear.
He is a drifter from the north.

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,120
He could not be our half brother.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,900
Even with this resemblance, Nobukado,

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,530
he is so wicked as to be
sentenced to crucifixion.

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,800
How could this scoundrel
be my double?

31
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,720
I only stole a few coins. I'm petty thief.

32
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,490
But you've killed hundreds

33
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,030
and robbed whole domains.

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,080
Who is wicked?

35
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,050
You or I?

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,280
I was going to be crucified.

37
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,020
My life could have ended this day.

38
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,840
I am immune to threats.
Boil me! Broil me!

39
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,980
Very well.

40
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,490
Say whatever you want.

41
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,070
If you will not say it, I will.

42
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,900
I am wicked, as you
believe. I am a scoundrel.

43
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,240
I banished my father
and I killed my own son.

44
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,910
I will do anything to rule this country.

45
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,320
War is everywhere.

46
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,520
Unless somebody unifies the
nation and reigns over us,

47
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,660
we will see more rivers of blood

48
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,040
and more mountains of the dead.

49
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
It is cold.

50
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,800
My old wound hurts when the air is cold.

51
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,140
Nobukado, he has spoken
hastily. He might be of some use.

52
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,220
Train him.

53
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,240
KAGEMUSHA (The Double)

54
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,840
In the 16th century,
Japan is torn by war.

55
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,350
Warriors vie for the capital Kyoto,
for the conqueror will rule Japan.

56
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,080
There are three rivals.

57
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,290
Shingen, Nobunaga and Leyasu.

58
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,460
In 1572, Shingen marches toward Kyoto.

59
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,610
We've cut the waterway into the castle.

60
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,790
The castle will soon fall.

61
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,700
I hope so.

62
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,330
We have had it surrounded for 20 days.

63
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,640
I don't think the enemy
leader will surrender soon.

64
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,040
Someone plays the flute every night.

65
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,070
And he plays well.

66
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,410
Our men are impressed. They
like to hear it at night.

67
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,390
Listen!

68
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,660
We must let my father know
we've cut the aqueduct.

69
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,700
Lord Shingen, your father, is here.

70
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,240
Except for us chief vassals,

71
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,710
not only the enemy, but our own
men believe the lord is here.

72
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,440
It is needless to
send messengers to him.

73
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,190
Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here.

74
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,700
Send him in.

75
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,280
Leave us alone.

76
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,930
My lord.

77
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,970
I'm angry.

78
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,990
Asakura sent me a message.
He is returning to his fief.

79
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,520
His men are weary and it is mid winter.

80
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,160
The enemy is also tired.

81
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,070
If Asakura retreats,

82
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,700
Nobunaga will reinforce
Leyasu and block my way.

83
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,440
Asakura's retreat is treason against me.

84
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,150
How old are you, sire?

85
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,420
- 53, as I remember.
- Why?

86
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,330
And you still behave like
a five-year-old child.

87
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,770
People gather, scatter.

88
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,240
They go left and right
following their interests.

89
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:53,010
That is not surprising. But
then I find you like this.

90
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,560
With such a narrow mind, you
must not dream of rulership.

91
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,460
Go back to your own domain.
You are a mountain monkey.

92
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,090
You should be gathering
nuts in the mountains of Kai!

93
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,500
That's enough.

94
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,200
What brought you here?

95
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,850
We've cut the aqueduct.

96
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,850
Will the castle fall soon?

97
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,160
I wonder. There will be rain and snow.

98
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,490
The castle can stand longer.

99
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,130
The garrison leader is a fine warrior.

100
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,970
He lets us hear the flute at night.

101
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,740
I heard about that flute.

102
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:03,050
Will he play again
tonight without water?

103
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,460
If we hear him tonight
the garrison will hold.

104
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,620
The castle will not fall.

105
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,060
But if we do not hear the
flute, the castle is doomed.

106
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,130
Its fall is near.

107
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,270
I want to hear if the
flute is played tonight.

108
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,580
Prepare my seat in the castle.

109
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,330
What? Shingen is dead?

110
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,550
According to our spy, there
is a rumor that he was shot.

111
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,120
Stupid! It's just talk.

112
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,850
Is he alive? Is he
dead? That is the point.

113
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,020
Bring a stool.

114
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,700
There is only one thing in
the world that can frighten me.

115
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,400
That mountain monkey.

116
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,440
He has bothered me.

117
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,280
His death helps.

118
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,840
I would go to Kyoto and take a nap.

119
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,150
Discover the truth of
his death. Understand?

120
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,050
My horse!

121
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,550
What? Lord Shingen is dead?

122
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,050
A sniper shot him. He was badly wounded.

123
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,220
Is he dead or alive?

124
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,030
Either way it is a chance
for our Tokugawa Clan.

125
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:39,470
Be quiet. Even if he did beat
me at the battle of Mikata,

126
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,800
I am no coward. His
death does not please me.

127
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,280
As a warlord, he has been unrivalled.

128
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,660
He is just over 50.

129
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,390
If he really dies, it is a great loss.

130
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,490
We have won many
battles. Why retreat now?

131
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,100
Strange.

132
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,430
I heard this rumor.

133
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,400
Our Lord's been shot.

134
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Open your eyes and look for yourself.

135
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
Lord Shingen is over there.

136
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,310
To occupy Kyoto,

137
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,980
to put my flags in the capital,

138
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,260
has been my long-cherished dream.

139
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,900
But,

140
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,110
if I die, we must forget it.

141
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,790
Let it be a dream.

142
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,200
Remember.

143
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,500
My death must not be known.

144
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,400
Keep it a secret for
at least three years.

145
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,210
Guard our domain. Never move from it.

146
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,320
Do not move.

147
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,660
If you ignore my order
and leave to attack,

148
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,590
our Takeda Clan will be no more.

149
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,480
Note that, men.

150
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,080
Consider it my will.

151
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Father.

152
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,130
But I am not going to die.

153
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,120
I said <i>"if."</i>

154
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,640
I must prepare for the worst.

155
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,770
But, no.

156
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,730
I will not die.

157
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,150
The lancet holes of the
castle were like this.

158
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,950
And the target?

159
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,920
Under the stone wall
of the second tower.

160
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,280
If I am similarly here,

161
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,320
that pine tree is the same
distance and direction.

162
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,130
You saw Takeda's men make
a seat there during the day?

163
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,580
They put up three bamboo
poles with white paper.

164
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,380
I thought an enemy lord might
go there to listen to the flute.

165
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,150
I set up my gun during the day.

166
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,280
Do as you did then.

167
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,490
I put the gun through
the lancet hole like this.

168
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,540
I steadied my aim and
waited for the night.

169
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,110
Shoot.

170
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,230
Go ahead. Shoot.

171
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,110
It was dark, at night, no bonfire.

172
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,880
I could not see.

173
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,860
Some time after the flute began,

174
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,030
I pulled the trigger like this.

175
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,670
Then what?

176
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,580
As soon as I shot,

177
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,890
noises came from the
spot I aimed at, like now.

178
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,350
Calm them.

179
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,230
Now we can believe that
Shingen was wounded.

180
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,770
Not yet.

181
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,980
If he was,

182
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,450
the Takeda army would
have annihilated the enemy.

183
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,450
They would have tried to
kill this sniper at least.

184
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,540
No.

185
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,520
They want to keep it a
secret. They would not.

186
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,930
They made peace when
they had almost won.

187
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,460
And they returned home.

188
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,540
It is strange. A ruse, perhaps.

189
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,630
Have we crossed the Seta Bridge?

190
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,340
I can see Kyoto.

191
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,140
Occupy it! Put my flags in the capital!

192
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,460
Our lord?

193
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,630
I cannot see him yet.

194
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,340
What a sight. Beautiful.

195
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,950
The invincible Takeda army.

196
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,080
Keep your line!

197
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,620
I don't think we can keep
my father's death a secret.

198
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,320
Some saw his body in the palanquin.

199
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,060
I took care of them. They died.

200
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,290
But there are spies
from Nobunaga and Leyasu.

201
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,600
You must observe your father's will.

202
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,930
We must try our best.

203
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Nobukado impersonated
the late lord in battle.

204
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,480
The enemy has never known.

205
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,650
We must deceive our own men too.

206
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,420
But Nobukado cannot do that.
And the secret will be out.

207
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,360
Exactly.

208
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,360
I cannot myself deceive our men.

209
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:39,500
But if there were another
double of the lord...

210
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,080
Another double?

211
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
I have prepared for such an occasion.

212
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,490
Take a look at him.

213
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,460
Come in.

214
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,890
Remove your mask.

215
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,040
Where is the lord?

216
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,720
You were born base!

217
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,900
You cannot see a lord so easily.

218
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,230
Make way for the lord!

219
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,940
You saw him?

220
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:28,980
Yes.

221
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,940
I think it is Shingen.

222
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,050
Let's have a closer look.
It might be a double.

223
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,980
I'm sure it is Shingen.

224
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,630
Leyasu sent you?

225
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,000
Nobunaga sent me.

226
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,840
I don't understand.

227
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,910
I found a guarded
palanquin hurrying north.

228
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,920
I thought Shingen was in it.

229
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,250
A doctor was beside it. I
thought Shingen was wounded.

230
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,790
But look at that.

231
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,790
Shingen was not in the palanquin.

232
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,890
Listen.

233
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,540
The party rested, then
returned to the main force.

234
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,690
And the doctor's servant
was killed on the pass.

235
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,060
It doesn't make sense.
Why did they turn back?

236
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,040
Why did the servant have to be killed?

237
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,510
But it is Shingen. No doubt about it.

238
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,290
That is right. It is Shingen himself.

239
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:15,590
Do not push your luck! What
if someone saw you just now?

240
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,660
Impossible.

241
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,210
He was dying before. Now he's healthy.

242
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,110
You do not know the truth.

243
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,620
Are your spies blind? Old? Deaf?

244
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,660
Shingen had some reason
to return home so abruptly.

245
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,040
He must be wounded, or dead.

246
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:06,770
If he were healthy, he would
have surrounded us by now.

247
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,230
Do not move!

248
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,430
You've disappointed me.

249
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,140
Of all things, you tried
to steal and escape.

250
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,880
I can play the role of his
double from time to time.

251
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:40,650
But not from morning till
night. It is too much.

252
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,750
Besides,

253
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,030
the lord is already dead.

254
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,230
You lied to me. You tricked me.

255
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,540
Shut up. Do as you are told.

256
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,700
You cannot treat me like this.

257
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,500
Come, come.

258
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,080
There is a good reason.

259
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,880
We must keep the lord's
death a secret, as he wished.

260
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:20,730
What do you mean?

261
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,200
We must pretend he is alive.

262
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,060
But these three know.

263
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:34,200
Those who were close to him should know.

264
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,540
I was intending to tell you, too.

265
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,120
I want you to keep this role.

266
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,450
Not anymore. I cannot.

267
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,820
- Do not be obstinate.
- It is not that.

268
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,330
The lord is dead. I have
no duty to anyone else.

269
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,040
Listen. He wanted to hide his death.

270
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,070
Because he wanted to live
with us for three more years.

271
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,710
If you have any duty
toward him it is now.

272
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,820
Perhaps you are right, but I
had been thinking he was alive.

273
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,290
Then I found him dead.

274
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,830
Suddenly, it all seemed stupid!

275
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,830
Hopeless. We cannot use him.

276
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,310
There is no other way. Only
he can deceive everyone.

277
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,550
Listen.

278
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,690
If you refuse to act as
the lord, you will die.

279
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,260
You saw the lord's corpse.

280
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,060
But if you help us,

281
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,410
you will be rewarded and
released in three years.

282
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,810
You owe your own life to Nobukado.

283
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,510
He is asking you now.

284
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,090
Enough!

285
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,850
No matter what you say, he
will never understand us.

286
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:41,730
Mind you, he has nothing
to do with the Takeda Clan.

287
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,210
It is selfish of us to
make him solve our problems.

288
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:55,020
This role is for someone who
can die for the Takeda Clan.

289
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,940
Release him.

290
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:34,180
But if he goes free,
then everyone will know.

291
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,860
There is no way not to.

292
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,990
Tomorrow,

293
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,140
we will bury the lord's body
in Lake Suwa as he wished.

294
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,110
This is no time for killing.

295
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,740
Day after tomorrow,

296
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,750
it will be a sad march home.

297
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,880
Let us discuss it.

298
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,740
What are they doing?

299
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,940
What is in that jar?

300
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,280
Strange. The jar is gone.

301
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,550
What happened?

302
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,660
I have it.

303
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,640
I thought the jar contained
a treasure, but I was wrong.

304
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,240
They would not abandon that.

305
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,310
And the Takeda warriors
behaved unusually.

306
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,110
I am sure the jar
contained Shingen's body.

307
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:05,030
The man we saw from the
mountain was his double?

308
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,250
Definitely.

309
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,940
Three spies were in that hut.

310
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:30,180
They saw everything. Send
your men to kill them!

311
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,880
We are going to tell our
soldiers of his death today.

312
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,360
Naturally, the enemy will know at once.

313
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,090
Leave.

314
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,460
What do you want? Payment
for the information?

315
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,700
No.

316
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,940
Let me help you.

317
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,440
I do not want any
reward. Make use of me.

318
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,360
I want to be of some use to him.

319
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,560
Use me.

320
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,850
I beg you.

321
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:14,710
Ajar of sake dedicated to the
god of the lake this morning.

322
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,510
What did it say?

323
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:49,510
Now I'm disappointed.
The jar contained sake.

324
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,720
Sake?

325
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,160
It was dedicated to the god of the lake.

326
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,490
Is that all?

327
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,230
Then is Shingen alive?

328
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,430
Wait.

329
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:10,170
There will be a Noh performance tonight.

330
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,610
We will see if the lord is real.

331
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,710
It is a lucky day.

332
00:56:53,780 --> 00:57:00,480
Boys' Festival and now the
return of your grandfather.

333
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,750
Will my father come home?

334
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,690
But you are the heir.

335
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,860
You will be the first to greet the lord.

336
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,910
I know. He is the master here.

337
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,640
And next to him, you.

338
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,770
Why do I come before my father?

339
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,990
I do not know.

340
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,290
Lord Katsuyori, your
father, is your guardian.

341
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:43,730
You are his charge until you grow up.

342
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:48,500
Hurry. The heralds are at the gate.

343
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,080
Now go and greet them.

344
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,080
The East Gate?

345
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,280
No. You will see him in the Main Hall.

346
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,200
The lord is back!

347
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,810
First, enter the Bishamon Hall.

348
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,380
Next, the Fodo Hall,
then the Izuna Hall.

349
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,090
And then the Main Hall.

350
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,720
Understand?

351
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:31,730
I have already taught you how to behave.

352
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,980
Congratulations, my lord.

353
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,020
No! He is not my grandfather.

354
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,870
What are you saying?

355
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,070
He's fought many months. His
countenance may have changed.

356
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,550
Besides, he suffered an
illness during the battle.

357
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,080
A serious illness can change us.

358
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,080
Go closer to him.

359
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,520
Have a good look at him.

360
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:33,120
It's true. He has changed.

361
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:41,350
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

362
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,620
That's good!

363
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,170
That was close.

364
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,170
I should have thought of it.

365
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,120
Children understand.

366
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:41,350
But you treated him properly. Well done.

367
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:44,720
I did not know what else to do.

368
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:51,760
That is all right. The late
lord was straightforward.

369
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,100
He stepped straight into
the hearts of the others.

370
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:03,300
Remember that. Behave
as your heart wishes.

371
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,940
That is best.

372
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,530
The hidden guard room.

373
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:28,400
When the lord gives audience,
guards are waiting here.

374
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:34,410
Also, guards are here all night.

375
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,380
The sutra room.

376
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,430
The lord reads the sutras here.

377
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:32,300
And this is the living room.

378
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:35,670
The lord relaxes here.

379
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,510
Beyond is his bedroom.

380
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:04,990
These three attendants and
two pages know everything.

381
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:08,060
They will take care of you.

382
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:13,430
One of them will always be at your side.

383
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:21,830
Behave as they bid. You
will not be suspected.

384
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,670
These people know who you truly are.

385
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,470
They are like your
family. Be frank with them.

386
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:56,070
I have chosen clever boys for you.

387
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:13,020
I know it is difficult.

388
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,720
I was for a long time the lord's double.

389
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,890
It was torture.

390
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:29,900
It is not easy to suppress
yourself to become another.

391
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:41,090
Often I wanted to be myself and free.

392
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:49,620
But now I think this was selfish of me.

393
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,730
The shadow of a man can
never desert that man.

394
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:10,310
I was my brother's shadow.
Now that I have lost him,

395
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:14,680
it is as though I am nothing.

396
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:09,540
Well, you are going to
meet the lord's mistresses.

397
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:14,410
These men will teach you manners.

398
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,750
Study the structure of this mansion.

399
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,180
Don't get lost in your own house.

400
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:12,070
My name is Tsuchiya, chief attendant.

401
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,410
Amemiya is mine.

402
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,220
Hara is mine.

403
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,990
Amari is mine.

404
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,790
Tomono is mine.

405
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,960
Do not be too proud.

406
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,830
What are you doing?

407
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,540
The late lord never did that.

408
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,920
How is this?

409
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,100
Little Takemaru was a problem,
but the horse is worse.

410
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:58,200
It can tell. Only the
late lord could ride it.

411
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:04,110
If the double falls off,
everyone will suspect.

412
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:14,150
Lord Shingen has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.

413
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,810
Good idea.

414
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,790
There are many other problems.

415
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:25,990
We must be careful to keep
the late lord's intentions.

416
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:31,530
Tonight he will have to meet
the late lord's mistresses.

417
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,400
How will he be with them?

418
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,910
Our master has been ill.

419
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,180
He must refrain from riding.

420
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,730
Where is Lord Katsuyori?

421
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:06,070
With Takemaru.

422
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,510
He is another problem.

423
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,640
Maybe the biggest.

424
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,700
He has never once smiled

425
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,580
since his son Takemaru
was chosen as heir.

426
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,480
No wonder.

427
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:23,680
He has won many battles.
Now he is a mere guardian.

428
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,350
He cannot be happy.

429
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:29,730
And above that, he has
to call a thief <i>"father."</i>

430
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,530
As do we.

431
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,530
Forget such personal feelings.

432
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,260
We must be united.

433
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,700
That is all.

434
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,450
I will return to Suwa Castle.

435
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:18,770
He is late. But we cannot
go any further. I am worried.

436
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,740
Nobukado is with him.

437
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,300
Besides, even I cannot
tell which is which.

438
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,620
He will be safe.

439
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,690
Will he? In bed?

440
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,330
Do I look like a different man?

441
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:23,130
You have not changed in appearance,

442
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:29,140
but your voice has changed
because of the illness.

443
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,680
The way you talk, too.

444
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,870
A serious illness can
change even a man's heart.

445
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:50,760
On second thought, you do
look like a different man.

446
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,720
Very well. The game is over.

447
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,270
Actually,

448
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:34,500
I am not Lord Shingen.

449
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,040
I impersonate the lord.

450
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,540
You are joking.

451
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,450
It is true.

452
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:51,620
Nobukado became tired
of the work and hired me.

453
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,160
Ask him.

454
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,140
Isn't that true, Nobukado?

455
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,970
Look at me carefully.

456
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,770
I am not your master.

457
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:49,010
You are drunk, sire.

458
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,620
It is late. Good night.

459
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:01,160
The master will not
stay with either of you.

460
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:08,160
The doctor said he
must not exert himself.

461
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,180
You are the leader of the Takeda Clan.

462
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,910
No one may deny this.

463
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,960
You.

464
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,330
The late lord destroyed Lord
Suwa who owned this castle.

465
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,590
He loved Suwa's daughter
and you are the result.

466
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:21,800
You are Suwa's grandson. He
could not appoint you heir.

467
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:27,780
So he compromised and made
your son Takemaru his heir.

468
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:35,150
In his heart, he always
thought the position yours.

469
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,560
No. I was not a son to him.

470
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,800
He always treated me
as one of his retainers.

471
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,770
No.

472
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:04,140
He wished to be buried in
Lake Suwa, in his armor.

473
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,480
Do you know why?

474
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,490
Because he wanted to
be near you, to aid you.

475
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:14,030
Since you live here in Suwa Castle,

476
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,490
I believe this shows his feelings.

477
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:22,200
He forbade me to use his banner

478
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:27,170
with the four letters for
Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain.

479
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,970
It represents the head
of the Takeda Clan.

480
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:37,550
That banner represents your late father.

481
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:43,850
He forbade you to use it because
he wanted you to surpass him,

482
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:49,150
to fly your own banner.

483
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:58,230
My father's intention was to ignore me.

484
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:03,700
His own chief retainers
treat me with disrespect.

485
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,540
Consider this, even
if this was his plan,

486
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:14,890
how could I call a thief
my father, bow down to him?

487
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:23,960
But now your name as a
brave warrior is well known.

488
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:31,960
The day will come when the
retainers will kneel to you.

489
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,210
Why are you called a
mountain, Grandfather?

490
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,610
Mountain?

491
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:47,950
Everybody calls you that.
<i>"Where is the mountain?"</i>

492
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:53,520
Is it because we have that
mountain in our garden?

493
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:09,370
You know the master's banner.
What do the letters mean?

494
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,120
Swift as the wind. Quiet as a forest.

495
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:26,760
Fierce as fire. Immovable as a mountain.

496
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:30,130
The lord is that mountain.

497
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,760
Both in battle and at home,

498
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:39,130
he is steadfast, like a mountain.

499
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,770
When his army moves,

500
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:47,270
first, the horsemen
attack as fast as the wind.

501
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:54,290
Second, the lancers
advance quiet as a forest.

502
01:25:54,360 --> 01:26:00,290
Third, the cavalry raids
mercilessly as fire.

503
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:04,860
And the lord is behind them,
always watching over them,

504
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:08,870
immovable as a mountain.

505
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:17,240
That is why our soldiers
can fight so strongly.

506
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,270
Immovable as a mountain.

507
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:28,810
The lord is that mountain.
So we call him the mountain.

508
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,290
I see.

509
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,930
Understand, Takemaru?

510
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,270
The spies agree Shingen
has returned home.

511
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,270
There were no other reports.

512
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:51,110
I don't understand. It was
his chance to take Kyoto.

513
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:56,210
Nobunaga, his rival, is
busy fighting other warlords.

514
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:02,150
Shingen would not miss
such an opportunity.

515
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:15,300
Very well. Let's attack.

516
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:18,270
Attack whom?

517
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,300
Takeda's outlying castles.

518
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,240
Attack them 
and watch Takeda's reaction.

519
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:36,350
Their reaction will tell us
if Shingen is behind them.

520
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:18,260
Messenger from Lord Katsuyori!

521
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,590
What are you doing? Nobukado is coming.

522
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,190
Be careful. They'll see you.

523
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:35,110
Tonight, as soon as
Lord Katsuyori arrives,

524
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:38,840
we will have a conference
of the entire clan.

525
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:45,340
You will have only to sit
with dignity and listen.

526
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,890
The decisions will be
made by the generals.

527
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:53,860
Then I will say:

528
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,550
<i>"The discussion is over. Let
us have your instructions. "</i>

529
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:05,330
Then you will nod in
satisfaction and say:

530
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,400
<i>"Well done. Thanks to you all. "</i>

531
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:13,710
And then stand up and leave. Understand?

532
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,740
Well done. Thanks to you all.

533
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,310
And then stand up and leave.

534
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,330
Do not try to put on airs.

535
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,220
The late lord was like a mountain.

536
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,130
Act naturally.

537
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,040
Like him.

538
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,580
The discussions are concluded.

539
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,590
Let us make our decision.

540
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:34,520
Leyasu is unforgivable.

541
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,800
We beat him once at Mikata.

542
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,420
He did not learn and
now he is attacking us.

543
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:49,700
I will drive them all from our domain.

544
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,780
Only one castle has fallen.
You need not go yourself.

545
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:06,110
He must study Leyasu's moves
to understand his purposes.

546
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:20,330
The Tokugawa army has
burned Okabe Castle.

547
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:25,580
Now they are surrounding
Futamata Castle.

548
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:31,910
We must counterattack
now to save Futamata.

549
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:43,290
The castle is protected by
Anayama. It is impregnable.

550
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:48,490
If it is in danger, he
will ask the lord for help.

551
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,710
Leyasu does not move capriciously.

552
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:07,410
He studies our reactions
to his initial attack.

553
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:14,890
He is young but very
thoughtful, cunning.

554
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,600
That's why Nobunaga trusts him.

555
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,370
He frightens me.

556
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:49,120
We must discover what
he meant by this attack.

557
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:51,720
That is first.

558
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:56,530
But it will be too late when
we find out what he meant.

559
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,560
Attack now,

560
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:05,030
or wait and see.

561
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,840
What does our lord think?

562
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:19,410
Father, what are your instructions?

563
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,480
Do not move.

564
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:57,560
A mountain does not move.

565
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:09,710
Well done. Thanks to you all.

566
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:01,650
Lord Katsuyori behaved badly.

567
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:08,930
He knew it was the late lord's double.

568
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:18,240
But that man countered beautifully.

569
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:25,840
We cannot approve.

570
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:33,150
He shamed Katsuyori
publicly. He went too far.

571
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,000
I admire his wit, standing up like that.

572
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:43,800
But sometimes a witty man
depends too much on his wits.

573
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:50,940
He must stay within
the limits of his role.

574
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:55,340
I know.

575
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,970
Still, he impressed me.

576
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:09,220
Even though he's tough,
it must be torture.

577
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:17,160
He must feel as if he
were truly on the cross.

578
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:39,510
What is it?

579
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:44,240
A dream.

580
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,240
A million enemies surrounded me.

581
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,970
Tell Leyasu this.

582
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:24,880
While I fight Lord Asai,

583
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:28,880
ride out and see if
Shingen is really dead.

584
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:33,410
Just asking will not
help discover the truth.

585
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,340
Amen.

586
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:29,910
Noda Castle and Nagashino
Castle have fallen.

587
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,640
You're good, Grandfather.

588
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,740
Another war?

589
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,150
Are you scared?

590
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:14,320
No. But you'll be gone. I'll miss you.

591
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,000
Noda and Nagashino have
fallen. Where is Leyasu?

592
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:27,700
He and his men have
surrounded Futamata Castle.

593
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:38,400
Katsuyori's gone to battle.

594
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:46,980
What? Without a conference? On his own?

595
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,150
Where did he go?

596
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:49,730
Takatenjin.

597
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:52,490
Takatenjin Castle?

598
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,630
Not a bad strategy.

599
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:05,680
If he takes the castle,
Leyasu will be threatened.

600
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,180
Only if he takes it.

601
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:12,680
Even his father failed to
take it. I do not think he can.

602
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:16,850
Leyasu has a chance to
attack him from the rear.

603
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:19,720
You may go.

604
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:35,670
We must send our troops to protect him.

605
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:40,340
Shingen's banners will make
Leyasu believe he is there.

606
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:47,140
That is right. The banners
will frighten him away.

607
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:08,560
May, 1574

608
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:09,490
The lord's banners in the rear.

609
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:07,130
Do not move. No matter what. Understand?

610
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:42,230
Not again. He stands
behind me at every battle.

611
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,770
He treats me like a child.

612
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:56,710
Let him. We will take over
this castle with our own hands.

613
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:05,960
Tell the men to break into the castle.

614
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,120
No, burn it.

615
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:54,230
What is this?

616
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:57,890
A group of horsemen are coming this way.

617
01:53:57,970 --> 01:54:00,330
Our side support?

618
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,530
What flags?

619
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:04,630
No flags.

620
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:13,540
Ours or theirs?

621
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:15,710
I cannot tell.

622
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:19,880
Now I see! The enemy!

623
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:28,560
Make walls of those lances.

624
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,000
Battle formation.

625
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,340
The enemy! A raid!

626
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,900
Keep calm.

627
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:10,640
Let them go!

628
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:13,660
Come back!

629
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:31,500
Enemy on the left hillside!

630
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:34,540
Enemy on the left. Attack!

631
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:02,130
Enemy's retreated!

632
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:15,880
Back to first battle form!

633
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:23,580
Look.

634
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:28,250
They died protecting you.

635
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:55,340
Imagine you are already
crucified. Do not move.

636
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:29,880
What is that?

637
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:37,220
Enemy on the right. The
banner is marked "Hon".

638
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:44,500
It is Heihachi Honda, one of
Tokugawa's bravest generals.

639
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,930
Enough. Pull back.

640
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,580
Do not move!

641
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:04,330
But I still feel Shingen
is dead. I do not know why.

642
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:07,240
That is what I feel.

643
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:08,280
Why?

644
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:13,910
I do not know. I just feel so.

645
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:29,160
We both hope Shingen will
die. It would help us greatly.

646
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:39,210
So we anticipate his death.

647
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,070
We long for it.

648
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:52,850
Maybe that is all.

649
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:17,280
The color is like blood,
but it is European wine.

650
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:49,780
What is the matter? Do you not like it?

651
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:01,250
Well...

652
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:34,320
I'll stop those religious
rioters in Ise. I'm quite busy.

653
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:15,890
I've been too late to help you.

654
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:19,260
This gold expresses my regrets.

655
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:27,100
I will leave Takeda to you. Farewell.

656
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:45,090
Nobody can deny that you
took Takatenjin Castle.

657
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:49,100
Even your father failed to take it.

658
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:50,330
No!

659
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,400
It is true I took the castle.

660
02:07:56,510 --> 02:08:00,600
But the credit does not go to me.

661
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:08,920
It goes to my late father
who frightened the enemy away.

662
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:17,650
I cannot escape from him after all.

663
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:23,660
The chief retainers are to blame.

664
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:31,300
They use the lord's double
to make you seem small.

665
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:18,420
The mountain?

666
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,510
In the garden, with Takemaru.

667
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:23,960
This will not do.

668
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:27,120
I told you, one of you must be with him.

669
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:28,160
I am sorry.

670
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:33,860
He is now well used to
living in this house.

671
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:38,130
He has become sure of
himself since Takatenjin.

672
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:44,270
He is doing well.

673
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:49,420
As if the late lord were inside him.

674
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:54,850
And he's charmed Takemaru, too.

675
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:58,120
The child loves him.

676
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:02,960
It makes me sad to see it.

677
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:06,900
That is so.

678
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:10,600
It is a cruel thing to do.

679
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:14,600
Some day he will know.

680
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:19,010
It will not be long.

681
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:26,750
The third year is almost
over, keeping this secret.

682
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:38,130
When the day comes,

683
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:43,300
it is not only Takemaru
who is to be pitied.

684
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:47,140
What will happen to the double?

685
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:55,980
A double means something only
when there is an original.

686
02:10:57,590 --> 02:11:00,820
When the original is gone,

687
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:05,390
what will happen to the double?

688
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,510
Where is the lord?

689
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:33,540
He's great. Only he can ride that horse.

690
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:16,490
Nobukado, he doesn't have the scar.

691
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:19,560
The wound he got at Kawanakajima.

692
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:24,500
So he is an impersonator after all.

693
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:27,400
Grandfather!

694
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:32,470
This man is not your grandfather.

695
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:34,480
He's an impersonator.

696
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:37,450
Grandfather!

697
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,550
Grandfather!

698
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:00,770
How stupid.

699
02:13:03,110 --> 02:13:08,240
He could deceive men, but not the horse!

700
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:18,520
I was to blame.

701
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:28,500
You have taken care so
that we have done properly.

702
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:32,700
We thank you for that.

703
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:42,140
Lord Katsuyori has arrived.

704
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:01,790
The play is over. Lord
Katsuyori is our master now.

705
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:50,380
From Nobukado.

706
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:54,950
He appreciates all you've done.

707
02:14:59,090 --> 02:15:04,050
This is with the compliments
of the other generals.

708
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,830
Take it.

709
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:26,010
Keep well.

710
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:58,380
Go away. Get out of here.

711
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:10,500
I want to see Takemaru
and say good-bye.

712
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:12,860
Takemaru? What impudence!

713
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:15,370
How dare you? Go!

714
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:03,880
April, 1575

715
02:18:37,850 --> 02:18:41,440
What? They conducted Shingen's funeral?

716
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:11,410
That is like Shingen.

717
02:19:13,550 --> 02:19:18,610
For three years after his death,

718
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:22,760
he successfully deceived me.

719
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:47,750
Even the 50 years of a man's life

720
02:19:47,850 --> 02:20:03,220
Is short compared to that of this world

721
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:15,270
Life is but a dream,
a vision, an illusion

722
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:40,190
Life, once given, cannot last forever

723
02:21:22,910 --> 02:21:26,940
Katsuyori has left his
domain, with 25,000 soldiers,

724
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,350
heading for Nagashino.

725
02:21:29,450 --> 02:21:32,580
The mountain has moved!

726
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:11,560
My lord, what do you
think that bar of light is?

727
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:16,460
A rainbow.

728
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:24,470
No. It is your late father's
instructions not to proceed.

729
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:29,800
He is telling you to stay
in your domain, to guard it.

730
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:33,350
Those were your father's last words.

731
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:36,850
Do so. Then nothing can harm us.

732
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:38,910
Harm us? Nothing could.

733
02:22:38,990 --> 02:22:45,390
Our ancestors never
lost a single battle.

734
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:48,290
We never retreat.

735
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:58,800
Forward!

736
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:51,690
May 21, 1575

737
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:05,470
Wind. Fire. This will
be the end of our clan.

738
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:10,500
Good-bye. I will go first.

739
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:17,910
Wind. Forest. We will meet
again where Lord Shingen is.

740
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:21,010
Attention!

741
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:08,690
Takeda will be no more.

742
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,290
The mountain has moved.

743
02:26:13,270 --> 02:26:14,670
Messenger.

744
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:28,280
Tell the gunners to
shoot the horses first.

745
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:34,480
The Takeda cavalry cannot
fight without horses.
