do anything again

Ah! But he knew where.
They were in here.

43
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,710

What of he himself?

King ecbert:
Hmm. But we can imagine
how it really ends.

49
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:52,704
We must do battle with
ragnar lothbrok and his allies.

50
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,409
I cannot believe that ragnar
does not want to negotiate.

51
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,411
I know him too well.
He's looking for land,

52
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,447
Farming land,
for his people.

53
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,352
King ecbert:
His men killed all of my envoys,
sparing only my son.

54
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,489
By which they sent me a simple
but clear message.

55
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,691
Athelstan:
Why not send me
to speak to him?

56
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:23,535
You are already too dear to me,
and too important.

57
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,605
Which is why, I think,
they would kill you.

58
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,513
Athelstan:
When? When will you attack?

59
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:39,484
King ecbert:
As soon as king aelle returns
with his warriors.

60
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:44,289
I'm sure you would prefer that
earl ragnar and I made peace.

61
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,359
Perhaps then you could be
at peace with yourself.

62
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,399
Ragnar:
King horik, your behaviour
has made it very difficult

63
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,402
To talk peace or to negotiate
with king ecbert.

64
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,639
King horik:
I never had any intention of
negotiating with king ecbert.

65
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,975
I thought you were aware
of that.

66
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,776
I only want revenge.

67
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,412
<i>I want to kill king ecbert.</i>

68
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,649
And then, perhaps,
I shall talk to him.

<i>Lagertha:</i>
<i>If we defeat ecbert in battle,</i>

70
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,820
He may be prepared

71
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,690
In terms not only of gold,
but of land.

72
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,460
Ragnar:
This was a gift
in good faith.

73
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,362
King horik:
What is good faith?

74
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:27,499
Why should there be good faith
between us and christians?

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,638
What do you say, floki?

76
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,609
Floki:
They worship a false god.

77
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,612
They're fleas and vermin.

00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,547
<i>Ragnar:</i>
<i>I will go myself</i>
<i>and talk to him.</i>

King horik:
You will not divide our forces,
earl ragnar.

80
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,387
You seem to forget
I am king.

81
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,457
We will strike camp tomorrow,

82
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,626
And, armed and ready,
we will go to seek battle,

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,496
As our father odin
has taught us.

<i>Bjorn:</i>
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

91
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,564
I am thinking about
what it is like to die.

92
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,535
Only those who have died
would know.

93
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,437
The seer would know.

94
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,707
Ragnar:
He is not truly dead;
that is his curse.

95
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,381
He told me something about you.

96
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,384
That you would marry
the daughter of a king,

97
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,887
Or else sail round a sea
that has no tides.

98
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,392
Then I shall not die tomorrow?

99
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,928
Not according to the seer.

100
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,899
(fire crackles)

101
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,605
Bjorn reminds me
of odin's favourite son, balder.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,742
<i>You know the story.</i>

103
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:24,416
Floki:
The gods made everyone swear
an oath that he would be safe.

104
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,587
Nothing could injure
odin's favourite son.

105
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,956
King horik:
The gods even tested the oaths.

106
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:35,427
They threw stones at him, darts,
struck him with axes,

107
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,630
And slashed at him with swords,

108
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:43,735
But it seems nothing
could harm balder.

109
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,970
Floki:
Everyone rejoiced

110
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,707
That it was impossible
to harm balder.

111
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,743
All except loki.

112
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,815
The sly one watched
with distaste and impatience.

113
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,584
<i>And it sickened him to see</i>
<i>how balder was immune</i>

114
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,187
From all sorts of attacks.

115
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:08,927
Yes. The sly one knew he had
to find a way to kill him.

116
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,535
Athelstan:
Help me, lord.

117
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,603
Who are these gods
who haunt my nights

118
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,639
And wreck my peace?

119
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,608
Odin, thor, freyr...

120
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,480
You have taught us
not to worship false gods,

121
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:31,183
But I have seen them.

122
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,751
I have seen thor in the sky!

123
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,554
I have seen the sparks
from his anvil.

124
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:39,458
I felt the sea heave
with his anger.

125
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,995
(sighs)
why is this false?

126
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,832
Things that I've seen
with my own eyes.

127
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,235
Things that ragnar believes.

128
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,709
Whatever happens,
do not let ragnar die...

129
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,981
Nor yet lord ecbert.

<i>The only way to bring an end</i>

But, in the meantime,
king aelle,

350
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,827
Buying the services
of these northmen,

351

As mercenaries,

352
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,399

Aelle:
Mm. Very well.
As you say.

354

That is, if they have not yet
already sailed away.
