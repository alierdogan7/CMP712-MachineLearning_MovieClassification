SALLAFRONTEN FINLAND
March 1940

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,000
- Kolbein!
- Max!

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,900
Down! Down!

15
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,400
Speak Norwegian.

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,800
- We must get back.
- Cover me!

17
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,600
It happens often that I wake up
middle of the sounds from Finland.

18
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I did so many times.
But not now.

19
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
They must lie still.

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,100
This time it's different.

21
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,900
They have suffered a decline.
They have a brain concussion.

22
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
The Russians were never longer
than 150 kilometer into Finland.

23
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,200
Norway, Germany had occupied
of two months.

24
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,600
I was embarrassed by atvære Norwegian.

25
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
- Gunnar.
- Hi.

26
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,100
- Kolbein, greet Gunnar.
- Sønsteby.

27
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
- Do we have contacted many?
- Yes, a few.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,900
Small groups like ours
have emerged across the country.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,300
People will not realize
the fight is over.

30
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,500
- Thank you for last.
- Hey, Tallak.

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,500
- Hi. Edvard Tallaksen.
- Max Manus. It is Kolbein Lauring.

32
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,200
- I celebrate anything?
- It's a wake.

33
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
- Max Manus.
- Gregers Gram.

34
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,700
- In Finland, was voluntary.
- I even went to Finland?

35
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Was it exciting?

36
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,300
- No, it was useless.
- There is a cut defense.

37
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,600
- Then we even build an army.
- We are not enough and have no weapons.

38
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,000
- It's not what this is about.
- What then?

39
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,400
To send a message. Millions of
Norwegians think like us.

40
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,700
The war has only just begun.
We must show that the fight is not over.

41
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,100
We would like to fight.

42
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,900
We just waited at
that someone would engage in battle.

43
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Someone has to go forward.

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,100
It is the brightest,
I have heard since 9 April.

45
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,700
Have you gone to university?

46
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
We just wanted to do something.
Somewhere.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,500
Anything.

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,700
- What should we do with it?
- Fix a newspaper.

49
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
- Fix a newspaper?
- Yes. Propaganda.

50
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,200
The Germans had taken over all
newspapers and filled them with propaganda.

51
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,000
I walked out of fifth grade
and can barely write.

52
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,400
But we made a newspaper.
The first freedom in the country.

53
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,900
We fought for king and country.

54
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
We want ETLAND
Too NORWAY

55
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
We were careless.
I was imprudent.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,300
Who are the Hovseter?

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,700
Greetings from Max Manus.

58
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,200
It is to Stein Forget Ming.

59
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
We were amateurs.

60
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,600
I thought not
of the consequences.

61
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,300
Swear to hell.
What is this some shit?

62
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,100
Perhaps the Minister may
send Whiskey from England.

63
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,800
I hear the king,
what he seems.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,100
Close both eyes now, Tallak.

65
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,300
- There is nothing wrong with the sights.
- Scroll down mørklægningen.

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Why do you want to travel,
when we have it so good here?

67
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,000
- That is where the resistance is organized.
- We organize it here.

68
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,300
Busting at the Colosseum Kino?
It is smart.

69
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,900
- Yes.
- It is not.

70
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Imagine if taken fell on his head
of Quisling and Hilden Berg.

71
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,900
There are hundreds
country are traitors.

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Are we lucky,
is head of the Gestapo there.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
- Cash Gestapo commander?
- Yes.

74
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,300
Civilians would be shot as revenge.

75
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,100
You can not win the war by
making newspapers.

76
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,200
- We must do something active.
- It'll come.

77
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,700
- Django Reinhardt.
- Enjoy it while you can.

78
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,800
Do not know
Jazz has been banned?

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,700
Anything that is not ideologically correct.

80
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,500
Is Jens Book-Jenssen
as ideologically correct?

81
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
It is always wrong
to hear the tågehorn.

82
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,100
It is Saturday, guys. I would
have been out dancing with ...

83
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,000
... with a girl
I can not remember the name of.

84
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,100
- I could have been killed!
- Of a luftpistol?

85
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
- There is a courier who is waiting for me.
- I will miss you, Greg.

86
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,700
- Will you not be?
- Will you not?

87
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,300
I do not really now.

88
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Have a good one.

89
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
He takes as a slut.

90
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,200
- Source him.
- No, no, no.

91
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,700
It is here.

92
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Good catch.

93
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,300
Half a year into the war
everything was more organized.

94
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,900
We should obey orders.

95
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,200
One of those who had contact with
London was Jens Christian Hauge.

96
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,600
As children we played war
in Ljan forest.

97
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Edvardsen.

98
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,500
- Detvar long ago now.
- What's your alias?

99
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,500
Tollef.

100
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,400
I thought you had to be lawyer
and counting money.

101
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
Are all come?

102
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,000
Edvard has spoken
with the government in London.

103
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,400
You decide. There will be no
actions without London's consent.

104
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,900
I have established a budrute to
Sweden and on to London.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Erling are the link in the network.

106
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,500
We are many, but most amateurs
so people need to England and train.

107
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,900
- I do not need training.
- Again, not me.

108
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,000
We are not
in a trench in Finland.

109
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,500
One should not
distribute leaflets openly.

110
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,300
Or download the arms of the people,
you do not know.

111
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,000
- Have you been in a fight?
- This is not about experience.

112
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I know because,
how to keep a gun.

113
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
If the Gestapo get one
in your network, the flnder you.

114
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,900
If you proceed now,
you will be taken.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,300
The government has asked me
assemble a ...

116
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,700
- See you tomorrow.
- It depends on the weather.

117
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,000
We want a country.
What kind of country, Max Manus?

118
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,700
I ...

119
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,300
I must to the toilet.

120
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,000
I have kept me all night.
Will I have, I will pee on the floor?

121
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Can we be allowed to piss
in his own apartment?

122
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,100
I should have done
very different.

123
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,900
I would never have been
taken. Not now.

124
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
Not that way.

125
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,900
What kind of idiot who saves
explosives under the bed?

126
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,300
Conspiracy against the German State.

127
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,600
You will appear like to try
the newly introduced capital punishment.

128
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Max, you should not!

129
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Max, do not!

130
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,100
Max, drag you back!

131
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Lig table.

132
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,700
To jump off was wise.

133
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,700
They are at Ullevål Hospital.

134
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,000
I have had a chance.
It will not I let go of me.

135
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,100
- How many?
- What do you think?

136
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,900
How many guards
there outside the door?

137
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Five. They have weapons.

138
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,600
- What is your name?
- Liv.

139
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,200
- Where are you from?
- Eivindvik. In Sogn.

140
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,200
- There I've never been.
- It has only a few.

141
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Are there many patriots there?

142
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Can you smuggle a message out?

143
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,100
I think the doctor can. Maybe.

144
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,900
He is a danger to the kingdom
and be heard now.

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,900
If he moved, he dies.
It is absolutely excluded.

146
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
- He must at Victoria terasse now.
- No. He is the observation.

147
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
He has internal bleeding.

148
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
- This medicine has bought us some time.
- And Max?

149
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,500
Max by too much. Will he
led to Victoria terrace ...

150
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,300
He would rather that we should shoot him.
And Kolbein?

151
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,700
He released the death penalty.
It does not Max. He is worth it.

152
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,000
Bring a car.

153
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,500
KOLBEIN was successful
FOR GRINI. In NATKLOKKEN 4

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,100
Can you smoke it is outside?

155
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Would you be comfortable?

156
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,600
Go now. I do myself.

157
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,100
No. Then he just left.

158
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,400
Hit me.

159
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,100
You have to beat me.

160
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,300
Otherwise they believe that I was with it.

161
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,700
So after he found you down, jumped
he is out the window and into a car?

162
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,000
- What about the girl?
- She was the accomplice.

163
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Arrest her and the doctor, and send
a picture of him cowboys out.

164
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,800
He is probably in Sweden now,
if not he is in England.

165
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
Max Manus.

166
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,600
FOREST LODGE-training camps
SCOTLAND

167
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,500
Captain Linge?

168
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
- Who are you?
- Military officer Manus.

169
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,100
Manus? Was it you,
who jumped out the window?

170
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,600
Great spirit.

171
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Bring a typewriter
that works.

172
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,400
Welcome to Scotland.
How was the trip?

173
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
- Long.
- Yes.

174
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,900
Volunteer in Finland.
Fought at Kongsvinger.

175
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Service in London. And now you will enter
in Notwegian Independent Company?

176
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Yes, if I may be allowed
to fight for my country.

177
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
If it can be done.

178
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,600
- What do you think?
- I flk done little late.

179
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,200
- There is no one has.
- They attack the Norwegian coast.

180
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,400
After the last attack
Germans shot 18 man.

181
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,900
They burned the city down and sent
60 people in the concentration camp.

182
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,500
Come.

183
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Sit down. We have not won
a city, since we left of Narvik.

184
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
The Allies have been beaten back.

185
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,500
The Germans are ten kilometers
from Moscow. London is chopped bombed.

186
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,900
It is a matter of time
before we all have to learn German.

187
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,800
But us who are here,
we will fight no matter what.

188
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,500
Sit. The chance of survival
in my company is minimal.

189
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,500
All that is here is stupid
or not really clever.

190
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,300
If you are crazy or stupid
you're welcome.

191
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
So you're stupid?

192
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Welcome. I look forward to
to work together with you, Manus.

193
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,700
Sign up with Corporal Gram.
He will show you around.

194
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,800
Without support from the people
we do not have a chance.

195
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,900
It is a big problem. If we do not
have people's confidence ...

196
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,000
One moment.

197
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,400
- Military officer.
- Corporal and instructor already?

198
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,100
Write 2000 words on the propaganda.

199
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I heard on the drain. You were completely
by crawling down a window.

200
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,700
You do not help.
How hard can it be?

201
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,000
Give me a hand. Give me a hand.

202
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,100
- Have you heard from Kolbein?
- He sits in Grini.

203
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,200
He is the commander room.
He helped with a flight.

204
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,700
- If he does not even look like?
- He locked all the doors.

205
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Since the last man was out,
locked again.

206
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,900
- Why?
- He flk bad conscience.

207
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,200
He felt his work was too
important that he could run away.

208
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,600
What a guy.

209
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Come on! Come on!

210
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,500
You are not serious.

211
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,400
I will not be
to make newspapers.

212
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,100
Propaganda is more than just newspapers.
There is resistance in the population.

213
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,500
It creates national unity.

214
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,600
This causes us to burst
all German stock on Norwegian soil.

215
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
So. Now it sits there.

216
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,100
- Next time.
- And you are a teacher?

217
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,200
In propaganda, yes.

218
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,500
REJECTED

219
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,800
Should we not go?

220
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,100
- Why not?
- You must go.

221
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,900
- I will not.
- Crap.

222
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,200
- Have you spoken to Linge about this?
- I can not flnde him.

223
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,700
Is it too much to ask?

224
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
Yes?

225
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,700
- Colonel Sir? Military officer Manus.
- Yes. Window-source officer.

226
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,200
Close the door.

227
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,400
Sit down
and came straight to the point.

228
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,500
I hate excuses.
They lead to the requirement. Brandy?

229
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,400
- No thanks. I drink no more.
- Who does not drink during a war?

230
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
Thank you.

231
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,900
- Why was not our mission denied?
- I must go.

232
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,400
We expand the school. We would like
retain Corporal chart as a teacher.

233
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,700
But it is our mission.

234
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,600
We've planned it together,
me and Gregers.

235
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,700
- Captain Linge has ...
- Captain Linge was killed.

236
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
By Måløy.

237
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,900
Why would you be saboteur, Max?

238
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,400
My country was stolen from me.
And I want it back.

239
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,000
I admire your kampånd and Gram
will certainly annoy the Germans, --

240
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,000
- But he lacks experience
as a soldier.

241
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,700
I have more battle experience
than most of the company.

242
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,900
I look after him.

243
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,700
As members of the first Norwegian
The company has now trained --

244
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,400
- To carry out missions behind
enemy lines in your own country.

245
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,700
This is not infantry.
Forget everything I know about warfare.

246
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
The enemy is running together
with you in the bus.

247
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,100
It is the old lady who would have
the dusør, the Gestapo would udlove.

248
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,500
Keep concentration.
This requires more than just courage.

249
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,400
You are in close contact
with the Norwegian nature.

250
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,200
- What about containers?
- I found three of them.

251
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,800
- Four. Want a sip?
- Yes.

252
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Thank you. Oslo harbor. 50 guards at night,
200 a day.

253
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,600
Why is there
Norwegian flag on?

254
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,400
- That we wait for.
- How long?

255
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,700
- TII we won the war.
- Are you ready?

256
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Yes.

257
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,500
The three main objectives are Ortelsburg,
von Kniprode and Tuguela.

258
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,600
Sigurd our insider at Aker.
He puts limp on two other ships.

259
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,700
Tollef, I thought of
with retaliation.

260
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,200
The Germans do not
execute dockers.

261
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,300
That is why
we have English uniforms on.

262
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,800
- What if we were not being seen?
- We put some English effects.

263
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,800
- It should probably go.
- This is a limp mine.

264
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,300
It contains over one kg of plastic
explosives, and there are magnets on.

265
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,800
They must put on the side of ships.
It is our job.

266
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,100
You must keep us stable
into ships.

267
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,000
Using ac-delay and cortexlunter
mines will go eight hours later.

268
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,000
That is nine o'clock.
Questions?

269
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,900
This is the last chance.

270
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,900
If you want to drag you
so do it now.

271
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,500
Well.

272
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,900
OPERATION MARDONIUS
OSLO PORT 27 April 1943

273
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,400
Get the mongrel out of here.

274
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,000
It is night, beginning.

275
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,600
- We will be discovered.
- It's too late to turn back.

276
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,400
What the hell?

277
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,300
Have a nice day
Third-UBÅDS Company

278
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,400
- How are we going to Sweden?
- We paddle.

279
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,400
We are across the border
and take a train from Arvika.

280
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,200
Look!

281
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,500
Order directly
from Terboven.

282
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,500
He can no longer tolerate the
kind. He demands retaliation.

283
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,900
If it was British,
they have been helped by the port workers.

284
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,900
Detention five workers.

285
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,900
Get them to sing.

286
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,500
Are you new here?
My name is Siegfried.

287
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,500
- Solveig.
- What a pretty, Norwegian name.

288
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Say, if I can help
with anything. I do not bite.

289
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,300
I would just do my work.

290
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,900
It makes you probably a good thing.
And remember. Ask for ...

291
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,600
- Sigfried.
- Right.

292
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
We must be in Sweden now.

293
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,300
Can you not feel that nature
has become more Swedish?

294
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,700
- Where are we going?
- When it is not. The orders Tlkken.

295
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,400
- Did not I tell you about her?
- Is it a new Swedish girl?

296
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,400
No, she is Norwegian.
She is just our boss.

297
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
All right. She is ugly.

298
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,700
No, she's not ugly. We have just
more of a brother-sister relationship.

299
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,200
- Should I try next?
- No.

300
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,700
- So you want her?
- No.

301
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,100
That, my friend, this is Sweden.

302
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
DETBRITISKE CONSULAR

303
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,700
I see if I can flnde Tlkken.

304
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,800
Sorry.

305
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,700
Good morning.

306
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,700
I need equipment.

307
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,000
- Who are you?
- Mr busy.

308
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,200
We need two diving suits,
20 kg coffee, eight limp mines ...

309
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,700
- Write down now.
- Let me look at it here.

310
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,800
60 cartons of cigarettes English
and 15 bottles of whiskey?

311
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,900
Can you get it or not?
I do not have time to discuss.

312
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
Do not stress out.

313
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,100
I have 20 refugees here.

314
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,000
I have 300 boxes of tobacco,
to be distributed among all.

315
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,600
Ask yourself in a queue like any other
and bring it there.

316
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Now, do not wear yourself up.

317
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,200
- Greg. Hello.
- You see, as always good.

318
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Can we borrow you for a moment;
Max and I?

319
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Max Manus, who fled
from Ullevål? Is he here?

320
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,600
- Is it?
- Max, welcome Tlkken.

321
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,100
Is it Tlkken?
What is Tlkken for?

322
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,000
Ida Nikoline Lie
Lind break Bernades.

323
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,500
It was a long name.

324
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:42,000
It was cold and dark
and his paddle distracting me.

325
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:49,000
Suddenly he was just, and I
felt hot, German urine over me.

326
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,700
- It is not true.
- And he gave me a hug afterwards.

327
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,700
- It was certainly deserved.
- Apropos of urine.

328
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,700
Are you ready soon?

329
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,000
- With what?
- As to behave so?

330
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,800
You do not always go
after first appearance.

331
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,900
It usually is a good fit.

332
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,200
So you are therefore a self-goose?

333
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Have I learned to know each other?

334
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,800
It's been a long day.

335
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,500
- Greg.
- Tlkken.

336
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,000
- We talk to you.
- What are you doing?

337
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,400
FOREST LODGE
SCOTLAND 7 June 1943

338
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,600
Corporal Gregers Gram.

339
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Military officer Max Manus.

340
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,300
- I will never forget you.
- They are an inspiration to us all.

341
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,700
It is probably the opposite, military officer Manus.

342
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,500
Yesterday a difficult time in the meeting.

343
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,600
I do not doubt your courage.

344
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,600
I would just ask you not
underestimating the enemy --

345
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,500
- In the same way
he underestimated us.

346
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,800
I ask you to convey my thanks
from me --

347
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
- To all those
who could not be here.

348
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:19,200
The work you do for Norway,
is crucial and historically.

349
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,600
Just to see you here today fills
a king with an enormous pride.

350
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,800
God be with you all.

351
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,000
I was too far from him.

352
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,000
- So it stupidly like?
- No, no.

353
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,200
- He knew my name.
- The captain said the course.

354
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,100
- Have you heard anything?
- We travel about two days.

355
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,800
- And we get more equipment this time.
- Yes, now you know the king.

356
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
- Mr Fehmer.
- Sorry.

357
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Mrs Jacobsen would like to speak with you.

358
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,600
Sid finally down.
What can I do for you?

359
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:21,000
Her son Sigurd Jacobsen
was arrested at the port.

360
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,000
Sigurd is a good boy.
He had nothing to do with it.

361
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,400
His uncle has been
member of the TS for many years.

362
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,300
I wonder also
entering the lot.

363
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,300
They do not join you in
to convince me.

364
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,300
He is the only one I have.

365
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,200
I will investigate.

366
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Should I pull the order back?

367
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,400
Beware.

368
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,800
Add an.

369
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,500
Shoot!

370
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,400
How the hell
flk they get Sigurd?

371
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,600
- It was not your fault, Max.
- He died for the case.

372
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,900
For the case?

373
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,700
See there. They both, we lowered,
was minor compared to.

374
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,200
They carry prisoners, soldiers
and arms every day.

375
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,300
- How can we beat it?
- They make mistakes. We must not.

376
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,100
No, because we are
so professional, right?

377
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,200
It is not a game, this.
What if the flk get your name?

378
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
They did not.

379
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,000
That is why he is dead
and I live.

380
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,900
Solveig, I look like a Norwegian now?

381
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,700
- I will stop after this week.
- What is it for something, my dear?

382
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,000
- Why you lied to the lady?
- What do you think?

383
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,200
You must understand that it is not easy
to be in my position.

384
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,100
The desperate acts of terrorism
serves no purpose.

385
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,900
They bring civilian lives in danger,
if they are not stopped.

386
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,200
Sometimes, we must take
difficult choices to everyone's best interests.

387
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,400
What would you have done?

388
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,700
I would live in peace.

389
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
Will you?

390
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I am here because I love Norway.
I would build a future here.

391
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,300
The resistance is over, when people
understand that we want their best.

392
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,700
Would you shoot me now?

393
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,400
Kolbein?

394
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
You are still just imprudent.

395
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,800
- When you slack off?
- Right now.

396
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,900
Three years of hell.

397
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
How did you like?

398
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,600
The Germans were well out of that I do not
had anything to do with you.

399
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,800
- Want a great cup of coffee?
- Yes.

400
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,900
Can we drink it outside?
I've had enough of small, dark room.

401
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,400
- What would you now?
- Avenge me.

402
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,100
You've been out in two seconds
and you will enter to sit again.

403
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,800
You can then enjoy the freedom a little.

404
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,000
You can not round a corner,
without any control.

405
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,800
Mr Bugge. Mr Brown.
Have a nice day.

406
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,300
Mr Blue.

407
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,900
- He said what he wanted?
- Only that we should meet here.

408
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,500
Jens Christian looks serious.

409
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,900
- What was with him?
- Have not heard it?

410
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,400
Quislings new labor service.

411
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,600
He will not get anywhere with it.
Only the unemployed arise.

412
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,100
- He introduces it as a service.
- That he can not.

413
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,300
It goes poorly østfronten, so he
will send Norwegian boys there.

414
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,800
- All between 18 and 20
- How many?

415
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,400
70-80.000 minimum. They send
calls out tomorrow.

416
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,300
Anyone who does not turn up,
being arrested. Damn.

417
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,100
Who was it? Gestapo?

418
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,500
- Gunnar, who is it?
- My mother.

419
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,600
- Your mother?
- She believes I am in Sweden.

420
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,700
She gets a nervesammenbrud,
if she sees me.

421
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,400
They have all files with names
various locations in the city.

422
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,300
We take the registry of the Police
Kjelland and the Labor Service.

423
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,300
Go ahead. Have a nice day.

424
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,600
Out with you!

425
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,700
Come out with you!

426
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,400
Fast! Out!

427
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,400
Fast!

428
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,800
- What a time it took.
- Talk nicely.

429
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,900
- Who is it?
- It's Karl-Johan.

430
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,300
I have an important message
to major Kjelland.

431
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,300
- Are you alone here?
- Where is the archive?

432
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,500
There are a lot.

433
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,700
Sit here.
We make you nothing.

434
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,300
Should we blow it?

435
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,900
- No, we burn it in the fireplace.
- There is no time for.

436
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,500
Dick ring out
if there are any.

437
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,000
Listen here. People sleep around
in the apartment here.

438
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,900
It will take all night.

439
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,000
- Are you ready soon?
- How goes it with her?

440
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,100
She has not so good.

441
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,900
- Dick, how many?
- No clue. It is the police.

442
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,900
Germans are just around the corner.

443
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,100
Per the road. Lars-Emil, you
with me. In others, the road.

444
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,100
Run!

445
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,800
There.

446
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,200
Held!

447
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,400
Held! Get off!
Up with your hands!

448
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,200
Hands up.

449
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,600
Turn around.

450
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,100
Keep your hands up.
Higher.

451
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,100
Come closer. Slowly.

452
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Lars-Emil!

453
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,900
Lars-Emil. Lars-Emil!

454
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,600
You were lucky.
It'll grow together.

455
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,100
- Who is here?
- Max and Kolbein.

456
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,500
- Where is Lars-Emil?
- He did it, unfortunately not.

457
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,400
- And Dick and Tlmo?
- I think they are doing.

458
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,500
We should have blown
it all into pieces.

459
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,000
- As with Per?
- No, unfortunately.

460
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,200
They had 50 men available.

461
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,100
We shot him in the neck.
We will flnde him.

462
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,800
Why should I work with
such incapable fools?

463
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,900
I had him surrounded,
and yet I let him go.

464
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,800
Now you too far.
It is completely unacceptable.

465
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,700
They keep you from my area.

466
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,700
- Is that clear?
- Yes. That is understood.

467
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,900
How beflnder Max Manus themselves?

468
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,100
Get him away.
We will continue this evening.

469
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,700
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

470
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,700
I've packed your things.
We travel about an hour.

471
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,600
THREE TERRORISTS shot

472
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,700
Everything has two sides.

473
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,800
The winner determines
who is a terrorist or patriot.

474
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,100
Should we do the propaganda?
It is an enormous risk.

475
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,400
It is a necessary risk.

476
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:10,300
- I do not want, something happens.
- Is it wrong, then wept a little for me.

477
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,900
Then you must make sure that my statue
get a flattering place.

478
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,500
Go ahead. A little summer gift
from us two for you.

479
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,000
From Scotland.
Open now.

480
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,400
- What have you two been on?
- Wait and see.

481
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,500
It is
the English royal family's hunting cabin.

482
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,100
We thought it was
an ordinary house, we broke into i.

483
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,200
- So it was filled with rococo furniture.
- Have you no manners?

484
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,700
- Ask the Conservative politician.
- I keep you away from my son.

485
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,300
- Do you have a son?
- Yes. George. He is five years.

486
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,100
World flneste little boy.
Where is he now?

487
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,600
He is at boarding school outside the city.
It is safer there.

488
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,900
It looks harmless out
but it can trigger a disaster.

489
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,100
Maximo Manus.
He fled from us three years ago.

490
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,900
We have tried to inflltrere those
but they are very careful.

491
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,200
He is cautious but ambitious.

492
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,700
- He is lucky to have you.
- Yes.

493
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,400
Once he fell asleep in the tram
and then came the Gestapo.

494
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,900
He had his pocket full
of illegal leaflets.

495
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,600
But they nænnede not to awaken him.

496
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,000
He looked so peaceful out.

497
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,500
Poor thing.

498
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,000
Sometimes I almost yearn
back to Finland.

499
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,900
Why?

500
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:36,100
It could see the enemy in the eye.
It was us or them.

501
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,900
Now the enemy is behind you
and around you. Everywhere.

502
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:49,100
They torture and kill my friends
to get me.

503
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,000
- Some have to lead.
- Yes.

504
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:57,400
I led them into something
they can not get out of.

505
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,100
- You laugh?
- Sorry.

506
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,600
I open myself, and then you laugh.

507
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,000
I knew just did not,
you were so sentimental.

508
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,800
Is there something wrong with that?
It becomes us men when we drink.

509
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,800
Gregers said that you cried,
when you saw Gone with the wind.

510
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,900
- And I regard him as a brother.
- I thought it was for fun.

511
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,400
- What you thought when you heard that?
- It should not be ashamed.

512
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,800
- I am not. Are you?
- No. Should it be embarrassing to me?

513
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,700
That I do not know. To sit and drink
fill jars with two all night.

514
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,800
- What is your man for this?
- He is in England.

515
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,800
We are still married --

516
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,700
- But we are not
really married longer if you understand.

517
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,800
All right.

518
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,400
- What are you now?
- Remove the foot from spinach.

519
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,000
- You have a bad sense of humor.
- You laugh then.

520
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,900
Hitler, Goebbels
and Hitler entering a bar.

521
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,600
- Hitler and Hitler?
- Himmler.

522
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,200
- Quiet.
- What is it?

523
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,800
- It's sabotage.
- No.

524
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,300
What is it?

525
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,300
Quiet.
Space is guaranteed.

526
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,700
- Is this safe?
- Yes.

527
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Who taught you to dance?

528
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
- A happy girl in Havana.
- Exactly.

529
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,900
I was 14 years old.

530
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,800
- Have you been to Havana?
- Yes.

531
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,300
Fut-fut.

532
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,600
My father sent me to Cuba
to become a man.

533
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,200
The mission has failed.

534
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,700
- Whiskey?
- Yes.

535
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,100
Moved you from your family,
when you were 14?

536
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,400
No.

537
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,400
It is a long history.

538
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,700
- Now we see if you can dance.
- No, no, no.

539
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
All right.

540
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,400
Come here.

541
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,700
I just need
to support me to you.

542
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,400
I have to go.

543
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,900
That you do not.

544
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,600
See you.

545
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,300
MRS ØYNEBRÅTENS OPPORTUNITY
FRICHSGADE 2 OSLO

546
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,700
Is there not a rooster?

547
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,800
It is hidden, so you can shoot
from your pocket without it stuck.

548
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,600
The front girl.

549
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,500
Can I see?

550
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,500
Is there a dusør?

551
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,100
- Olav must be involved.
- We do not need more people.

552
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:57,500
- What we have then.
- Hi. Olav.

553
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:06,300
I think so. Take care, Max.
Half the group was taken.

554
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,700
- Take your precautions.
- I stick to the boys here.

555
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,500
Will I need me, so please ask for a
Turkish among kringle baker Andersen.

556
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,400
What if we get a kringle?

557
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,500
- Turkish kringle flndes not.
- I have tasted one.

558
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,900
- No, it was the Turkish pastry.
- Forget the kringle.

559
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,400
Watch out, Max. You can not jump out
through the windows anymore.

560
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,000
- What happened?
- He lost the gun.

561
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,300
- Call an ambulance.
- He is wanted.

562
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,900
- My father is a doctor.
- To get him, however!

563
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,600
Sorry.

564
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,900
- Damn, Greg. Tallak.
- Be quiet.

565
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
My brothers ... our king.

566
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,900
He was also hit in the leg.
Two locations.

567
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,400
It went through my leg first.

568
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,900
- I can see the ball.
- Can you?

569
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,400
It's just a small splinter.

570
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,700
Where was I scared.

571
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,900
It makes damn evil.

572
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:39,400
There were some pieces I did not
could get out. Do the hospital.

573
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,300
- I can not.
- Then you must come to Sweden.

574
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,700
- There may be inflammation in it.
- I can not let boys.

575
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,100
What I also know about it?
I have only been a doctor in 30 years.

576
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,300
Does he have more dressings
or pills?

577
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,400
- I can not leave now.
- You do not benefit without your legs.

578
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,500
Want to contribute to Sweden?

579
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,800
One of us must stay here.

580
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,400
And be careful,
that gutterne not burst palace.

581
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,200
- It's a bad time.
- You will soon be back.

582
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,800
See here. So you do not forget
what we need.

583
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,800
What an idiot I am.

584
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,900
You know what?

585
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,800
You are absolutely right.

586
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,300
Stop!

587
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,700
Are you sure of this?
It is the Germans.

588
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,400
They must have realized
which way the war goes.

589
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,000
- You do not agree.
- Yes, I would like.

590
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,100
- Then came you.
- This is one of my friends.

591
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:21,600
Take a seat. I ordered coffee.
Replacement Coffee.

592
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:26,100
- Will you please sit there?
- Yes.

593
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,100
I am pleased
that you have contacted us.

594
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:37,000
It means a lot to us to get
information about the Gestapo.

595
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:43,300
But I have to make sure
you are really on our side.

596
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,000
It is ...

597
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,900
It is a dangerous ...

598
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,400
... game.

599
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
Quiet, quiet. Shoot no.

600
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,200
Gregers!

601
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Stop!

602
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,100
He is still alive.

603
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,200
Such. Now you must take it
amble a few days.

604
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,400
Sorry.

605
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
Hello.

606
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,200
- Gunnar? They have not taken Kolbein?
- No.

607
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,500
Gregers?

608
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,400
It can not match.
That is not to hell.

609
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,300
- When flk you know?
- In the morning.

610
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,300
It can not match.

611
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,000
We can not, Tlkken.

612
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,600
How?

613
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,100
It was at Plasskafeen.
An ambush.

614
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,200
I knew
I should not be taken away.

615
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,400
- You can not take you ...
- Were there others?

616
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,600
- Tallak. He was arrested.
- When does the train to Arvika?

617
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,100
You can not leave.
So they caught you.

618
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,000
- You can not save everyone, Max.
- I can save him.

619
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,600
How can you travel now?
You can be comfortable here.

620
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Here. You may not travel far.

621
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,900
How can you
asking me to be?

622
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,600
No. No.

623
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,300
I do not know who I think I am.

624
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,600
I am just a messenger.
I know nothing.

625
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,200
Do not make it difficult
for yourself now, Tallaksen.

626
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,600
Can you put any other music?

627
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,800
You can take it quite calmly.
We have a good time.

628
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:39,800
Torture is a symphony in several rates.
This is just the first.

629
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,400
You can die quickly and painlessly --

630
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,200
- When you have told us everything.

631
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:54,600
OSLO
24. December 1944

632
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,400
God Jul

633
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,700
God Jul

634
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,900
Are you home to celebrate Christmas?

635
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,200
- I go to a friend.
- I understand, unfortunately, not Norwegian.

636
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,000
TII a friend.

637
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,300
I have a daughter at her age.

638
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,900
I hope
I can come home next year.

639
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,600
You want to go home?

640
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,200
Cheers, mate.
It is enough with the war.

641
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,700
Here. Cigarettes.

642
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,100
Thank you.

643
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,800
You have no idea
how happy I am now.

644
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,500
Maybe you're one of them, I will
kill, when we lower Danube.

645
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,200
So are you in the icy water
and crying for your mother.

646
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,200
We will both die.

647
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:53,000
I can die with a smile,
I know we will win.

648
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:01,400
Gregers knew it. Tallak smiled,
when he knappede his shirt up.

649
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,000
He knew we would win
with or without him.

650
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,700
Just as we know that ...

651
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,400
I have to.

652
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,700
TAG ON HER WITH
KOLBEIN

653
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,100
Offensive on the Western Front will
break through the Allied lines.

654
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,800
- And then we Antwerp.
- It is impossible.

655
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,700
Once we Antwerp
we can negotiate for peace.

656
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,300
- Then the troops move east.
- I do not believe in negotiations.

657
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,000
I do not think the total war
we beflnder us will allow it.

658
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,300
Fortunately we will never
negotiate Norway.

659
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,200
- Good, old fortress Norway.
- For Norway.

660
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:43,700
You must discard the ad and ensure the
it is clean and velsmurt.

661
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,900
- Where is Max?
- Inside.

662
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:58,000
Max, the Germans have broken through
in the Ardennes on the Western front.

663
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,900
- Hitler timber country troops.
- Good.

664
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,100
300,000 soldiers rested
to the front is not good.

665
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:09,400
- But what is it with us to do?
- Not one German have to leave the country.

666
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,500
We wanted to hunt them out,
and now we keep them here?

667
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:19,000
The Germans want the invasion force
Seas. They can win the war.

668
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,300
Gunnar and the others have begun
to blow all the railway tracks.

669
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:29,100
And then there is the Danube, which nobody
do something about. The sail still.

670
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,200
- It takes the British aircraft of.
- It has shot half of them down.

671
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,200
I have worked at the port.
I know we can handle it.

672
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,600
It is still me
having command.

673
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,500
Who the hell are all these people?
Can you come out?

674
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,400
Out. Out!

675
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,100
What are you doing, Max?
You can not take Danube alone.

676
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,200
I am tired of people dying
around me. I do it alone.

677
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,500
- Join now not so stupid.
- Have you heard Roy?

678
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,600
Danube sailing with five companies
and tons of equipment.

679
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,300
- One man is worth it.
- No.

680
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,800
Regardless of how we do it here
As we do so together.

681
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,800
We have one chance
and it costs a life.

682
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,900
- It's my turn.
- TII what?

683
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,700
Out with you.

684
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,500
Gregers and Tallak was not just your
friends! Who said you have to die?

685
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,700
There is only us back!

686
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,500
We are doing it here together,
and we do not live by it!

687
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,100
- Should we wait a little?
- I have eaten rotten eggs.

688
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,800
There is smooth here.

689
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,700
- Hello. We are electricians.
- I have not heard anything about.

690
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,100
Damn. Now comes the paperwork
to take the half day.

691
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,400
They will probably repair
this connection in the control room.

692
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,400
It is in order.
You may go through.

693
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,100
Sorry.

694
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,400
New routines?

695
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,400
Can we come in?
We have a task to perform here.

696
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,700
- Thank you.
- Go out on the other side.

697
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,500
Here. Roy.

698
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,500
Hold me to it.

699
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,500

01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,200
- So they us?
- I do not think so.

701
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,200
Have you been out to swim?

702
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:38,900
- What is it?
- It seems that we have worked.

703
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,900
- Is everything okay?
- We come back tomorrow.

704
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,900
- Be sure to get the papers.
- We do.

705
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,500
- Sorry.
- It does not matter.

706
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,200
One moment.

707
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,100
- Who are they?
- Electrical.

708
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,200
Have not I seen you before?

709
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,800
That I do not know.
I live on this around.

710
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,200
No.

711
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,000
They play football?

712
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:53,300
So should we just wait for
they jump at sunrise.

713
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,500
- Be careful at the border.
- Same to you.

714
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,500
Bombs were placed,
Danube before leaving port.

715
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,800
I want a list of
dead and wounded.

716
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,900
There have been sabotage
against the railway.

717
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,300
They have blown all the lines.
Kongsvinger, Drammen, Moss.

718
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,100
During one night?
It can not match.

719
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:27,000
Are not we crack down
in these people?

720
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,200
We put on a sample Höhle.

721
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,800
It is important that we show strength.

722
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,700
Get addresses of all suspects.
We must crush them once and for all.

723
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,700
- Max.
- Hi.

724
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:02,100
Just go already.

725
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,500
Where have you been?

726
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,500
- Do not ...
- Can we go somewhere go?

727
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,700
- No, not now, Max.
- I am leaving tomorrow.

728
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,400
We flk telegram on the Danube.
It sank off Drøbak.

729
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,400
It is fantastic.

730
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,500
Is there anything I can do for you?
Missing something?

731
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:30,700
Do not do it here.
Join now sweet.

732
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,000

01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:06,100
We take full responsibility.
We turn to tomorrow.

736
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,100
Yes. Heil Hitler.

737
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,600
No, wait!

738
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,800
- Max, you must go now.

739
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,500
- The strike across the city.
- Where?

740
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,000
They surrounded Kolbeins house.
He had to shoot out.

741
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,400
- Where is he?
- He did.

742
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:24,500
- Mrs Øynebråtens enough roof.
- What are you talking about?

743
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,200
They have probably been with her.

744
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,200
Listen to me, Max. Do
go to Sweden. All must go now.

745
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,700
- You need to Sweden.
- Not without gutterne.

746
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,900
We interrupt the program
with a novelty.

747
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:27,100
Here is London.
Here is a novelty.

748
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:32,900
German radio has just announced
that Hitler is dead.

749
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,700
Dear compatriots. Again, we can celebrate
as etfritfolk.

750
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,900
Tens of thousands of people
are assembled ...

751
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:44,300
Everywhere there are Norwegian flag.

752
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:48,000
8. MAY 1945

753
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,700
Norwegian seamen.
Old Norway loves you all.

754
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:58,400
A warm thanks to the Norwegian people.
God preserve Norway.

755
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,100
Can you recognize me?

756
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,900
No.

757
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,600
My name is Manus.

758
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,500
Are you Max Manus?

759
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,600
May I congratulate you?
They have a lot to be proud of.

760
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:00,200
They see not that dangerous out
in reality.

761
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,900
It makes you not.

762
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,900
They should have known
how we strained ourselves.

763
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:13,800
But you slipped away again and again.

764
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,100
It was luck.

765
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,300
I do not believe in luck.
They have it in you.

766
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,200
They can not be caught.

767
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:37,900
English cigarettes.
The only thing that is good about England.

768
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:53,000
Well? Do you have it better --

769
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,800
- When the big,
bad wolf is behind bars?

770
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,400
In so many years
I wanted you dead.

771
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,800
And now?

772
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:36,300
I am glad that I flk Law
to take you, Max Manus.

773
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,800
Where are you going?
Grand share free beer out.

774
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,200
Fine.

775
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,600
- I have to Trondheim. Will you?
- I'll stay here.

776
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,900
- Is everything okay?
- Yes yes.

777
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,400
- You have to celebrate it here.
- Yes.

778
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,900
I have hung a flag up the room.

779
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,300
It has been buried
Since the invasion, so enjoy it.

780
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,900
Has all been?
So let me deliver a bowl.

781
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,500
- For freedom.
- For the King.

782
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,100
For Max.

783
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:15,000
For Max.

784
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,400
Hello?

785
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,600
Is here anyone?

786
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,500
Max?

787
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:41,300
What are you doing?

788
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,900
How long have you been here?
Gunnar has not seen you for days.

789
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:50,900
- You could have called anyone.
- I celebrate.

790
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:57,400
There is simply no
to celebrate with.

791
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,400
I am not
your responsibility longer Tlkken.

792
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,400
That is not how it works.

793
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,100
See it there.

794
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:18,600
I thought it was God.

795
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,700
I asked him --

796
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:30,700
- Why he
Gregers trains instead of me.

797
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,900
Is that so much to ask?

798
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:59,300
There's nothing more pathetic than
a soldier who no longer need.

799
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:05,300
A drunkard ... with bad nerves.

800
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,900
Max, which is peace.

801
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,100
You do not save you more.

802
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:16,800
They are dead, Tlkken!
They are dead, everybody!

803
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,800
- And for what?
- They are not all dead.

804
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I have two ears! I have no
education and no work!

805
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,400
I do not have you.

806
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,500
All my life was planned.

807
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,900
I am married to a diplomat.

808
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,500
Fine apartment in Stockholm.

809
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,000
Just as
my parents would --

810
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,100
- And now I sit here with you.

811
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:30,100
- Sorry.
- You drink and feel sorry for yourself.

812
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:38,500
And yet ... I have never met
a man like you, Max.

813
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,800
- Now we are in a turn.
- No, no.

814
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:04,300
You managed to blow the Danube, so you
may well go down the stairs with me.

815
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,900
Everything tends to organize itself, Manus.

816
01:47:53,700 --> 01:48:00,000

He is Norway

Tlkken and Max moved along
after the war.

827
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,900

He wrote books
and started a kontormaskineflrma.

832
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,200
He struggled with mental
problems and alcohol abuse.

833
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:05,200
Despite this, he had
and Tlkken a good life together.

834
