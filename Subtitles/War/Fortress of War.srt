translating the zamlaćivao Zorg

3
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:39,593
In mid-nineteenth century on the west
border of the Russian Empire,

4
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,904
at the confluence of the rivers Bug and Muhavec,
Brest fortress was built.

5
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,180
Powerful fortifications, fortress system,
ramparts, ditches and water obstacles,

6
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,841
were the impregnable fortress.

7
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,902
A century later, the emergence of new species
weapons, defensive properties of the fortress

8
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,244
are reduced to mimimum ...
But not people who have defended it.

9
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,439
Almost 20 years after the war,
the world is from the book by Sergey Smirnov

10
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,600
I learned the truth about achievement
defenders of the fortress.

11
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:05,471
8. May 1965 Brestka Fortress
earned the title of "Fortress-Hero".

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,004
Dedicated to the memory of
heroes of Brest Fortress

13
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,201
and to all who have
defending our homeland.

00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:52,677
We could eat one ice cream.
- And what is the movie? Tell me, please.

17
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:55,079
Let's go get ice cream!

18
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,548
Come on, only I'll be the first to arrive.
- No, I will!

19
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,433
Where are you going?

20
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:03,203
I remember ...

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,608
I remember everything.

22
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,917
In the city park, as well as
Every Saturday, there was dancing. i>

23
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:15,713

This is Anja.
Only Anja.

31
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:47,739

... Only Anja.

33
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:55,759
Wait a minute ...
Be right back.

00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,756
Saska!
Why can not you jedninici?

35
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,851
Koska asked me.

36
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:22,536
The entire orchestra is fled,

I order you to immediately

39
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,996
What are you yelling?
You're not my father either, not even the commander.

40
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:36,381
What did you razvikao front of everyone?

00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,839
Officer's family friends, gather up!

00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:04,003
Do not move.
- Come on, calm down!

47
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:07,032
It's easier to cope with the sheer,
but with you.

At ease!

Citizens, do not push it!

67
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,803
It was ordered that no one is playing,
means that today there are no tickets.

68
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:11,349
No!
No tickets!

69
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:14,861
I am telling you - no maps!

70
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:18,949
I am telling you that there are no tickets!

71
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:21,653
Means - nor the military reservation,
nor by any other basis.

72
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:26,415
I explain to you in Russian.
They gave me only 3 days to get there and back.

73
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,142
May they give the ticket.
We do not have. You can go.

74
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,184
Listen, he has a wife and small child
in Daugavpils.

75
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,819
I have to move
the new place of service.

76
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,551
For 20 th July.
That's all I can.

77
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,965
Cancel the reservation!

78
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,880
Comrade Commissar,
I am telling you as your:

79
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,999
Forbidden to annihilate
Reservations!

80
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,904
We received a directive from headquarters:
Only by special order.

81
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,992
So you will not?
- Perhaps it is good.

82
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,046
Why do you want there,
when all they want from there?

83
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,687
What exactly does this
do you mean?

84
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,534
Hell.

85
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,743
Rights desert.

86
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,012
To die with envy!

87
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,217
German cargo?

88
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,158
Hello, comrade commissars!

89
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,593
Hello, Nicholas.

90
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,182
Film drive?
- Yeah, I'm driving.

91
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:10,444
'Hey ... Come on, come quickly!

92
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,492
Come on, come on!

93
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,858
C'mon!
C'mon!

94
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,894
Togušev!

95
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:39,494
Kolja is fast, but
Togušev even faster!

96
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,628
Dear, I have not managed to get.
The fortress was calm.

97
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,248
War will not be!

98
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,522
Mat!
- The logical coincidence.

99
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:57,389
Come more.
- Come on.

100
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,615
Commissioner!
- Shape up!

101
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:06,373
You are not gone, comrade commissars?
- To go, and I do not see the end of the party?

102
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,116
Choir!

103
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:12,388
Freeze!
On the right ravnajs!

104
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,319
To the right!

105
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,327
You brought the film?

106
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:20,250
Made.

107
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,821
And more beer.
- Do not be without it?

108
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,859
Well, tomorrow is Sunday!

109
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:30,881
On Sundays people are resting.
- Resting and me.

110
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,749
Mama!
- Three beers.

111
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:36,654
No, you tell him. Why me?
- Alec, Nina!

112
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,524
You did it tell you,
You just agreed.

113
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:44,264
And mineral water for children.
- You are remembered for the children ...

114
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,477
So, are we all take?
- What's cap!

115
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:53,145
Thanks a lot.
- Come on, chaps.

116
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,779
Come on, kids.
- It's beautiful ...

117
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,242
Yes, and my mom had this.

118
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,889
RECEIPT OF GOODS

119
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,749
Did you bring?

120
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,195
Yes.

121
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,324
Certainly love again?

122
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,726
Love.

123
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:46,298
I messed up thing, buddy sergeants?
- What?

124
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,638
Little is beating you?
And as you noticed?

125
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:53,326
I played off-key, but you
know what kind of hearing is my brother.

126
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,200
And what are you playing?
- "On the Hills of Manchuria".

127
00:10:56,235 --> 00:11:00,753
By tomorrow morning, you have learned.
Tomorrow to review the odsviraš.

128
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,221
Stop the music!

129
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,652
Hruš, what are you doing?
Where bleneš?

130
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,843
Comrade Lieutenant, this is
some kind of "Swan Lake".

131
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,812
Healthy-living.
- Hi-alive.

132
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,121
Zina, thank you.

133
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:43,316
And so ...

134
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,622
And when you think,
to start a war with Germany?

135
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,271
Seriously ask?

136
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,965
Commanded to
investigate your case.

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,224
The expansion ... So ...

138
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,385
... Panic about rumor
War with the Allies.

139
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:03,151
I believe and I see that you are
convinced Communists and honorable man.

140
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:07,969
How could that happen to you, Pyotr
Mihailovic, characterized as a panic?

141
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,737
Ask those who have me nabedili.

142
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,777
Help me, Pyotr Mihailovich.

143
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,236
I have a low rank,
little authority,

144
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,700
and assignments on the throat.

145
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:28,829
I see you with
these have nothing.

146
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,605
Who sow panic in the garrison?
What do you think?

147
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:38,275
In particular I called you here to talk,
as they say - in private.

148
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,827
Tell who, Comrade Major?
- I.

149
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:48,466
Nonsense to think that
Germans will soon rush.

150
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:54,393
Nothing that I did not like
heard from someone else.

151
00:12:55,806 --> 00:13:00,529
In garrison, there is no panic,
Comrade Weinstein.

152
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,462
Sleep peacefully.

153
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,066
Here Lieutenant see ...

154
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:18,232
If you rush, you will find yourself in the environment.

155
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:21,046
Garrison of 8,000 men.

156
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:25,352
Such a torrent of people will fail to
pass only through the North gate.

157
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,456
Wife, children, aunts loaded their
things, blanket, towels ...

158
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,258
Sanatorium, his mother ...!

159
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:36,708
Much of the garrison should be
performed outside the fortress,

160
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:40,443
Places to station units.
That's what I, a war commander,

161
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:44,041
which has passed the two wars, I say.
I will continue to speak.

162
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:47,604
A whole army of the fourth? Pjotr
Mihailovic, would not guess that leave us?

163
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,137
We will not be left hanging?
- It will not.

164
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:55,673
Not, if everyone is
where it should.

165
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:59,040
Soldiers in one place
Commanders on the second.

166
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,129
When there is a soldier without a commander,
there was panic.

167
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,986
These are basic things,
Comrade Lieutenant?

168
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,367
Quite understand you,
Pyotr Mihailovich.

169
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,871
I personally our conversation
I find very useful.

170
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,387
Of course, please
to keep it a secret.

171
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,895
For discussion of your case
determined on 27 June

172
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,666
Comrade Lieutenant,
allow to leave.

173
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,560
The film starts in the club ...
- Yes, of course.

174
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,635
Petya, it's time to enter!
- Ma stićićemo.

175
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,629
Where it needs to hurry ...
- Entrances.

176
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,773
Healthy-living!

177
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:49,042
"... Ju, ju, ju, ju ...

178
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:51,593
... Warmed up our iron ...

179
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:55,125
... I'm not jealous of another,
it will change ...

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,448
... Anyway, you will be mine,
thou shalt not escape me ...

181
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,891
Anjuta, a long time I
wanted to tell you ...

182
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,335
Silence there!

183
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:14,403
Sonja? - Mmm ...
'Hey Sonja?

184
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,200
You will remain?
- See how people live, a. ..

185
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:22,773
Anjuta, a long time I
wanted to tell you ...

186
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:29,059
Time to go home!

187
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,995
Thank you, Comrade Major.

188
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,810
Petya ...

189
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,749
Tea you stayed.

190
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,867
Go lie down, Katyusha.

191
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:24,960
So they appeared in Brest
German commandos.

192
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:27,170
In our uniforms.

193
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:32,983
Turn off electricity and water
Fortress is the work of their hands.

194
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,853
What's the matter?

195
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:45,213
However today is the watchtower
defected one Pole.

196
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:48,666
Said that the war will begin
today in four hours.

197
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,488
Do you believe him?
- No, of course.

198
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:55,327
Just this week we got
ten of these and each tells

199
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:58,192

And now that is something you ask,
Nadur and went somewhere.

202
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,055
Look, it's not sick?
- Yeah.

203
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,373
Her disease is called Saska Akimov.
Our Njurka in love.

204
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,549
So these are things, Daddy.

205
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:26,631
Dreams?
- Say.

206
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,515
Remember that you promised me you'd
to take me with you on a fishing expedition?

207
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,321
No, Newry, parents will not let you.
- Silent I will iskrati. When you fall asleep.

208
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:39,273
OK Njurka, you Zasviraj,
and I'm going to smoke.

209
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,322
Let's get married.

210
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,216
And I ask you and I, the groom?

211
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,403

Now I'll be right back.
- Wait!

213
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,712
For a moment I will.

214
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,492

00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,507
Maneuvers?

219
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,732
Do not give you any to get some sleep.

220
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:10,234
I'm going to see what happens.

221
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,647
Zaleze!

222
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:19,974
What is it?
- Maneuvers.

223
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,049
Run!
- Where?

224
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,679
Home! You will find you!
- And you?

225
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,207
Where's Anja?
- Calm down. Appears.

226
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,215
Where's Anja?

227
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,272
Andrjušenjka.
- Where is Anja?

228
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,546
Petya!
War!

229
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,770
Katja! Quick!
- All of you have taken?

230
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,306
Hang in there.
- Run!

231
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:28,520
Katja!
Work the way I have taught.

232
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,322
Take shelter in the basement.

233
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,263
Petya!
- Quiet!

234
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,905
War!
- Come on, son!

235
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,966
Take a hat!
- When the silence, there will be you.

236
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,414
Petya!

237
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,502
You can find us, right?

238
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:50,940
So how?
- Stay here.

239
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:53,667
And you?
- I gotta go.

240
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,359
Katja, hold it!
- I believe it!

241
00:24:56,394 --> 00:25:00,304
See ya.
Run! Run!

242
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,136
Andrjuša. Andrjušenjka!

243
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,933
Mama!
- Andrjuša!

244
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,147
Is prone.

245
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,695
Not subject to provocations!

246
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,944
Come on, compelled!
All you waiting for!

247
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:27,918
C'mon, Bujko! Redman!
Come on, come on!

248
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:39,525
I imagined the war.

249
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:44,399
But I did not imagine ...

250
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,407
such a war.

251
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:48,633
All were waiting for him.

252
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:53,144
But no one expected
so suddenly.

253
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,687
Plain and horrible.

254
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:33,315
I fled into the house.
It was a rendezvous place

255
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:36,099
in case of war.

256
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:50,080
So it was written
in the schedule.

257
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:55,778
But the schedule has remained there,
but in the collapsed house.

258
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,474
It can not!
- Let go!

259
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,407
Get away! Without Commander
I can not give a weapon!

260
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:02,318
Quick!

261
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:11,683
I have not assigned a weapon.
- The first line, with me!

262
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:15,478
But I have had their weapons,

263
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:21,419
that do not have to
anyone's permission.

264
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,950
Appears to have ceased.

265
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,368
06:30 h.

266
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,727
Mama ...

267
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:05,124
Mom.

268
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,423
Small ...

269
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,728
Dopuzi here.

270
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:29,600
Run, run ...

271
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,441
It can not!
Here you can! Do not enter here!

272
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:39,595
Fortress. Volinska fortification.
Hospitals.

273
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,744
Where are you?

274
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,834
Well.

275
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:51,146
You can not operate!
It can not!

276
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:04,020
Fortress. Kobrinsko fortification.
North Entrance.

277
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,839
Where are you, Hatter?

278
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,165
Where are you? Where are you?

279
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,129
Mama!

280
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,826
Mama!

281
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,077
Stop Panic!

282
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,551
Stop the panic!

Fortress. Kobrinsko fortification.
East Gate.

284
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:41,824
Back when I say!
Go back to the barracks!

285
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,217
Stop the panic!
Go back to the barracks! Back!

286
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,693
Guy ... Play it!

287
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:52,090
What should I play?
Never mind, Play!

288
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,100
Stop! Stop!

289
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,547
Stop!

290
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:59,374
Child, are you crazy?
Begaj here!

291
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:02,022
Where is your weapon?
- Ma teraj up!

Commanders!

293
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:14,470
We are. - We are here.
We are lieutenants.

294
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:18,088
You are the lieutenants? I do not see.
Bring in a row.

295
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,251
I raportirajte properly, otherwise
I will make you ustrelim to panic.

296
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,472
I understand!
- All to return to the barracks!

297
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:27,845
Copy and seize weapons
Defense! Run!

298
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,777
March!
- Zamnom! - Fast!

299
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,039
Fortress. Holmsk gate.

300
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:35,453
Your resistance is useless!

301
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,348
And where are our?
- On the air to hear only the Germans!

302
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,648
Perhaps the maneuvers?
- What, who 'my maneuvers? What?

303
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:46,472
Avoid it!

00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:51,638
If the commander

00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,418
Clear.

307
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:00,310
Taking over command of yourself.
Sergeants! - Please!

308
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:04,382
Collect and share all personnel weapon.
Arrange the windows up!

309
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,376
Do not let the Germans across the bridge!
Save ammo!

310
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,711
Do not end the attempts
to make the connection!

311
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,950
Here Fortress, Fortress here ...
- Tana!

312
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:19,226
Listen to my command! Save your weapon!
- There are few weapons, Comrade Lieutenant?

313
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:21,963
Buried under the rubble!
- Politruk? - Killed!

314
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,270
All those who have weapons - here!

315
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:32,244
Further, all
You can make ...

316
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,883
The Germans!

317
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:21,457
Tana!

318
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,117
Get ready for a fight.

319
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,300
After me!

320
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:34,206
Hurray!

321
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,060
Give a man on the first floor!

322
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,960
The fortress here ...

323
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:59,572
The fortress here ...
Stick defense, we fight.

324
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,766
We are waiting for reinforcements.

325
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,559
Fortress.
132nd Military barracks Battalion of the NKVD.

326
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:18,697
What is this unit?
Who was in command?

327
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:22,454
Commanders here!
Commanders here!

328
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,226
Lieutenant NKVD, Weinstein!
- As a senior in rank, command:

329
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:29,497
leave the barracks and separate
to small groups!

330
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,734
Penetrate the fortress in small
utvrđanom groups to the area!

331
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,951
Comrade Major, let
I contact?

332
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,492
If we abandon our position
Germans can break through the fortress,

333
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:40,331
and we can reserve them
until there is help!

334
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,339
The Germans!
- Prepare to fight!

335
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:44,996
Attack on the left!
Watch out!

336
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:55,729
Lieutenant, Execute order!

337
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:04,020
Two divisions have already started
the cobra to the rescue!

338
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,710
It is pointless to sacrifice the people!

339
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:11,059
And you sergeant?
- Senior Sergeant Novikov!

340
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,821
Do you know what happens if
not carry out orders?

341
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:17,153
Comrade Major, I am guilty!
I do not know you!

342
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:20,492
Let me see your
Document! - Yes, yes.

343
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,679
Of course.

344
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:26,063
And needs.
Praise for the caution!

345
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,619
And boots, I will pray!

346
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,687
What boots?
- Show your boots!

347
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,430

Did not give the enemy

01:06:42,962 --> 01:06:47,412
There I first saw
German prisoners of war.

524
