Once my mother knows that I drank

Yes, they said.

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,436
There is a bucket of water in front of us for all.

143
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,359
Henry, we need to organize,
otherwise we'll kill each other.

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,398
Look, I am so sorry
that happened to your son

145
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,671
Why did not you take leave for few days?
- I tried it

146
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,315
but apparently
they found no other fireman.

147
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,396
I lost three sons in the war and did not get even
one fucking day off!

148
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:05,553
And one and two, and three, and four ...

149

Mom, it seemed to me
I'm the best dancer in the world!

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,598
You will,
I swear.

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,909
Put the legs aside need to pass! I need to pass!

153
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,475

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,594
- Yes?
- I need some water.

155
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,955
Me too!

156
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,076
Wait a moment! Please ..We will have to keep a record
on Paper and register those who got the water, and who is not.

157
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,235
A bucket of water stand next to you,
that does not entitle you to take when you want

158
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,748
I will no take more.

159
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,393
I am sixty years, and my husband
seventy and has severe diabetes.

160
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,238
Each of us needs water!

161
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,913
we will find a way to regulate it

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,310
Yes! Sure, right after your wife
gets the first drink!

163
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,476
Please! I want to say something

164
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,798
I know some of you to carry water
and a meal. ...., I think that those who have something

165
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,878
Should not use a common water until
consume their own supplies.

166
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,478
What are we talking about ? Water is not
much enough by tomorrow morning!

167
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,150
One bucket for all!

168
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,913
So I'll wait until the afternoon.
Then everyone will be able to drink.

169
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,479
And what about your wife?

170
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,788
She is Breast feeding! If she got no milk
the child could die.

171
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,511
Or anyone has any objection to the two mothers
who get little more water?

172
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,957
Or is there perhaps some other woman can breast feed,
instead of my wife Erika?

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,955
Thank you.

174
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,915
The wood is hard as steel, will never move.
Should We try those iron bars.

175
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,274
And then what?

176
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,476
We find the boy, who will stretch out of the window ...

177
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:17,993
Sticks his fingers into the gaps to keep.
Opens the door from outside and then we can jump!

178
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,914
Take care of her, I find the boy.

179
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,199
Of course the train must go slowly
otherwise it will be too dangerous.

180
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,753
come to me.

181
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,117
What Nina What's happening? Hungry?

182
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,914
We have some food, but we still
wait a bit longer ...

183
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,758
- I'm hungry.
- Just?

184
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,270
- she needs to eat ...
- Later ...

185
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,628
Oh, angelica.

186
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,354
We have her clean clothes. You take it?

187
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,198
Nothing happens baby,don't worry.

188
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,039
It's hot, as in Ethiopia, .
Or it has something to do with my age?

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,310
Once  its hot, later cold.

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,197
I am glad only that I've lost the sense of smell.

191
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,030
If you get water, we die.
Why do you tell a joke?

192
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,599
- I agree.
- And who know? I say "No". Go away, please!

193
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,952
I have with me several gold coins. When we get out
we can make a good use of them.

194
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,511
Do not stop me from it!

195
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,511
I warn you if  you come close to us,
I will kill you! Understand?!

196
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,395
I am from the Bar Mitzvah. I had a man!

197
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,790
Stop it! Approaching the station!

198
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,550
Bullshit!

199
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,996
On the other track coming passenger train
from Berlin! Beware!

200
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,033
Please! We need more water! Water, please!

201
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:42,368

203
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,836

204
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,995

205
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,315
Go ... did not really need a water.

206
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:31,016
Move on

207
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,156
Water, water! Please give us some water!

208
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,957

209
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,518
Anyone else want some water?

210
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,619
Now they don't need water any more any longer.

211
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,713
Albert! Can not just lie her there!

212
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,396
We'll put her in corner

213
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,514

214
00:24:50,615 --> 00:25:01,815
Look this a Jew Sold it to me
for the crumbs of bread.

215
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,315
Saddle up! Ahead! We gotta go!

216
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,953
Come to America! You hear? You have to go to America!

217
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,719
- They have a lot of pianists, they do not need me!
- imigrate to America, right?

218
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,431
- And what will you do without a pianist, my dear?
- I must die of hunger. So?

219
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,114
With your taste?

220
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,434
Our relationship is over!
Leave now , i never want to see you.

221
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,878
I divorce  you! Simply you divorce me.

222
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,315
Stop, Jacob You already know,
that i will never leave you.

223
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,718
A Pianist....Look at these hands.

224
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,112
- Do you play?
- A little ...

225
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,238
What's happening? Why it stops?

226
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,594
What do we do when very afraid?

227
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,278
The first sentence of the prayer Shema Israel. This helps!

228
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:17,034
Well ... Shema Israel, Adonai Elheinu, Adonai
Echad ... Baruch ...............

229
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,155
I'm sorry, this a military transport. we preferred
occupie all the tracks!

230
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
How long this will  take?

231
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Hours, days, God knows. trains Pass
in both directions. In any case, we must wait.

232
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,435
Shit, shit!

233
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,111
Mr. Perles we think about your
suggestion.

234
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,598
We all think that escape is not the best idea.

235
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,635
What do you think, where are they taking us,
is it Auschwitz?

236
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,595
It is not certain. but its sured,
that if we get caught, then all of us will be shot.

237
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,633
- In any case, try it.
- We should vote.

238
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,115
No vote! No discussion.
Once the opportunity arises, we must escape.

239
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,589
Henry, boy, maybe you're right.

240
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,395
Would you like To throw their
children from a moving train?

241
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,038
While at the end of our destination there will be an
expensive hot meal and a roof over  head are waiting for us.
.

242
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,639
As the train starts,
we'll get to work.

243
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,197
It is about MY son!

244
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,313
Sooner or later, when it stop again,
do we need water and food.

245
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,519
It can not be so difficult
we give small sign to him when we see soldier

246
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,995
Silence! not a single word
shut your mouth.

247
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:34,896
they will kill him

248
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,398
while passing If something happens to my child,
God will Take care of him.

249
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,931
They think I am feeding prohibited animals.

250
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,429
We will die of heat.

251
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,672
- I was completely dries.
- We have to get away.

252
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,517
not giving us no food or drink.
They do not care even if we gonna die!

253
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,871
But, they need us! You said
we're going to work!

254
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,516
They're so stupid to
keep us here to let us Die.

255
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,718
May God hear our words. If still exists.

256
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,554
And what will happen to those who can not work?

257
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,593

will be all be happy, again

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,356
Think of something nice. Also I will think of something nice.

369
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,995
When David was still in your belly?

370
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,110
You remember when we were lying
on the bed under those soft blankets .

371
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,188
What are you doing?

372
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,558
You feel his kicking.

373
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,629

00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,190
If we found any tools not surrendered

377
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,955
Jews out!

378
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,109
You were about to escape
once? to shorten the trip?

379
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,550
No tools, Lieutenant!

380
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,995
Very interesting.

381
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,555
Can anyone tell me how to open the door?

382
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,078

383
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,671

384
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,074

I do not believe you.

389
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,680
Doesn't your parents taught you not lie?

390
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,233
Small little girls who lie,
can happen bad things to them

391
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,592
Even such a beloved little girl like you.

392
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,114
And her parents can become too terrible things.

393
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,070
No?

394
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,548
Yes, please sir?

395
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,518
I'm sure you like your mother.

396
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,198
Well let me ask again.

397
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,919
Did you see the tools, you know whom it belongs.

398
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,155
Tell the truth and I'll bring
hot breakfast for you and your family.

399
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,909
I was asleep, was asleep.

400
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,712
Thank you sir,
You have very good manners.

401
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,557
I guess you're right, perhaps it's our fault.

402
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,549
Stupid lack of attention! But you can believe me.

403
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,713
This will no longer have to repeat.
Schmidt!

404
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,556

double door and tie with wire.

405

No!

411
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,633

Through the floor. At the rear, axles

01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,033
It will take at least a day, not longer.

421
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,839
Every hour counts!
- Yes.

422
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,909
Is he so hungry.

423
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,591

01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,473
Wake up!

516
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,476
Erika rehearsing yesterday.
I think it's a little help.

517
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,277
Even Aaron got a little bit.

518
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,632
Does it really do?

519
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,359
It can save David's life.

520
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,919
Will it harm?

521
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,472
I think not, my angel.

522
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,190
I can not.

523
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,513
We have nothing there.

524
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,194
I'm sorry. So sorry!

525
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,519

527
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,392
Henry? Can you continue?

528
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,748
I need to rest.

529
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,759
How do you feel?

530
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,918
Strong. In any case,
you're stronger than me.

531
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,748
Your hands are like my grandmother's hands.

532
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,549
I am helpless

533
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,050
I feel so helpless

534
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,468

01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,353

536
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,718

539
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,558

01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:14,118
But until then all gonna die!
coach is already full of corpses! Full of corpses!

541
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,318
At least be some water for those who are still alive.

542
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,553
What song should I sing for?

543
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,157
Jacob, you're a crazy?

544
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,110

01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,190
I can sing. I am a great comedian.

549
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,756
Sing your beautiful song.
Or recite few verses from Goethe. What do you think?

550
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,275
I'm hungry. Do you think that they give something?

551
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,959
- Please!

552
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,032
In any case,i will not
