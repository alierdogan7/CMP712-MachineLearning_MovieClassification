Uh, me? No, no.

20
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,343
You look like you're
dressed to leave, though.

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,845
How observant.

22
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,381
I've been summoned to cover
our army's embarkation

23
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,682
from Philadelphia to New York.

24
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,652
Oh, the retreat.

25
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,687
That's right. Well...

26
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,789
they'll do very well to have the
Queen's Rangers looking over them.

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,825
Travel safe.

28
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,260
Upon mustering
my men this morning,

29
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,831
I find two are missing...
Maclnnis and Tanner.

30
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,866
- Have you seen them?
- Can't say I have, no.

31
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,368
Cannot say or will not say?

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,638

Hey, where'd you get that flask?

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,383
That's Maclnnis's.

36
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,755
Oh. What's it doing here
and where's my bloody flask?

37
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,892
To hell with yours!
Where's Maclnnis and Tanner?

38
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,628
<i>They ain't showed today
and they didn't show yesterday.</i>

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,697
I don't understand why you
think I should've seen them.

40
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,700
Because I sent them
to follow you.

41
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,568
Why would you do that?

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,370
To look after your safety

43
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,506
since you seemed threatened
by Corporal Eastin.

44
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,541
Well, when they do show
their sorry selves,

45
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,511
tell them to return my
property, the thievin' toyles!

46
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,547
( shouting )

47
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,723
Thank you very much, Captain, but I
wouldn't worry yourself for my safety.

48
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,459
( indistinct shouting )

49
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,495
- ( rifle cocks )
- Halt!

50
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,598
Stand fast!

51
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,553
They have Maclnnis's flask!

52
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:52,770
I should never have allowed
Akinbode to leave for New York.

53
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,340
You idiots cannot keep
yourselves in line.

54
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,742
Captain Simcoe!

55
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,679
Order your men
to stand down their arms.

56
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,814
After you, sir.

57
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,967
Allowing two British forces
to bloody each other

58
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,770
wouldn't be good for either
of us, now would it?

59
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,406
Blood has already been spilled.

60
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,475
If you know what's good for
you, you'll leave this town.

61
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,944
You're in luck.

62
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,946
Major Andre has called
us to New Jersey

63

of actual importance.

64
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,586

- Clinton: Not now, Major.
- General, if you will take but a moment to consider...

78
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,921
I don't have a moment, John.

79
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,457
We're already moving
too slowly as it is

80
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,726
to entertain the notion
of moving any slower.

81
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,962
Unless you think it wise
to be trapped

82
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,632
between the French fleet
and the Continental Army?

83
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,601
Of course not, sir.

84
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,003
I think it wise to destroy
Washington's army now

85
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,839
and cause the French
to reconsider their support.

86
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,776
( sighs )

87
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,612
You propose to leave
our rear guard undefended?

88
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,948
Lightly defended.
1,500 infantry.

89
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,583
Just enough to tempt
the enemy into open ground.

90
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,620
And once they take the bait, that's
when Cornwallis brings up his division.

91
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,855
If they take the bait.

92
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,625
Lee is heading
their advance corps.

93
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,527
He will march half
of Washington's army

94
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,928
into the jaws of a trap

95
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,030
and then preside over
a disastrous retreat.

96
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,834
Their columns, their spirits
will be broken, sir.

97
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,671
Well, you're in quite the hurry

98
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,340
to end this, aren't you, John?

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,610
As I assume you are, sir.

100
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,914
Oh, I can't wait to get
back to London, true.

101
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,050
But it seems you can't wait to get
back to Philadelphia even more.

102
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:03,662
So, where do you suppose
this trap best be sprung?

103
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,835
Monmouth Courthouse.

104
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,572
The surrounding farmland will leave
Clinton's baggage train exposed.

105
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,841
We can pin his rearguard
between the treeline here

106
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,876
whilst the rest of our division
encircles them from the left.

107
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,845
He'll have the surprise
of his life, sir.

108
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,147
I fear surprise
will not be a factor.

109
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,750
Sir, our main body is so large

110
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,818
that any element of surprise
will surely be lost.

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,687
We don't need surprise.

112
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,757
For the first time in this bloody
conflict, we have the numbers...

113
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,925
Nearly 6,000 to their 1,500.

114
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,469
How have you come
by that number, sir?

115
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,134
Tallmadge, I would've hoped
that General Washington

116
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,569
would've impressed upon you
that the key to victory

117
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,905
lies in having
the correct intelligence.

118
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,175
I learned these numbers
from my scouts, of course.

119
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,711
And have they told you
where Cornwallis is?

120
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,713
If he counters our charge,
we may not be able...

121
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,181
By the time Clinton and Cornwallis
bring up their columns,

122
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,116
I'll have decimated their rear.

123
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,720
The regiments will be able to hold
the rest till Washington arrives.

124
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:05,624
Of course with our esteemed commander
camped back at Rocky Hill,

125
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,958
he's likely to miss
the whole show.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,894
( chuckles )

127
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,897
Then perhaps we should wait
for the reinforcements...

128
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,865
Perhaps you should
ready your dragoons.

129
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,735
They have the honor
of leading the van.

130
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:20,806
You get to be
tip of the spear, Major.

131
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,478
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,884
- ( chatter )
- <i> ( hammering )</i>

133
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,921
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

134
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,934
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

135
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,169
I think I've lost him.

136
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,971
Lost him forever.

137
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,241
- Oh.
- You found me.

138
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,710
No, I haven't,
'cause he's right there!

139
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,146
- There he is. Yes, I've gotcha.
- ( laughing )

140
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,182
I've gotcha, Sprout. You've got
to get better at sneakin' around.

141
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,117
Gotta get better at sneakin'.

142
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,986
Klara DeJong said
two Queen's Rangers

143
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,654
were shot dead
by the major's men.

144
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,058
No, two rangers are missing.

145
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,259
No shots were fired.

146
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,228
I think Klara's
probably a bit confused.

147
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,199
It is confusing and frightening.

148
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,134
Look, the safest place
to stay out of trouble

149
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,970
- is right here, isn't it?
- ( door opens )

150
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,271
With your papa.
That's where it's safe.

151
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,672
Abraham, you...

152
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,040
<i>( door closes )</i>

153
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,944
I'd like to speak to Abraham
alone, please, if you would.

154
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,813
Of course.

155
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,182
Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
There you go.

156
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,950
Bye-bye.

157
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,254
Please.

158
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,761
We need to compile your
final report from New York.

159
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,230
My... my what?

160
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:56,902
I intend to send the entire history
of our operation in York City

161
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,739
to General Clinton's special
adjutant, a Major John Andre.

162
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,008
Andre backs Simcoe.

163
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,211
He's the only reason Simcoe was
saved from the court martial

164
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,780
that he so desperately deserves.

165
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,248
The task of the Queen's Rangers

166
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,984
is to root out hidden
conspirators in Long Island.

167
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,021
We know that the real spies,
the truly dangerous ones,

168
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,722
- are in New York.
- Yes... yes, sir.

169
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,157
If I can prove that to Andre,

170
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,327
then he will learn that Simcoe
does not need to remain here

171
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,730
and he will move
the Queen's Rangers out.

172
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,866
Um...

173
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:32,003
but... but my mission was
a... it was a failure, sir.

174
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,872
That's not the point.

175
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,840
Perhaps Andre can find something
in your intelligence.

176
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:40,211
I need to show Andre that I am
more useful to him than Simcoe.

177
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,148
And you are
my best hope of that.

178
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,350
Let's go.

179
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,953
Uh, Major.

180
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,889
Major, please, my... my
time in prison has, uh...

181
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,290
It's played tricks
on my mind, all right?

182
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:56,761
I... I can't recall
with any... accuracy

183
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,131
the details
before I was detained.

184
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,801
I know what it is like
to look back on days

185
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,836
that you would rather forget,

186
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,306
but if we don't act now, there
will be darker days to come.

187
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,041
Take the day
to collect yourself,

188
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:14,012
but I will need
your report tonight.

189
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,119
Richard: <i> Run.</i>

190
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,357
What did you say?

191
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,226
Tonight. Don't look back.

192
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,929
<i>You've taken this
as far as you can.</i>

193
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,122
Have I?

194
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,373
This person Andre
will see right through you

195
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,974
and you know it.

196
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,276
<i>To prove you're not a liar,</i>

197
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,379
<i>you'll have to give up
something true,</i>

198
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:51,082
such as the person you were
really meeting with in New York.

199
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
( sighs )

200
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,231
I don't understand.

201
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,833
Which part?

202
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,835
Silence Hewlett.

203
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,437
Do you mean...
You mean kill Hewlett?

204
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,106
I know, it seems impossible,
all right, but it's not.

205
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,242
( scoffs ) - All right,
he still fancies you.

206
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,010
So you take him out tonight,

207
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,146
you take him down by the water,
I can get the drop on him.

208
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,048
- No.
- No, no, no, it'll work.

209
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,250
It's gonna work. We just make
it look like Simcoe ordered it

210
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,851
just like we did
those other two Rangers.

211
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,286
No, Abe. No, I won't do this.

212
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,255
- I won't take part in this.
- All right, why, why?

213
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,058
Because it's murder
and it's done in cold blood.

214
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,431
What? So, then you... you're
not hearing me, all right?

215
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,268
Hewlett plans to pass on
my name to Andre.

216
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,270
You remember him from New York?

217
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:49,007
Listen, when he hears the name Woodhull
again, when he hears Setauket,

218
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,910
where he already sent Robert Rogers to
look into the ambush that we planned...

219
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,278
There has to be another way.

220
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,380
<i>Edmund is...</i>

221
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,015
He's not...

222
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,918
- Wait, Edmund?
- Major Hewlett.

223
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,287
Yes, Major Hewlett
of His Majesty's Royal Army.

224
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,956
Have you forgotten
who our enemy is?

225
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,569
Have you forgotten we're at war?

226
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,098
You've changed.

227
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,900
Ever since you got out of
prison you're different.

228
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,402
Yeah, prison will
do that to you.

229
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,041
Are you gonna help me
get this done...

230
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,242
or not?

231
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,083
All right.

232
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,186
You'd better run along
before he gets suspicious.

233
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:49,000
( blade scraping )

234
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,075
<i>( door opens )</i>

235
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,511
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

236
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,069
<i>( man shouting orders )</i>

237
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,341
Ah, there you are.

238
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,510
Did you find your escort
to be satisfactory?

239
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,546
They were well-armed.

240
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:38,249
- Is there a problem, General?
- Not at all, my dear.

241
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,255
Father.

242
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,257
Good day, Margaret.

243
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,359
Fantastic day.

244
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,196
Shall we give her the news?

245
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,364
Yes, well...

246
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,367
after happy discussion
with this fine gentleman,

247
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,003
I have given my blessing.

248
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,539
We shall be married
straightaway.

249
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,476
Now, tell me, how do you feel?

250
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,012
I... I...

251
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,248
( laughs ) She is so elated,
she can hardly speak.

252
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,584
- Truly.
- Come.

253
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,186
When was this decided?

254
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,222
- Arnold: Just now. Here.
- <i> ( door opens )</i>

255
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,158
- A toast...
- Sir?

256
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,292
Major Wells to see you.

257
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,161
Not now, Francis.

258
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,431
He claims it's urgent, sir.

259
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,433
Urgent.

260
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:33,238
A word thrown hastily by an officer
who has never seen combat.

261
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,282
Excuse me for a moment. I must
administer a chastisement.

262
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,113
You gave your blessing?

263
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,349
- <i> ( door closes )</i>
- Don't act so surprised.

264
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,452
I hope you're proud of the
position you put me in.

265
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,088
I don't like being threatened.

266
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,490
What do you mean?
Father, what did he say?

267
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:56,561
It wasn't what he said
so much as what he insinuated.

268
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,464
A husband's duty is to
protect his wife and family.

269
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,667
And, as military governor,
he would see to it

270
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,270
that our family was protected

271
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,239
from the patriot mob
who now rule this city.

272
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,377
- I cannot marry that man.
- <i> ( marching footsteps )</i>

273
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,180
But he told me
that he'd already proposed

274
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,548
and you eagerly accepted.

275
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,118
No, I... I did not.

276
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,452
I will not.

277
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,122
Well, then tell him so.

278
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,490
I don't wish
the son of an apothecary

279
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,091
into this family
any more than you do.

280
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,194
- I can't tell him no.
- Why not?

281
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,197
Because it will insult him
and I will lose his friendship.

282
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,199
So?

283
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,634
It's complicated, Father.

284
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,504
You... you couldn't understand.

285
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:44,309
Then help me understand.

286
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,512
Why do you require
his friendship?

287
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,547
- <i> ( door opens )</i>
- ( gasps )

288
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,421
Oh, she just went to tell
her sisters the happy news.

289
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,357
- Ah.
- <i> She's a very...</i>

290
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,527
exuberant young lady,
you'll come to find.

291
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,196
One of the many reasons
why I love her.

292
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,468
- ( chatter )
- <i> ( horse whinnies )</i>

293
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,275
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

294
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,614
Cicero: <i> M-Mama?</i>

295
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,483
Hi, Mama.

296
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,020
( laughing )

297
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,597
Hey, Abby.

298
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,168
It's all right, Mama.
He brought me here.

299
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,570
All the way from Setauket.

300
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,639
"All right, Mama."
Listen to you now.

301
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,275
He's getting big, eh?

302
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,710
What's that you wearin', Jordan?

303
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,712
They got you workin'
as some kind of soldier?

304
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,281
Queen's Ranger.

305
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,685
Don't dig ditches no more, but I do
dig graves for those who cross me.

306
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,720
And humble as ever.

307
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,757
I don't need to be.
I got my freedom papers.

308
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,592
I don't look down for no one.

309
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,460
You see me lookin' down?

310
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,463
Major Andre pays me for my work.

311
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,299
We've both come a long way
since Selah Strong.

312
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,368
I didn't come here to argue.

313
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,404
Then why'd you come here?

314
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,240
To take you North.

315
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,509
<i>Now, if we're free,
we should go free.</i>

316
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,346
Right now, today, all of us.

317
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,680
Where would we go?

318
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,750
You heard of Canada?
I know the way.

319
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:36,336
You got your boy back. What
else you got to stay here for?

320
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,223
Uh...

321
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,226
like you said,
I got my boy back now.

322
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,761
I can't think about running.

323
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,663
Not yet.

324
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,769
You... you wanna think, think.

325
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,539
But know this... I'm gonna
come back to New York soon,

326
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,109
and when I do, be ready.

327
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,413
Akinbode.

328
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,728
Thank you.

329
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:27,371
Hey, you take care of her, yeah?

330
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,752
Abraham:<i> After my arrest, they
probably moved quiet altogether, sir.</i>

331
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,790
Well, are we finished, then?

332
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,761
If that's all you need,
sir, yeah.

333
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,597
I think so.

334
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,468
Well, you mustn't blame yourself
for being an imperfect spy.

335
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,705
It's a dirty business,
after all.

336
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,810
Major Andre should be very interested
in this intrigue nonetheless.

337
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,313
Um, how will you, uh...

338
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,616
<i>How will you get
all this to New York?</i>

339
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,853
You mean how can I make sure that
Simcoe doesn't try to intercept it?

340
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,524
I'll send a trusted courier
to carry the letter,

341
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,425
likely Corporal Eastin.

342
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,461
He's made the trip
several times now,

343
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,429
and I plan to encrypt
the message...

344
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,533
- <i> ( drawer scrapes )</i>
- with this.

345
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,937
What's that, sir?

346
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,339
It's called a Cardan Grille,

347
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,877
named after the Renaissance
astrologer Gerolamo Cardano.

348
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,614
Cloaks a secret message
inside an ordinary one,

349
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,350
<i>which only a matching
grille can reveal.</i>

350
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,721
It usually takes several drafts
to compose a proper mask letter.

351
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,824
It may be too dull for you
to watch, so don't mind me.

352
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,360
You've earned your rest.

353
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,362
Whatever your
misgivings, Abraham,

354
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,465
know that you have done well.

355
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,501
<i>( knock at door )</i>

356
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,808
( inhales deeply )

357
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,912
Forgive me,
but Thomas isn't well.

358
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,581
I think he may have a fever.

359
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,382
What? He was fine this morning.

360
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,684
I may be wrong. Will you
please come and look?

361
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,619
- Yeah.
- It's quite all right.

362
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,555
We're done here.
I can finish up on my own.

363
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,892
Okay.

364
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,836
Well, where is he?

365
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,708
Anna came to me and told me
what you intend on doing.

366
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,711
She already knows
I'm involved with the ring.

367
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,813
We can't let you do this, Abe.

368
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,748
- No.
- You do not have to kill Hewlett.

369
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,583
- Oh, I don't? I don't have to?
- No. No.

370
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,518
All right, then why don't
you tell me what I have to do?

371
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,487
You only have
to kill his courier.

372
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,490
- What?
- Think about it.

373
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,592
Hewlett will likely
send one courier

374
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,994
as he can't afford to spare
a whole detachment.

375
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,496
Eastin, yeah.

376
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,431
You get ahead of him
on the road, you ambush him,

377
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,633
make it look like Simcoe did it,

378
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,601
revenge for the men
that he lost.

379
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,504
Mary, I came to you for help.

380
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,440
- You did the right thing.
- Wait, what about Andre?

381
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,576
Hewlett will just send
another courier.

382
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,711
( sobbing )
Please don't do this.

383
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,847
Why not? Eastin's a rat.

384
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,549
He's the one that tried to kill
my father under Simcoe's orders.

385
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,451
There is no one
more deserving than Eastin.

386
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,521
What changed for you?

387
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,856
What happened
to "Raid the armory",

388
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,924
storm the church,
shoot Hewlett"?

389
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,597
Did you find some
hidden love for the king?

390
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,568
Or is it just for Hewlett?

391
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,949
You forge a response.

392
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,020
What? ( scoffs )

393
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:07,591
The story will be that Eastin was
ambushed returning from New York.

394
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,760
You forge a letter from Andre
thanking him for his efforts,

395
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,662
but making it very clear
that he's not interested...

396
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,830
No. - ...in pursuing
the matter any further.

397
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,765
Hewlett won't dare
to challenge him.

398
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,903
Listen to me. Hewlett will be expecting
a message that is encrypted.

399
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,838
What do you mean?

400
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,774
Why are you doing this?

401
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,843
Huh?

402
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,715
Why did you change sides?

403
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,687
I haven't changed sides, Abe.

404
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,091
I don't believe in your
cause, I believe in you.

405
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,727
And I'm done
trying to change you.

406
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,899
Though I do think I can help
you be a little less sloppy.

407
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:52,536
Now, your father keeps
a pistol in the house.

408
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,105
I know where it is.

409
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,378
- It's going to be all right, I promise.
- I know it is.

410
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,942
Redcoat: Flank formation!

411
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,848
My God, they're ready for us.

412
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,850
Halt!

413
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,659
Dress to the right.

414
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,695
- Soldier:<i> Sir, courier!</i>
- ( horse neighs )

415
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,835
Caleb?

416
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,837
- Caleb, is that you?
- Hey, Ben, what's new?

417
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,806
Where in God's name
have you been?

418
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,774
I thought you were stuck at the
bottom of New York Harbor.

419
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,744
Have I got a story for you.
Read this, hang on.

420
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,446
Forward march!

421
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:11,982
Where's Washington?

422
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,718
He's with the main company
a day behind us.

423
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:20,724
Ben, he's in danger.
It's an inside job.

424
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,893
Oh, God. I knew it.

425
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,479
What do you mean? I just
got it from Long Island.

426
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,902
It's a trap.

427
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,838
Lee's marching us
straight into it.

428
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Halt! Halt!

429
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,908
<i>- Halt!
- ( horse neighs )</i>

430
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:49,053
First company, make ready!

431
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,255
Redcoat: <i> Present!</i>

432
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,957
<i>Fire!</i>

433
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,760
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( men groaning )

434
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:57,995
Take aim!

435
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,132
<i>Fire!</i>

436
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,201
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( men groaning )

437
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,936
<i>Prime and load!</i>

438
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,205
( chatter )

439
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,141
And for this,

440
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,677
Lee receives a small fortune.

441
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,013
Well worth the price
of ending this war.

442
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,640
Redcoat: <i> Fire!</i>

443
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,852
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( groaning )

444
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,822
Second company, make ready!

445
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,257
Take aim!

446
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,092
Fire!

447
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,960
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( groaning )

448
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,196
Redcoat: <i> Present! Fire!</i>

449
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,767
Redcoat #2: <i> Battalion! Ready!</i>

450
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,168
<i>Fire!</i>

451
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,305
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( groaning )

452
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,074
Captain Simcoe...

453
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,310
it appears Wayne's right
is vulnerable.

454
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,713
- <i> Tie them down.</i>
- With pleasure, sir.

455
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,982
To the front! March!

456
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,751
Redcoat: <i> Make ready!</i>

457
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,462
Redcoat #2: <i> Reload!</i>

458
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,290
<i>Fire!</i>

459
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,167
- ( bullets whistling )
- ( groaning )

460
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,995
Fall back!

461
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,165
Soldier: <i> Lee said fall back!</i>

462
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,735
Fall back! Let's fall back!

463
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,105
Hold the line!
Hold the line, men!

464
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,876
- Stand fast, men!
- Fall back to the trees!

465
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,911
( shouting continues )

466
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,250
- Hold the line!
- Hold the line!

467
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,152
- ( shouting )
- Ben:<i> Stand fast, men!</i>

468
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:32,022
<i>- Stand fast!</i>
- Soldier:<i> Retreat!</i>

469
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,258
( gunfire continues )

470
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,332
Ben: General Lee, sir!

471
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:45,102
Generals Wayne, Scott, and Maxwell
are withdrawing through the orchard

472
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,937
and all our men
are falling back at once.

473
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,372
Yes, I know. I ordered them.

474
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,775
But, sir, if we do
not rally the men

475
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,078
and form a defensive line, we
will not be able to hold them.

476
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,847
Hold them? Hold them how?

477
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,017
Clinton has sprung a trap
and we are outnumbered.

478
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,318
Retreat is our only option.

479
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,154
Washington expects us to hold.

480
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,959
Colonel Bradford, if Major
Tallmadge does not clear the road,

481
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,062
he is to be hanged from
that tree as a deserter!

482
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,263
A deserter?

483
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,169
<i>( horses approaching )</i>

484
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,279
<i>( horse nickers )</i>

485
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:37,021
General Lee, I've had a
most disturbing report

486
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,958
from a young fifer traveling in the
wrong direction from the battle.

487
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,293
Sir, I... I thought you
a day behind us.

488
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,130
Why are your men in retreat?

489
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:50,067
They... there has been
some confusion, sir.

490
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,368
There remains some.

491
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,371
Why are your men in retreat?

492
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:57,107
Circumstances prevented
a proper advance

493
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,978
and I did not think
a major action

494
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,280
was in the best interest
of America at this time.

495
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,149
You did not think?!

496
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:09,219
You damned poltroon!
You never tried them!

497
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,857
You should not have
requested this command

498
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,326
if you did not intend to attack!

499
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,296
<i>What the hell
are you about, man?</i>

500
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,098
I apologize, Your Excellency.

501
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,333
- To the rear, sir.
- Sir... sir...

502
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,203
I said to the rear!

503
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,971

505
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,095
Colonel Bradford,
how far are their cavalry?

506
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,030
15 minutes, sir.

507
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,032
Washington: <i> I want both these
detachments into the woods</i>

508
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,234
to ambush the nearer
of their columns.

509
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,071
Major, ride out to General
Wayne and General Scott.

510
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,073
Have them hold up the enemy

511
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,009
while I form a defensive
line with artillery.

512
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,311
Yes, sir.

Whoo!

00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,505
( cheering continues )

539
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,355
Peggy: <i> I wish to apologize</i>

540
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,291
<i>for my ungracious exit
the other day.</i>

541
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,560
No, you were excited,
as you should be.

542
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,397
And I'm excited for you, for us.

543
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,165
Yes, yes.

544
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:19,369
And it will only
get better from here.

545
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,271
I've found us a mansion
on Market Street,

546
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,106
a far nicer home than this.

547
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,108
We can have the wedding
there next week.

548
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,377
I can't be married next week.

549
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,383
That did not come out
the way I intended it.

550
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,719
Oh. And what did you intend?

551
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,523
All I meant to ask of you is
if we may delay our nuptials

552
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:43,126
until my sister Elizabeth...
My eldest sister Elizabeth...

553
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,328
Can be married.

554
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,530
Ah, I see.

555
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,732
And when is
her happy day planned?

556
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,568
Well, she is not
engaged yet, so to speak.

557
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,271
Not engaged? Well, why not?

558
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,440
I've seen your sister.
She is a fine woman.

559
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,642
Betsy's suitor was a
royal officer who left

560
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,677
when the King's Army evacuated.

561
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,348
She doesn't know
if or when he'll return.

562
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,183
It's been dreadfully
trying for all of us...

563
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,719
So she is not engaged
and has no suitor?

564
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,689
When do you suggest we delay
the wedding until? Christmas?

565
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,292
- I cannot say.
- A year from Christmas?!

566
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,693
Please don't shout.

567
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,362
Then give me a clear answer.

568
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,231
Do you wish
to be married or not?

569
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,168
More than you can imagine.

570
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,470
Then why wait?

571
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,705
I, for one, am through
with standing silent

572
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,508
waiting patiently for what
I deserve now, today.

573
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:40,650
Who said anything about waiting?

574
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,623
If you wish to marry
into a Philadelphia family,

575
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,527
you must adapt
to Philadelphia customs.

576
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,732
We may have to wait
for our wedding day.

577
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,636
But that doesn't mean
we have to wait

578
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,305
for our wedding night.

579
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,644
I can't wait that long for you.

580
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:14,217
Of course, no one can know
about this but us.

581
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,486
Of course.

582
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,294
So, you see, the actual date...

583
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,498
No, of course.
Whatever you think is best.

584
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,770
<i>( music playing )</i>

585
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:02,265
- To, um...
- <i> ( marching footsteps )</i>

586
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,335
( chuckles ) To New York City.

587
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,878
Leave it.

588
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,347
A testament
to my shattered ambitions...

589
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,351
and all I've let slip
from my grasp.

590
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,687
As you wish, sir.

591
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,290
Why didn't you stop me, Abigail?

592
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,525
Sir?

593
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,397
I should never have
left her in Philadelphia.

594
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,304
And now I've
left her in the hands

595
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:45,442
of that great blue bear,

596
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:50,780
a wounded shell
of vanity and lust.

597
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:56,353
She'll turn him,
like she turned me.

598
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,854
Changed me.

599
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,893
I believe in Peggy
more than anyone.

600
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:05,862
She won't give up
until she delivers him...

601
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,665
and he delivers Washington.

602
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,607
( grunts )

603
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,945
To General Benedict Arnold.

604
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:27,617
May his treachery
bring us victory,

605
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,654
and may victory bring me Peggy.

606
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,961
( sighs )

607
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,150
Cicero: <i> Mama?</i>

608
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,810
What's he talkin' about?

609
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,246
( sobbing )

610
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,818
None of our business.

611
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,661
Now, remember, travel safe.

612
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:15,932
You know me, sir... I take the
safest and dullest route possible.

613
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:19,669
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

614
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,807
Have you seen your husband?

615
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,909
Yes. He took Thomas
down to the water.

616
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,844
He wanted to teach him
how to skip stones.

617
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,914
Ah. Have you seen my pistol,

618
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,583
the one I kept in the study?

619
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,519
Ask Aberdeen. She might have
moved it while dusting.

620
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,860
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

621
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,895
You can come out now.

622
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,434
Good boy.

623
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,637
And now, Grandpa's
going to hide,

624
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,572
and then later
we'll look for him.

625
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,575
Shh.

626
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,543

- You... you shot me.
- ( gun hammer clicks )

631
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,808
You shot my father.

632
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,353

- ( gasping )
- Shh...

637
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:10,113
( soldiers laughing, singing )

638
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,952
Ah, Bradford.

639
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,521
You survived.

640
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,591
Disappointed?

641
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,394
Hey, where are you going?

642
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,963
<i>Come back here!</i>

643
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:30,066
Come face me,
you stinking Judas!

644
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,136
Odd, you should use that word.

645
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:36,139
( grunting )

646
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,907
Go.

647
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,616
<i>( faint singing continues )</i>

648
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,786
- The commander is engaged.
- Yes, of course.

649
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,121
But if you'd just please
tell him that I have

650
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,889
some urgent news
I have to discuss...

651
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,392
The general wishes
to see Major Tallmadge.

652
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,928
Major Tallmadge, General.

653
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Ben: <i>Well,
congratulations, General.</i>

654
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,769
You've claimed the first
victory of the year.

655
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,637
It was the army's victory,

656
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,607
and that only in the most
forgiving sense of the word.

657
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,576
We turned them, sir.

658
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,145
We saw their backs.

659
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,881
<i>They won't soon forget
that, and neither will we.</i>

660
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,886
A symbolic victory, then.

661
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,755
<i>( pen scratching )</i>

662
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,158
Your Excellency, there's
something I have to ask you.

663
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,760
How long did I know
that General Lee

664
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,663
was in communication
with the enemy?

665
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:41,805
Ever since you passed
along the message

666
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:45,708
from 3-5-5 in Philadelphia.

667
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,912
- But, sir, you...
- Merely had to wait

668
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,014
for the proper time
to deal with him,

669
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,817
and with the proper
amount of discretion.

670
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,185
Like a public shaming?

671
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,921
Better he be court-martialed
as a failure

672
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:59,856
than as a traitor.

673
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,692
There can be no security

674
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,094
without secrecy.

675
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,831
Indeed. I agree, sir.

676
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,200
The value of secrecy

677
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:13,236
is why I've come to you tonight.

678
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,772
I have news from Culper.

679
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,079
Thanks to your
pardoning Hewlett,

680
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,882
Culper was freed and he
maintained his cover.

681
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,183
Now he can't go back
to New York,

682
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,052
but that's no longer necessary,

683
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:31,120
as we have a new man
in the city...

684
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,122
Robert Townsend.

685
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,925
We refer to him
as "Sam Culper, Jr."

686
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,827
And he's already provided proof

687
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,863
of a conspiracy
against you, sir.

688
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:46,035
- Conspiracy?
- Billy, would you call in the Life Guard, please?

689
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,919
Sergeant Hickey,
Sergeant McPherson.

690
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,954
Our new agent in New York

691
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,789
overheard a conspiracy plot

692
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,191
as it was being discussed openly

693
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,927
in the heart of enemy territory.

694
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:14,063
Now, he didn't catch the names
of all of the conspirators,

695
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:17,901
but we do have one of them
under guard, right now.

696
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,273
It's Lee's man...
William Bradford.

697
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,943
- Where are you holding him?
- No, sir...

698
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,879
I can't allow you to leave this
tent, for your own safety.

699
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,215
Not until we identify
the assassin.

700
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:36,719
So, by your leave, my counsel is
to have one of your Life Guard

701
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,822
quietly escort Bradford here.

702
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,758
Discreetly.

703
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,192
I'll fetch him.

704
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,901
Now, according to "Culper, Jr.,"

705
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,237
the chief architects of the plot

706
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,772
are Royal Governor Tryon
and David Matthews,

707
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,740
<i>the acting mayor of New York.</i>

708
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,109
<i>They're privately funding
a cabal within our camp...</i>

709
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,845
<i>Right now, right here...
Under your nose.</i>

710
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,214
<i>It's all there
in the report, sir.</i>

711
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:11,888
Sorry. I have to do this.

712
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,256
It will be the end of
both of us if I don't.

713
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,859
- ( gasps )
- Drop it.

714
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,964
- ( bayonet rings )
- Now.

715
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,168
<i>( faint singing continues )</i>

716
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,971
( Caleb whistling )

717
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,984
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

718
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,355
Sir...

719
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:47,156
they're secure.

720
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,094
Make sure.

721
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:58,801
Sergeant Hickey.

722
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,337
There are other charges they
can be brought up on, sir.

723
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,206
Counterfeiting, for one.

724
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,808
They can both be hanged
and no one will ever know

725
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,410
how close they came.

726
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,016
Thank you, Benjamin.

727
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,218
No, thank Brewster and Townsend.

728
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,953
And Woody...

729
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,422
I mean, Woodhull, sir.

730
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:27,030
So, 7-2-1,

731
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:31,134
<i>do you trust the integrity
of the Culper ring, then?</i>

732
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,337
With my life, sir, and yours.

733
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,108
As you said, secrecy is
the key to security.

734
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,843
( door closes )

735
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,412
Ben: <i> As long as the
ring is secret,</i>

736
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,981
<i>it is secure.</i>

737
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:48,117
( panting )

738
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,391
Kept this safe, did ya?

739
00:44:56,327 --> 00:45:00,263
( panting, coughing )

740
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:03,933
I'll be taking it back now,
if you don't mind.

741
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,406
I'm sorry to deny you

742
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:13,009
success on your little mission
on the road today,

743
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,111
but, then, that's life,
ain't it?

744
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:18,414
We're all denied everything
we don't take for ourselves.

745
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,185
- ( gasping )
- ( laughing )

746
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,021
I always knew there was
something wrong with ya.

747
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:28,024
<i>Ever since John Andre</i>

748
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:30,193
<i>sent me to this backwater.</i>

749
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,164
And now...

750
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,901
I'm sure he will live
to regret his decision,

751
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,038
because I have found

752
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,109
what he was
looking for after all.

753
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,012
You and your plucky
young freedom fighters...

754
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,447
The tavern wench,

755
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,450
the smuggler, the cavalry lad...

756
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:56,953
( coughing )

757
00:45:56,955 --> 00:46:01,958
and the farmer who
can't catch a harvest...

758
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,262
All of Georgie's
bastard children.

759
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,134
See, you're the thing

760
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,169
<i>Andre wants most in the world.</i>

761
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,239
And what I want most

762
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,541
is my revenge on him.

763
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:23,312
So let an old trapper

764
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:27,383
show you how to set
a proper trap.

765
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,565
<i>( music playing )</i>
