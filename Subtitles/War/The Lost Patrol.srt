1
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,639
Right through the lung.

2
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,122
Bell, dismount the men.

3
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,202
Yes, Sergeant.

4
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:19,837
Dismount!

5
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,038
Pity.

6
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,804
- Decent boy, in some ways.
- Yeah, no soldier though.

7
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,253
- See the blighter what done it?
- No.

8
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,007
Blasted Arabs. Hide like sand flies.
Never see them.

9
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,342
There's them GS shovels.

10
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:50,178
Will I get two or three of
the blokes to start in?

11
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:51,837
Right.

12
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,039
Sanders!

13
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,117
Corporal.

14
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:02,516
Brown.

15
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,523
Here.

16
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:05,881
Hand your horses over to McKay.

17
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:09,881
Put your rifles back in your buckets
and get them GS shovels.

18
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,721
What happened?
There was a shot and then the officer...

19
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,243
Is dead, my lad. Gwendolyn is napoo.

20
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:24,490
We are gravediggers.

21
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,678
Understand now, young fellow, my lad?

22
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:29,044
But out here?
Where are we gonna bury him?

23
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,445
Doesn't make much difference, does it?

24
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,678
- All right, men, that'll do.
- Gonna mark it?

25
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:47,386
What's the good? Bell, mount the men.

26
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Sergeant.

27
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,438
Haven't you forgotten something?

28
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:53,892
Oh.

29
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,196
Go ahead, Sanders.

30
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,723
"Almighty Father...

31
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,481
"we commend the soul
of our brother departed...

32
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,685
"and we commit his body to the ground.

33
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:22,722
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...

34
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,844
"in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...

35
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,840
- "unto eternal life, through our Lord."
- Amen.

36
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm sorry, Sergeant,
but that's not the entire service.

37
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,918
Sorry, Sanders,
but we gotta be moving.

38
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,239
If we stick around here...

39
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,439
we'll be patting you and a couple
of others in the face with a spade.

40
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,165
Put your topi on.

41
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,882
All right, men.
Return to your horses.

42
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,717
Morelli, do you see anything?

43
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:52,164
No. Nothing but sand. Plenty of it.

44
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,004
Corporal Bell.

45
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,640
Yes, Sergeant?

46
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,679
- Do you know where we are?
- No.

47
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,840
Do you know what we're here for?
Do you know where we're going?

48
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:31,194
- No.
- Well, neither do I.

49
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:31,879
Huh?

50
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,004
That young lad, that officer back there,
never gave me his orders.

51
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,477
I ask him four or five times,
and he'd always say...

52
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,195
"I'll do that, Sergeant, tomorrow."

53
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,559
Well, here's our tomorrow.
A nice one, too, ain't it?

54
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,196
Didn't he have them on him?
Wasn't they in his pocket?

55
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:53,036
No, kept them in his head.
A fat lot of good that'll do us now.

56
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,562
Where are we going now?
What are we gonna do?

57
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:57,206
Well, we're lost.

58
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:00,200
You heard me. Lost.

59
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,239
What are you figuring on doing?

60
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,225
Well, I've worked it out the best I can.
We're heading due north.

61
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,440
We ought to hit the river tomorrow night.

62
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:12,077
Yes, we may hit the river and that'll
be that. But what else will we hit?

63
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,761
Yeah. A fine thing, ain't it, huh?

64
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,158
A patrol patrolling
and not knowing where they're at...

65
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:21,245
and the orders locked up
in that dead kid back there.

66
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:23,881
Dismount.

67
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:53,436
That's it, Jock.
That'll do your horse good.

68
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,156
Pearson!

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,209
Yes, sir?

70
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,525
- You're a fool, Pearson.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,637
Now, come on.
Take it off, give it to me.

72
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:32,396
Now, come on, come on.
You know I won't drink it.

73
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,396
You'll have a little
left for tonight.

74
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,198
All right, men, walk your horses.

75
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,084
I don't know, Jock,
I will never forget the time...

76
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,204
I drank the 57 bottles
of beer on a bet.

77
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:13,081
It was in a bar in Calcutta,
the Queen's Bar.

78
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,405
- Ice cold it was.
- 57 bottles.

79
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,922
Well, I may have miscounted a few,
one way or another...

80
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,886
but I know it was 10 below me record.

81
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,759
Freezing cold it was. Gave me a chill
that nearly caused my death.

82
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,156
A pity it didn't.

83
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,490
All right, then.

84
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,361
Horse down!

85
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,926
Hold it! Halt!

86
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,477
Come on, laddie, please get up.

87
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:02,796
Too bad.

88
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,726
Sorry, McKay.

89
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,679
Here, Jock, give me that.

90
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,725
Take my horse. Go on with the rest.

91
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:40,961
Bell...

92
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:42,399
what do you make that out to be?

93
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,317
Looks like something moving.

94
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,304
Not sure. Such a glare.

95
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:55,933
- Couldn't be the brigade, could it?
- Brigade? No.

96
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:57,478
Might be Arabs.

97
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,207
Morelli.

98
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:05,733
Hey, Morelli.

99
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:09,764
You're the hawk-eye of this party.
What do you make that out to be?

100
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,919
Trees.

101
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,059
Whole clump of them.

102
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,440
Sure it ain't a mirage?

103
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,757
Mirage, my aunt.

104
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,116
Think he's right, Bell?

105
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,277
Maybe and maybe not.
Maybe it is Arabs.

106
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,483
Arabs, my eye.

107
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,637
It's palms, I tell you.

108
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,179
It's an oasis.

109
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,139
That's what it is.

110
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:41,046
- Right.
- An oasis.

111
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,686
Prepare to mount.

112
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,763
Take it easy.
Take it easy, there.

113
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:30,286
Look after your horses.

114
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,083
That's enough.
Now come on, watch your horses.

115
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:51,205
"Oh, Mother, may I go out to swim?
"Yes, my darling daughter

116
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,596
"Hang your clothes on a hickory tree
But don't go near the water"

117
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,158
Corporal Bell, come on,
get out of there.

118
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,019
You forgotten yourself?

119
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,350
You haven't watered your own horse,
have you?

120
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,990
Go on, get your rifle
and see what's in there.

121
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:10,406
You ought to know better.

122
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,801
Now come on, you men,
get out of there.

123
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:16,163
Oh, Jock, boy,
why, this is better than beer.

124
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,481
A creepy place.
What do you think?

125
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,334
Mohammedan mosque.

126
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:37,837
- I wonder how old it is?
- It's hard to say.

127
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,362
Funny.

128
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,556
Water, plenty of dates, this thing...

129
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,720
- and not a soul around.
- Yeah.

130
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:49,918
And not a ghost of an idea
where we're at...

131
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,556
what we're here for,
or where we're going.

132
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,798
I want to see the horses.

133
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:03,322
Well, the horses look good.
I bet they feel better.

134
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,206
Abelson, smarten up there.

135
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,559
Do up that shoulder strap,
and carry that rifle, don't sling it.

136
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,720
You're on duty.

137
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,120
- Is that your horse?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,999
I thought so.

139
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,546
Look at his back.
I've told you about this before.

140
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,006
You ride the officer's horse tomorrow.

141
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,317
Tomorrow?
Are we gonna ride tomorrow?

142
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,961
I said tomorrow.

143
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,959
We pull out before sun-up.

144
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,085
I say, Sergeant,
did I hear you right?

145
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:40,563
- We moving out of here tomorrow?
- Yes.

146
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:44,922
Gentlemen, I am the bearer
of joyful tidings.

147
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:46,179
Yeah?

148
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,601
We leave this charming paradise
tomorrow.

149
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,561
Paradise?
It is the devil's own backyard.

150
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:53,019
Don't jest, Quincannon.

151
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:54,356
You know what this place really is.

152
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,646
I do, and I can tell you in 50 words.
And every one of them forbidden.

153
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,317
If you'd read your Bible...

154
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,881
instead of hanging around canteens
and native quarters all your life...

155
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:06,641
you'd know that Mesopotamia...

156
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:11,082
this, this very spot that you're
standing on this very minute...

157
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,803
is the actual Garden of Eden.

158
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:18,642
The Garden of Eden!
The Garden of Eden, how are you?

159
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:21,799
I tell you, it'd take no angel
with a flaming sword to drive me out.

160
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,088
That's blasphemy, Quincannon!

161
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,720
- You'd better not...
- Blasphemy?

162
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:29,355
Are you aware you're talking to a man
who was for 10 years an altar boy?

163
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:34,077
- How you feeling, Pearson, better?
- Oh, I feel fine, thank you, sir.

164
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,441
I'm sorry I wasn't
quite up to it out there.

165
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,958
- Guess I'm not much of a soldier yet.

166
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,841
You're all right, lad. 
You did fine.You'll learn.

167
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:45,242
- Thank you, sir.

168
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,837
Sure he'll learn.
Take for an example yon Matlow.

169
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:53,240
I remember the time when he first came
to the regiment 20 years ago...

170
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:58,482
- Quincannon.

171
00:14:58,727 --> 00:14:59,716
- Sergeant.

172
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:03,241
How soon are we going to join up
with the brigade?

173
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,964
I don't know.
Tomorrow, possibly the next day.

174
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:07,201
Yes, sir.

175
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,199
Yes, but everything's all right now,
isn't it?

176
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,597
Why, yes, certainly.

177
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:19,202
Quincannon, have you seen that
the horses are securely pegged down?

178
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:20,476
Yes, Sergeant.

179
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,922
Well, I want you to
paste this in your hat.

180
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,398
Our getting back to the brigade
depends entirely on our horses.

181
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,084
Well, we've lost one today, you know,
McKay's horse.

182
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,126
- Now that's bad.
- Now, don't worry, Sergeant.

183
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,763
They're as secure as
if I was in charge myself.

184
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:36,993
They'll stand through the night.

185
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,441
Well, before you kip down tonight,
look them over again.

186
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:40,722
All right, Sergeant.

187
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:41,996
Pearson.

188
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,118
I think I'll give you a whack
at sentry-go tonight.
Will do you good.

189
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:48,317
Yes, sir.

190
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,405
All right, get your rifle
and watch over the horse lines.

191
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:51,445
Yes, sir.

192
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:01,199
Well, boys, it's hotter in here
than it is out there.

193
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,845
Hey, here's a place there might be
some shelter from the wind.

194
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,122
Come on, Matlow.

195
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:11,402
I say, jolly sort of place, isn't it?

196
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,525
There ain't no swansdown feather beds
like what you got at home, Topper.

197
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,440
The Garden of Eden Temperance Hotel

198
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,955
Brother Sanders,

199
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,638
will you lead us
in prayer, or are we to be spared that?

200
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,804
I likes that tune, Morelli.

201
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:42,444
That was my cue in the music halls.
When the orchestra did that...
 

202
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,643
I come down rolled up in the curtain.
It always knocked them.

203
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,479
Play it again, will you, Morelli?

204
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,479
That's what the band was playing
when we sailed from Tilbury.

205
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,797
And here was I,
standing on the deck...

206
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,124
and there was Molly, in a red hat,
a-waving from the dock.

207
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:05,283
First time she ever saw me in my khaki,
and the last sight I ever had of her.

208
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,245
So, there's a Molly with a red hat
in your love life, is there?

209
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:12,799
Molly's me wife, Topper.

210
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:15,681
We were married that morning
by the regimental chaplain.

211
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,156
 Married, huh?

212
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,921
Got a baby.
I'm the father of a boy.

213
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,761
Herbert Hale Jr. II.

214
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,645
Got a letter when we left Cairo.

215
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,685
I've got a picture of the nipper here.

216
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,281
It's in my haversack. I'll show you.

217
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:30,960
He's two months old.

218
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,564
- Two months?
- Yes.

219
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:42,959
Splendid fellow, Herbert.
Nothing like a family.

220
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,359
It's all right, Pearson, it's me.

221
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,518
Now, if I was one of those sneaking
Arabs, I'd have cut your throat by now.

222
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:05,316
Well, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think.

223
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:06,876
I mean...

224
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:11,876
I was just thinking.
What were you thinking?

225
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:14,962
Well, that moon.

226
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,205
It's so bright.
It sort of gets one, Sergeant.

227
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,759
I was just thinking

228
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,204
that in 12 hours' time...that same moon
will be shining over England.

229
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,443
Makes it seem sort of close.
Don't you think so, Sergeant?

230
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,405
I never thought of that.

231
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,481
- How old are you, son?
- 19, sir.

232
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,235
Public school?

233
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:43,444
No, I had a tutor for a while.

234
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:45,846
Just Mother and I.

235
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,484
She never wanted me to be away.

236
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,124
Guess that's why I'm here now.

237
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:54,200
I ran away.

238
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,000
Joined up, huh?

239
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,597
Well, I thought it was
the right thing to do.

240
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:02,160
My uncle, well,
he's in the War Office.

241
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,604
He wanted to wangle me a commission.
But I'd rather be on my own.

242
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,318
That's why I'm glad I'm here.

243
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,485
Oh, I suppose I'll get a commission,
eventually...

244
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,018
but it's a fine thing
to come up from the ranks.

245
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,043
- Don't you think so, Sergeant?
- Yes.

246
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,763
You see, you're more on your own.

247
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,322
You're around fine soldiers...

248
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:24,559
men like Mr. McKay
and Mr. Quincannon...

249
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:29,885
the kind of soldiers I read about
in Kipling. I'm crazy about Kipling.

250
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:32,485
And here I am...

251
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,125
a part of it now.

252
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,916
The finest thing is,
they're so modest.

253
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,283
They don't even see the glory in it,
do they?

254
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,917
No.

255
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:46,006
How about your mother?

256
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,439
What did she say
about your joining up

257
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:51,157
First time I ever saw her cry.

258
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,800
Well, you're lucky, son.

259
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,278
Nobody ever cried over me.

260
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,605
Well, stop looking at the moon
or you'll be seeing ghosts.

261
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:10,197
And keep your eyes peeled, because we
don't know what's out there, you know.

262
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:11,682
Yes, sir.

263
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,956
- Good night.
- Good night, Pearson.

264
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:40,516
Fall out!

265
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:52,601
Knifed in the back.

266
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,363
Aye, that's Arabs, Michael.
We've met it before.

267
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,896
The swine.

268
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:57,644
Bell, Corporal Bell!

269
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,240
- So help me...
- I'll get him!

270
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,569
Where's the horses?

271
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,721
They're gone!

272
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:05,756
Fall in!

273
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,006
Extended order.
From Cook, right turn.

274
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,726
Double. Left turn.

275
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,598
Keep 25 yards apart.

276
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,645
Circle the mosque.

277
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,802
Sergeant, I found Bell alive.
Just.

278
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,159
There's where the horses went.

279
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,679
Sergeant, can't we put
something over it?

280
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:55,595
I could get a couple of sticks, Sergeant,
and tie them together and...

281
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,556
Wait. Get Pearson's sword.
Put it there.

282
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,239
I think he'd like that.

283
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:17,435
See anything?

284
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,652
No.

285
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,435
Beats me, how in the name of holy...

286
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:09,977
Oh, shut up. We've chewed
the blinking rag about it...

287
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,103
all the blooming morning.

288
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,076
- The horses are gone, ain't they?
- Hey!

289
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,142
Whose fault is it
the horses are gone?

290
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,842
Yeah, they should never have put
that laddie out there, Michael.

291
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,243
Oh, chuck it. Chuck it!

292
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:21,522
''SaIaam a tingaI''.

293
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:23,036
''SaIaam a tingaI''.

294
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:25,078
Hey, what kind of lingo is that?

295
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:30,628
Meant to be Malayan,
or possibly Javanese.

296
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,755
- I forget.
- Been there, Topper?

297
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:37,230
Cruised around a bit.

298
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,445
- What's it like?
- Ain't like this, I hopes.

299
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:44,640
Oh, palm trees.
But you don't mind the heat.

300
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:49,119
Lots of water, flowers, mountains,
a breeze from the ocean.

301
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,003
Cruised around on a yacht
most of the time.

302
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:55,281
Tell us, what did you have to
drink there, besides water?

303
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:55,882
Oh, the usual.

304
00:24:56,327 --> 00:25:00,164
Gin and bitters in the morning,
scotch and soda in the afternoon...

305
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:05,645
and at night, sparkling champagne
served in a bucket of ice.

306
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:09,234
- Don't, don't.
You're breaking my heart.
- Shut up.

307
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:11,198
I can't say much for
the women though.

308
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:12,806
But, oh, the girls.

309
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:16,645
All Malayan females
should be poisoned at 21.

310
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,395
Before that, they're...

311
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,000
But a wee bit on the dark side,
huh, Brown?

312
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:24,475
Oh yes, they're dark.

313
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,563
But the longer you're there,
the whiter they get.

314
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,200
Or that's the way it seems.

315
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,565
That didn't bother me, Jock.

316
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:35,442
I'll never forget
the first time I saw them.

317
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:39,241
We sailed into a little harbor,
about sundown.

318
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:42,077
The girls all came swimming out...

319
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:45,478
flowers in their long hair, singing
and laughing up at us from the water.

320
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:47,481
Brown skin?

321
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,596
Seemed like gold to me.

322
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:53,037
A richer, deeper gold than any metal.

323
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:56,921
I can see that gold shimmer, even now,
on their wet bodies...

324
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,244
as they swam like mermaids to the rail
and climbed on-board...

325
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,398
laughing at us
like a lot of shameless imps.

326
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,279
Ah, man, Topper...

327
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,316
'tis the soul of the poet you have.

328
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,965
They knew they were beautiful.

329
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,686
What happened then?

330
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,560
Oh, then the men came out.
Yeah, in their war canoes.

331
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:22,440
Seems they didn't quite like the way
we were getting along with the girls...

332
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,082
- entirely too chummy.
- Did you fight?

333
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,759
Yeah, one fellow heaved a spear at me.

334
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:30,466
I suspect it was his girl
I had under one arm...

335
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,646
while I was trying to heave up
the anchor with the other.

336
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,764
Go on, go on.
Don't keep us in suspense.

337
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,045
- What come of it?
- Nothing. We sailed away.

338
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,440
Hey, but the lasses?
What about them?

339
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:43,759
Oh, later on,
when we passed by the coast again...

340
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,717
they slipped over the side
and swam ashore.

341
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,038
- How about it?
- Oh, shut up.

342
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:52,439
Ain't you got no imagination?

343
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:56,003
But all the same, Topper,
you didn't ought to leave 
us high and dry like that.

344
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,523
They want the gory details,
you know, color.

345
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:04,758
What their minds will run to
is far more exciting than
what actually happened.

346
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:05,996
Brown!

347
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,879
I want a word with you.

348
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:15,921
- Go ahead.
- I would rather...

349
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,680
In a way, I would rather have spoken
to you in private, but that'd be cowardly.

350
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:25,436
I will say it in front of these...
I will say it in spite of...

351
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:26,962
Bub, what's all this for?

352
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,802
It's for your sake, for you.

353
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:31,716
Oh, Brown, I implore you to listen.

354
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:38,148
Is your whole life
so filled with filthy drunkenness...

355
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:41,677
brawling and lust, that here now...

356
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,123
perhaps close to your death...

357
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:47,116
the only thing left for you to do
is to live it all over again in your mind?

358
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:49,682
Oh, pack up. It's too hot to listen.

359
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:51,997
- But Brown...
- And don't shout so.

360
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:55,080
Brown, you're a gentleman,
you've got breeding.

361
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:56,999
You must have faith.

362
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:58,636
Why?

363
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,636
Why?

364
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:09,522
In heaven's name, man,
what do you believe in?

365
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,680
What do I believe in?

366
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,479
Would it really interest you?

367
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,086
Oh, a lot of things.

368
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,486
A good horse...

369
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,646
steak and kidney pudding...

370
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,602
a fellow named George Brown...

371
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,721
the asinine futility of this war...

372
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,601
being frightened...

373
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,878
being drunk enough to be brave...

374
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,205
and brave enough to be drunk.

375
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:44,880
The feel of the sea when you swim,
the taste and strength of wine...

376
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:48,162
the loveliness of women, the splendid,
unspeakable joy of killing Arabs...

377
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:56,022
the smell of incense and bacon,
the weight of a fist...

378
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:58,063
an old pair of shoes,
toothache, triumph...

379
00:28:58,134 --> 00:28:59,877
Stop!

380
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,442
All right.

381
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:06,321
Oh, you're barmy, soapy.
Shut your trap. Leave us alone.

382
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,600
- Hey, hey...
- Hey, wait a minute.

383
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,720
You leave him alone, Abelson.

384
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,510
He can't help it.
You're more offensive than he is.

385
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:14,200
- What's that?
- I said, you're offensive.

386
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,414
Abelson! Abelson, take it easy.

387
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:19,085
Oh, go on. You're nothing but
a second-rate, broken-down, heavyweight.

388
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,182
If I have to get to my feet,
you're gonna regret it.

389
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,517
- Get to your feet.
- No, no!

390
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,217
- Brown, no!
- Hey, wait a minute, come here!

391
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:25,783
Take it easy!

392
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:26,646
Brown! Abelson!

393
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:28,962
Put on those topis.

394
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,925
Sanders, come here.

395
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:40,197
You're supposed to be
looking after Corporal Bell.

396
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,395
Get inside.

397
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,000
I wanna talk to you, men.

398
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:08,204
Sorry, Sergeant, about that scrap.
Must have been the heat.

399
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,597
- Sorry, Abelson.
- All right.

400
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:15,564
Well, what do you think
of our chances here?

401
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:18,841
Well, I think the position
is extremely dubious.

402
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,756
- Now, what do you think?
- Well, I'll tell you what I know.

403
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,082
Nothing.

404
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,599
I don't know where we are.
I don't know where we're going.

405
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,519
I don't even know where the brigade is.

406
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,987
It's my fault. It's me.
I told you I was a Jonah

407
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,475
Bad luck, that's me.
Bad luck, if you say so.

408
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,922
Of course, our horses are pinched.
That's Arabs.

409
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,966
What's your opinion, McKay?
How many out there?

410
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,801
Well, we examined the tracks
of the horses. There's not many.

411
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,647
- That's just what I think.
- How so, Sergeant?

412
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,407
Well, if there'd been more than a few...

413
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:52,397
they'd have rushed us in force
and wiped us out.

414
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:53,681
- Aye.
- That's true.

415
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,281
How about stalking out somewhere
on foot, Sergeant?

416
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:58,315
With our rifles,
and fighting it out tonight.

417
00:30:58,386 --> 00:30:59,957
And leave the Corporal here alone?

418
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:02,063
How would you carry
him without horses?

419
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,646
We've gotta stick here and
take our chances of being relieved.

420
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:11,036
We've got water, we've got dates.

421
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,005
But first we've gotta see.

422
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:16,955
You think you can see everything
in the desert, but you can't.

423
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,799
Hardly a thing out there.

424
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,004
We've gotta see for miles.

425
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:26,136
Sergeant, how about me climbing to the
top of that palm tree and having a look?

426
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:27,475
I could see from there to Bloomsbury.

427
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,978
- That's it.
- Go on, Hale. I'll help you.

428
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,050
All right. Let's go.

429
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,556
That's a boy!

430
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,962
Come on, old boy.

431
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:46,791
Hey.

432
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,461
A little bit of how's-your-father.
Will you all mind?

433
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:50,935
Right. Coming up.

434
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,016
- See anything?
- Can't see what I'm looking for...

435
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,983
Molly's red hat on the dock.

436
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:09,113
Are you sure it's the red hat
you're looking at?

437
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:12,647
If she has a friend with her,
let me know, will you?

438
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:20,096
Half a mile. I see something.

439
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,725
It's moving.

440
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:24,362
Looks like the sun
shining on a rifle barrel.

441
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:27,305
- Where?
- Right over there, behind that dune.

442
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:29,740
Right over there, in the shadow.

443
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,603
Look out! Clear!

444
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,482
Hale, Hale, Hale.

445
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:44,557
Right through the head.

446
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,633
See here, men.

447
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:08,404
There's a strip of paper in here
for each one of us, except Sanders.

448
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:10,473
I'm leaving him out of it.

449
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,650
All right with you?

450
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,821
There's one of them longer
than the others...

451
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:26,662
and the man that gets it,
picks his mate and slogs out
for the river tonight.

452
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,693
It's our only chance.
We've gotta get help.

453
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:35,533
Anybody object to doing it that way?

454
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,045
No? All right.

455
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,341
Here they go.

456
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:48,677
Now, keep it as it is. Don't unroll it.
I'll draw the last.

457
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:55,556
Abelson.

458
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:04,565
Morelli.

459
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:16,446
All right, unroll them.

460
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:34,000
- It's up to you now, Cook.
- Aye.

461
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,432
Relieve Morelli.

462
00:34:35,602 --> 00:34:37,365
Come on, choose your sidekick.

463
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:40,066
- Who would it be, but myself.
- No, no, Michael. You are too late.

464
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,506
If Matlow goes, I go with him.

465
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,342
- He'll need my knowledge of soldiering.
- What did you say about soldiering?

466
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:51,714
- Well, in my 25 years of service...
- And what about my 27?

467
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,950
Three of them in the guardroom.

468
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:56,489
The guardroom?
Boys, did you hear that?
The guardroom.

469
00:34:56,557 --> 00:34:59,549
Listen, Jock, to your teeth,
that's a dirty red lie.

470
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:03,392
Forget it, forget it.
Brown, flip a coin. You decide.

471
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,662
Have you got a shilling?

472
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,328
Oh.

473
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,936
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo,
catch a boodoo by his toe...

474
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:18,273
if he hollers, let him go,
eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

475
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:21,075
Now, that settles it.
McKay, you go with Cook.

476
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:25,585
And you better get your gear together.
Take all the water bottles, except two.

477
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,779
You'll leave tonight
when the moon is down.

478
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,255
Aye.

479
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:34,889
Oh...

480
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:36,986
by the way...

481
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,093
they might not...

482
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:44,565
There's a chance
they might not get back in time.

483
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,503
Now what I mean to say is...

484
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:49,599
if any of you fellows
want to scribble a few lines...

485
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,509
I've no objection of
McKay taking them along.

486
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:13,122
Remember, Jock...

487
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,565
- keep to the north all the time.
- Right.

488
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:19,128
Head to the river
and you'll find the brigade.

489
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:24,776
Here's some letters.
Morelli's, Quincannon's, Sanders'.

490
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,172
Here's mine.

491
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:34,346
I didn't know that, Sergeant.
You're a man to be envied.

492
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:36,981
- Thanks.
- Well, Matlow, here we go.

493
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,456
Goodbye to you, Sergeant.

494
00:36:39,526 --> 00:36:41,926
We'll be sending along for you shortly.

495
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:43,485
We'll be looking for you.

496
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:44,963
- Say goodbye, Jock, old scout.
- Goodbye.

497
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:46,761
And have a couple of pints for me
when you get there.

498
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,027
So long, Jock.

499
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:49,261
No sweating on the way.

500
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:52,732
- Good luck, Jock.
- I'll try, Michael.

501
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,433
- See you.
- Bye.

502
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,924
- How you feeling, Abelson?
- Oh, I'm all right.

503
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:53,199
Only it's so blooming hot...

504
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,517
I'm sweating worse than
when the sun was up.

505
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,877
Want me to take your
turn at sentry-go?

506
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,126
I'm not asking any favors.
I'll do my part.

507
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:05,677
Well, you'll be relieved pretty soon.

508
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:11,240
Keep your topi on, son.

509
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,076
- What's up?

510
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,596
- Abelson. Look.

511
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,446
Over and beyond Abelson.

512
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:47,881
See that moving there?

513
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:49,321
200 yards.

514
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,080
Blank fire and keep firing.

515
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,081
He's moving.

516
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:06,559
Morelli! Come back, you fool.

517
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:08,082
Come back!

518
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,636
Morelli, you fool. Come back.

519
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:24,443
Come on, cover him up. Rapid fire.

520
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,600
You mustn't go. Don't go.

521
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,800
Sergeant. Sergeant! Corporal Bell!

522
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:13,835
Oh, Father.

523
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:16,008
Father of mercy.

524
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:28,996
Sergeant!

525
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:34,555
- What's up?
- Something moving out there.

526
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:36,326
Right back of that dune.

527
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:39,636
Turn out!

528
00:41:53,087 --> 00:41:54,076
Horses.

529
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:56,162
Get ready.

530
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:08,036
Let them have it.

531
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:13,115
Wait, they're not Arabs.

532
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,040
They're our horses.

533
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,481
It's McKay and Cook.

534
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:45,159
Oh, look at their faces.

535
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:47,361
Oh, Jock. Jock, Matlow.

536
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:49,685
Quick, lend us a hand.
We gotta get them out of here.

537
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:55,680
The dirty, filthy swine.
I'll get one of you for this.

538
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:58,527
By the cross of Croagh Patrick,
by the blood of the mother that bore me...

539
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,002
you shall suffer.
I'll get you for this. I'll get...

540
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:08,122
- Quincannon! Come back!
- Come back, you fool!

541
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,164
- Come back, Quincannon!
- Bastards!

542
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:30,562
Morelli.

543
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:32,900
Morelli.

544
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:41,909
Morelli.

545
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,318
Did you see their faces?

546
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,884
McKay and Cook?

547
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:52,717
Their eyes and mouths...

548
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,517
all choked up with...

549
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,877
Shall you ever forget it?

550
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:04,435
Oh, shut up, will you?
I'm trying to forget it, blast you!

551
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:07,155
I was dreaming,
thinking I was back in Blighty.

552
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,806
And you wake me up.

553
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:12,475
First, it was the Lieutenant...

554
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:15,204
then it was Pearson.

555
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:19,876
Oh, suck it, will you?
What's the use of talking about it?

556
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,064
Then it was Hale...

557
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:25,006
Abelson...

558
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:27,682
Bell...

559
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:32,236
McKay, Cook...

560
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,281
Quincannon.

561
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:39,005
And now he's gone.

562
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,644
What are you talking about?

563
00:44:50,727 --> 00:44:53,002
You're not going the way they did.

564
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:55,805
They weren't prepared.

565
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:59,882
I'm going to save you, Morelli.

566
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:02,797
I know my mission now.

567
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,437
I'm going to make you believe.

568
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:06,796
Listen, Sanders,

569
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:09,563
I'll blow you to kingdom come.

570
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,206
I will, so help me. 

571
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,883
I'll splatter your brains 
against that wall.

572
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:15,166
- Now stay away and shut up, will you?

573
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,805
- Steady on, steady on.

574
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:18,799
Easy with that rifle, Morelli.

575
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:20,236
- What's up?

576
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,285
He's crazy, Sergeant.
He ought to be tied up.

577
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:26,565
If you don't keep him away from me
I'll kill him, so help me, I will.

578
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,479
Morelli, get hold of yourself.

579
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:34,435
Sanders! Go wake up Brown.
Time I was relieved.

580
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:38,481
He's gone.

581
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:42,758
Gone? Who?

582
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:44,076
- Brown.

583
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,884
He went out of that door.

584
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,517
He said you'd understand.

585
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,196
What?

586
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:58,516
He wrote something in my Bible...

587
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,761
for you.

588
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,086
Deserted?

589
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:14,522
Insubordinate swine.

590
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:17,602
Bilged out.

591
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:21,559
Left us like a rat,
when we needed every man.

592
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,766
Why didn't you tell me?

593
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:27,084
You're a party to this, you know.

594
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:34,358
Get your rifle and get out of here.

595
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:35,922
You take his place.

596
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:38,918
Yes.

597
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:43,603
Yes, that's it.

598
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,317
That's it, Sergeant. Yes.

599
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:57,526
"Sorry, Sergeant...

600
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:01,564
"but Quincannon was right.

601
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:03,963
He marked off one for Jock.

602
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,403
"I'll get another for Matlow.

603
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,165
"Taking a long swing to come around
behind them.

604
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:14,000
"Fine moon tonight.
Should be good hunting.

605
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:16,682
"Yours contritely, George Brown.

606
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:18,276
"PS:

607
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,406
"Not a good name...

608
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:23,767
"but the best I could think of
when I enlisted."

609
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,802
I guess you don't know
what I mean, Sarge.

610
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:47,365
Guess nobody else does.

611
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,319
You're not bothered with no woman.

612
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:53,325
Never seen you look at one.

613
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,597
You never was married, like,
was you, Sarge?

614
00:47:58,327 --> 00:47:59,999
- Yes.
- Yeah?

615
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:03,798
That's funny.
I never heard you talk about it.

616
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:06,442
She died.

617
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:10,355
Kind of made me hate the kid at first.

618
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:12,002
Oh.

619
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:13,998
- That way, huh?
- Yeah.

620
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,157
Seemed to me
the little beggar was to blame.

621
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:21,206
I didn't want him. I wanted her.

622
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,275
- Little blighters grow on you, though.
- I suppose so.

623
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:29,001
I'll never know.

624
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,275
Pretty soon,
all I could think of was the kid.

625
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:36,442
Wanted him to have
everything I'd missed.

626
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:40,727
Found myself working
hard for promotion.

627
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:43,967
More pay. Saving every bob.

628
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:47,118
Cor, I had it all figured out.

629
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:49,604
Sent him to a good school.

630
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:53,037
Oh, he's a fine little fellow, Morelli.

631
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:54,920
You ought to see him.

632
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,362
That's what I've been fighting for.

633
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:03,722
What'll happen to him now,
without me?

634
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:08,280
Oh, forget it.

635
00:49:10,287 --> 00:49:13,642
- If only something would move out there.
- Don't worry.

636
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,517
- You ever had ambition?
- Yeah.

637
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:20,803
Jessie and me
always wanted to play the Coliseum.

638
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:22,765
Well, I've had it bad in my time,

639
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:24,963
but I've never had it like I've got it now.

640
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,364
Swine...

641
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:28,960
hiding out there.

642
00:49:29,607 --> 00:49:30,722
I'll get them.

643
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,323
I tell you, I'll get them, Morelli.

644
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:37,959
- And then I'll die.
- Easy, Sarge, don't you go that way.

645
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,797
Hey!

646
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:23,280
He sees us, Sarge!

647
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:26,983
He sees us!

648
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,398
Sanders, Sanders, look! See it?

649
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:35,716
Look!

650
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,727
You see that, Sanders?
We're all right now.

651
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,275
We're all right now.

652
00:50:56,791 --> 00:51:00,090
- He's landing, Sarge.
- Morelli, Morelli, we're crazy.

653
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:08,560
Hello.

654
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:11,731
We mustn't do it.
If he goes walking across there...

655
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:13,019
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- I never thought of that, Sarge.

656
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,044
Get away!

657
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:16,363
- Don't do it! Turn back!
- Get away!

658
00:51:20,527 --> 00:51:23,087
- Don't do it!
- Turn around!

659
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:23,113
- Go on!
- Don't do it.

660
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:24,356
- Get away!
- Hey!

661
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:32,452
I say...

662
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,892
I say, you chaps should...

663
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,797
You did that! You've killed him!

664
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:49,277
He came in answer to my prayers,
for me...

665
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,444
and you killed him,
you murdered him!

666
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:57,839
Tie him up, Morelli.
Tie him up before I kill him.

667
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:15,676
Look at it out there, mocking us.

668
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,759
What good does it do us?

669
00:52:18,687 --> 00:52:20,166
Better if it wasn't there.

670
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:26,281
- Ever been up in one, Sarge?
- No.

671
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,484
Let's do something.
I can't stand this.

672
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:33,560
- Let's take a whack at it.
- Good idea.

673
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,844
- You know how to start it?
- No.

674
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:37,725
I don't know one
jigger from the other.

675
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,006
All I know is horses.

676
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:41,880
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

677
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:43,842
I'm thinking...

678
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:46,841
if we'd have rushed them, right off,
the minute we got here...

679
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:50,766
What's the use of chewing the rag
about something we might have done?

680
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:52,806
Right you are, Sarge.

681
00:52:53,127 --> 00:52:55,277
Yeah, I know what you're thinking!

682
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:58,883
Perhaps I've done everything wrong.
Perhaps this, and perhaps that.

683
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,364
But what I've done, I've done!

684
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:03,404
And what I haven't, I haven't!

685
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:07,636
Sorry, Morelli.

686
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:09,884
Shouldn't fly off like that.

687
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,760
- I'm getting jumpy.
- That's all right, Sarge.

688
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:17,842
- Forget it. My fault.
- No, it's mine...

689
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:21,564
because I...
Well, I blew up like that because...

690
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:26,234
Well, I've done all the thinking
in this outfit.

691
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:30,834
Had to meet everything that came along.

692
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,539
My head was twisted silly, thinking.

693
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:37,743
- Good job you was with us.
- Thanks.

694
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:38,999
But the thing that gets me most...

695
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:42,040
is being done in by them sneaking Arabs.

696
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:45,685
What does the war mean to them?

697
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:48,599
Might just as well be friendly.

698
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:51,916
Some are, some ain't.

699
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,486
- They'll get us all right.

700
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:58,322
- Yeah, but we'll get them, too, see.
That's all I want now.

701
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,717
That's the only idea I've got in here.

702
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:03,044
See, I'm thinking, Morelli.

703
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,805
That's all I've been doing.

704
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,806
All day and all night.

705
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,236
Thinking, thinking.

706
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:15,606
I've got an idea.

707
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:20,082
We're going out there, you and me.

708
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,516
Try and start it?

709
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,003
Don't be crazy. I said an idea.

710
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:29,559
I'll leave this behind.

711
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,684
- You stay here and cover me.
- Wait a minute, Sarge...

712
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:33,684
- I'll go along with you.

713
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:37,122
- You stay here.
No, Sarge.

714
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:39,641
I can tell you, I'm scared...

715
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:43,158
scared of being alone, the last man,
no one to talk to.

716
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,484
I'd go bug-house like him.
I couldn't stand it.

717
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,276
All right.

718
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,117
Leave it here. Come along.

719
00:54:52,407 --> 00:54:54,477
- Leave it?
- Yes, I said leave it.

720
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:56,516
Come on.

721
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:29,024
Halt!

722
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:32,436
Sergeant Clegg.

723
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,399
What do you make that out to be?

724
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:44,045
Fire of some sort, sir.

725
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:46,881
How far do you think?

726
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:50,362
Five or six hours, sir.

727
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:57,566
Forward march!

728
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:50,684
Sergeant! Sergeant!

729
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:59,006
I thought I saw something
moving out there!

730
00:58:03,007 --> 00:58:04,565
Couldn't have been though, huh?

731
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:07,483
I'm getting jumpy.

732
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:13,040
No. No, it ain't that, Sarge.
I'm scared. Scared of being alone.

733
00:58:13,287 --> 00:58:16,006
Scared to be the last man,
I gotta talk to somebody!

734
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,997
Well, we're alone now.

735
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:21,315
He's gone.

736
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:23,917
- Sanders?
- Yes.

737
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:34,885
Morelli, look!

738
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:38,356
Sanders, come on back here! Sanders!

739
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:42,842
Morelli!

740
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:45,516
Sanders

741
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:47,445
Sanders, don't stick your head up there!

742
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:47,586
Sanders, what's wrong with you?

743
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:49,484
Morelli, come back! 

744
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:51,116
Let him go!

745
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:53,798
Stop walking, will you!

746
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:30,759
Come on, you swine!

747
00:59:31,007 --> 00:59:34,443
Come and get me now!

748
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:35,676
Come and get me! Come on. Come on.

749
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:37,959
Come on, you swine!

750
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:46,156
Come on!

751
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:47,602
Come on!

752
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:38,243
Quincannon, I got them!

753
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,079
Quincannon, Brown!

754
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:42,397
There they are! I got them!

755
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:46,319
Morelli, Pearson! Pearson, Morelli!

756
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:50,043
McKay, look! Look at them! l...

757
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,602
Full halt!

758
01:04:29,567 --> 01:04:31,876
Been looking for you, Sergeant.
Where are your men?

759
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,161
Speak up, man. 

760
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:38,806
Where's your section?
