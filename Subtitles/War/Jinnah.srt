1
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,834
Miss Jinnah.

2
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,379
Doctor.

3
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,377
Steady flight?

4
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,627
(Engine splutters)

5
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,792
- Why have we stopped?
- Engine.

6
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,247
(In Urdu) We can fix it.

7
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,956
(Man) It's out of petrol. It was spluttering.

8
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:35,544
- No, no, I'm sure it's engine failure.
- Let's use the car.

9
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,127
No. Absolutely not.
You can't move him.

10
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,501
- Colonel Knowles, fetch some petrol.
- Get another ambulance.

11
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,626
(Colonel Knowles) Let's go.

12
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,501
Doctor, quickly.

13
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,671
(Gasps)

14
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,789
(Man) Oh... just put those things
over there... and clear off.

15
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,584
Look, I'm quite happy with pen and paper.

16
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,539
I do not want... Oh...

17
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:11,247
Jinnah Sahab.
Assalamualaikum.

18
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,246
- Walaikumasalam.
- (In Urdu) Forgive me.

19
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:17,496
I thought you were one of these
wretched computer wallahs.

20
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:20,706
They keep sending these
damned machines in from the future.

21
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,834
- (Phone rings)
- Excuse me.

22
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,001
Yes?

23
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,576
No. No, no, no.

24
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:33,329
No appeal. Tell him to go to hell.

25
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:38,044
You do know where you are...

26
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,917
I have a vague idea.

27
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,882
You've stopped here
so we may decide where to send you.

28
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:48,251
With all due respect sir, may I know
how you arrive at these decisions?

29
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,956
(Clicks tongue) Ah...

30
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,794
Here. We have everything here.

31
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,707
We've been expecting you.

32
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,214
What...

33
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,334
Oh, no.

34
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,629
They've transferred
every detail of your life

35
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,081
into these wretched computers.

36
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,499
No one here knows how to use them.

37
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:13,536
And the manuals are written in
God knows what language.

38
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,667
(Sighs deeply)

39
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,084
Your file's gone.

40
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,247
As it is, we're overworked.

41
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:26,536
We've had lots of trouble
with your century.

42
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,627
World wars, revolutions, communism,
capitalism, fascism,

43
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,961
this ism and that ism.

44
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:36,254
Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse-tung.

45
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:38,706
Mr Harry Truman and his nuclear bomb.

46
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,214
Yes...

47
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,174
We've had a very busy time here.

48
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,004
And where did you send them?

49
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,126
I can't even remember.

50
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:54,042
The problem you fellows pose
is desperate.

51
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,631
You create Pakistan...

52
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,131
and millions die
in the division of what was one country

53
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,881
into two pieces.

54
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,831
There was no other way. None.

55
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,417
Maybe. Maybe.

56
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,132
Please, follow me, Mr Jinnah.

57
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,792
(Projector whirrs, indistinct voices)

58
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,127
(Jinnah) I did everything I could
to stop the slaughter.

59
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,501
I fought for Pakistan.

60
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:30,206
So that 100 million people
could live in safety and dignity.

61
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,667
(Other man) I've got an hour and a half
to prepare your case.

62
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,922
What are the charges?

63
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:42,792
They accuse you of being ambitious,
arrogant, humourless, stubborn.

64
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:46,287
A man without charm, a bully.

65
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,127
They say you used people.

66
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:52,671
I had no ambition. Except for
the safety of the Muslims of India.

67
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,881
I had no stubbornness or arrogance,

68
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,421
except that which was required of me,
to face my enemies.

69
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,501
And I died a million deaths, myself,
for all those who suffered

70
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,746
through Partition.

71
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:10,956
No, Jinnah Sahab, just the facts.

72
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:14,174
Facts? What facts?

73
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:18,292
You've lost the books.
You don't understand the machines.

74
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,876
Oh... I see what you mean.

75
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,286
Well...

76
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:29,247
There is, of course,
the eternal shortcut.

77
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:35,577
'At Harrow, we got into the habit
of calling everyone 'sir'.

78
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,749
'I called my father 'sir'.'

79
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:41,376
(Chuckles)
I called my mother 'sir'. Everyone.

80
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:45,381
It's a great British tradition.
When in doubt, call them 'sir'.

81
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,421
I'll suggest it to Dickie.

82
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,882
He only calls you Panditji
to annoy Jinnah.

83
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,881
(Man chuckles)
It's difficult, isn't it?

84
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,171
And what do we call Gandhi?
Mahatma. Bapu...

85
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:59,252
Gandhiji... Mr Gandhi.

86
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:02,786
He has more names than a character
in a Russian novel.

87
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,917
Perhaps it's best to behave
like a good Indian wife.

88
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,752
They don't call their husbands anything.

89
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:09,786
Just nudge 'em.

90
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,957
And what do you think
of Western civilisation, Mr Nehru?

91
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:16,884
(Nehru) 'Oh, I think it would be
an excellent idea.'

92
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,171
(Both chuckle)

93
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,129
That's private!

94
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:29,166
You're not happy, are you,
Jawaharlal?

95
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,582
You want the British... us...

96
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,959
to go, but you don't want
the bond to be broken.

97
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:38,714
What the British have left us
will last a long time.

98
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,504
- In people like you?
- Oh, I'm proud of it.

99
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,576
Did Mr Jinnah
go to Oxford or Cambridge?

100
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,079
No, he didn't.

101
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,419
Er, but he was called to the bar
in London.

102
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:55,542
(Chuckles) And I'm told he even did
a stint as Romeo on a London stage.

103
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,287
(Chuckles)

104
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,037
"It was not the lark
but the nightingale

105
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,497
"who..." (Chuckles)

106
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,416
"...who..." (Chuckles)
Who forgot the rest.

107
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,792
Oh, Jawaharlal, you're lying.
He never played Shakespeare.

108
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,707
(Nehru) No, it's true!

109
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:17,004
It's funny. He seemed so proper
when we first met him in Delhi.

110
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,916
His propriety doesn't bother us.

111
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,172
His stubbornness, vaingloriousness...

112
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,502
Wait till the discussions begin.

113
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:29,166
Dickie's in for a surprise.

114
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:33,002
I know he thinks
he's the Great Persuader.

115
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:37,666
Jinnah is the Great Unpersuadable.

116
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:42,376
The Great Unpersuadable?

117
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,379
(Man) Divide the country in two?

118
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,421
Muslims on one side,

119
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,212
Hindus on the other?

120
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,246
Mr Jinnah...

121
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,626
that is madness.

122
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,421
Lord Mountbatten...

123
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,922
It would be equally insane
to leave a Muslim minority

124
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:09,042
at the mercy of a Hindu majority,
many of whom hate us.

125
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,997
- Now, if the English parliament...
- The prime minister...

126
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:14,166
has given me full powers.
I decide.

127
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,962
That's why I'm here.
As representative of the King Emperor.

128
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,504
Whom we respect.

129
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:26,536
And I am here a representative
of a Muslim nation,

130
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,627
whom you must learn to respect.

131
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,751
(Distant shouting)

132
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,246
(Jinnah coughs)

133
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,416
- (Man) Pakistan!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

134
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,632
- (Man) Pakistan!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

135
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,671
- (Man) Pakistan!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

136
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,792
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!

137
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,827
- (Man) Pakistan!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

138
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!

139
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,174
- (Man) Pakistan!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

140
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:58,582
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!

141
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,209
Mr Jinnah, what did Lord Mountbatten
think of the Pakistan demand?

142
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,634
I suggest you ask him.

143
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:08,081
I do not speak for the King Emperor.

144
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,789
Jinnah Sahab.
We were told that you are... humourless.

145
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,537
Oh, really?
It's that fellow again.

146
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,167
He's a member of the Congress Party.

147
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,752
Because I don't laugh at his jokes,
he goes around spreading this rumour.

148
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,416
(Laughter)

149
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:28,787
You call yourself Muslim and you parade
your respected sister in front of crowds,

150
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,247
shamelessly?

151
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:36,126
Islam stands for equality
for men and women, Maulana Sahab.

152
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:40,081
And the women in the family of
the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him,

153
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,499
were active in public life.

154
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:51,876
Oh, no. They've followed me here.
Bloody fools!

155
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,882
Your Ladyship. Mr Nehru, sir.
His Excellency has asked me to...

156
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,291
Porrit, I said I didn't need...

157
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,627
His Excellency's orders, milady.

158
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,707
So...

159
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,884
- Dickie knows where you are.
- No, Jawaharlal.

160
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,831
Dickie knows where we are.

161
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:30,834
- Goodbye, Mr Nehru.
- Lady Mountbatten.

162
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:37,416
- How many were hurt?
- Eight people badly burnt.

163
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,132
We had a feast prepared for Eid, miss.

164
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,331
The Hindus rushed in,
with stones and sticks,

165
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,039
shouting:
"Kill the cow murderers!"

166
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,327
(Man shouts) The residents
of this settlement

167
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,499
will move out of this area.

168
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:54,326
My orders are from local magistrate.

169
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,579
(Woman)
These people need your protection.

170
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,169
And who are you?

171
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,752
They have sent Hindu policemen.

172
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:05,626
- These are illegal squatters.
- We have lived here 20 years.

173
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,331
Encroached on the land.

174
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,959
You politicians better get out.

175
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:13,044
- Sir, do you know who...?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

176
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,707
These people are not moving until you
escort them to a proper relief camp.

177
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,254
Arrest these people.

178
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,036
My apologies again, Miss Jinnah.

179
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:25,707
I assure you we have evacuated
the whole neighbourhood

180
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:29,044
to temporary accommodation
in army barracks.

181
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,577
Yes, thank you.

182
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,754
My apologies again.

183
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,672
Arresting Miss Jinnah.

184
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,672
You damn fool!

185
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:52,212
(Imam chants) Allahu Akbar.

186
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,707
(Men speak in Urdu)

187
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,209
Nowhere is safe.
It's even worse in the Punjab.

188
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:46,134
The Bihar Muslim League is reporting
countless incidents of arson

189
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,881
and murder,
against Muslim communities.

190
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,711
And the police here just turn their backs.

191
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:56,044
All over the country, Hindu officers
have taken charge of the police forces...

192
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,247
- (Coughs)
- Are you all right?

193
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:02,376
Yes, I think the fever's going.

194
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:08,672
That poor girl.
She gave up her life for you.

195
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,132
Fatima, my little sister?

196
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:13,001
She was everything to me.

197
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:18,082
She should've been married, and found
happiness with a husband and children.

198
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,539
In some decent family.

199
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,997
She was my companion,
my friend,

200
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,996
and my guide.

201
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,996
And she believed in Pakistan.

202
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,037
Were you ever jealous of Nehruji?

203
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:37,627
His good looks, his wit, his charm,
his English manners.

204
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:39,881
He was my political opponent.

205
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:43,001
I respected him,
though I never really trusted him.

206
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:45,786
- And Gandhiji?
- Another worthy opponent.

207
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,917
But he would never lie.

208
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:51,752
Though, as a politician,
he would not always tell the truth.

209
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,496
(Shouting)

210
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,541
Gandhiji, will you meet with Mr Jinnah
in Simla?

211
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,577
It is always a pleasure to meet Mr Jinnah.

212
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:22,004
Mr Gandhi, Mr Gandhi.
Are we near the end?

213
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:26,706
I would prefer to say
close to a new beginning, my son.

214
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,132
Ah...

215
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,961
- Gandhiji.
- Viceroy.

216
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:47,956
(Gandhi) I feel like the mother in
the "Judgement of Solomon".

217
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:52,084
Give the child to the other woman,
but don't cut it in two.

218
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:58,996
Together, we must make one last effort
to keep this great nation as one.

219
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:03,326
Muslims and Hindus
in one free country.

220
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,209
Gandhiji, I'm willing to try.

221
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:12,004
Years ago, Viceroy,
Mr Jinnah was the greatest advocate

222
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:13,786
of Hindu-Muslim unity.

223
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:17,627
Was he, indeed?
Well, then, what changed him?

224
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:21,631
- Blind ambition.
- (Gandhi) No, no.

225
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,961
The feeling that Muslims
would have no voice... perhaps.

226
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:31,504
Gandhiji, if you were in my position,
what would you say to Jinnah?

227
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:34,956
I would say, "Mr Jinnah,

228
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,834
"India must stay united.

229
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:42,499
"You be its first prime minister
and choose your cabinet."

230
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,786
And tell him that Congress agrees.
They suggested it.

231
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:51,209
But, Babu...
what are you saying?

232
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,964
Our party would never agree.

233
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:56,754
Jawaharlal, you mean
you would never agree?

234
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,166
For the unity of India?

235
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,792
Well, yes, but...

236
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:06,077
Making Jinnah, from
a minority Muslim party, prime minister?

237
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:09,329
We would ensure, of course,
that you would be deputy prime minister.

238
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,079
But our party...

239
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,079
But if Gandhiji and you
and Sardar Patel declare in favour,

240
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,329
who is to say no?

241
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,249
Except, of course, Jinnah.

242
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,956
You think he'll agree?

243
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,254
Why would he not?

244
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:25,076
All right, Bapuji. What would he say?

245
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,829
If I told him that Gandhi made the offer?

246
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,999
(Chuckles)

247
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:34,456
He would say: "Wily old Gandhi!"
(Chuckles)

248
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,787
(Coughing)

249
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,417
(Coughing continues)

250
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,381
(Knocking)

251
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,577
- Letter for Jinnah Sahab.
-Thank you.

252
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:26,166
Dinner. Lady Mountbatten. Tomorrow.

253
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:30,582
You can't offer it to Jinnah.
The country won't accept it.

254
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,829
- We've never even put him in jail.
- I could start now.

255
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:38,329
Nehru's been in for years,
defying the British.

256
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,749
Jinnah does it more subtly.

257
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:43,916
I'd no idea Gandhiji was so cynical.
It'll never work.

258
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,002
What you mean is,
what will our Jawaharlal do?

259
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:49,746
He has to be prime minister, doesn't' he?

260
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,246
Yes.

261
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:57,129
(Mountbatten) 'He's the great rising star
in our firmament. A man of destiny.

262
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,881
'But will it make sense
to give it to Jinnah?

263
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,671
(Edwina) 'Gandhiji didn't mean it.

264
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:04,712
Yes, he does. And it's a great plan.

265
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:08,174
Give Jinnah the biggest responsibility
in an undivided nation,

266
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,542
what can he do?

267
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,707
He has to appoint a majority congress
to a cabinet.

268
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:16,004
I've seen it before. Make
the biggest bounder the head prefect.

269
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,827
The country'll never forgive you.

270
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,879
You mean,
Jawaharlal will never forgive you.

271
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:24,751
Or you.
And you couldn't live with that.

272
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:30,126
Dickie, it isn't only me.
You're in love with power.

273
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,881
And Jawaharlal is the embodiment of it.

274
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,787
So... what will you do?

275
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:37,957
I don't know.

276
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,504
But I'm tempted.

277
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:43,036
If these Indian politicians carry on
like this, I'll foist Jinnah on them.

278
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:46,707
It's what they deserve.
A sour, spoilt barrack-room lawyer.

279
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,631
Gurdip Singh.

280
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,831
Not very dignified.

281
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,539
(Mountbatten) 'Of course,
I was in love with India.'

282
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,877
I saved it from the Japs.

283
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,501
Edwina will tell you,
we longed to come back.

284
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,706
You can imagine how I felt.

285
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,424
The King called me and said:

286
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,252
"Go to India. Give it all away."

287
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,416
Can you give away
what never really belonged to you?

288
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,382
You're right. We don't own it.

289
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,881
We hold it in trust.

290
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,631
My predecessor, Wavell,
told me a funny story.

291
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,251
When he first landed in India,
the crowds greeted him with

292
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:34,496
"Pakistan Zindabad! Pakistan Zindabad!"

293
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,876
He knew even less Urdu than I do.

294
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,921
So he turned to his aide and said,
"What are they saying?"

295
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,502
Whereupon, quick as a flash,
the aide translates:

296
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,996
"Oh, they're saying,
'Pakistan's in the bag!"'

297
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:47,956
You see? "Zindabad". "In the bag".

298
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,794
- Ha-ha-ha.
- (Chuckles)

299
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,964
With all the tension in the country,

300
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:56,584
I don't think we have
a great deal to laugh about.

301
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:00,039
(Mountbatten) Perhaps not.
These are, by any measure,

302
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,577
difficult times,
with difficult decisions ahead.

303
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:06,416
May I take this informal occasion

304
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,332
to make a very serious proposal?

305
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,631
Dickie... should the ladies withdraw?

306
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:14,331
No. Stay.

307
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,831
Suppose, Mr Jinnah,
I were to say to you,

308
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:24,669
let's have a united India,
with a democratic constitution,

309
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,882
and the first prime minister of India,

310
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:29,581
completely free
to choose his own cabinet,

311
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,169
would be Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

312
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,171
What would you say?

313
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:37,752
The Hindus, the Congress Party,
would never agree.

314
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:40,206
Suppose I tell you they have?

315
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,754
It was, in fact, Gandhi's idea.

316
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,456
(Chuckles)

317
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:47,004
Wily old Gandhi.

318
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:52,666
- Well?
- Well, Viceroy, it's a clever ruse.

319
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,752
- Give a dog a bone...
- No, no.

320
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,746
Let us say that Mr Jinnah
is the best man for the job.

321
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,706
And the best choice available.

322
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,174
Do you expect me to be flattered?

323
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,962
Perhaps even to accept?

324
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,754
The brutal truth, Lord Mountbatten,
is that the Hindus

325
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:10,496
have three votes to our one.

326
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:13,246
You think they will accept that?

327
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:16,376
Democracy. One man, one vote,

328
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:18,881
without any safeguards,

329
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:22,131
will turn the Muslims
into frightened, insecure,

330
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,081
second-class citizens.

331
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,789
With our religion, our culture,
our language, our very lives

332
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:29,997
under threat.

333
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,456
We can discuss building in
some safeguards. Assurances.

334
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,714
What assurances, Lord Mountbatten?

335
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:40,334
Why do you want to force
reluctant partners into a marriage?

336
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:44,379
Our customs, our food. We can't
even drink out of the same glass.

337
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:49,209
You don't yet understand
why we want to create Pakistan.

338
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,707
Both communities have suffered,
Mr Jinnah.

339
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,384
Yes, they have.

340
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,381
And they must be separated.

341
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,041
Why didn't you accept it?

342
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,707
Folly of the highest degree.

343
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,924
You could've saved millions of lives.

344
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,882
Millions of homes. There would've been
none of this misery.

345
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:11,711
You think I took this decision lightly?

346
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,884
Here I was,
being offered the prime-ministership

347
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,001
of the largest new free nation on Earth,
and I turned it down.

348
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,834
Because it wouldn't work.

349
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,379
You should've stayed in Simla.

350
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:29,501
And in bed. You can't
play fast and loose with bronchitis.

351
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,714
Not even if a country is at stake?

352
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,834
There will be no country without you,
Jinnah Sahab.

353
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,671
It's not bronchitis.

354
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:48,957
No.

355
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,831
It's consumption, isn't it?

356
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,422
Yes.

357
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,536
Leading to deterioration.

358
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,667
And death.

359
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,329
Yes.

360
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,544
Doctor...

361
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:18,207
we must keep this between ourselves.

362
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:22,134
Think of the potential consequences.

363
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,132
I've never lied to him before, Doctor.

364
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:30,251
And now I have to pretend
that I don't know.

365
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,917
You must get him to rest.

366
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:16,171
Fatima, were you jealous of Ruttie?

367
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,542
No.

368
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:22,127
Of course I wasn't jealous of her.

369
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:24,751
That pretty creature.

370
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:27,826
So stunningly pretty and young.

371
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:31,826
- 'Young enough to be your daughter.'
- (Ruttie giggles)

372
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:35,626
But she didn't look after you,
did she?

373
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:39,081
She wasn't interested in the same things.

374
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:43,499
And she could never look down
the long road of your destiny.

375
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,496
As I can.

376
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:48,416
- I'll race you back.
- You'll lose again.

377
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:02,956
A great setting for the beginning of love.

378
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:05,826
Yes, it was.

379
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,382
(Man no. 2) And then love faded away?

380
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,421
Mine never did.

381
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:18,172
Mm. I can see that you'd run away
from the gates of heaven

382
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,922
to catch a last glimpse of her.

383
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,424
(Unidentified man)
'Being neither Hindu nor Muslim,'

384
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:34,672
we Parsees can only benefit if
the two main communities stop fighting.

385
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,712
I agree, sir. And share their culture
and their... Indian-ness.

386
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,746
(Man) Jinnah, dear boy.
You are young and idealistic.

387
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:47,626
The only solution is the closest contact.
Interracial marriage.

388
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,791
Then the children will be neither
Hindu nor Muslim,

389
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:53,287
and these differences will fall away.

390
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:57,377
(Jinnah) So, Hindu-Muslim marriage
would be beneficial?

391
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:58,961
Most certainly.

392
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:01,754
And what, sir, do you think
of intermarriage between a Parsee girl

393
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:05,036
and a Muslim man?

394
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,287
If their status were compatible?

395
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:18,916
Mr Jinnah. How dare you, sir!

396
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:21,632
You have abused my hospitality.

397
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:25,881
I will remind you that my daughter is 16.
A mere child.

398
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:31,292
Sir, I deny any such intention.

399
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,827
But I apologise for any offence
I may have caused...

400
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:36,669
and will relieve you
of the feeling...

401
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,502
that your generous hospitality...

402
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,626
has been abused.

403
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,786
You may retire.

404
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:56,497
I shall see you in the library,
after dinner.

405
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:59,166
And you will never see that man again!

406
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:02,002
...Muslim, 24 years old, medically fit.

407
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:06,956
More like a Kashmiri to me.
We'll take him anyway.

408
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:20,962
Mr President. Good morning, sir.
I trust you are well.

409
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:26,631
We have come to join the British Army.

410
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:28,131
Mr Jinnah.

411
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:31,001
I warn you that any interruption, here,
of recruitment,

412
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:34,496
will be seen as a riotous disturbance.

413
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,376
No need for your threats, sir.

414
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:42,501
As Indians, we simply demand
that we be recruited to the King's service.

415
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,576
As fully commissioned officers.

416
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,079
(Men all speak at once)

417
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:50,419
This form of exhibition
will get you nowhere.

418
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:55,792
If Indians are being asked
to shed their blood for the Empire,

419
00:29:55,917 --> 00:30:01,127
then why can't we be given the dignity
of joining the army at all levels?

420
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:03,961
Or are we just cannon fodder?

421
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,576
I declare the proceedings for today
to be over.

422
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,539
Your reply, sir!

423
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,249
(Men all speak at once)

424
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,924
(Ruttie) Mr Jinnah!

425
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm 18 today.

426
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,502
I've left home.

427
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,417
(In Urdu) In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most merciful.

428
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,504
Repeat the kalma after me.

429
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,709
(In Urdu) There is no God but Allah

430
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:36,504
and Muhammad is his prophet.

431
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:43,334
There is no God but Allah
and Muhammad is his prophet.

432
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:53,334
Our beloved daughter Rattanbai,
we welcome you

433
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,919
to the faith of Islam.

434
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:58,709
Now, daughter,

435
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,964
do you accept this man,
Muhammad Ali Jinnah,

436
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:07,504
to be your lawful husband
in the sight of God?

437
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:13,834
I accept, I accept, I accept.

438
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:23,917
Mr and Mrs Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

439
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:31,246
Delighted, Mr Jinnah. Delighted.

440
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:34,036
- Mr Jinnah.
- And Mrs Jinnah.

441
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,497
I must confess,
your reputation as Bombay's beauty,

442
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,706
is not exaggerated.

443
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:44,334
Yes, indeed. You and Mr Jinnah
deserve to delight in it.

444
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,379
Thank you.

445
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:50,001
I'd rather be known as
the strongest nationalist in Bombay.

446
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:54,206
I thought we'd put politics behind us,
this evening, Mrs Jinnah.

447
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:57,334
We are so pleased
you were able to join us.

448
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:05,042
(Woman) You live above us, don't you,
Mr Jinnah? Atop the hill.

449
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,627
(Jinnah) Yes.
With a view of the Arabian Sea.

450
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:11,291
The same vast expanse
we see from our Karachi house.

451
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:13,457
Oh, how lucky.

452
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,794
We've never been to Karachi.

453
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:20,961
And the weather there...
Changeable?

454
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,544
I was... saying to Mrs Jinnah,

455
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,417
the weather in Bombay
is quite changeable.

456
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,332
Would you bring Mrs Jinnah a shawl?

457
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:31,326
We never think of heating the house.

458
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,879
You must be feeling quite chilly, my dear.

459
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:38,921
(Jinnah) When Mrs Jinnah feels the cold,
she will ask for a wrap herself.

460
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,502
Spare yourself the trouble.

461
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,542
I won't stand in their way.
Let them go.

462
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:49,462
How dare she dress like that
at my table!

463
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:54,134
(Sighs) I don't believe Mr Jinnah
will go very far, with that attitude.

464
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:57,921
We must make two pledges.

465
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,792
The first...

466
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:04,037
The first is that we stand united,

467
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,207
Hindus and Muslims,

468
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:11,334
for an India
free from imperial British rule.

469
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:19,497
The second is that we must act
in a constitutional way.

470
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,959
- We place our just...
- (Murmuring)

471
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:42,174
We place our just demands.

472
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,917
Because only in this way...

473
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:50,629
...by treading the path of dignity...

474
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,287
...can we take our place as Free India,

475
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:59,577
among the civilised and great nations.

476
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,082
Ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,209
I move the motion.

478
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:17,126
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

479
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:42,211
I am very happy to be with you today.

480
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:47,334
I am even happier to see that you have,
as your chief spokesman,

481
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:50,249
of Hindu-Muslim unity,

482
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:52,916
the distinguished Mr Jinnah,

483
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:56,042
from the Minority Community.

484
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,746
I wish to lend my support

485
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,916
to everything Mr Jinnah says.

486
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:09,004
He said we must act
in a constitutional way.

487
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,916
He means we must play by the rules.

488
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:15,792
We can only play by the rules

489
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,167
if we are included in the game.

490
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:20,252
(Applause)

491
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,419
I welcome the fact

492
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:34,832
that Mr Jinnah speaks of dignity.

493
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,629
India has an ancient, unshakeable dignity

494
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,751
and an ancient spirit.

495
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:44,876
A force of spiritual strength

496
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,791
which has been suppressed for too long.

497
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,536
But when it is released,

498
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,957
this shining light of truth

499
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:58,544
of ahimsa, which is non-violence,

500
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,287
and satyagraha,

501
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,877
which is the ancient path of truth...

502
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,001
no force on Earth,

503
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:08,536
no constitutional gain,

504
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,327
will be able to suppress it.

505
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,129
(Applause)

506
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,792
- Fine speech, Jin.
-Thank you.

507
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,747
Your Mr Gandhi
is very patronising.

508
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:40,746
As though you were the newcomer

509
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:44,706
and he'd worked to build the Congress
Party, instead of the other way round.

510
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,544
Oh, I don't care about that.

511
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,667
There is something about
what Mr Gandhi says...

512
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,379
That makes me a little uneasy.

513
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,042
I wish you'd stay for a few more weeks,
Fatima.

514
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,577
My other brothers need me in Karachi.

515
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,079
But I'll be back soon.

516
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,377
I hope you haven't forgotten anything.

517
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:28,171
- I don't trust these servants.
- Oh, don't be silly.

518
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:31,632
Ram has been looking after me
ever since I was a little girl.

519
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:38,044
Ram, please look after her.
She's so young.

520
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,997
Don't worry, Bibisahiba. Don't' worry.

521
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,416
But...

522
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,792
when you will return from Karachi?

523
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,127
As soon as I'm needed, Ram.

524
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:52,834
(Dog pants)

525
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,827
Where are you going, Jin?

526
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,959
Just for a stroll, my love.

527
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,502
Do you want me to come?

528
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,421
Good afternoon, young man.

529
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:36,132
I hope you don't mind me resting,
for a few moments, in your lovely garden.

530
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,671
Oh, no. No, of course not, sir.

531
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,582
Can I ask them to fetch some water?

532
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:45,709
No, no, no. I'm not unwell. It's just
the climb up the hill is a little tiring.

533
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,922
- You're most welcome.
- Thank you.

534
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:53,126
Mr Jinnah.

535
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,667
You are right to trust logic,

536
00:39:56,792 --> 00:40:01,832
but isn't there some logic
in Gandhi's non-violence?

537
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,827
What do you mean?

538
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,209
Who are you?

539
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,504
Just a traveller.

540
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:13,746
Gandhi angers you.

541
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:17,666
- Because he patronises you?
- No, no.

542
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,212
No, I'm not a child.

543
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:24,334
Mr Gandhi is an extraordinary man.
A man who believes in his own mission.

544
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:26,079
But...

545
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,169
...the clothes...

546
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:34,132
this imitation of the Hindu peasants,
the... the spinning wheels, the fasts,

547
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:36,751
the bits and pieces
of Sanskrit philosophy.

548
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:38,416
Ahimsa, satyagraha...

549
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:41,002
He is calling forth a flood.

550
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:44,496
Isn't that what the movement needs?

551
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:47,956
Millions of people demanding
that the British leave India.

552
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:50,754
Yes. But will it stop there?

553
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:53,326
What else will they demand?

554
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:57,829
When you talk of spirit,
you release darker forces.

555
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:02,249
Powers that can't be questioned.
illogical urges and anger.

556
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:07,826
If they succeed in kicking out the British
because they have usurped power in India,

557
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,579
won't their attention,
then, turn to the Muslims?

558
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:12,996
After all,

559
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:15,706
we Muslims conquered India
long before the British.

560
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,044
Isn't that logical too?

561
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,787
No. Because we are not outsiders.

562
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,667
We are part of this country.

563
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,627
And besides...

564
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:33,751
we have no England to go back to.

565
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,917
(Ruttie) Jin?

566
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,631
- Talking to yourself, Jin?
- I'm just rehearsing a speech.

567
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:07,711
Perhaps I should ask
for a postponement of the trial.

568
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,626
Jin...

569
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:14,001
I don't want you take this amiss...

570
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:16,456
but I'd like to discuss
something personal with you.

571
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:21,134
Kanji, I have three cases pending
in the High Court. Can't it wait?

572
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,251
(Shouting outside)

573
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:36,292
(Men begin to chant)

574
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:03,126
(Men continue chanting)

575
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,834
Clear the roadway!

576
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:39,626
Ruttie!

577
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,921
What the hell are you doing?
Why have you brought Dina here?

578
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,542
Jin, stop them.
They're beating helpless people!

579
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,827
They offer themselves to be beaten.

580
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,999
- Gandhi's politics...
- They're breaking their heads!

581
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:55,464
There is nothing I can do.

582
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:57,384
They want these histrionics, this theatre.

583
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,881
You can't just stand there and watch.

584
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,036
Kanji, come on.

585
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,126
Ruttie, get the child home.

586
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,827
By whose authority are you using force?

587
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,999
Can I see the magistrate's order?

588
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:22,166
- My advice, Mr Jinnah, is to go back.
- Stop this slaughter.

589
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,922
Now!

590
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,667
Pull the men back.

591
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,831
Withdraw lathi charge!

592
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:43,462
(Gandhi)
In this great battle for our freedom,

593
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,834
let it not be said of us

594
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:49,829
that we are guilty of shedding blood.

595
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:52,629
But let it be said

596
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,581
that we suffer.

597
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:57,959
That we shed,
not somebody's blood,

598
00:44:58,084 --> 00:44:59,714
but our own.

599
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:09,462
So, I put this resolution to congress...

600
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:17,884
We pledge ourselves to secure
complete independence for India,

601
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:21,041
through means of non-violence.

602
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,787
(Applause)

603
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:34,832
Members of Congress...

604
00:45:39,376 --> 00:45:42,996
I beg to oppose this hasty resolution.

605
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,496
(Man shouts in Urdu)

606
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:55,041
No one's desire for independence

607
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,167
is greater than mine.

608
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:01,997
Yet I wish to point out
that these methods...

609
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,536
this dragging in of religious symbols,

610
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:10,077
these radical marches and provocation
are now beginning to split the movement.

611
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,884
The method and goal proposed
by Mr Gandhi's...

612
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,331
(Man) No!

613
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:17,829
No!

614
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,249
Mahatma Gandhi!
Say 'Mahatma Gandhi'!

615
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:22,746
(All) Mahatma Gandhi!

616
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:31,376
Mr Gandhi's resolution...

617
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:37,536
At this moment, the destiny of our country
is in the hands of two men

618
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:40,667
and one of them is Gandhi!

619
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:44,579
Therefore...

620
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:47,499
standing on this platform...

621
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:52,246
I appeal to him to pause,
to cry "Halt!"...

622
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:01,249
...before it is too late.

623
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:06,876
- No! No! No!
- No! No!

624
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,629
Mr Jinnah is right!

625
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:14,171
Do not bring religion into politics.

626
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,457
We are all Indians.

627
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,754
If we go down this road,

628
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:25,456
we will turn Hindu against Muslim,
in the end.

629
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:27,884
If we do not win our freedom together,

630
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:31,961
we will turn brother against brother.

631
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:35,129
The turning point?

632
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:38,671
I left the Congress Party.

633
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,882
If Congress was going to turn into
a Hindu party,

634
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:44,331
then somebody had to speak up
for the Muslims.

635
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:55,246
Why are you dressed like that?

636
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,497
Jin, you are so late. We're late.

637
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:02,876
The party started at eight o'clock.

638
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:05,001
The party?

639
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:09,206
The party at Lady Jeejeebhoy's.

640
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:14,294
- You said you'd take me.
- Of course. That party.

641
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,037
Well, I have to start for Delhi
on the ten o'clock train.

642
00:48:17,876 --> 00:48:19,876
You go by yourself.

643
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:25,709
Again.

644
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:28,544
Ruttie, I have a practice to run.

645
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:31,667
I don't want to go dancing
with the baronets.

646
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,167
(Slurring) Jin... Jin...

647
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:18,331
The train...

648
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,959
Ruttie? Are you all right?

649
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,964
It's not your fault.

650
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:29,539
- No dancing...
- You've been drinking!

651
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:34,541
- (Jinnah) How dare you!
- Why are you cross with Mummy?

652
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:41,174
It's all right, darling.

653
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,292
Come and sit down.

654
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,424
I'm not cross with Mummy.

655
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,462
Did Mummy give you a kiss goodnight?

656
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:52,834
No, silly. Mummy never puts me to bed.
Anita puts me to bed.

657
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,879
Anita, take her back to her room.

658
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:57,541
I have to go, sweetheart.

659
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:01,167
- You're always going away.
- I know. I'm sorry.

660
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:04,292
Go to bed. There's a good girl.

661
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,292
Hello? Dr Patel, please.

662
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:38,129
Patel? Jinnah.
Can you come immediately?

663
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:40,171
Thank you.

664
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:43,292
Sir, Kanji Sahab is here, sir.

665
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,081
- Kanji, thank God.
- Ready to go?

666
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:49,829
Kanji, I... I found these.

667
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:53,577
- Where is she?
- She's asleep. I couldn't...

668
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,167
Kanji, you knew about this?

669
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:02,292
Why didn't you tell me?

670
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,667
She didn't want you to know.

671
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:10,632
She has cancer.

672
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:14,131
It's eating up her insides.
That's why they prescribed the morphine.

673
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:19,209
Oh, God...

674
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:31,289
(Woman) Ask... what is in your heart.

675
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:34,747
(Ruttie) I can't. It's too private.

676
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:38,036
(Woman) Go on, dear.
We can't keep the spirit waiting.

677
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,787
Ruttie.

678
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:44,084
What are they doing?

679
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:47,749
(Ruttie) Will my Jinnah
get married again?

680
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:51,076
- When I die?
- No, Ruttie, no. Never.

681
00:51:56,667 --> 00:52:00,497
The pretty dear wants to know
if her husband still loves her.

682
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:02,626
Like he used to.

683
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:14,711
Kanji. Please do something
before Mr Jinnah comes back.

684
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:17,834
The glass was right.

685
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:23,384
I did not love her as before.

686
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:27,501
I loved her and I needed her
much more.

687
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:33,751
But I never taught myself
to show that love.

688
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:37,174
If we win, here in Delhi,

689
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:41,792
the government will be forced to publish
casualty figures for Indians killed in battle.

690
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:44,747
I shall demand that
the compensation paid for Indian widows

691
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:46,746
is the same as they pay for Tommies'.

692
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:50,456
Sir, long-distance call from Bombay.

693
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:56,384
Thank you.

694
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,541
Muhammad Ali Jinnah speaking.

695
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:00,287
Yes.

696
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,714
I see.

697
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,834
I'll be on the next train.

698
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,711
My, er... my wife is very ill.

699
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,544
You'll have to carry the case.

700
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:35,376
(Man chants)

701
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:54,084
(Chant fades, sobbing becomes audible)

702
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:53,584
- Do you still cry for her?
- No. Not for her.

703
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,877
Then why?

704
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:01,541
For love that is irretrievable.

705
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,667
So much love.

706
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,626
And it all melts away.

707
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:31,669
(Jinnah) 'Mr Birtwhistle has been accused
of subversive publications.'

708
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:36,827
By 'subversive', they mean
in favour of Indian independence.

709
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:41,829
He has also been
forcibly removed from India.

710
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,576
My Lord...

711
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:48,879
Either Mr Birtwhistle is a citizen of Britain
and a subject of the King Emperor,

712
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,831
or he is not.

713
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:54,539
And either India is part
of the British Empire, or it is not,

714
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:58,417
and the King Emperor is
its king and emperor, or he is not.

715
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:01,172
And I would remind the court...

716
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:07,127
...that it is treason
to pronounce that he is not.

717
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:09,081
Mr Birtwhistle.

718
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:13,126
Are you a citizen of Britain
and subject of the King Emperor?

719
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:16,041
- Indeed I am.
- And were you so one month ago?

720
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,377
Yes, I was.

721
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,331
And were you instructed to leave India?

722
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:20,829
- Yes.
- By whom?

723
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,959
By the office of the
Secretary of State for India.

724
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:27,329
(Jinnah) My Lord...

725
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:31,959
No resident of... Bournemouth,
shall we say,

726
00:57:32,084 --> 00:57:36,384
may be told that he is to repair to Scotland
and Scotland alone.

727
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:40,631
Since Magna Carta, the right to
free movement throughout the realm

728
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:42,831
has been established.

729
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,629
(Judge) So it has.

730
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:47,541
My client has been denied that right

731
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,827
in that part of this realm known as India.

732
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:54,292
Tell me, Mr Jinnah,

733
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:59,577
in another place, I have heard you argue
that India is not part of this empire.

734
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,879
That is as it may be, My Lord.

735
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,501
However, I am not in that place now

736
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:08,996
and I'm conscious
of my humble role of advocacy

737
00:58:09,126 --> 00:58:10,826
in this, your court.

738
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,751
Mr Birtwhistle,

739
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:17,876
you are a fortunate man.

740
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:21,417
(Bells peal)

741
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:28,631
Jinnah Sahab, the Muslims of India
need your leadership.

742
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:31,581
Iqbal Sahab,
lam flattered by the compliment,

743
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:34,999
from you,
our great poet and philosopher.

744
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,036
There are many who can provide
that leadership.

745
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,037
No, Jinnah.

746
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,537
We need a Muslim of the modern day.

747
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,287
Such as man has to lead
the struggle for Pakistan

748
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:49,127
and then be an inspiration to a country,
at its birth.

749
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:53,001
How can I even dare think
of myself as such a man?

750
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:55,076
(Iqbal) There is no other.

751
00:58:55,209 --> 00:59:01,539
For 200 years, the Muslims of India
have lost the directions of their destiny.

752
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,287
And now, as the mists clear,

753
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,997
a vision is born,
of a country of...

754
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:10,326
purity and compassion.

755
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:13,079
Pakistan.

756
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:15,209
Dr Iqbal, please.

757
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:21,211
Jinnah Sahab.
It's my turn to speak, please.

758
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:24,964
I know I haven't long to live.

759
00:59:25,084 --> 00:59:29,714
Go back to India
and take charge of the League.

760
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:39,669
Go back to India.

761
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,712
Carve out a country.

762
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:47,077
(Jinnah) 'How? Where to start?

763
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:14,334
Jin!

764
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:17,079
My God, why didn't you write or wire?

765
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:20,709
I know. I'm sorry to intrude.

766
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:24,674
- Serious problem?
- Just polishing his teeth.

767
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:29,002
Sir, I beg your indulgence.
Would you mind coming back tomorrow?

768
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,326
We have urgent business.

769
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:33,581
What are you saying? I have paid.

770
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,459
Please.

771
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,129
I'm so sorry.

772
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:54,084
Fati, there's one thing that's been
bothering me.

773
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:58,044
I've spoken to Aunt Masiji.

774
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:03,577
- How to say this?
- Well, you're the lawyer.

775
01:01:03,709 --> 01:01:06,169
I want you to contact decent families.

776
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,132
With boys that...

777
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:09,961
You understand.

778
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,084
Men, of about your age...

779
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:14,579
Suitable men.

780
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:17,879
- As head of the family, I...
- (Giggles)

781
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:20,751
You're going to matchmake for me?

782
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:22,996
That's so sweet.

783
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:24,706
For your happiness.

784
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:27,214
I resolved to give that up long ago.

785
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:30,544
The marriage, love, children.

786
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:34,127
I want to be there when we win.

787
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:39,211
Fati, forgive me.

788
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:41,964
I know you think I'm very modern.

789
01:01:42,084 --> 01:01:44,254
You're as old-fashioned as they come.

790
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:45,709
(Cheering, applause)

791
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:57,209
(Jinnah) We have swept the polls
throughout India.

792
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:08,626
The will of the people has put Pakistan
within our grasp.

793
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:18,247
The Muslim League has proved,

794
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:20,496
in the eyes of the world,

795
01:03:20,626 --> 01:03:26,626
our right to represent
the Muslims of India.

796
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:30,501
A nation which has found its identity

797
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:33,456
and has, today, declared its will.

798
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:36,584
(Cheering, applause)

799
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:40,419
(Cheering, applause)

800
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:43,582
(Cheering, applause)

801
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:46,379
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

802
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,081
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

803
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:49,669
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

804
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,502
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

805
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:53,166
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

806
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:54,882
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

807
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,501
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

808
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,166
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

809
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,882
- (Man) Pakistan.
- (Crowd) Zindabad.

810
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,461
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

811
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,174
- (Man) Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) Zindabad!

812
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:04,832
- (Man) 'Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) 'Zindabad!

813
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:07,079
- (Man) 'Quaid-e-Azam!
- (Crowd) 'Zindabad!'

814
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,916
Jinnah Sahab.

815
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:15,462
Men must also be judged
by the love they have shown.

816
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:19,206
Apart from Ruttie,

817
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:21,544
who would you say you loved the most?

818
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,707
My sister Fatima.

819
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:25,544
My daughter Dina.

820
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:31,036
'And you think you treated them
as well as you could?'

821
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:38,212
Morning, my dear.

822
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:42,174
- Papa, I must speak to you.
- Of course. Sit down.

823
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,671
Papa, I want your permission to marry.

824
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,996
Marry?

825
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,456
But...

826
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:04,674
But you are far too young.

827
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:06,882
- Who?
- Neville.

828
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,671
Mr Wadia? But he's a Parsee.

829
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:12,832
Yes...

830
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,959
Dina, there are millions
of young Muslim boys in India.

831
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:22,581
- You can't do this to me.
- There were millions of Muslim girls.

832
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:25,169
And you married Mama.
She was a Parsee.

833
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:28,042
She became a Muslim.

834
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:31,377
Is Mr Wadia prepared
to embrace our faith?

835
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:34,041
No. But I will marry him.

836
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:39,634
Dina, if you do this,

837
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:42,211
you cannot call yourself my daughter
anymore.

838
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:46,211
- I forbid it.
- But...

839
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:47,584
But why?

840
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:52,289
Because it is against our customs.
Against our tradition.

841
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:55,997
I have fought for a Muslim State

842
01:05:56,126 --> 01:06:00,126
and my daughter marries
outside the faith.

843
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:07,786
(Rustles newspaper)

844
01:06:07,917 --> 01:06:11,957
(Fatima)I am very proud that the girls
from our community have qualified

845
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:14,794
in law, in the sciences,

846
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:16,537
in English and Urdu,

847
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:21,327
Sanskrit, and even in Chinese.
Excellent.

848
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:25,209
The graduates from the Muslim College
will, no doubt, go on

849
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:30,834
to enrich the lives
of both Pakistan and India.

850
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:33,999
- Lady Mountbatten.
- (Applause)

851
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:45,746
It gives me great pleasure
to give the Rattanbai Modi Award

852
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:50,166
for distinction in history
to Farida Shah.

853
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:02,752
Miss Jinnah, why have you invited
an Englishwoman to be our guest,

854
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:05,076
when they have only contempt for us?

855
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:07,709
Why should we have to shake
the hand of the enemy?

856
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:10,334
(Applause)

857
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:14,629
If you object to my presence,
I will willingly...

858
01:07:14,751 --> 01:07:16,421
No, Lady Mountbatten.

859
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,044
My younger sister,

860
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:24,377
this is not the way we Muslims have
chosen to fight for our independence.

861
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,247
The British are our friends and our rulers.

862
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:30,576
We don't want them to be our rulers,

863
01:07:30,709 --> 01:07:34,039
but we want them to remain our friends.

864
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:36,882
Now, sister.

865
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:39,541
Come and take your prize.

866
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,957
Panditji it is dangerous.

867
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:56,134
There are demonstrations
against our party by Pathan tribesmen.

868
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:58,751
Khan Sahab,
I'll speak to them, don't worry.

869
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:04,042
Muslim League members.
Stop the car, I want to talk to them.

870
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:07,127
I said stop!

871
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:13,999
Silence!
My friends and comrades.

872
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:16,376
My fellow citizens of India.

873
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:19,041
Throughout my tour
of the North-West Frontier,

874
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:23,127
I have been dismayed and saddened
by the demonstrations of violence

875
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:26,081
and opposition
directed against the Congress Party

876
01:08:26,209 --> 01:08:27,959
in this great province.

877
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,584
(Crowd jeers)

878
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:34,419
Congress... Congress is a party
with no religious boundaries.

879
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:40,292
It is for Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs,
Christians, without distinction...

880
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,497
of caste or creed.

881
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:54,504
My dear fellow. I'm so sorry.

882
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:57,326
Why on Earth are you giving speeches
in the Frontier?

883
01:08:57,459 --> 01:09:00,249
I thought Edwina specifically told you
not to go.

884
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:04,996
Dickie, I thank you for your concern,
my friend.

885
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:08,496
- Does Edwina know about the incident?
- Of course.

886
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:11,496
Nothing stays secret in India.

887
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,246
Well...

888
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,416
Let me tell you both that...

889
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:19,672
I will never accept that we,
in Congress,

890
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,292
can't represent the Muslims.

891
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:24,537
And one stone won't stop me.

892
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:26,207
My dear Jawaharlal,

893
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:27,674
this is not one stone.

894
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:29,382
It's an avalanche.

895
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:32,831
This election is disastrous
for your Congress Party.

896
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:35,459
The Muslim League
has won the Punjab.

897
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:38,294
It's won Bengal, it's won the Frontier.

898
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:41,917
What did you expect?
They have a majority in those provinces.

899
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:45,002
Yes. Who've given their votes
to Mr Jinnah.

900
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:47,036
And now he'll demand
that with these provinces,

901
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,707
he has the basis for Pakistan.

902
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:50,504
He can break away.

903
01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:54,416
Oh, Dickie. This is dangerous nonsense.

904
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:59,752
Those provinces have minorities
of Sikhs and Hindus. Millions of them.

905
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:03,496
- So?
- They will never be safe in Pakistan.

906
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:06,826
That, my dear Jawaharlal,
is precisely what Mr Jinnah says

907
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:09,829
about the Muslims in India,
under your party's rule.

908
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:13,169
Yes, I know, I know. But...
but don't you see?

909
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,632
There are Hindu fanatics
in our own party.

910
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:19,671
And with all this talk
of a Muslim Pakistan,

911
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:23,542
they are beginning to demand
a Hindu India.

912
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:25,787
If they split the Congress,

913
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:29,327
the Muslim League
will be the strongest party in India.

914
01:10:30,751 --> 01:10:34,961
Unless I give Jinnah his Pakistan,
and split the country first.

915
01:10:35,084 --> 01:10:40,174
My friends, this is a historic day.

916
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:43,292
The Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten,

917
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:46,537
has conveyed to me

918
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:50,247
the decision of the British government

919
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:53,536
to concede, to us,

920
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:58,497
the creation of the State of Pakistan.

921
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,286
(Cheering)

922
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:11,002
A partition commission is being set up

923
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:13,536
under Sir Cyril Radcliffe,

924
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,787
with three Muslim judges
and three Hindus,

925
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:22,537
to mark out the borders
of Pakistan.

926
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:31,632
(Man, in Urdu)
Great Leader! Emperor of Pakistan!

927
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:34,081
(Crowd, in Urdu)
Great Leader! Emperor of Pakistan!

928
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:35,789
No!

929
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,787
I am nobody's emperor.

930
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:42,877
Iam a soldier,
in the service of the birthright of Pakistan.

931
01:11:43,001 --> 01:11:45,461
(Applause)

932
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:50,584
(Shouting)

933
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,457
(Man shouts)

934
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:52,381
Wait.

935
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:57,081
Who are you?
And why do you want to kill me?

936
01:12:57,209 --> 01:13:00,789
You're a traitor, Jinnah.
If there is to be a Pakistan,

937
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:03,127
it must be a Muslim state!

938
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:08,541
- Pakistan will be a Muslim state.
- Yes. But with you as leader.

939
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,167
You speak of the rights of Christians,
of Hindus.

940
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,582
You talk of the rights of women.

941
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:18,289
You are an ignorant fool.

942
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:23,917
I have fought for your mother,
your sister, and your children's children

943
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,082
to live in dignity.

944
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:29,039
Islam doesn't need fanatics like you.

945
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:32,127
Islam needs men of vision
who will build the country.

946
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,581
Now, grow up!

947
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:36,709
And serve Pakistan.

948
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:48,709
Thank you, Nadeem.

949
01:13:57,126 --> 01:14:00,706
Now, that's one thing
Indians are not good at.

950
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:04,579
(Chuckles)
I only meant baking cakes.

951
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:07,919
I must teach the cook.
Lady Wavell absolutely spoilt him.

952
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:11,126
Jawaharlal...

953
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:13,251
We're moving ahead.

954
01:14:13,376 --> 01:14:15,876
It's within shooting distance,
independence.

955
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:22,327
Dickie should insist
on Gandhiji's proposal

956
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:26,499
and offer him again
the prime-ministership of a united India.

957
01:14:26,626 --> 01:14:28,876
Don't start wavering now.

958
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:32,291
You must be prime minister of India,
and giving away Pakistan

959
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:34,747
is the only way.

960
01:14:34,876 --> 01:14:36,876
What are you two discussing?

961
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:40,961
The impossibility of Indians
baking proper English cakes.

962
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:43,674
The cake needs the right ingredients.

963
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,542
That's not what's depressing Jawaharlal.

964
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:50,956
Come on, old boy. Jinnah can have
his truncated little country.

965
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:54,672
He'll come limping back to you
in a matter of months.

966
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:57,502
Jinnah will beg for reunification.

967
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,956
And then, it'll be up to you,
Jawaharlal, to be magnanimous.

968
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:03,084
I'll see to it.

969
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,747
Then you still don't know him.

970
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:09,876
He'll beg for nothing.

971
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:12,501
My dear Jawaharlal,

972
01:15:12,626 --> 01:15:15,826
The anniversary of my victory in Burma
falls in August.

973
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:17,629
Wouldn't it be a great triumph

974
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:20,711
if it coincided with the date of the
independence of India and Pakistan?

975
01:15:20,834 --> 01:15:24,584
You mean... delay the transfer of power
by four months?

976
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:28,419
No. I mean,
bring it forward by eight months.

977
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:32,962
India will gain her independence
on the 15th of August 1947.

978
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:36,674
Pakistan will have to scramble
to get itself ready.

979
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:42,384
(Jinnah) 'Mountbatten changed the date
to force Pakistan into failure.

980
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:45,001
'He would not permit us
to have our own army.'

981
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:48,916
But when the Muslims threatened
to mutiny,

982
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:52,042
- He backed down.
- Ah...

983
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:56,957
So you are not beyond manipulation
and a little bit of blackmail.

984
01:15:57,084 --> 01:16:00,174
I wouldn't put it like that.

985
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,082
Let us just say...

986
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:04,209
persuasion..

987
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:35,497
(Horses whinny)

988
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:39,459
(Screams)

989
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:53,584
Mama! Mama!

990
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:11,174
What will you say to Dickie?

991
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,422
(Edwina) I'll say I was with you. Talking.

992
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:16,542
He wants us to be close.

993
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:19,537
I feel that too, but... but why?

994
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:24,037
Well, if there's one person in the world
who can explain something so difficult,

995
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:25,707
he stands before me.

996
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:30,747
Really?
The mind of an Anglo-German aristocrat?

997
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:33,576
- Even that.
- Well.

998
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,419
There's the deep answer
and the shallow answer.

999
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:39,082
Oh, give me the shallow one first.

1000
01:17:39,209 --> 01:17:43,129
You won't mind if it's indelicate?

1001
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,251
Guide's honour.

1002
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:49,787
After being married for 20 or more years,

1003
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:54,247
Dickie doesn't want you anymore,
in that compelling way.

1004
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:57,417
And the deep reason?

1005
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:00,457
It's because...

1006
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:03,464
he understands that friendship is rare

1007
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:04,884
and that we have found it.

1008
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:07,581
And he wants to be a part of it.

1009
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:10,249
He wants it to be the three of us

1010
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:12,166
and he's willing to...

1011
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:14,712
This is difficult.

1012
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:19,707
- It's not a sharing...
- No, no, you're right.

1013
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:22,674
He has the deepest admiration for you.

1014
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:26,542
You see,
you have more than he ever had.

1015
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:28,707
Oh, he has power.

1016
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:31,584
But you have the love of millions and...

1017
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:36,129
He wants to feel there's something...
very strong...

1018
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:42,959
...something very deep,
between you and him, too.

1019
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:46,044
Only, he can never bring himself to say it.

1020
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,917
I know. He's an Englishman.

1021
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:51,332
And the only way he knows
is to lend me to you.

1022
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:52,879
Shh...

1023
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:56,129
I understand.

1024
01:18:56,251 --> 01:18:58,671
Too well, perhaps.

1025
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:01,882
Jawaharlal, can I ask you
one small thing?

1026
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:04,831
- Anything, my dear.
- I know it's the one thing he wants.

1027
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:08,419
- But he's too proud to ask.
- What? Dickie, proud?

1028
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,542
We know he's Viceroy because he's
the best man on Earth for the job.

1029
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:16,457
But for him, the doubt still remains that...

1030
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:19,674
he's the King's cousin,
and that's why he got the job.

1031
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:24,002
- But if Congress were to invite him...
- Were to invite him...

1032
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,956
to become India's governor-general?

1033
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:31,252
I think... it would be a great honour for us.

1034
01:19:31,376 --> 01:19:33,826
And it would please Bapu, I know.

1035
01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:35,419
But, Edwina,

1036
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:37,792
there is one thing
I want you to promise me.

1037
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:39,457
I promise.

1038
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:41,884
There are difficult times ahead.

1039
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:44,666
I want to make a pact with you.

1040
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:47,132
To keep what is between you and me

1041
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:50,041
free from any matters of politics.

1042
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:55,882
I'll never ask the Prime Minister of India
for anything.

1043
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:01,172
I feel what's between you and me is...

1044
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:03,672
spiritual.

1045
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,751
Its feet shall not touch the earth.

1046
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,707
Excuse me, sir.

1047
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:43,379
There is a matter I wish to discuss.

1048
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:48,667
- What are these?
- Letters.

1049
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:50,922
From Lady Mountbatten to Nehru, and...

1050
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:52,712
from him to her.

1051
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:54,424
Shameful things.

1052
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:57,422
(Jinnah) More shameful
for us to read them.

1053
01:20:57,542 --> 01:21:00,502
We don't read them, sir.

1054
01:21:00,626 --> 01:21:02,416
It was suggested we use them.

1055
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:06,172
We do not descend to this level.

1056
01:21:07,459 --> 01:21:09,459
The shame is not theirs, it is ours.

1057
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:12,924
- Destroy them.
- They are carving up our country!

1058
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:15,792
Savaging our people.

1059
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,877
Er... I... I'm sorry, sir.

1060
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:23,381
I'm sorry.

1061
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:27,247
I too am sorry...

1062
01:21:27,376 --> 01:21:30,916
for the thought that blackened
your generous mind.

1063
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:46,214
Well, Jinnah Sahab.

1064
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,044
A bit foolish of you.

1065
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:52,667
You could've changed the
whole course of history with those letters.

1066
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:57,037
Are you trying to play Satan with me?

1067
01:21:57,167 --> 01:22:01,877
Did I hear you say that I should use
blackmail against my political opponents?

1068
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,292
It would have saved lives.

1069
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:07,957
History is made by the will and the wants
of millions of people.

1070
01:22:08,084 --> 01:22:11,084
Not by some letters and blackmail.

1071
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,964
(Mountbatten) Top right hand
for my personal ensign.

1072
01:22:15,084 --> 01:22:16,794
Crest instead of the Union Jack.

1073
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:20,827
It's slightly larger, I think, as the shield
takes in the idea of Great Britain.

1074
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:23,289
We can check with the School of Heralds.

1075
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:26,417
Would it be proper to have
both the Union Jack and my own crest?

1076
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:30,376
Ah, Mr Jinnah.

1077
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,751
Good of you to come.

1078
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:34,496
Viceroy.

1079
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:41,669
Let me get straight to the point.

1080
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,634
They've invited me to be
first governor-general of India.

1081
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:48,581
There's no doubt
that you deserve the honour.

1082
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:53,211
Mr Jinnah, what, then,
is Pakistan's position?

1083
01:22:53,334 --> 01:22:56,134
Lord Mountbatten, I can't say
I didn't anticipate that question.

1084
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,961
It's quite clear to me

1085
01:22:58,084 --> 01:23:03,044
that one man cannot possibly be
the head of state of both nations.

1086
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:07,167
Surely, it'll be a great symbol of friendship
between the two countries.

1087
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:16,746
If we were at war, Lord Mountbatten,

1088
01:23:16,876 --> 01:23:21,076
you couldn't possibly order one side
to attack and the other to defend.

1089
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:23,459
I see.

1090
01:23:23,584 --> 01:23:25,634
Whose name do you think
the Crown will approve, then?

1091
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,711
The Muslim League has asked me
to submit my own.

1092
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,332
Do you realise, Mr Jinnah,
this will cost you dear?

1093
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:37,959
A few crores of rupees, perhaps.

1094
01:23:38,084 --> 01:23:40,174
Or a division of the spoils.

1095
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,172
No, Mr Jinnah,

1096
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:45,502
it will cost you the future of Pakistan.

1097
01:23:45,626 --> 01:23:47,416
Everything.

1098
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:51,632
You won't have a wooden table or chair
in your office, in your Pakistan.

1099
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:55,081
Or the money to buy
an olive-green army water bottle.

1100
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:29,424
(Jinnah) I left something behind me
of great value,

1101
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,332
when I was forced to leave my city.

1102
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:34,329
Well, Jinnah Sahab,

1103
01:24:34,459 --> 01:24:37,419
the sacrifice of a large house...

1104
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:41,172
What is it, compared to the death
of millions for your Pakistan?

1105
01:24:42,084 --> 01:24:45,544
I was not referring to my house.

1106
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:49,327
I was referring to my daughter.

1107
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,714
Papa, we've come to say goodbye.

1108
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:26,577
I'm sorry you're not coming with us
to Pakistan,

1109
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:29,289
but... I understand.

1110
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:31,417
I will visit you, Papa.

1111
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:35,712
But my home is now in Bombay.
With my husband and my child.

1112
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:52,711
Bibisahiba, Jinnah Sahab has come back.

1113
01:25:52,834 --> 01:25:54,754
Bring some tea.

1114
01:25:58,459 --> 01:26:01,129
The refugees are pouring into Pakistan.

1115
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:03,211
There are stories of massacres.

1116
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:05,334
Well, we'll send our army in to help them.

1117
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:09,629
You haven't any army.
They've given Firozpur to India.

1118
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:11,461
It's final.

1119
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:14,504
But that is Muslim territory.

1120
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:17,826
- And our major arsenal.
- It's Mountbatten.

1121
01:26:17,959 --> 01:26:20,789
With Nehru whispering in his wife's ear.

1122
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:36,579
I'm glad you could spare me these
moments before you go, Miss Jinnah.

1123
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:39,629
I will see you in Karachi, won't I?

1124
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:41,961
You must be my guest, Your Excellency.

1125
01:26:42,084 --> 01:26:44,674
Oh, do call me Edwina.

1126
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:49,042
Edwina, I invite you formally,
on behalf of the government,

1127
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:52,577
and informally, to sneak in
whenever you wish.

1128
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,826
But your heart is really in Hindustan,
isn't it?

1129
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:00,501
Why do you say that?

1130
01:27:00,626 --> 01:27:04,956
Because I think we should start
by being honest with each other.

1131
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:07,334
That's very welcome.

1132
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:11,924
So... what do you mean by India...

1133
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:14,832
Hindustan being nearer my heart?

1134
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:18,959
Your friends.
Your particular friendship with...

1135
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:22,424
- His name is Jawaharlal Nehru.
- Yes.

1136
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:24,542
Nehru.

1137
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:29,037
It goes very far, doesn't it?
Your friendship with him.

1138
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:31,877
And he's a friend of your husband.

1139
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:34,211
People have been talking, but...

1140
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:36,924
people do talk.

1141
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:39,832
- You know what they say about you?
- Me?

1142
01:27:39,959 --> 01:27:42,289
- There's nothing to talk about.
- On the contrary.

1143
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:46,577
They say that you and your brother...
are obsessive.

1144
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:49,539
That you're obsessed with this...
Pakistan.

1145
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:51,287
Yes.

1146
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:54,787
And that is the ideal
that holds us together.

1147
01:27:56,501 --> 01:27:59,381
Could you accept, as a friend,
someone who didn't share that ideal?

1148
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:02,291
Who...didn't believe in Pakistan?

1149
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:05,751
No.

1150
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:09,377
I thought you might say that.

1151
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,581
But I want you to know, Fatima, that...

1152
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:15,039
if there can be a one-sided friendship,

1153
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:18,127
I consider myself your friend.

1154
01:28:27,334 --> 01:28:31,004
Liaquat, I'm appointing you
first prime minister.

1155
01:28:31,126 --> 01:28:33,576
I will announce it
in the assembly tomorrow.

1156
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:36,129
As for remuneration,

1157
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:41,251
my salary, as governor-general,
will be one rupee a month.

1158
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:44,036
We must be the first to set an example.

1159
01:28:44,167 --> 01:28:45,577
(Jinnah coughs)

1160
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:51,786
Are you feeling all right, sir?

1161
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:54,329
(Gasps)

1162
01:28:55,459 --> 01:28:57,539
(Military band plays)

1163
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:11,381
(Cheering)

1164
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:30,417
(Jinnah) 'If we want to make
this great state of Pakistan

1165
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,042
'happy and prosperous,

1166
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:36,667
'we must concentrate wholly and solely

1167
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:40,332
'on the well-being of the people.

'or any other place of worship
in the State of Pakistan.'

1171
01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:53,082
My guiding principle

1172
01:29:53,209 --> 01:29:56,999
will be justice and fair play,

1173
01:29:57,126 --> 01:30:00,286
without any prejudice or ill will,

1174

without any partiality or favouritism.

1175
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:09,962
We must root out the poison
of corruption and nepotism.

1176
01:30:10,084 --> 01:30:12,384
Our inspiration

1177
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:16,041
will be the golden principles
of the Holy Prophet,

peace be upon him.

1179
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:19,826
And I know

1180
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:23,999
that with your support and cooperation,

1181
01:30:24,126 --> 01:30:26,326
I can look forward

1182
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:29,249
to the day when Pakistan

1183
01:30:29,376 --> 01:30:34,626
becomes one of the greatest nations
of the world.

1184
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:36,381
(Applause)

1185
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:05,792
Each family will be given a grant
and some accommodation, sir.

1186
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:34,171
Something is wrong, sir.

1187
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:37,461
Open the doors.

1188
01:31:43,959 --> 01:31:46,209
Oh, God!

1189
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:52,077
No, sir, no. It's not for you, sir.

1190
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:23,209

(Man cries)
Allahu Akbar!

1193
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:48,667
Jinnah Sahab, what would've happened
if you had not created Pakistan?

1194
01:33:48,792 --> 01:33:50,582
I don't know.

1195
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,919
I had my fears.

1196
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:56,922
Look what happened to the Jews
in Germany.

1197
01:33:57,042 --> 01:34:00,002
(Narrator)
And to minorities all over the world.

1198
01:34:00,126 --> 01:34:01,536
India, please.

1199
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:04,671
(Cheering on screen)

1200
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:06,332
(British male announcer)
'Tensions had reached a high point

1201
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:07,959

Is this the end result
of Hindu fanaticism?

01:34:35,126 --> 01:34:40,246
These are the people I outlawed
when I was Prime Minister of India.

(Nehru)
Fortunately, they still remain a minority.

1212
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:53,917
You realise, of course,
that these are the people who killed me?

1213
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:57,292
And you know why, Quaid-e-Azam?

1214
01:34:57,417 --> 01:35:01,537
They accused me of giving way
to Pakistan.

1215
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:04,377
I always thought that one day

1216
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:08,631
British Raj would become
Ram Raj.

1217
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:12,631
(Cheering)

1218
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:17,754
Some of them have come
thousands of miles.

1219
01:35:17,876 --> 01:35:21,626
I don't know what we can do
to help them.

1220
01:35:24,209 --> 01:35:25,999
- Assalamualaikum.
- Walaikumasalam, madam.

1221
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:28,166
- How do you do, Lady Mountbatten.
- How do you do.

1222
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:31,712
I am the social worker
in charge of this camp.

1223
01:35:31,834 --> 01:35:34,674
Madam, the conditions here are appalling.

1224
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:38,462
There are no tents.
The officials are not at all cooperative.

1225
01:35:38,584 --> 01:35:41,584
(Speaks Urdu)

1226
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:45,881
She's saying that she's lost her son

1227
01:35:46,001 --> 01:35:47,831
and that her husband has died,

1228
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:50,709
and is this
what they left their homeland for?

1229
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:52,424
Madam, you gave me an award.

1230
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:55,172
At Ahmedabad University.

1231
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:56,712
Lady Mountbatten was there.

1232
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,134
Yes, I remember you clearly.

1233
01:36:00,834 --> 01:36:04,924
They've taken my sister.
My little sister.

1234
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:07,882
She's gone!

1235
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:10,381
(Social worker) There are hundreds
like her sister, on both sides.

1236
01:36:10,501 --> 01:36:13,131
Kidnapped, raped, and kept as slaves.

1237
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:16,501
Too ashamed to identify themselves
or run away.

1238
01:36:16,626 --> 01:36:20,246
(Edwina) And their families wouldn't
accept them back, if they've been raped?

1239
01:36:20,376 --> 01:36:22,996
Would you accept your daughter,
under the same circumstances?

1240
01:36:23,126 --> 01:36:25,916
Of course!

1241
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:30,462
Why don't you sit down?
I'll just get you some tea.

1242
01:36:35,917 --> 01:36:37,747
What can we do?

1243
01:36:39,334 --> 01:36:41,634
I'll do what I can here.

1244
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:43,631
Meanwhile, on the other side,

1245
01:36:43,751 --> 01:36:46,251
use your influence with Nehru.

1246
01:36:46,376 --> 01:36:49,996
Get him to send troops
to stop the slaughter and kidnapping.

1247
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:52,956
Fatima, he's no longer just a friend.

1248
01:36:53,084 --> 01:36:55,584
He's Prime Minister of India.

1249
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:59,129
And for... all sorts of reasons, I can't.

1250
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:02,422
I shouldn't.

1251
01:37:04,876 --> 01:37:06,286
I'll talk to him.

1252
01:37:09,084 --> 01:37:14,044
Mountbatten has promised us
complete army support.

1253
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:18,167
And yet, all British officers
are confined to barracks.

1254
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,132
Sir.

1255
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,751
The Maharaja of Kashmir

1256
01:37:22,876 --> 01:37:25,786
has signed the state over to India!

1257
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:28,037
That's impossible!

1258
01:37:31,501 --> 01:37:34,791
Kashmir is a Muslim state.

1259
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:38,667
Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan.

1260
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,632
(Man) Sir, we have reports

1261
01:37:40,751 --> 01:37:44,501
that the Indian army
is already in Kashmir.

1262
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:48,376
And they're being... personally directed
by Mountbatten.

1263
01:37:48,501 --> 01:37:52,581
(Liaquat) Lord Mountbatten
has deceived us.

1264
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:55,329
And he still pretends to be our friend.

1265
01:37:56,501 --> 01:38:00,001
He is due here tomorrow,
on a state visit, and...

1266
01:38:00,126 --> 01:38:01,206
I'll snub him!

1267
01:38:04,292 --> 01:38:08,132
We must learn to rise above
these differences, Liaquat.

1268
01:38:10,834 --> 01:38:13,674
He is our guest.

1269
01:38:14,834 --> 01:38:16,334
So, Jinnah Sahab,

1270
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:19,669
your story is that most of the blame
lies with the Mountbattens.

1271
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:22,252
Only as much as they are guilty of.

1272
01:38:22,376 --> 01:38:25,576
Of course, you don't know
what happened to Mountbatten.

1273
01:38:25,709 --> 01:38:27,289
No.

1274
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:31,037
For a while, it was rumoured
that he was a Soviet spy.

1275
01:38:32,334 --> 01:38:34,634
In the end,

1276
01:38:34,751 --> 01:38:37,581
he became a symbolic target

1277
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:40,379
for the Irish Republican Army.

1278
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:44,291
(Jinnah) My Lord, may I open,
for the prosecution?

1279
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:47,792
Your case, Jinnah Sahab.

1280
01:38:47,917 --> 01:38:51,127
Lord Mountbatten stands accused

1281
01:38:51,251 --> 01:38:54,131
of being, from the first,

1282
01:38:54,251 --> 01:38:56,171
an enemy

1283
01:38:56,292 --> 01:38:58,832
of Pakistan.

1284
01:38:58,959 --> 01:39:01,039
Guilty or not guilty?

1285
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:04,707
- I created the wretched country.
- (Jeering)

1286
01:39:06,917 --> 01:39:08,747
(A gavel is struck)

1287
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:11,126
Order! Order! Order!

1288
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:15,671
I submit five pieces of evidence.

1289
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:17,042
One:

1290
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:23,207
Lord Mountbatten advanced
the date of partition by eight months,

1291
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:27,004
hoping that the new country
would be like a regiment of soldiers

1292
01:39:27,126 --> 01:39:31,206
parachuted into enemy territory
without maps.

1293
01:39:31,334 --> 01:39:35,384
Secondly: Lord Mountbatten interfered
in the division of land

1294
01:39:35,501 --> 01:39:38,581
between India and Pakistan,

1295
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:43,379
giving the whole military arsenal
at Firozpur to India,

1296
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:47,711
after it had been allocated to Pakistan.

1297
01:39:47,834 --> 01:39:50,924
I now call Sir Cyril Radcliffe,

1298
01:39:51,042 --> 01:39:53,132
who drew up the boundary

1299
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:56,461
and was then forced to change it.

1300
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:01,787
Sir Cyril,

1301
01:40:01,917 --> 01:40:06,287
did the Radcliffe Commission
award Firozpur to Pakistan?

1302
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,577
Yes, it did. At first.

1303
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:11,829
- Why?
- It was a Muslim majority district.

1304
01:40:11,959 --> 01:40:14,789
Sir Cyril, did Lord Mountbatten

1305
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:16,457
issue any orders to you?

1306
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:19,294
Oh, yes. He gave me a verbal order.

1307
01:40:19,417 --> 01:40:22,457
You see, the border near Firozpur
became a curve

1308
01:40:22,584 --> 01:40:25,754
and I was instructed
to make it a straight line.

1309
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:29,786
Thus transferring hundreds of thousands
of people from one country to another

1310
01:40:29,917 --> 01:40:35,127
and leaving Pakistan without
one major army arsenal.

1311
01:40:35,251 --> 01:40:37,461
- That is correct.
- (Jeering)

1312
01:40:37,584 --> 01:40:39,584
Order! Order!

1313
01:40:39,709 --> 01:40:41,289
Thank you, Sir Cyril.

1314
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:46,747
And lastly,

1315
01:40:46,876 --> 01:40:48,956
this mess over Kashmir.

1316
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:51,964
My Lord,
there was no mess over Kashmir.

1317
01:40:52,084 --> 01:40:55,334
Even I know that there've been
three wars fought over Kashmir

1318
01:40:55,459 --> 01:40:57,669
since you left it the way you did.

1319
01:40:57,792 --> 01:41:00,502
The mess was not of my making.

1320
01:41:00,626 --> 01:41:03,536
Mr Jinnah hates to lose.

1321
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:06,207
He signed a document allowing
the Maharaja of Kashmir

1322
01:41:06,334 --> 01:41:08,424
to choose either India or Pakistan.

1323
01:41:08,542 --> 01:41:12,172
- He chose India. Now he cries foul.
- (Jinnah) My Lord...

1324
01:41:12,292 --> 01:41:15,382
I did sign

1325
01:41:15,501 --> 01:41:18,581
and the Maharaja of Kashmir,
being a Hindu,

1326
01:41:18,709 --> 01:41:24,329
with a population 80 per cent Muslim,
should have signed to Pakistan.

1327
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:27,884
My Lord,

1328
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:31,381
lam guilty.

1329
01:41:31,501 --> 01:41:34,881
Guilty of trusting Lord Mountbatten

1330
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:38,541
and the British army officers
who came to command my army

1331
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:40,997
at my request.

1332
01:41:41,126 --> 01:41:42,876
My Lord, I call General Gracey.

1333
01:41:53,126 --> 01:41:55,036
General Gracey,

1334
01:41:55,167 --> 01:41:57,537
you were the army commander
in Pakistan.

1335
01:41:57,667 --> 01:41:59,077
Yes.

1336
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:02,629
Did you receive intelligence
that Indian regiments,

1337
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:07,251
under Lord Mountbatten's command,
had been airlifted into Kashmir

1338
01:42:07,376 --> 01:42:08,916
- Yes.
- Were you ordered,

1339
01:42:09,042 --> 01:42:13,172
by the government of Pakistan,
as its army commander,

1340
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:16,502
to resist that invasion?

1341
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:18,326
Yes, I was.

1342
01:42:18,459 --> 01:42:21,499
And did you resist it?

1343
01:42:21,626 --> 01:42:24,416
No, I... I...

1344
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:27,002
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to explain to the court.

1345
01:42:29,251 --> 01:42:31,381
I'm a British officer.

1346
01:42:31,501 --> 01:42:35,081
The Indian side
was led by British officers.

1347
01:42:35,209 --> 01:42:39,629
I wasn't going into a war with
other officers commissioned by the King.

1348
01:42:40,417 --> 01:42:41,667
I refused.

1349
01:42:41,792 --> 01:42:44,132
But, General Gracey,

1350
01:42:44,251 --> 01:42:45,331
that is mutiny.

1351
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:51,829
Well, mutiny is a rather large word
for a country like Pakistan to use.

1352
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,577
Thank you, General Gracey.
That will be all.

1353
01:43:01,709 --> 01:43:06,379
And now, a question
to Lord Mountbatten himself.

1354
01:43:07,959 --> 01:43:12,919
Why did you not stop the slaughter?
Why did you not send in your troops?

1355
01:43:13,042 --> 01:43:14,922
As I said to you before, Mr Jinnah,

1356
01:43:15,042 --> 01:43:18,132
British troops could not get involved
in your squabbles.

1357
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:21,081
Britain had to withdraw. With honour.

1358
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:28,747
After 200 years of looting, exploitation,
and colonial theft,

1359
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:31,626
I suppose there is...honour...

1360
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:34,211
among thieves.

1361
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:36,384
My Lord, I rest my case.

1362
01:43:37,709 --> 01:43:40,579
Jinnah Sahab, one last question.

1363
01:43:40,709 --> 01:43:42,959
Mind you, I ask all of them this.

1364
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:45,794
If you had your time again,

1365
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:48,377
would you do the same thing?

1366
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:50,131
Yes.

1367
01:43:50,876 --> 01:43:53,706
But I would want others
to behave differently.

1368
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:58,749
And if you were to ask
one person for forgiveness,

1369
01:43:58,876 --> 01:44:00,166
just one,

1370
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:02,132
who would you choose?

1371
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,794
The time is past.

1372
01:44:05,917 --> 01:44:08,667
Perhaps it still can be arranged.

1373
01:44:55,001 --> 01:44:57,881
- What's your name?
- Zakia.

1374
01:44:58,001 --> 01:45:00,751
- Where are you from?
- Firozpur.

1375
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:02,076
And where are you going?

1376
01:45:02,209 --> 01:45:03,919
To Pakistan.

1377
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:07,002
That's a brave girl.

1378
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:10,246
Pakistan was made for you.
You're safe now.

1379
01:45:10,376 --> 01:45:12,876
Will my mother meet me in Pakistan?

1380
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:14,631
Shh...

1381
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:21,039
I'm sorry, sir. She's distracted.
She lost her mother.

1382
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:23,077
It has been very hard.

1383
01:45:23,209 --> 01:45:26,629
Abbajan,
maybe the old man has seen Amma.

1384
01:45:27,542 --> 01:45:29,332
Shh...

1385
01:45:29,459 --> 01:45:32,209
Do you know who he is?

1386
01:45:32,334 --> 01:45:36,134
This is the Quaid-e-Azam.

1387
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:41,631
I'm sorry, sir. We beg your forgiveness
for her not recognising you.

1388
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:44,131
But... she's only a child.

1389
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:49,461
It is I who should ask you for forgiveness.

1390
01:45:49,584 --> 01:45:52,384
For any part I have had
in what has happened to you.

1391
01:45:52,501 --> 01:45:57,291
No, no, sir.
I bless you with all my heart.

1392
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:59,417
Allah blesses you.

1393
01:46:02,167 --> 01:46:05,577
