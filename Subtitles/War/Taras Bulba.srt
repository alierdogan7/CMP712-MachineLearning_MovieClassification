throughout the civilized world.

The Ottoman Empire swept
east across Asia Minor,

8
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,402
Triumphant, the Turkish Sultan
turned west to the Ukraine.

9
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:47,402
Turkish spearheads threatened
the frontiers of Poland.

10
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,906
The fate of Europe
hung in the balance...

The whole army's probably
lying drunk in the mud.

Colonel Manfred, we
will speak here.

38

It will spare us
both embarrassment.

39

I give you a toast to our common
triumph over the infidels.

40

Too bad we're fighting
on the same side, huh?

43

You fight well, Cossack.

His Majesty is pleased
by the results of our alliance.

to do you the honor...

of integrating all Cossack troops
into the Polish-lmperial Army.

Do you see this scalp lock?

56
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,057
That means you're speaking
to the Zaporozhtzi.

We fought with you
to rid this land of the Turks...

61
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,113
because this is our land.

62
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,896
Now take your Polish

as a buffer against the East...

is dispersing the Cossack troops...

85
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,651
