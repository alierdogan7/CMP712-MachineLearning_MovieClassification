1
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,432
Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.
Attention.

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,030
Explain to.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,998
Long live our sacred Germany.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,798
Fire.

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,751
Is it all began?
- Hurry up. Forward.

6
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,269
Loge 19. We are too late,
but can you for this one time...

7
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,989
The Führer is there too.
You should only go after the break.

8
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,709
Oh, it's just begun.
And the best music is loud.

9
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,796
Make an exception for an officer
who, like the Führer loves to Wagner.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,393
Be quiet and stay behind the curtain.
Just after the break may visit your place.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,956
There he is.

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,392
Do you see those eyes.
He really enjoys full teugen.

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,074
He loves that music.

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,269
And he loves soldiers.
- Me too.

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,751
That bodes well
for our future.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,268
Will you marry me?
- What?

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,878
Not, It is not so difficult. Will you marry me?
- You're not all there.

18
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,237
Can I make an offer?

19
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,429
Dear Nina, we are
so far encountered by land...

20
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,673
that we have two days right
Poland and left move the masses.

21
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,719
The country is desolate,
just sand and dust.

22
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,591
It is inconceivable crowd.
Many Jews and mixed blood.

23
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,877
A nation that is only
under the knout feels good.

24
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,237
Everywhere you see sad poverty
and dining.

25
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,791
The thousands of prisoners will
our economy a disservice.

26
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,597
We knew that a campaign against
Russia would not be easy.

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,515
This kind of slaughter.
- Henning, you exaggerate.

28
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,435
Here things happen, Claus,
just behind the front line...

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,394
that my imagination to go upstairs.

30
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,519
Your troops do not believe you found
if you tell them.

31
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,394
Tell him what you saw.

32
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,278
She was suddenly tonight
to my door, exhausted and confused.

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,995
Can you get that letter in your unit
question? He is faster than in Berlin.

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,719
It is a woman...

35
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,990
Child. Small child. Man.

36
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,948
Old man, is difficult.

37
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,478
Move, move. Walk.

38
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,198
Come on, dirty jew.

39
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,994
Command to stop. Undress.

40
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,115
Please, don't.

41
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,513
Beautiful woman, old man.
Everybody cries.

42
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,078
Very little.

43
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,269
So small.

44
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,908
Lots of crying.

45
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,628
My baby. So many crying.

46
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,030
Nothing child, please.

47
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,229
In her village, in Krupka,
that is not so far away...

48
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,279
has a German unit
citizens from their home.

49
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,309
Children, elderly, women,
men. She received a Execution by shooting.

50
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,274
912 people, almost the entire village.

51
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,358
These were her parents
and her brothers and sisters.

52
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,440
There are also other villages.

53
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,355
Not in this area over 30,000
why people have to be made.

54
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,999
Unbelievable.

55
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,548
They are people like us.
I think that breeds hatred intolerable.

56
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,872
They took us as liberators.
I hear they are still welcome.

57
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,950
There is only one possible solution.

58
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,112
Hitler must go.

59
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,076
Now? While the war is in full swing?
We have sworn an oath.

60
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,074
He has already sworn a hundred times
trampled.

61
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,356
Time is running out.

62
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,836
Dear Nina, there are days that you never
most of his memory is erased.

63
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,552
Times when we doubt
to everything we think and do.

64
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,272
I've never been so serious doubts
to my profession and my life now.

65
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,959
East Prussia, 1943

66
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,637
That bastard.

67
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,279
What is a bastard Hitler. I hope
klojo ending in hell.

68
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,109
He knows not what he says
if he is drunk.

69
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,355
He let hundreds of thousands of people
die in the bloody Stalingrad.

70
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,236
However, it stops cold.

71
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,473
He is so almost anything.

72
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,112
General, and kept to himself. He is also
still head of the intelligence service.

73
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,555
And you should not yell.

74
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,793
It should be just,
otherwise I explosive.

75
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,439
Which is insensitive bastard
only with themselves busy.

76
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,311
His people can not give a damn him care.
- Now it is enough. Can you help me?

77
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,879
Yes, of course.

78
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,078
Who are you?

79
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,993
You're right.

80
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,914
Die-Russia military exercise is considered
's disaster. And also in humanitarian terms.

81
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,038
If you knew what officers
the intelligence service such as hear...

82
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,351
You can not better
discuss somewhere else?

83
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,999
Come on.

84
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,759
Dear Nina, with open eyes, I see
our country towards its downfall.

85
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
But I can do nothing against.

86
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,677
My work in the General Staff
is meaningless.

87
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,437
I would like to move to the front
in Africa. I can not just different.

88
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,678
Tunisia, April 1943

89
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,558
Where are you from?
- First Lieutenant Farber.

90
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,390
I had to sign with you. You would have
give to me a unit command.

91
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,514
It seems you hear a Swabia.
- You sometimes?

92
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,719
Yes, from Lautlinge. And you?
- From Böblingen.

93
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,872
It is not true. Go sit still.

94
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,715
And you want a unit of me?
- Yes, that's why I'm here.

95
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,031
We can no longer
the hero will pass the time.

96
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,396
Our African adventure is over.

97
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,398
Outwards. Come on.

98
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,628
Put die, boy.

99
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,793
We have a front Swabia.
So it is good.

100
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,034
Tell me something. And keep breathing.
All right, just keep breathing.

101
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,988
Wait. Not dead, boy.

102
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,153
Therefore, Why don't you listened to me?

103
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,833
See 'm. See you again.

104
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,317
I go to the new command post.
- I wait until everyone has passed.

105
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,597
Yesterday, we had gone here.

106
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,519
I'm sorry. Order from on high.

107
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,318
What do you see?

108
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,152
A doctor.

109
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,550
Where am I?
- At the hospital in Munich.

110
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,072
We have in each case
To view can save.

111
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,800
We are pleased that you are still alive.

112
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,398
Wait a long time. LN
Africa has almost given to you.

113
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,752
Hello, Claus.

114
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,635
What have they done to you?

115
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,356
In the land of the blind
one-eyed man is king.

116
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,753
I can not even wegwissen your tears.

117
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,834
On this arm you do not hand more.

118
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,718
That has been amputated in Tunisia.

119
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,392
And my wedding ring?

120
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,394
They have thrown away the manual.

121
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,117
The ring is still on.

122
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,918
I have to do something against this guy.
I had a lot to do.

123
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,592
You have to be healthy again,
nothing more.

124
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,113
Can I my gloves
not off, Henning?

125
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,956
Then there are fingerprints on.
- It's for your own safety.

126
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,831
Write the following. First:
'The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead. "

127
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,276
"An unscrupulous clique...
- What types should I?

128
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,749
'The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead. "

129
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,754
That you can not do.
- We must. We have no choice.

130
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,832
If this message reaches the press,
he is already dead.

131
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,878
Are you afraid?
- My hands shake just a little.

132
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,278
You had promised me that you would do.

133
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,158
I do too.

134
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,953
Okay, first sentence.

135
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,433
'The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead. "

136
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,192
Exclamation.

137
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,151
"An unscrupulous clique of party leaders...

138
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,312
has the opportunity
taken to benefit...

139
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,598
to the violent conflict front
in the back to attack. "

140
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,478
That is not true.

141
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,679
Maneuver distraction. They may
not know who is behind it.

142
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,798
Since there now
great danger...

143
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,080
The rich government,
to maintain law and order...

144
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,036
decided to take action.

145
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,839
The SS.

146
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,150
And the papers?
- Too late.

147
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,355
Exit and follow me.
Put your arms on edge.

148
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,073
Who is that?

149
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,276
Do you live here?
- I would have known.

150
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,953
What is that answer?

151
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,069
I'm Colonel Henning von Tresckow
and that is Lieutenant Von Stauffenberg.

152
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,633
ln order.

153
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,952
Come on.

154
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,314
Shoot immediately
as they try to flee.

155
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,711
Surround the house
and blocking all exits.

156
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,110
That was a lot.
- Come out and fast.

157
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,589
Keep the windows in the cellar holes.

158
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,238
What is it?

159
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,678
I'm afraid.
I'm terrified of the gallows.

160
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,435
We burn all drafts
and hide the typewriter.

161
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,077
I know. It is highly dangerous
what we do. For all of us.

162
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,310
You can now go on logging.

163
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,919
I can not. And I do not.

164
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,113
The kids want you
good night wishes.

165
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,392
Who first?

166
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,358
Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Valerie. Sleep good.

167
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,911
Excuse me...
- No. Another time.

168
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,833
Who told you that?

169
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,957
Grandma.
- You know my mother still.

170
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,873
God will protect you.
And now to bed.

171
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,475
Good night, big boy. Come over here.

172
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,869
Men may embrace each other.

173
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,033
Sleep good.

174
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,876
Where did you get that gun for?

175
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,518
In the event that.

176
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,910
Burn it. They should not
fall into the wrong hands.

177
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,550
Anything else?
- Are you mad?

178
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,111
What time does your train?
- According to 't track booklet to 00.10 hours.

179
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,274
Then it will do so. Germans
are very punctual, even in the war.

180
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,273
You exaggerate.
- Perhaps.

181
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,397
I am the only
to my senses to do.

182
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,075
Why?
- You may guess three times.

183
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,949
I can not tell you.
I may not agree.

184
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,796
Not anymore?
You tell me anything.

185
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,033
We turn around to the topic
as a cat to the hot broth.

186
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,432
You're something. I do not know what
and therefore I'm upset.

187
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,876
Do you trust me?

188
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,315
It has nothing to do with confidence
to make it comes to your security.

189
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,074
So the hero you want to hang out.

190
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,119
I want an end to the war make.

191
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,512
Do you also turn out to me?
To your children?

192
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,318
Very often.

193
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,669
Can you imagine
that we do not want to lose?

194
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,235
You're my man. You're with me
married and not with the Empire.

195
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,110
It is also about us.
- To us, it has long anymore.

196
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,398
It is about duty, honor and morality.
I got my belly full of them.

197
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,159
You are so changed.

198
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,517
If I see you so, I think:
That's my man anymore.

199
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,393
He is just as fanatical
as those beyond.

200
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,640
They trot through their hatred and others
trot in their desire shipment.

201
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,670
I was always so proud of
that you was different.

202
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,072
That is now over.

203
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,556
You're just like her.

204
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,950
What we do here, Nina,
we do for Germany.

205
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,392
Thing to do for me. Only for me.

206
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,116
Do not die.
- I will see to that.

207
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,795
Swear. With a handshake.

208
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,628
I will do everything I can.

209
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,794
I think that is not enough.

210
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,795
I can not promise you.

211
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,788
Then go back to Berlin
and do not let what you can.

212
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,797
You demands the impossible from me.
- You also mine.

213
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,832
Are we like each other?

214
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,671
You want to own something.

215
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,992
Actually not.

216
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,918
Take care of yourself.

217
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,191
Sorry, I guess I
coupá me in the wrong.

218
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,356
Can you still my wife 's call, Alix?
- I will.

219
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,358
General Fromm would like to speak
in his office.

220
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,354
I do so.
I expected another call.

221
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,359
By Alix von Winterfeld.
I would like Mrs speak.

222
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,471
I will pass on to the colonel.
Until horns.

223
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,395
Your wife is with the children away,
your mother said.

224
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,790
And unfortunately not available.

225
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,038
Come inside.

226
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,837
Would you like cognac?
- Not daytime.

227
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,510
The highest boss wants from us
a proposal on new troops.

228
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,672
I do not know
where I should get away...

229
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,958
but you'll think of something solid.
I can not go this time.

230
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,510
I have no time and honestly
I am also in no sense.

231
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,075
Civil defense siren again?

232
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,917
That would be the 20th.
The day after tomorrow. July 20.

233
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,071
And now in the shelter.

234
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,109
Are you not coming down?

235
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,710
Tomorrow is another execution
of Tristan and lsolde. Are you coming?

236
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,155
Is there a chance
that we get help from the British?

237
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,511
They demand the unconditional
surrender of the Germans.

238
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,309
For them, we are also traitors,
Like our own nation.

239
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,077
Well, we do it without them.

240
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,958
Even Hitler's enemies
we get no help.

241
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,031
Your decision is therefore common.

242
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,717
It must be done, and done now.

243
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,077
I put everything on the game,
even my life.

244
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,153
And I expect you to support me,
with all the consequences.

245
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,790
All sectors in the army
are aware.

246
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,430
If it succeeds in Berlin,
the others do too.

247
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,434
What happens when things go wrong?
- It may just not go wrong.

248
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,592
It can really all directions.
- That is true.

249
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,829
Expects you still visit?

250
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,873
This way.

251
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,275
What is it?
- I have the whole end apart.

252
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,470
I thought I was by the Gestapo
followed. Fortunately that was not the case.

253
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,198
This is Margarethe von Oven.

254
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,751
She was once the secretary of
Tresckow. She is on our side.

255
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,996
The story goes that the headquarters
of the Führer could result.

256
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,390
This week.
- Who says that?

257
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,189
That rumor doing the rounds.
- We must act quickly.

258
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,239
And another thing.
Tresckow stuck on the Eastern Front.

259
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,030
He had been pleased to see.
I had the next pass.

260
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,671
The attack should immediately
take place. At all costs.

261
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,512
I think that too.

262
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,595
If it goes wrong, we must
still trying to commit a coup.

263
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,513
It is not about the practical usefulness...

264
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,992
but we must world show
that we have tried.

265
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,833
And that our lives are
are prepared to give.

266
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,791
He said that literally.

267
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,079
You must immediately get out of Berlin.
Tonight yet.

268
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,073
No, not now.
- I beg you.

269
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,636
Get up. It is five hours, boss.

270
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,518
Yes, thank you. I am al

271
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,839
Think of the briefcase.
- I already have gestruikeld.

272
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,510
I do myself.
Stop just two shirts in my bag.

273
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,955
I do.
It's going to be hot again.

274
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,748
Is there one broken cases?
Good morning.

275
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,110
Here is the bag
and an extra shirt.

276
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,671
I just throw the tank full. We must
on time at the airport.

277
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,318
English explosive.

278
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,510
Who shall decide on our fate.

279
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,915
Why should you execute the attack?
We got you here so urgently needed.

280
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,108
Best guy, nobody wants
the dirty work.

281
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,989
We are here.
Lieutenant Haeften is already waiting.

282
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,034
Rangsdorf airport, 7 hours

283
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,791
We have unfortunately delayed.
- Why is that?

284
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,839
Hanging low fog and poor visibility.
- How late are we?

285
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,479
About an hour.

286
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,158
I will bag on the plane explain?
- Fine, yes. Be cautious however.

287
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,629
Is that the bag with the...

288
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,470
Your papers are here. How long
is flying to Rastenburg?

289
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,029
Two hours, depending on the wind.

290
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,156
Could it be...

291
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,918
that we never see each other?
- Yes, you can.

292
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,598
In the worst case.

293
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,351
I have huge respect for you.
For your courage.

294
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,035
Call Nina again.
Tell her...

295
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,999
Tell her I love her.
For the rest nothing.

296
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,475
Give me the bag with the paper.

297
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,956
It can also accidentally explode?

298
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,958
Dear Nina...

299
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,234
Rastenburg, East Prussia, 10:15

300
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,511
Kretz ensign.
I bring you to Wolfsschanze.

301
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,515
You can 't lose sight of.
- No second.

302
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,717
I have the text for your speech
given topic.

303
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,791
See you at noon in Keitel
barrack. The discussion is for an hour.

304
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,757
I will promptly on time.

305
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,311
Already 's been here before?
- Five days ago.

306
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,989
I have no problem with Jews.
That can not, because I know there is none.

307
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,073
Colonel Stauffenberg, heil Hitler.
What do you think of that?

308
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,676
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Anyway the best answer.

309
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,717
The Russians bars me worry.
- They are also right on our doorstep.

310
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,000
Say that but not against the Führer.
- That he knows well Thursday.

311
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,678
You have not had breakfast, I think so.

312
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,037
Breakfast for the colonel.
And soon a little bit.

313
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,395
Thank you, but I have no hunger.

314
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,917
The shoot lunch urge in,
So lay ahead but a bodempje.

315
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,876
And how are you in Berlin?
- Half the city is in ruins.

316
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,472
Willy Fritsch apparently at the last
air attack to have collapsed.

317
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,470
Well, in any case
it's a beautiful summer.

318
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,634
I think the worst mosquitoes.
- They are still disastrous than the Jews.

319
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,872
Just do not start again
about to whine.

320
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,434
Go ahead, I come true.

321
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,116
We gotta go. I believe
General expects Buhle us.

322
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,833
My adjutant von Haeften.
Lieutenant-General Von Thad.

323
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,956
Commander...
- Lechler.

324
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,556
Am I too early?
- We are on the way to Keitel.

325
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,038
Can Haeften somewhere waiting for me?

326
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,195
In the guest stay then.

327
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,393
John, bring the adjutant of Colonel
Stauffenberg to the guests stay.

328
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,509
I must say, Field Marshal...

329
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,832
that no troops there soon
more available.

330
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,996
There are up to fifteen divisions
deployable against the Russians.

331
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,553
The losses of the army, we can
do not respond.

332
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,436
Your enthusiasm is praiseworthy, but
if you can not talk against the Führer.

333
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,908
Keep your foot on the losses.

334
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,993
Saving the nerves of those poor guy.
With Keitel.

335
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,678
Yes, I know.

336
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,677
We gotta go.
- Already?

337
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,676
The agreement begins a half hour earlier.
Has anyone told you that?

338
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,831
No, unfortunately not.

339
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,437
How much time do we have?
- Ten minutes. So no hurry.

340
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,912
And think of what I said.
This is no ordinary war.

341
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,913
Where can I quickly
another shirt collection?

342
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,117
That can happen in my bedroom.

343
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,750
Here. If you want to help...
- I only need my adjutant.

344
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,474
Go ahead, I come true.
-We have to wait. There is time enough.

345
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,191
That never succeed.
- I love this. Do you have the ignition?

346
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,319
What do you want?

347
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,711
A quarter. Both.
We certainly need to play.

348
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,592
Both inflammation.

349
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,757
The tongs, give me the tongs.

350
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,551
If the wire breaks, it's over.

351
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,152
Is the acid-free?
I can not see.

352
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,835
Acid is released.
- Well, the second ignition.

353
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,798
What is it?
- Fellgiebel asks whether you call back.

354
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,476
I do later. Anything else?
- John Major is to wait.

355
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,631
We are coming to.

356
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,596
The guy is a disaster.

357
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,518
Check the equally fast.

358
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,909
And then pack. However cautious.

359
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,112
And what am I doing this?

360
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,680
A kilogram is enough. Take it.
- What you want? We are in a hurry.

361
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,434
I am al Hurry up.

362
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,272
God be with you!
- With all of us.

363
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,760
With just to hand that not.
- Keitel is already assumed.

364
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,559
What should you say?
- I want to help you.

365
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,679
My arm is still there.
- Gentlemen, we are not.

366
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,799
Little weird, right?

367
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,909
Every day there is bad news,
both the east and the west front.

368
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,117
Why can not hear the Führer?

369
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,873
He must know
how the situation there is?

370
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,875
Keitel part I think not.
Schenk just ready wine.

371
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,794
Heusinger is already busy.
Then, we're too late.

372
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,951
I want as close to the Führer
so I miss nothing.

373
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,157
I hear bad.
- I will.

374
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,635
The northern forces are
almost up to Ostrow along.

375
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,036
He is chief of general staff
General Fromm.

376
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,668
He introduced the new positions again.

377
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,154
The danger that the Russians,
in the area of the central forces...

378
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,949
which consists of 15 divisions,
draw in this direction.

379
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,157
So they cut
Northern troops that have...

380
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:27,270
Retreat is fundamentally wrong.
Let 's see. Here.

381
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,114
If we attack them from the side...
- I gotta call.

382
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,230
then we surround them and not to us.
But go quietly away.

383
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,076
I propose that the northern troops
Duna to return to bags.

384
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,595
Thus we strengthen the central...

385
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,038
Call for Superior General Fellgiebel
Stauffenberg. He is on the post adjutant.

386
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,713
Go for it.

387
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,670
General, I connect you through
with Stauffenberg.

388
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,909
I got you connected.
You can 'm record here.

389
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,511
Is it all end?
- No, I come right back.

390
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,352
That does not matter anyway. Yes, I wait.

391
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,870
Did you see me?

392
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,632
But not here.

393
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,315
And how are in the east?
- It is all according to plan.

394
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,189
There are problems with the car.
Apparently there is no...

395
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,159
Do not panic, it explodes here
more often a mine in the prohibited area.

396
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,553
Occasionally there accidentally kicks
an animal. And your car is underway.

397
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,352
I saw him though when I arrived.
- Well, you now have two cars.

398
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,271
Oh yes, one more thing. The commander asked
or you also continued to lunch.

399
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,912
Set at the height Berlin
and disconnect from all connections.

400
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,675
Let nothing leaking.
Keep it secret as long as possible.

401
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,398
Do you think he...

402
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,674
I bring you back.
- We are in a hurry.

403
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,709
You forget your hat and...
- Keep your mouth. And drive it.

404
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,075
Nurses, this way. The Führer.

405
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,470
I have to go to the airport.

406
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,156
Have not you heard? There is something
exploded in the headquarters.

407
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,318
I know, but we have a hurry.
Führer command.

408
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,273
But driving.

409
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,150
We have another one is needed.
This is insufficient.

410
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,471
Halt.
- Take your position.

411
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,672
You can not go.
There is alarm just beaten.

412
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,592
I have to go to the airport.

413
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,957
There may, until further notice
no one in or out.

414
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,874
We have no time.
Our unit leaves for hours.

415
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,519
Warrant warrant.

416
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,992
I commend you barricade
away and immediately.

417
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,836
I love me my instructions.
- This is unbelievable.

418
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,394
Can I use your phone?
- Always.

419
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,235
I call the commander for u.

420
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,078
With Kolbe, surveillance South. Colonel
Stauffenberg is here next to me.

421
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,710
He wants the commander speak.
- With Stauffenberg.

422
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,788
Möllendorf Oh, you're it.
We are stopped.

423
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,589
Alarm, yes. I've heard.
Also nothing more.

424
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,038
I miss my plane shortly
if not this sergeant...

425
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,635
You know, sir, that...

426
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,075
Yes, on your responsibility.

427
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,673
Airport Rastenburg, 13.15 hours

428
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,311
It is our success.

429
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,510
Not yet. Still a long way.

430
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,636
God, give me new strength.

431
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,036
Fellgiebel has fixed
already called to Berlin.

432
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,556
The man who wore them out...
Have you seen m?

433
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,110
That was Hitler.
- It was his mantle.

434
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,359
The face covered, like a dead man.

435
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,074
You do not survive such a bomb.
Even he did not.

436
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,594
Berlin, airport Rangsdorf, 15:40

437
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,273
Strange. Where is everybody?

438
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,828
And no pantserwagen.

439
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,117
Schweizer is true?
That was it agreed?

440
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,876
Yes, I'm just landed.

441
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,879
"Today in raids
of the jets did it happen...

442
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,794
what interests me in this oppressive hours
pijnigt incessantly. "

443
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,916
I go to the Bendlerstrasse.

444
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,119
Call Olbricht minute.
And make sure they send a car.

445
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,032
I needed fresh air.

446
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,594
She knew nothing of.
- Has Fellgiebel or not call?

447
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,072
That, but it was
a rather odd message.

448
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,074
There is something terrible thing happened.
The Führer alive.

449
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,469
That may not. These idiots have
in those two hours Thursday not done.

450
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,108
That is unbelievable.

451
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,354
Enter the start signal to Walküre.
Right now.

452
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,550
Hitler is dead, no doubt about it.
- Are you really sure?

453
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,952
Do you think I lie?
-It claims no one, but...

454
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,399
The air shed is made.
- A large cloud of smoke and screams dire.

455
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,597
Hitler was on a stretcher
wear away.

456
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,276
The bomb exploded two meters
next to him. He must be dead.

457
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,638
I'm convinced.
- Why is Walküre only now started?

458
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,191
We Taste in the dark.
We only got that call.

459
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,238
Come to Fromm.

460
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,468
I wait on you here, for all
security. I hear there are not more.

461
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,199
It is therefore failed.
- Adolf Hitler is dead, General.

462
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,477
Keitel claimed just the opposite.

463
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,632
The Field Marshal
highest in person.

464
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,158
Keitel is lying again 's. I've seen
Hitler dead that they took from the shed.

465
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,914
It is over.
- That does h.

466
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,357
General Fromm,
I myself have placed that bomb.

467
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,115
You?
- Hence launched Walküre.

468
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,592
Who gave his consent?
- Mertz von Quirnheim and me.

469
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,959
This is terrible. You give wholeheartedly again
that you have committed high treason.

470
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,192
Bartram, get immediate
Colonel Mertz.

471
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,236
The attack was carried out and did it.
Now it is important to quickly...

472
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,279
Stop with that nonsense.
Your attack failed.

473
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,395
Do you have a gun?
- Where do I need?

474
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,350
You must commit suicide.
You simply have no other choice.

475
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,115
I do not foster suicide.
- There is work to be done.

476
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,636
If we do nothing,
is our homeland to the sharks.

477
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,839
Did you participate in this coup?
- That you knew right?

478
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,438
I knew nothing. Absolutely nothing. And
such insinuations I am not served.

479
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:26,510
Did you launched Walküre?
- That 's right, yes. ln your name.

480
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,151
Then you're all three arrested.
Bartram, close them down.

481
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,633
You have nothing more to recommend here.
From now on we share the tune.

482
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,191
You have therefore not yet the courage
to join us to join.

483
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,353
I will make short shrift with you.
Give me your gun.

484
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,389
To do anything, General.
Otherwise you're dead.

485
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,952
I thought you were smarter.
You'll regret it.

486
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,671
There is a lot to regret
in this country. But this is not.

487
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,952
Plug him in the room next door.
And let him watch.

488
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,112
Grab his arms off
and make the phone defective.

489
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,232
Comrades. Soldiers.

490
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,428
I am deeply shocked.
I've just heard...

491
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,433
that our beloved Führer Adolf Hitler...

492
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,478
no longer alive.

493
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,953
Has just been launched
for the emergency Walküre.

494
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,430
We should form a united front.

495
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:48,994
We received the order for the government
hermetically district to close...

496
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,557
and to any disturbances
The order is restored.

497
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:01,796
I call on everyone
absolute obedience.

498
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,233
As to the front.

499
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,556
Why is the first sentence
crossed out?

500
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,510
The orders are secret. I do not know...
- Who has crossed out?

501
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,189
There must surely someone contract
Links have given?

502
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,393
The radio sends a communiqué.
- Is the radio still is not busy?

503
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,279
Apparently not.
- Make it happen.

504
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,034
We send the orders by integral.

505
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,274
Stop them there. You get
the orders of us. Hitler is dead.

506
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,233
Beck wants to hear from your mouth.

507
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,916
The dictator is dead, General.
I saw it happen before my eyes.

508
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,629
You do not survive such a bomb.
-Keitel otherwise.

509
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,193
That is a mystery to me.
- A riddle leads to confusion.

510
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,196
What we tell the people as Himmler
Hitler or Goebbels not declare death?

511
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,469
Well, what you also the world
make for me Hitler is dead.

512
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,358
And we act accordingly.

513
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,194
For you, the successor to Fromm.

514
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,911
But I honestly feel
me not so comfortable in that role.

515
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,515
Where Stauffenberg is?
- Second floor left.

516
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,628
All division leaders, yes.
Fromm immediately to the office.

517
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,359
I search colonel Stauffenberg.
- That's me.

518
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:08,355
SS leader Pifrader. I come on behalf of
the head of state.

519
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,238
You are therefore of the Gestapo.

520
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,875
Can I ask a few questions
under four eyes?

521
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,830
I got just one.
- It is a serious matter.

522
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,993
That I agree with you.
Give your arms off. Your adjutant too.

523
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,709
What do you want from me?
- I love you.

524
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,670
Close the door. Fast. Keep them.
- Get him in his leg.

525
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,918
I got m. The gentlemen are
disabled.

526
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,508
Close the gate off
and put extra surveillance down.

527
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,110
Six men with me.
We conclude that SS on it.

528
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,279
A second unit for the entrance.

529
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,549
Silence. I request you to be quiet.

530
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,196
I give the floor to our new
Head of State, General Beck.

531
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,555
Ladies and gentlemen,
This is a historic moment.

532
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,195
The military situation
that you all know...

533
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,512
is practically hopeless, on all fronts.

534
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,718
Each day new losses
reported. New defeat.

535
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,991
We want peace at last.

536
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,870
Where did he talking about?
- I know a lot.

537
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,195
... that all our energy to
turn and even our lives to car.

538
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:21,154
I ask you to us
to help and support.

539
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,992
In my opinion he does not count.
- Lntegendeel. Come on.

540
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,915
This is a coup.
- Without me.

541
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,039
We must equip
and the counter-attack going. But how?

542
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,158
I know
how we can come to weapons.

543
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,077
Berlin office of the commander,
18.00

544
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,276
Are you here for a reason?
- There is not anything here, Major.

545
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,231
Why? We follow the orders on.
- But not those of the Führer.

546
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,799
What do you mean by that?

547
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,318
I just come in from Dr. Goebbels.
He asks you to him want to come along.

548
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,596
It is rather a warrant.

549
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,959
I really do not follow orders of
a minister. Even though he called Goebbels.

550
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,109
Okay, I'm going to do to him.

551
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,629
With Mertz.
No, you can 'm not speak.

552
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,190
Follow that up.
Further instructions may be added.

553
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,918
That is not true.

554
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:18,030
By maintaining the power
arbitrariness and revenge out of the question.

555
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,036
Did you know?
- Yes.

556
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,352
The people must
the difference with the arbitrariness...

557
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:31,868
of the current rulers understand.

558
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,870
On the radio
the communique read.

559
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,433
today was...
a bomb attack committed.

560
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,910
These were some of the most seriously injured:

561
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:57,837
Lieutenant-General Schmundt,
Colonel Brandt, assistant Berger.

562
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,152
Slightly injured
Colonel General Jodl...

563
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:08,236
and the generals Korten, Buhle,
Boden Schatz, Heusinger and Scherff.

564
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,631
Furthermore, the admiral Voss
and Von Puttkammer...

565
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,078
sea captain Assmann
and Lieutenant-General Borgmann.

566
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:23,073
The Führer remained unharmed, a few
burns and bruising after.

567
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,836
Keitel was therefore right.
- He is right to work gone.

568
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,154
He will later today the Duce
for a longer receive maintenance.

569
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:39,077
Shortly after the attack, the state -
Marshal by the Führer to visit.

570
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,391
They lie.
They lie that it is printed.

571
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,633
Berlin, palace Goebbels, 18.55 hours

572
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,838
Nobody should look like or is
without my permission.

573
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,835
If I 'n quarter'm not back,
you must storm the house.

574
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,594
The building is surrounded. Two-man
to the right, two men left.

575
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,432
Minister, you wanted me to speak.
- Finally.

576
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,754
What is happening in the city?
And why is my house guarded?

577
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,911
Warrant from on high.

578
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:28,552
Immediately after it was disclosed
that our beloved Führer is dead...

579
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,395
What are you talking about?
The Führer is not dead. He is alive.

580
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,113
Lives the Führer?

581
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,557
That may not be true.

582
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,235
With Dr. Goebbels.
I need urgently the Führer speak.

583
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,476
Heil, Führer.
Next to me is one Major Remer...

584
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,598
that the government must monitor district.

585
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,672
They have him point made
that you no longer alive.

586
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,956
Major Remer, you hear me?
Do you recognize my voice?

587
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,037
As you wish, Führer.

588
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,433
Are all your doubts now
removed?

589
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:32,038
No doubt. He told me
the order given throughout Berlin.

590
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,797
Now we
from another keg tap.

591
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,230
Two units of the 5th Company
go to the Bendlerstrasse.

592
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:47,109
Did you get that machine gun
previously could not load?

593
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,113
Shoot straight away if they resist.

594
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,795
About ten minutes, this
all gone.

595
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,591
We can not go back.

596
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,713
Not anymore.

597
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,715
That coup must succeed today.

598
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,716
If not, then we all die.
I know for sure.

599
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,550
And maybe even our families.

600
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,875
The hatred of this man is
just as immoderate as himself.

601
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,558
We go by.

602
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,914
Yes, of course. I am so used to.

603
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,358
If you have not received orders?
Dan can come any time.

604
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,917
Can you just sign this?

605
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,193
He is so.

606
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,112
No, those orders are incorrect.
You only need to execute our orders.

607
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,078
Commander of the reservists, yes.

608
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,835
I do not know.
I only know that Hitler is dead.

609
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,516
In Paris, the SS disarmed.
Also in Vienna everything runs according to plan.

610
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,757
No, that statement is a fabrication.

611
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,999
Have you been off the radio speech?
- Yes, that was off.

612
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,270
No, with Stauffenberg.

613
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,877
Hayes, you're it.
I can still count on you, huh?

614
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,160
Yes, you must persevere.
Everything is here in full swing.

615
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,998
Field Marshal.

616
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,516
Chief is
Field Marshal von Witzleben.

617
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,956
He has been out of service, but...
- He supports h.

618
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,716
The attack was carried out and...
- What a mess.

619
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,509
I thought you did not.
- Since I had all reason.

620
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,831
I had promised to come
although that is useless.

621
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,676
Fromm asked whether he be back
his chamber may return. He is hungry.

622
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:32,597
He swears nothing improper to do so.
- Good, but keep him in the eye.

623
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,717
Come over here.

624
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,635
This is completely absurd.

625
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,920
The attack failed and the uprising is
beaten down. This takes nothing out.

626
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,390
Walküre runs.
In Paris the SS is already disarmed.

627
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,350
Hitler alive,
No one doubts there anymore.

628
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,275
With a handful of people you can not
against that man and the state begin.

629
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,396
Understand that anyway.

630
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,678
You can not even
reliably mobilize troops.

631
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,037
You let Major Remer
besiege the government district.

632
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,237
That man is a Nazi to the bone.

633
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:29,429
Solution to the problems
in the east. Sixty divisions...

634
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,990
He throws it wiped out.

635
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,670
Stieff has already been covered.

636
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,957
Fellgiebel too.

637
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,798
And now he is.

638
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,270
They just give to the effervescent.

639
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,074
It is not such sponsors continues.

640
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,476
But there was Tresckow.

641
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,030
Mertz, you need to hear this.
This is signed by Keitel.

642
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:22,548
'The Führer has to Himmler
appointed commander of the army.

643
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:28,078
Orders of Fromm, Witzleben
Hoepner are invalid or hence. "

644
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,553
You know what that means?
- We must immediately destroy.

645
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:44,119
That nothing will change even more.
Unfortunately not.

646
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,519
Help me out.

647
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,232
Faster, hurry. Pacific horns.

648
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,469
The coup perpetrators should not brands.

649
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,438
Here are the guns.

650
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,388
That should be faster.
Not make such a fuss.

651
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,752
The hand grenades.

652
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,030
Are you for or against the Führer?

653
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,590
Do you have a weapon?
- Are you for or against the Führer?

654
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,790
We are now married eleven years.

655
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,718
As long as he is in power.

656
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,676
Not much for a marriage.

657
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,949
Four children, I have begotten
and the fifth is coming.

658
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,519
And he?

659
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,229
He has, in the same period
destroyed almost the whole of Europe.

660
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,874
That is sure.

661
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,879
He would eventually get equal?

662
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,434
That may still not allow God?

663
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,994
I'm at the end of my Latin.

664
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,950
Tell my wife...

665
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,511
I for a case where I die for
fully endorse.

666
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,638
Any opposition is nipped in the bud.

667
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,389
I must ask you:
Are you for or against our Führer?

668
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,473
What should you do?
Make you outta here. Get out.

669
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,189
It occurs
since Stalingrad a disaster...

670
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,876
Are you for or against?
That is the only thing I want to know.

671
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:29,077
I can not me behind him scissors.
- Then, I have unfortunately arrest.

672
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:34,394
Do what you think you should do.
Mertz has nothing to do.

673
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,633
lntegendeel.
Unfortunately, the attack failed.

674
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,634
Give me your weapon.
- We are also officers, like u.

675
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,191
You've had your longest time.
- You have the Führer vowed faith.

676
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:53,230
You had to be ashamed. We go
to Fromm. You are with us.

677
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,712
Freeze. Stauffenberg, stop.
- Grab 'm. He can not escape.

678
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,635
Do not shoot. Are you crazy?
Don 't shoot.

679
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,598
Put the weapon on the ground.
- Reverse.

680
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,394
Doe quickly close that door.

681
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,791
Delia, call my wife again.

682
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,989
We have finally lost.
- It's over.

683
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,233
You must immediately all the incriminating
burning material.

684
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:52,872
They may find nothing. All names,
especially the names. Help them, Werner.

685
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,589
I am sorry,
but there is nobody at home with you.

686
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,910
So no goodbyes.

687
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,314
They have left us in the lurch.

688
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,512
Far too much.

689
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,517
I had a dream.

690
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,431
I have dreamed
of a German peace-loving people.

691
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,432
Guided by the best forces
from all walks.

692
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,557
A nation that law and justice
above all suggests...

693
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,439
that this war far eschews...

694
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,673
and that nothing else wants
than live in peace and freedom.

695
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,392
The game is off, Colonel.
Will you go to my office.

696
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,835
Now here I am again the lead
in hands. Is there something?

697
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,158
Well, gentlemen, that was it.

698
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,079
Now we turn again to the rolls.

699
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:43,631
I verordonneer you for your weapons
to issue and immediately.

700
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,836
We have no weapons.

701
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,793
We are not criminals?

702
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,430
You guys are much worse: traitors.

703
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,309
I accuse all participants
of high treason.

704
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,119
High Treason
our Führer Adolf Hitler.

705
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,835
You have faith
to the Führer vowed.

706
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,753
But that you have failed to do.

707
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,073
An officer may
no more serious crime.

708
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,836
In the name of the Führer
and as the highest court of the army...

709
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,279
I condemn you to the ball. The verdict
will be immediately implemented.

710
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,516
Dear Fromm,
your assessment is fair.

711
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,948
And perhaps necessary.

712
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,077
But I do not want
be shot dead.

713
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,031
We have so long together in the army
served. We were friends for so long.

714
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,034
That has nothing to do.
- Yet I beg you.

715
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,355
Yes, I beg you:

716
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:57,231
Let me again
I own that your verdict execution.

717
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,477
Give me your gun. Please.

718
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,392
Just do it, Beck.
But it could be over.

719
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,997
That is not so easy, Fromm best.

720
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,228
This senseless death...

721
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,916
Only one extra,
where there are already so many went for me.

722
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,392
But now it is my own death.

723
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:00,670
Is it already happened?
- Stay where you are. Help that man.

724
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,351
Get him off that gun.

725
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,273
Go on, hurry up.

726
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,351
God be merciful to him.

727
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,512
Can we talk about it?

728
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,912
Please, Fromm.

729
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,070
Can anyone than this poor guy
out of his misery?

730
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,515
Pridun, done that job on.

731
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,834
Hoepner, I think it
really terrible.

732
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,870
Choose you for the same fate as Beck?
- I do not feel guilty.

733
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,875
I think in any case not that I
a bullet through the head must hunt.

734
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:03,512
I can defend me and let me also
do. Even compared to my family.

735
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,631
Well, then I arrest you

736
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,272
Would anyone still write something?
A few final words.

737
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,355
I want something in the paper
entrust. Please.

738
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,512
Here, you go
sit at this table, Olbricht.

739
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,319
So we always sat facing each other.

740
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,237
Shoot it, so the
for the others not too long.

741
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,789
Are you ready, Olbricht?

742
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,192
Lieutenant Schady to death
convicted and executed are:

743
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,070
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht of infantry...

744
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,314
who colonel whose name me
forgot, and the first lieutenant.

745
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,597
Consummation down the verdict in the garden.

746
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,639
And bring General Hoepner
to Moabit prison.

747
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:31,113
All participants have at my command
acted. Their take no blame.

748
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,113
I am the only one who is guilty.
- Take him to.

749
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:38,114
You, you and you: you.

750
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,949
Stay away from that man.
- Do not dawdle too.

751
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,188
Hurry, go through.

752
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,792
Come on, those cars parking here.

753
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,350
Come on, traitors.

754
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,720
Schweizer, it's all over.

755
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,155
What are you doing here? Is that your car?

756
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:40,029
Row behind the others.
And do your light on.

757
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,712
Is there something? Come on.

758
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:38,117
General of the infantry
Friedrich Olbricht.

759
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,435
Attention.

760
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,270
The heart sees more than the eye, said
Tresckow. I will never forget.

761
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,237
Explain to.

762
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,839
Fire.

763
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,912
Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.

764
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,153
Attention.

765
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,791
Explain to.

766
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,433
Long live our sacred Germany.

767
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,759
Fire.

768
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,952
A very small clique
ambitious and unscrupulous...

769
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:13,717
and also unwise
and criminal officers...

770
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,077
Full smeedde
me to eliminate.

771
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:22,189
And together with me
the whole top of the German army.

772
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:31,834
The bomb, made by Colonel Stauffenberg
was placed...

773
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,118
exploded at two meters
away from me.

774
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,796
It struck a number of
my loyal employees injured...

775
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,552
and there was one death.

776
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,149
Eastern Poland, July 21, 1944

777
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,151
Schlabrendorff best.

778
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,151
A man leads only
a virtuous life...

779
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:34,519
if he is prepared to give his life
to provide for his conviction.

780
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,271
Say that to my wife.

781
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,152
After the attack were hundreds
people killed, so Fromm.

782
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,153
Nina and her children
have survived.

783
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,154
But until May 1945 were
yet millions of people dead.
