1
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:55,142
Setup on leading freighter.

2
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,868
Range.

3
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,705
-Mark?
-1500.

4
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,668
Fifty port. Open outer doors,
tubes one and two. Stand by.

5
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,670
Open outer doors, tubes one and two.
Stand by.

6
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:25,130
Open outer doors on one and two.
Stand by.

7
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,846
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

8
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,808
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

9
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,851
Outer doors open on
tubes one and two, sir.

10
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:39,228
Final bearing.

11
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,440
-Mark.
-320.

12
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,193
-Set.
-Fire one.

13
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,403
Fire one.

14
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,489
-One is fired, sir.
-Fire two.

15
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,615
Fire two.

16
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:54,994
-Two is fired, sir.
-Time on that first torpedo.

17
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:57,246
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

18
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:17,391
Crash dive! 300 feet! All ahead full !
Got a destroyer coming in fast!

19
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,226
Rig for depth charge. Silent running.

20
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,020
-Rig for depth charge. Silent running.
-Time!

21
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:23,230
Ten, nine, eight,

22
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,065


 seven, six. . .

23
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:22,182
We'd better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

24
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,018
-Why?
-His car had a flat tire this morning.

25
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:27,396
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

26
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:29,398
-Send 'em tomorrow.
-Yes, sir.

27
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,151
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

28
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:34,194
Another flat tire?

29
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,240
Almost the same thing. His wife, sir.
They had a quarrel last night.

30
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:41,201
-That.
-I'm ready for action.

31
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,829
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

32
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,165
Heading straight on towards the Akikazes.

33
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,125
-Stand by to dive.
-Aye, aye, sir.

34
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,002
Range, 1,800.

35
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,921
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

36
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:57,426
-Clear the bridge. Dive.
-Dive. Ready to shoot in 25 seconds, sir.

37
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,845
Bearing. Mark.

38
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:00,971
Fire.

39
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,222
Fire one.

40
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,057
Twenty-four seconds, sir.

41
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,935
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

42
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:09,897
You sunk him again, sir.

43
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:14,109
That makes 200 times
you sunk Bungo Pete in. . .

44
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:18,447
Two hundred days. He only sunk you once.

45
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,365
Just once.

46
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:22,409
But it wasn't on a desk.

47
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,413
Where do you get all these things anyway?

48
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,666
-Tables, desks.
-Mueller, you're a thief.

49
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,752
I'm a collector, sir.

50
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:35,881
Bungo Pete!
Let's put him next to his Akikaze destroyer.

51
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,675
The unknown factor.
The Sea Dragon of Area 7.

52
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,929
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area.

53
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,932
Too bad they'll never give you
another chance in that area, Commander.

54
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:47,768
Holy smokes.
Four submarines sunk in the Bungo Straits,

55
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,770
and they keep you behind a desk for a year,

56
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,480
for something they can't even
figure out themselves.

57
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:55,108
How many subs? You said four, I think.

58
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,195
-Yes, sir.
-The count was three a month ago.

59
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,781
Well, it's only scuttlebutt, Commander,

60
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:04,952
but the word's around that the last boat
sent out there was lost three days ago.

61
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,665
Get these things out of here.

62
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,128
Mueller,

63
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:17,798
when is the next sub due in?

64
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,425
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

65
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,888
Her skipper was wounded, but the
executive officer is due to take over.

66
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,515
He qualified for command?

67
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,599
Yes, sir.

68
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,643
They'll send her out to 7.

69
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,104
I suppose so.

70
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,649
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.

71
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,858
Tell him I'm coming over.

72
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,171
Executive Officer to the Duty Section.
Now hear this.

73
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,465
The repair crew will take over at 1 300.

74
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,093
Duty Section will stand by
with a repair list.

75
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:07,014
You beach boys who will be checking
in at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel,

76
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,683
the hotel does not have a repair crew.

77
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,935
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

78
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,945
Break it up! Russo! Cullen ! Break it up, I. . .

79
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,450
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

80
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:30,162
What we mean to say,
Mr. Bledsoe, congratulations.

81
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,663
Good luck, Captain.

82
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:33,874
Good luck, sir.

83
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,959
So this is the way we start, huh? Bribery!

84
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:37,127
Don't know what you mean, sir.

85
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,879
Next thing you know,
it'll be special privileges.

86
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,797
Sunbathing on the deck,
two-hour watches. . .

87
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,550
A sunburned crew's a happy crew, sir.
It's an old Navy axiom.

88
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,510
That you just made up!

89
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,351
Thanks a lot, men.

90
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:53,894
Don't any of you get the idea I can be had !

91
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,729
-The thought never entered our heads, sir.
-I'll bet!

92
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,981
-Go on, try it on, sir.
-Yeah, come on.

93
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,941
You'll look mighty sharp on that bridge,
Mr. Bledsoe!

94
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:02,903
Looks great!

95
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,072
See you a moment, Bledsoe?

96
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,281
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,325
We were just leaving, Captain.

98
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,911
I said we were leaving !

99
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,752
It's a sort of a gift, sir. The men, they. . .

100
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,712
It's all right. Never mind.

101
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,131
-Any milk left in the galley?
-Yes, sir.

102
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,258
It's powdered, sir.

103
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,593
That'll do.

104
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,221
She belongs to the chief of the boat.

105
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:30,472
Good luck token.

106
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:34,059
The men give her a pat
on their way to battle stations.

107
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,769
Interesting.

108
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:37,562
I'll get the milk, sir.

109
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:44,861
Submarines.

110
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,488
They ruined my liver!

111
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,324
Couldn't take one again.

112
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:52,244
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique!

113
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,621
You like subs?

114
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:55,956
I chose the service, sir.

115
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:57,457
Yes, of course.

116
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,132
-Good record.
-Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:08,093
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me.

118
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,554
I told you two years ago
you were pretty hot stuff,

119
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,972
that you'd have a sub one day.

120
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:14,141
-Remember?
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

121
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:16,810
Well, you're going to, Jim,

122
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:18,186
but not this time out.

123
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:22,023
The Nerka is being
assigned to Commander Richardson.

124
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,526
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

125
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,489
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7,

126
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,075
and Richardson's acquainted with the area.

127
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,371
7's a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year,

128
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,332
all of them sunk
by an Akikaze off the Bungo Straits.

129
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,795
His sub was the first. The Navy Board feels
he deserves another chance now.

130
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,672
That command was mine, sir.

131
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,507
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?
Is that it?

132
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,510
Of course not, Jim.
Your ability isn't being questioned here.

133
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,763
It's just that Richardson's suggestion. . .

134
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:56,183
-Richardson's suggestion?
-He presented a very strong case.

135
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,856
This whole thing is
suddenly very clear to me.

136
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,150
That all, sir?

137
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:06,526
That's all.

138
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,159
You won't mind
if I keep this out of mothballs, Captain.

139
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,911
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

140
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:20,373
Rich?

141
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,169
Rich? Hey, be careful !

142
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,378
What's the matter?

143
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:27,547
Thought you might like me
to fix some lemonade.

144
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,050
Sure, honey, you go ahead. I'll be down. . .

145
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,265
Better make enough for three.

146
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,558
Three?

147
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,268
We have company arriving.

148
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,854
I can't see anyone like this!

149
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:45,148
I don't think this is a social visit.

150
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:50,070
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

151
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,615
Looking for me?

152
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:00,914
Commander Richardson?

153
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:02,082
That's right.

154
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

155
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,085
Well, a pleasure!

156
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,712
Would you mind
throwing me up that insect spray, Jim?

157
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:09,923
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come here to spray insects.

158
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,509
Well, it's the leaves you spray.

159
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:13,927
But it doesn't matter.

160
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,557
-What's on your mind?
-A request, sir.

161
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,767
I'd like you to ask for another exec.

162
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,230
-Just like that, huh?
-My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

163
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,774
Well, I'd have to take it to the Board.

164
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:28,942
You went to them before.

165
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:32,320
That's just it. I got what I wanted then.
Why should I change it?

166
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,864
Maybe I can enlighten you.

167
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,324
There's a crew
that's already accepted me as its captain.

168
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,493
They have me decked out as the groom.

169
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,121
Now that you're taking my
place, I'd rather not go the wedding.

170
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:42,789
Are we discussing your pride,

171
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,666
or are you embarrassed to face them?

172
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,960
You'll be facing them yourself
in a couple of days.

173
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:50,046
The resentment's going
to be twice as great with me on board.

174
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,300
Mr. Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

175
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,094
I don't care about their resentment,
or yours.

176
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:58,430
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.

177
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,556
That's all there is.

178
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,266
The Board didn't give you a thing.

179
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:04,019
You went to them. The poor desk
commander with a tear in his eye.

180
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:06,438
You told them if you could have me,
a qualified commander,

181
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,440
for a backstop, you could do the job.

182
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,025
That was your selling point, wasn't it?

183
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,109
Mr. Bledsoe,

184
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,862
your request for release is denied.

185
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,539
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over,

186
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,082
so to get things straightened out.

187
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,792
We're going to get along just fine.

188
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,879
Don't worry, Jim,
I'll take good care of the bride.

189
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,547
Anyone for a slug of gin?

190
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:33,757
We're out of vermouth.

191
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,842
Lieutenant Bledsoe, Laura, my exec.

192
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,427
-Hello.
-Thanks, Mrs. Richardson.

193
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:39,512
-I'll take a rain check on the drink.
-You sure?

194
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:40,680
Some other time.

195
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:42,098
Lieutenant?

196
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,352
If there isn't another time, good luck.

197
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,355
Take good care of my husband.

198
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,858
I'll take care, ma'am.

199
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,112
Take over, Mr. Conwell.

200
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,279
Aye, aye, sir.

201
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,247
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

202
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,792
Captain's off the bridge.

203
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,919
Cap's off the bridge, Chief.
Orders coming up soon.

204
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,254
Okay.

205
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:55,547
Is he downstairs yet?

206
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:57,507
"Below," Jessie. The captain's below.

207
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:58,967
Hey, Chief, how much is in the pool?

208
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,927
Two hundred bucks.
Are all the areas covered?

209
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:02,804
I've got a five-spot on Area 22.

210
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,515
16 for me. I hear it's a pleasure cruise.

211
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,100
-I took 7.
-7?

212
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,727
-7?
-What?

213
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:09,811
I took 7.

214
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,021
That's a one-way ticket, idiot!

215
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,731
You trying to jinx us all?

216
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,274
What do you mean, "one way"?

217
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,901
No return, Jessie. No return !

218
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,070
But I was born on the seventh !

219
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,906
What with all that money in the pool. . .

220
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,075
Well, seven's lucky for me.

221
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,118
Ain't it?

222
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,831
Here you go.
The money's all locked up inside.

223
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:32,876
Bosun, tell the engine room we're
standing by, and relay to maneuvering.

224
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,295
-Right!
-Hey, Chief! Could I change areas?

225
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,796
Too late.

226
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,339
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

227
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,800
The next voice you hear

228
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:43,136
will be the dealer.

229
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,432
This is the captain.

230
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:51,853
I know all of you are vitally
interested in our area assignment.

231
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:54,773
Here is a brief rundown of the orders

232
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,942
under which we will operate
during this patrol.

233
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,028
Number one,

234
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,114
and I'm sure you've heard this many times,

235
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:04,699
sink enemy shipping.

236
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,701
Number two.

237
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,413
Proceed on a specified course to Area 7,

238
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,208
-and radio exact position
-I knew it! I just knew it!

239
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,918
-of all ships in the area.
-For Pete's sake, turn it off!

240
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:16,586
Number three.

241
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,174
Avoid the section in Area 7
known as the Bungo Straits.

242
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:26,763
Number four. Take coast intelligence
photos wherever possible.

243
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,307
A third of you are new men,

244
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,851
and I know there are bound
to be some questions.

245
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:34,646
Feel free to ask
your division officer anytime.

246
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:37,857
That's all. Thanks for your attention.

247
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:39,984
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits anyway?

248
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,778
-Why?
-He said we'll avoid it.

249
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:44,781
What's the difference?
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7!

250
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:47,408
Okay.
Give everyone back his money, Kohler.

251
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:49,994
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

252
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:51,579
Who?

253
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,373
He did.

254
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,003
Well, jeez, fellas, I didn't know!

255
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:03,049
Well, it's my birthday!
Seven's my birthday!

256
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,734
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

257
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:23,736
Range, 2,000.

258
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,321
All hands standing by for drill.

259
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,240
Very well.

260
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,075
Lookouts below!

261
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,420
Clear the bridge!

262
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,595
Dive! Dive!

263
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,144
What's the depth?

264
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,353
Thirty-eight feet, sir.

265
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,607
Ruby, where's the scope?

266
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,317
We're not at periscope depth yet, Captain.

267
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,527
Stand by to surface.

268
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,404
-Stand by to surface!
-Stand by to surface!

269
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,281
Now let's get this straight.

270
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,825
I want this scope up as we dive.

271
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,118
As we dive, sir?

272
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,329
I want to be ready to fire
as soon as we level off at 50 feet.

273
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,789
Now, I know this is all new to you,

274
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,291
but you'll just have to get used to it.

275
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,500
The whole purpose of this drill

276
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,878
is to dive and fire as soon as we level.

277
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,422
Let's try it again. Surface!

278
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,007
-Surface!
-Surface!

279
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:29,302
Blow main ballast. Hard rise on planes.

280
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:00,833
-Flow negative.
-Level off.

281
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,879
Eight-degree angle. Depth, 40 feet.

282
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:06,089
Steady on course, Captain.

283
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,674
Mark. Fifty, leveled off.

284
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:08,925
Fire one.

285
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,010
-Time?
-Forty-two seconds, sir.

286
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,471
That's not fast enough.
You have to get those vents open sooner.

287
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:15,765
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.

288
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,600
-Stand by to surface!
-Stand by to surface!

289
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:26,985
Dive! Dive!

290
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,903
Open the vents on the diving alarm.

291
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,280
Taking a chance, isn't it?

292
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:31,364
The Captain wants a faster dive.

293
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:33,700
You can always shut it
if you don't get a green board.

294
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:34,784
Aye, aye, sir.

295
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,043
Dive! Dive!

296
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,670
Open them up! Flood those tanks!

297
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,314
Dive! Dive!

298
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,915
-Mark 50. Leveled off.
-Fire one.

299
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,252
Thirty-seven seconds, sir.

300
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,087
Good. Very good.

301
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,965
By the time
we reach Area 7, I want it down to 33.

302
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,759
-Thirty-three, sir?
-Thirty-three is right.

303
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,553
Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations, sir?

304
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,637
Yes, Jim.

305
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,473
-Take the con, Mr. Cartwright.
-Aye, aye, sir.

306
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,682
Secure from battle stations.

307
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:40,933
Secure! Third Section, take watch !

308
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,061
-Secure! Third Section, take over watch !
-Up scope.

309
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:44,729
All ahead one-third.

310
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:46,105
All ahead one-third, sir.

311
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,315
Light the smoking lamp.

312
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:00,203
I said secure.
Your tails can't be dragging that much.

313
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,289
What's the matter?

314
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,375
No gripes? No groans?

315
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,294
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

316
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,922
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

317
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,174
Ruby, you worried about drills?

318
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,967
-No, sir.
-Poplin?

319
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,304
Now, look, I never keep
anything from a crew,

320
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,098
I don't expect them
to keep anything from me.

321
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,391
So come on, speak up.

322
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,311
Well, I. . .

323
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,356
I guess it's Area 7, Mr. Bledsoe.

324
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,066
Didn't you hear the captain
read the operation orders?

325
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,359
That's just it, sir.

326
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,486
He specifically mentioned
the Bungo Straits.

327
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,654
What difference does that make?

328
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,072
That's the section of Area 7

329
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,240
where all those subs were lost.

330
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:38,741
That's the graveyard.

331
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,494
And we've got orders to
avoid the Bungo Straits.

332
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,830
-For Pete's sake!
-Yeah, right.

333
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:47,041
-And all the time, we thought that Area 7. . .
-Don't think.

334
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,836
You better grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

335
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,171
-Drill ! Drill ! Drill !
-Thirty-three seconds. No boat in the fleet. . .

336
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,090
We could leave the hatch open.
The water might pour in,

337
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,508
the boat might go down faster.

338
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,678
How do we get back up?

339
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,221
There's no room to swim anyway.

340
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:02,849
I heard you, Lieutenant.

341
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:05,226
Now that you've explained the orders,

342
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:09,105
how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

343
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:27,123
Captain to the bridge.
Captain to the bridge.

344
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,466
Easy, fellas! Take it easy!

345
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:37,884
She's got to last the patrol !

346
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:39,010
One pat to a customer, now!

347
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,514
-All ahead standard on the board.
-Okay, I got it.

348
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:46,184
Radar contact dead astern, sir.

349
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,810
We think it's a Jap sub.

350
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,105
-Has he seen us?
-Hard to tell.

351
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,774
Shall we open the outer doors
on the stern tubes, sir?

352
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,234
No, just keep her on present course.

353
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:07,747
Conning tower, manned and ready.

354
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:14,504
Comm, forward torpedo room,
manned and ready.

355
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:17,215
How long should we hold this course, sir?

356
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,259
-What?
-Before we double back to get him.

357
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,596
We're not going to double back.

358
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:25,556
Sir?

359
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,266
He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

360
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:29,018
But we're faster, sir.
We could outmaneuver.

361
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:31,395
-Just hold her steady on present course.
-Aye, aye, sir.

362
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:33,314
-Keep a sharp lookout astern !
-Aye, aye, sir.

363
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,442
Lost radar contact at 6,500 yards, sir.

364
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,527
Very well.

365
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,278
Secure from battle stations.

366
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:40,947
Secure from battle stations.

367
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,282
Second Section, take the watch.

368
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,247
I'll take the con. Lay below.

369
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:51,290
Aye, aye, sir.

370
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,968
Well, you've had the boat
for a week now, Captain.

371
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,470
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

372
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,347
Always a little shudder, though,
when you push her too hard.

373
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:07,682
Best to ease her into it.

374
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:10,184
Thanks.

375
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:11,310
Anything else?

376
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:12,603
Just one thing, sir.

377
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:16,232
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

378
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,986
Permission to go below, sir?

379
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:21,445
Granted.

380
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,827
Now hear this. Now hear this.

381
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:29,996
Orders of the day. To your sacks, men.

382
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:32,999
You've got 25 seconds
to lay flat on your backs.

383
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,335
Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

384
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,587
He's a caution.

385
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,338
Isn't he a caution?

386
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:41,173
Give the skipper a couple, will you?

387
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,509
A Jap sub and all these drills,

388
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,886
Captain must be running scared.
Is that what it is?

389
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:48,806
It's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

390
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,392
Who said anything about a war patrol?

391
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:53,144
You're all confused, my friend.

392
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:55,187
We're on a drill patrol here.

393
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:58,357
The first time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

394
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:59,859
What's it all mean?

395
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,819
What's he got in mind?

396
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:03,195
Haven't you heard?

397
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,531
He's gonna challenge the Japs to a drill.

398
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,701
The winner's going to get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon trip

399
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:11,370
with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

400
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,414
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.

401
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:16,208
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

402
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,544
"Caution with safety,
and safety with caution."

403
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,922
No, let's do better than that.

404
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:25,676
Let's drink a toast
to our beloved captain, the drill master.

405
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:28,929
For it was he that knew our fleet
boat was faster than a Jap sub.

406
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:30,389
I think I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

407
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:32,808
Why? A cautious captain
with orders that say, "Avoid"?

408
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:36,228
Now, if we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Bungo Straits, we're in !

409
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,064
I'll bet he's thinking of a way right now. . .

410
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:40,024
Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

411
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,484
What about that, Mueller?

412
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:42,902
You're pretty chummy with the captain.

413
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,279
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Cartwright.

414
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,405
Do you, sir?

415
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,491
Come back here, Kraut!

416
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,535
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

417
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,334
You have any questions, Cartwright,
you come to me,

418
00:24:58,418 --> 00:25:00,336
not members of the crew. You understand?

419
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,421
And that goes for your opinions, too.

420
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:06,592
Maybe we better break this up.
It's getting late.

421
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:22,858
Shut up.

422
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:51,137
Battle stations manned, Captain.

423
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:52,596
Standing by for drill.

424
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:03,023
Lookouts below!

425
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,195
Clear the bridge!

426
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:15,953
Dive! Dive!

427
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,395
Surface! Surface!

428
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:49,487
Someone left topside, sir.

429
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,238
-All stop.
-All stop, sir.

430
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,406
Emergency surface!

431
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,062
Open up!

432
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,125
You all right?

433
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,877
I'm all right, sir. I'm okay.

434
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,213
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?

435
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,298
Mr. Cartwright, sir.

436
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:52,925
I thought he'd already asked the O. D. , sir.

437
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,635
I was on the bridge
with Mr. Beckman, and I didn't hear. . .

438
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,803
Get below.

439
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,096
Yes, sir.

440
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:01,559
The captain gives permission to dump
the trash, and only the captain.

441
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:04,395
Instead of losing time on this drill,
we almost lose a man !

442
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,065
Stand by to dive!

443
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,109
Check the watch, Mr. Kohler.

444
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:11,360
Aye, aye, sir.

445
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,363
Mr. Bledsoe.

446
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:17,950
Yes, sir?

447
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:19,952
Have you been with this boat long?

448
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:21,453
Over a year, sir.

449
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:25,791
And is this
the kind of cooperation you usually get?

450
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:30,004
No, sir.

451
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:33,007
A man could have been killed today.

452
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,967
The responsibility is yours, Mr. Bledsoe,

453
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:36,927
you're in charge of the drills.

454
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,178
I have no excuses, Captain.

455
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,973
But under the circumstances,
the crew did their best.

456
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:42,057
What circumstances?

457
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:43,142
Don't press it, sir.

458
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:44,768
I intend to. I want an answer.

459
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:47,146
It's one thing to drill a crew for fighting.

460
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,689
But when you duck a Jap sub,

461
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:50,566
they wonder why they should
break their backs on drills

462
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,443
when the captain
has no stomach for attacking.

463
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,195
"What does he want?
Obedience? Efficiency?"

464
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,656
Or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

465
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:03,913
Mr. Bledsoe, tell them
I am doubling the drills, starting tomorrow.

466
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:06,999
Yes, sir.

467
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:12,046
You might as well know, sir,
I don't believe it.

468
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,172
Believe what?

469
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:15,591
That you ran away from that sub
from cowardice.

470
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,399
Yeah, sure, I know what you mean,

471
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:34,944
but what's the cook supposed to do,
eat the garbage?

472
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,404
-We haven't had a minute to. . .
-Hey! Hey, Vince!

473
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:45,162
SJ contact! SJ contact!

474
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:48,499
Bearing 330, range, 15 miles.

475
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:50,918
Looks like a big one, huh?

476
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:52,169
It's not a fishing boat, friend.

477
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:57,883
Picking up two of them now, sir.

478
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,848
Range closing. The first check
puts enemy on southerly course.

479
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:06,100
Very well.

480
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:10,646
Right full rudder!
Come right to course 330!

481
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,399
Right full rudder, sir. Coming right to 330.

482
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:14,566
Very well.

483
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:15,985
Looks like he's going to go in.

484
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,611
Sightseeing, Pat.

485
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:18,696
Just sightseeing.

486
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:34,128
I can see them now.

487
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:38,424
Lead ship, possible Momo destroyer.

488
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,175
Trailing ship, a large tanker.

489
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:44,054
We'll wait until the destroyer passes clear,

490
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:45,139
then we'll take on the tanker.

491
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,434
Shifting to TBT. Bearing coming down.

492
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,365
Bearing 020.

493
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,410
Set, sir.

494
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:09,747
Right full rudder. Come right to course 030.

495
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,291
Open outer doors on tubes one and two.

496
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,876
Open outer doors on tubes one and two.

497
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,419
Open outer doors on tubes one and two!

498
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:29,224
Angle on the bow now, starboard 70.

499
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,185
Torpedo spread, one right, one left.

500
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:32,644
Solution checking.

501
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,272
Everything's set, sir.

502
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:37,357
Destroyer's well clear now, Captain.

503
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,942
Tanker range, 3,200.

504
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,652
-All ready to fire, sir.
-Very well.

505
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:42,488
Stand by, tube one.

506
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:44,865
-Stand by, tube one.
-Stand by, tube one!

507
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,001
What's the torpedo run?

508
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:57,336
2,500 yards, sir.

509
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:58,504
Commence firing.

510
00:31:58,546 --> 00:31:59,671
Fire one!

511
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,590
-Fire one!
-Fire one.

512
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:04,426
One fired, sir.

513
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:06,011
-Stand by, two.
-Stand by, two!

514
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,513
-Spread set.
-Fire two!

515
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,556
-Fire two!
-Fire two.

516
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:12,476
Two fired, sir.

517
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,187
Torpedo number one running hot,
straight and normal, sir.

518
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:58,230
Destroyer's angle on the bow now zero.

519
00:32:58,314 --> 00:32:59,314
Bearing?

520
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:06,196
Bearing 045.

521
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:07,990
He's heading right at us.

522
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:10,576
Keep the sound on him, Cullen.
We'll have orders to go deep in a second.

523
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:11,618
Aye, aye, sir.

524
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,914
If you had any questions about the drills,

525
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,291
I think you'll have them answered now.

526
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,043
We're taking on the Momo.

527
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:24,047
Right standard rudder.
Come right to course 045.

528
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,717
Right standard rudder, sir.
Coming right to 045.

529
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:28,093
Very well.

530
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,430
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

531
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,432
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

532
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:34,683
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

533
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,769
Range to destroyer, 2,000. Bearing steady.

534
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:39,646
Closing in fast, sir. Coming head on.

535
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:54,494
At range 1,500, we'll crash-dive.

536
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,038
At 50 feet, we'll give her two fish.

537
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,999
Down their throats? That's a bow shot.

538
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,501
Range, 1,800.

539
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:19,561
Lookouts below!

540
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:23,440
Stand by to dive.

541
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,484
-Stand by to dive!
-Stand by to dive.

542
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:26,818
Clear the bridge!

543
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,369
Dive! Dive!

544
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,097
Bearing,

545
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,348
-mark.
-044.

546
00:34:56,432 --> 00:34:58,350
-Set?
-Depth, 34 feet.

547
00:34:58,393 --> 00:34:59,643
Ten-degree angle.

548
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:00,769
Thirty-nine feet.

549
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,562
Level off.

550
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:04,147
Forty-four feet.

551
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:05,691
Steady on course, Captain.

552
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,234
Stand by on tube three.

553
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:09,486
Stand by, three.

554
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,740
Leveled off at 50, Captain !

555
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,617
-Fire three!
-Fire three!

556
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:18,370
Three fired, sir.

557
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:21,498
Fire four.

558
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,041
Fire four!

559
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:25,419
-Four fired, sir.
-Stand by to take her down fast.

560
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:29,172
-Stand by to take her down fast!
-Aye, aye, sir. Standing by.

561
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:48,233
Got 'em ! We got 'em !

562
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:50,986
Thirty-two seconds. Thirty-two seconds!

563
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:01,204
Left full rudder. All ahead one-third.

564
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:03,498
-Left full rudder, all ahead one-third, sir.
-Very well.

565
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,958
Now hear this. Captain speaking.

566
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,337
You've just given
a Jap tin can the deep-six with a bow shot

567
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,588
in 32 seconds.

568
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,631
Gentlemen,
I think this boat is ready for anything.

569
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,175
Let's keep it that way.

570
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:15,010
Drills, no more than usual tomorrow.

571
00:36:15,178 --> 00:36:16,178
-Bledsoe.
-Yes, sir.

572
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:17,763
Take the con.
Get us back on our base course.

573
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:19,097
Aye, aye, sir.

574
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,058
Boy, that skipper!

575
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:22,893
Let me tell you, he knows his stuff.

576
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,102
That was amazing !

577
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,240
Come here, you guys. Listen to this.

578
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:40,994
"Dear Commander,
Japanese Imperial Fleet.

579
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:45,248
"Be it hereby known that on July 31, 1943,

580
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:49,252
"the USS Nerka, under the
command of Captain P.J. Richardson,

581
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,129
"sunk a Japanese destroyer."

582
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:54,591
-Be quiet!
-"One down, 20 fish to go!"

583
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,426
Signed, Kraut Mueller.

584
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,636
How do you like that, Chief?

585
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,429
We've been drilling
for a bow shot all the time.

586
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:00,972
Hey, Ruby, you were up there, huh?

587
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,974
Right on the pickle, dear friend.

588
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,435
That tin can zigs right into us.

589
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:06,770
I tell you, I was shaking.

590
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:08,063
What about the old man? What did he do?

591
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,482
Calm, you know what I mean?
No excitement.

592
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,443
He just orders two fish
right down her throat.

593
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:15,112
Just like you'd order ham and eggs.

594
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:17,072
If we'd missed, though,
we wouldn't have lived long enough

595
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,240
to get into Area 7,

596
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:20,575
which I still think
we won't live long enough to get out of!

597
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,120
"If, if, if." Go back to Sears, Roebuck,
will you?

598
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:25,247
Forgive me if I interrupt the music.

599
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:28,750
You are listening once again
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose,

600
00:37:28,835 --> 00:37:32,212
speaking to you from the heart of
the mighty Japanese Empire,

601
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:36,133
telling you in your own
language of a war you cannot win.

602
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:38,760
It has been substantiated
that we have destroyed

603
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:40,846
16 enemy ships this month alone.

604
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,181
Come on, Rosie,
why don't you get up to date, huh?

605
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:45,058
You're missing one Jap tin can !

606
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:49,855
Jessie! Jessie, dear friend.

607
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:52,065
We've decided to be big about it.

608
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,527
We're not going to
hold you responsible for Area 7 any longer.

609
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:56,903
We'll take back the money.

610
00:37:57,155 --> 00:38:00,282
Gosh. Well, that's nice of you fellas,

611
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,869
but my conscience hurt me so much
I threw it overboard.

612
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,169
Not now, Kohler.

613
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:13,712
Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

614
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:18,300
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen them together.

615
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,094
But I never saw one run away
from a Jap sub before,

616
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:24,222
then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

617
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,141
There has to be a reason.

618
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,397
That bow shot didn't just happen.

619
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,773
The drills were planned for it.

620
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,900
The whole thing was. . .

621
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:39,362
I never heard of a bow shot being set up

622
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,156
where it wasn't used in desperation.

623
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:43,408
It's all like some experiment!

624
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:47,078
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

625
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,332
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a hell of a difference.

626
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,501
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

627
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:55,086
But that's impossible.
The orders say to avoid it.

628
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,924
I know.

629
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:10,268
Look, I know how you feel
about him taking the boat and all,

630
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,355
but don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

631
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,775
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

632
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:10,704
Four.

633
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,582
Five.

634
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:15,917
Six.

635
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,420
It's a convoy, all right, sir.

636
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:20,630
Bearing 320, relative.

637
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:28,805
Sounds like a whole lot of them, sir.

638
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:31,850
Cullen.

639
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,059
Right, sir.

640
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,395
I have the dive, Captain. Depth, 60 feet.

641
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,105
Forward torpedo room
manned and ready, sir.

642
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:38,732
We're undetected, sir.

643
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,859
After torpedo room manned and ready, sir.

644
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:42,569
We're dead ahead of the convoy, Captain.

645
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:44,738
What firing position shall we take?

646
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:49,451
Captain?

647
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,121
Take her down, sir?

648
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,626
Take her down to 100 feet.

649
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,419
A hundred feet. Aye, aye, sir.

650
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:02,881
Five-degree down bubble!
Take her to 100 feet.

651
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,216
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

652
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,343
Aye, sir.

653
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:08,470
Come right to course 280.

654
00:41:08,554 --> 00:41:10,722
-Coming right to course 280, sir.
-Very well.

655
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:12,515
Mr. Cartwright, take over the con.

656
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:13,558
Yes, sir.

657
00:41:14,977 --> 00:41:16,603
What's he doing? What's going on?

658
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,234
Give me a line on course 280.

659
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,945
-Sir?
-A line on course 280. Now!

660
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:27,072
Aye, sir.

661
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:29,240
-What's the skipper up to?
-Later, Beckman.

662
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,411
-Start leveling off.
-Aye, sir.

663
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:52,931
There it is. You might as well post it.

664
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:55,100
A whole area to patrol,
and you pick the graveyard !

665
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:57,018
The Bungo Straits!

666
00:41:59,146 --> 00:42:01,439
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

667
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:03,483
The one spot
the orders direct you to avoid !

668
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,735
You make it sound like a snap decision.

669
00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:06,945
It wasn't, Jim.

670
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,321
That's quite obvious now, sir.

671
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,740
Passing a Jap submarine
to save your torpedoes,

672
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:12,450
jeopardizing the whole boat
with a bow shot,

673
00:42:12,493 --> 00:42:15,036
ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

674
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:16,621
You planned it, all right.

675
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,289
And you knew it the day
I came to your house.

676
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:19,958
I knew it before that, Jim.

677
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,252
I knew it a year ago,
when my boat went down.

678
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,838
We have operational orders.
They're explicit.

679
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:27,382
We have a crew that expects
the captain to follow those orders.

680
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,343
You know as well as I do
that a captain can redefine orders

681
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:31,678
if he feels he has an advantage.

682
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:32,804
What advantage?

683
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,431
You just named it! A bow shot!

684
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:37,016
We proved we could do it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

685
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:39,811
You call that an advantage when there are
four subs out there before us

686
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,438
that never even had a chance to shoot?

687
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,772
They were detected.

688
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,315
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

689
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:45,942
And what about the Japanese Navy?

690
00:42:45,985 --> 00:42:48,486
No, sir.
That's no advantage, not in my book.

691
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:51,156
But you're not the captain.

692
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:55,243
If you should fail
and somehow come out of this alive,

693
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:57,954
there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time.

694
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,623
That's strange, Jim.

695
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,500
I never even thought of failing.

696
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,254
You've got a lot of guts, sir,

697
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,214
with other people's lives.

698
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,341
That's my decision and my responsibility.

699
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:12,510
To whom, sir?
To a crew that died a year ago?

700
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:14,929
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

701
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,603
Now, believe what you want.

702
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:29,652
Well, this crew's still alive. They at least
have a right to know where they're going.

703
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:30,945
Do I have to tell them?

704
00:43:32,364 --> 00:43:33,990
What's the matter, Captain?

705
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:35,784
Surely you've got guts enough for this, too.

706
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:41,289
This is the Captain.

707
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:43,374
Due to conditions of special advantage,

708
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:46,377
I have decided
to take this boat to the Bungo Straits.

709
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:21,246
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

710
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,967
We're there.

711
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:38,346
Bungo Straits.

712
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:41,558
We're at the Straits.

713
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:44,769
Bungo Straits.

714
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:48,565
Bungo Straits.

715
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:51,025
Bungo Straits.

716
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:58,616
We're there. We're in the Straits.

717
00:45:03,372 --> 00:45:05,456
If I'd only been born on the eighth.

718
00:45:07,376 --> 00:45:09,210
See you a moment, sir?

719
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,470
-What is this?
-Well, we. . .

720
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,431
We want to talk to you, Jim.

721
00:45:21,473 --> 00:45:23,224
I've been looking
through the Navy rules and regulations.

722
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:24,601
We want you to take over.

723
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:30,148
Well, that's very flattering, gentlemen.

724
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:32,483
Let's go. Everyone outside.

725
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:33,818
We're talking about Navy orders!

726
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:35,320
-What right does he got to. . .
-A captain's right.

727
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:36,988
That's all he needs.

728
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:39,198
We might as well
make up our minds right now.

729
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:40,909
We're going to follow his orders.

730
00:45:40,993 --> 00:45:42,327
Where? To the bottom?

731
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,495
If that's what he's got in
mind, that's where we'll go.

732
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:46,831
This boat, any boat, has one captain.

733
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:51,294
Is that right, Kohler?

734
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:53,463
Yes, sir.

735
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:56,382
Is that right, Mr. Cartwright?

736
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,217
Yes, sir.

737
00:45:58,302 --> 00:45:59,552
Let's break this up.

738
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,231
Mr. Cartwright?

739
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:14,651
With all due respect to your rank,

740
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,611
may I say that I think you're an ass?

741
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:22,075
I see by this report
that you called Mr. Cartwright an ass.

742
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:24,202
-Yes, sir.
-An officer?

743
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:26,371
That's right, sir.

744
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,498
Mueller, you're a damn fool.

745
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,708
Yes, sir. I know it.

746
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:34,212
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too, Captain.

747
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:36,047
They wanted Mr. Bledsoe to take over.

748
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:38,174
Well, he put an end to that fast.

749
00:46:38,217 --> 00:46:39,217
He would.

750
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,053
Would you tell me something, Mueller?

751
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:43,596
If I can, sir.

752
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:44,973
Am I a damn fool, too?

753
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:46,933
Sir?

754
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:48,810
Well, Mr. Bledsoe seems to think I am,

755
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:50,937
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

756
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:54,357
Well, maybe you have to be,
Captain, to do something like this.

757
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:57,276
Look, sir,
you nailed that Momo with a bow shot.

758
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,153
Why not the Akikaze?

759
00:46:59,238 --> 00:47:01,781
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

760
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,242
Well, he will this time, sir.

761
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:09,080
Is that a classified opinion,
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

762
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:10,206
It's a fact, sir.

763
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,376
A fact they'll all realize
at Bungo Pete's funeral.

764
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,558
Convoy now bearing 31 3.
Range, 7,000 yards.

765
00:48:12,144 --> 00:48:14,562
Are we going to set up
on the leading ship, sir?

766
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:17,065
No, that's a decoy. Shallow draft.

767
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:19,192
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

768
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:22,779
You could shoot 10 fish.
They'd only run under.

769
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:35,541
There!
There she is, pulling up with the convoy.

770
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,251
-The Akikaze?
-Yes.

771
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:40,254
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

772
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:42,924
Look at her cut through there.
Must be making 30 knots.

773
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:46,427
Doesn't stay in one position long enough
to give you a target.

774
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:48,012
Not unless she's coming toward you.

775
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:50,473
Take over in the conning tower.

776
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:52,934
Start tracking
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

777
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,477
-We'll give you a bearing on her.
-Aye, aye, sir.

778
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,270
-Right standard rudder!
-Right standard rudder, sir!

779
00:48:56,355 --> 00:48:57,355
Very well.

780
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:05,154
This is the Captain.

781
00:49:05,197 --> 00:49:07,990
The convoy we've been waiting
for is on our starboard bow.

782
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:10,868
The plan of attack is as follows. First,

783
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,412
we'll strike a freighter going in.

784
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:15,623
If that doesn't bring the Akikaze toward us,

785
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,209
we'll attack the freighter nearest him.

786
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,837
When the Akikaze does head toward us,
bow on,

787
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,881
we'll dive and
give him two fish at 1,500 yards,

788
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:25,383
just like the Momo.

789
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,760
Let's go. All ahead standard.

790
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,554
-All ahead standard, sir.
-Very well.

791
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:31,222
All ahead standard on board.

792
00:49:38,564 --> 00:49:41,482
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

793
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,901
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

794
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,324
Plane contact, sir.

795
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,122
Captain, radar's picked up an enemy plane.

796
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:00,168
Lookouts, planes coming in.
Watch for them.

797
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:02,253
Aye, aye, sir.

798
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:04,338
15 miles. Range closing.

799
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:06,215
Plane's 15 miles. Range closing.

800
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:17,852
They're closing fast, sir.

801
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:21,397
Plane's closing fast, sir!

802
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
They must've known.

803
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:24,233
The Japs must've known we were here.

804
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:26,777
We're going in according to plan.

805
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,113
Give me the setup.

806
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:31,657
-Stay right on that freighter, Beckman.
-Aye, aye, sir.

807
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,743
Range on freighter, 2,000, sir.

808
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:35,912
Track 70, gyro 20 right.

809
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:38,247
Recommend firing course 297.

810
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:40,249
Come right to 297.

811
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:43,085
-Coming right to course 297, sir!
-Very well.

812
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:44,545
Plane, six miles.

813
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:46,923
They'll be on us in a minute, Captain.

814
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
Stand by.

815
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:51,219
Ready on tubes one and two.

816
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:52,887
Outer doors open. Standing by.

817
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,431
Range, 1,800 yards.

818
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,850
Commence firing.

819
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,310
Fire one!

820
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,020
-Fire one!
-Fire one!

821
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:05,274
-One has been fired.
-One fired, sir.

822
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:07,068
One's away. Fire two.

823
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,487
-Fire two!
-Fire two.

824
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:12,073
Two has been fired.

825
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,616
-Two fired, sir.
-Two's away!

826
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:15,660
Make ready stern tubes.

827
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:17,245
Make ready stern tubes!

828
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:18,663
Make ready stern tubes!

829
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:19,914
Aircraft now one mile.

830
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:22,708
Come to course 089.

831
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:24,794
Coming to course 089, sir.

832
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,337
Very well.

833
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:27,713
Time check on first torpedo.

834
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:30,216
Five seconds. Four. . .

835
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:41,519
Both fish hit. She's headed down.

836
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,688
-Stern tubes ready, sir.
-Very well.

837
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:46,524
Aircraft range steady.
Appear to be circling overhead.

838
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:54,198
Right full rudder. All ahead flank.

839
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:55,866
Right full rudder, all ahead flank, sir!

840
00:51:57,869 --> 00:51:59,954
Shift target to Akikaze. He's coming on.

841
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:01,872
Bearing, coming down.

842
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:08,963
-Bearing 250!
-250, sir.

843
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,695
Radar to bridge. Aircraft returning !

844
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:40,870
Range, 4,000.

845
00:52:40,954 --> 00:52:42,913
Tubes three and four ready.
Outer doors open.

846
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:01,807
Shall we take her down, sir?

847
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,809
Not yet, not yet. Lookouts below!

848
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:05,686
Stand by.

849
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:07,438
Range, 3,000.

850
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:09,607
We'll have to fire from surface. Stand by.

851
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:18,574
Commence firing !

852
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:21,035
-Fire three.
-Fire three!

853
00:53:23,622 --> 00:53:25,122
-Three fired, sir.
-Three's away, sir.

854
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:36,133
Clear the bridge!

855
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:41,639
Dive! Dive!

856
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:55,319
-Take her down to 300, fast!
-Aye, aye, sir!

857
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:56,737
Give me a time check on that fish.

858
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:58,989
Twenty-four, twenty-three. . .

859
00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:01,492
Torpedo screws, sir.
Heading in toward our port side.

860
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:10,793
Must be that last torpedo, sir.

861
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:11,836
It's a runaway!

862
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,003
It's coming back at us.

863
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,506
Crash dive! Sound collision alarm.

864
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:44,952
Passing 75 feet, sir.

865
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:49,248
Passing 90 feet, sir.

866
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,209
Destroyer coming in, sir.

867
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:40,299
He's shifting to attack frequency, sir.

868
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,064
Picking up splashes, sir.

869
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:57,066
Depth charges on their way down.

870
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:00,694
Passing 150 feet.

871
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,082
Ignited torpedo!

872
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,168
-Pass along that T wrench !
-It's all right, leave it.

873
00:56:58,253 --> 00:57:00,379
The governor'll stop her at 2,100 rpm.

874
00:57:10,348 --> 00:57:11,765
Forward torpedo room reporting.

875
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,225
Hatch was blown on the main...

876
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:16,395
We cannot make...

877
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:18,564
Forward torpedo room.

878
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,525
Forward torpedo room !

879
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,280
Forward torpedo room !

880
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:28,991
Forward torpedo room !

881
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:31,452
Phone circuit's out, sir.

882
00:57:31,536 --> 00:57:33,245
-Check on the damage.
-Yes, sir.

883
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:06,612
Coming through. Watch it.

884
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:09,490
Captain wants a report on the damage.

885
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:11,325
Couple of dogs sheared off the hatch.

886
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:12,409
Can you fix it?

887
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:13,535
We'll know in a minute.

888
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,458
Turn on emergency lights.

889
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,587
Torpedo room.
Forward torpedo room, report.

890
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:27,257
Forward torpedo room !

891
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,760
Take the con. I'm going to check.

892
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:31,929
Leveling off!

893
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:34,390
-All ahead one-third !
-All ahead one-third, sir.

894
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:46,652
The hatch sprung?

895
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,237
Couple of dogs sheared off, Captain !

896
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:18,058
Close the hatch !

897
00:59:23,106 --> 00:59:25,023
Come on, close the hatch !

898
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:46,253
Go!

899
00:59:51,176 --> 00:59:52,801
Losing depth control. Heavy forward.

900
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:54,428
Request more speed, sir.

901
00:59:54,512 --> 00:59:55,721
Forward room must be flooding.

902
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:58,182
-All ahead standard !
-All ahead standard, sir!

903
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,026
You okay, sir?

904
01:00:09,068 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah.

905
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:12,529
Compartment flooded?

906
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:14,156
Partially.

907
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:16,033
Three dead.

908
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,251
They're coming in for the kill, sir.

909
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:32,090
Only way to get out of this alive

910
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:33,592
is to make them think we're all dead.

911
01:00:33,676 --> 01:00:35,052
Send up an oil slick?

912
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:37,346
We'll send up everything.
Blankets, gear, everything.

913
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,223
Jim.

914
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:42,768
The men that were killed.

915
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:45,229
Send them up through the tubes.

916
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:48,774
Yes, sir.

917
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:01,198
Screws diminishing, sir.

918
01:03:19,384 --> 01:03:20,509
Captain?

919
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,970
Captain, there's something else here.
Listen.

920
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,976
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

921
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,177
What's the situation on the hatch?

922
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:05,303
It's okay, Captain.

923
01:04:05,388 --> 01:04:08,557
The engineer should have the new parts
ready in a couple of hours.

924
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:12,769
It's well secured with block and tackle, sir.

925
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:16,732
Clear the compartment.

926
01:04:17,275 --> 01:04:19,109
Okay, everybody out. Come on.

927
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,278
On the double. Let's go, fellas.

928
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,754
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

929
01:04:38,796 --> 01:04:40,881
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

930
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:44,134
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

931
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:51,933
Here. Better take a swallow, sir.

932
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:54,895
What is it?

933
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:56,813
A stimulant, Captain,
from the medical safe.

934
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:59,399
It's 100 proof, sir.

935
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:02,944
How long have I been out?

936
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,363
-Just a few minutes, Captain.
-Here you go.

937
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:08,408
No.

938
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:11,995
You'd better worry about yourself, sir.

939
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,914
You're gonna be in for a pretty rough time.

940
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:16,500
Please, Captain.
Hendrix knows what he's talking about.

941
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:18,126
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

942
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:19,628
It's worse than that.

943
01:05:19,754 --> 01:05:21,254
There's a long medical term for it,

944
01:05:21,339 --> 01:05:22,923
but it all adds up
to blacking out every now and then

945
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:24,299
for quite a while.

946
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:27,094
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,

947
01:05:27,178 --> 01:05:29,429
you're gonna be blacking out permanently.

948
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,685
You'll keep this to yourselves.

949
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,855
-But, sir, in my report. . .
-That's an order, Hendrix.

950
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:44,945
Send for Mr. Bledsoe.

951
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,031
Well? Go on !

952
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:49,866
Yes, sir.

953
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:21,231
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

954
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:24,651
We'll have to set up a jury-rig for the radio,

955
01:06:25,403 --> 01:06:26,778
and the radar needs some work, too.

956
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:28,613
That's another 24 hours.

957
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,116
That's not bad, considering.

958
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:33,910
We'll lay over for two days

959
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:35,078
and then we can get moving, huh?

960
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:36,663
Yeah. The timing's perfect.

961
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:39,374
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

962
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:43,545
You really got shook up, didn't you?

963
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:44,629
No.

964
01:06:44,714 --> 01:06:46,840
No, I couldn't feel better.

965
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:48,675
Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

966
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:50,886
You heard me right.

967
01:06:50,928 --> 01:06:52,596
I'm talking about the Straits,

968
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:54,514
going back to the Bungo Straits.

969
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:01,938
We're through playing with lives, Captain.

970
01:07:02,023 --> 01:07:03,523
This boat's had it. It's the end of the line.

971
01:07:03,608 --> 01:07:06,109
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

972
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:09,196
You know yourself that's 100-to-1.
An accident!

973
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,947
The whole Japanese Air Force,

974
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:12,616
dropping everything it's got.

975
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,118
That's an accident, too?

976
01:07:15,286 --> 01:07:17,746
The next time around, we'll make it.

977
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:20,957
What are you gonna do?

978
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,751
Swim back to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

979
01:07:23,294 --> 01:07:25,212
Because that's
all the help you're gonna get.

980
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,465
Those are tall words.

981
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,009
You better stop and think a minute.

982
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:32,886
I have thought about it, Captain.

983
01:07:33,137 --> 01:07:35,931
That wasn't
exactly a tea party the crew held before.

984
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:37,265
They wanted me to take over then,

985
01:07:37,308 --> 01:07:39,226
and I can assure you
they'll feel the same way now.

986
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,561
You make one move to take over this boat,

987
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:43,813
and I swear, I'll see that you're hung.

988
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,190
Then we'll hang together.

989
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,526
The orders were disobeyed.
It's a proven fact. No more technicalities.

990
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,237
A fleet boat of the Navy,

991
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:52,697
a submarine
with her fighting power still intact,

992
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:54,908
and you'd take her back to Pearl?

993
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,159
I don't believe it!

994
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,792
Mr. Cartwright!

995
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,841
Yes, sir?

996
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:17,138
Mr. Cartwright, we'll lay over two days
for repairs before returning to Pearl.

997
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:18,765
I'll be in command.

998
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,850
Get a detail started right away.

999
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:22,269
Yes, sir.

1000
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:24,396
That's all, Cartwright.

1001
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,023
Yes, sir.

1002
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:35,073
The best exec
I could possibly get in the whole Navy,

1003
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:36,700
"the backstop," I think you said,

1004
01:08:37,285 --> 01:08:41,037
and the first command
you give as a captain is to order a retreat.

1005
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:06,771
Goodbye, Bungo

1006
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:08,523
Hello, Pearl

1007
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,484
Funny, funny, funny!

1008
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:12,736
What's with you?

1009
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,738
I'm trying to eat. Knock it off. That's all.

1010
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,448
What is this, a private dining room?

1011
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,199
You wanna sing? Go to the head !

1012
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,243
It'll take a little more than you
to put me there!

1013
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:22,412
Break it up! Break it up!

1014
01:09:22,455 --> 01:09:24,039
What's the matter with you guys?

1015
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:26,249
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

1016
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:31,338
How many patrols have you had,
Mr. Sears, Roebuck?

1017
01:09:32,715 --> 01:09:34,174
This is my second.

1018
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:36,217
I've had five since '42.

1019
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,262
I've taken depth charges, shells, strafings,

1020
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:42,098
even a bombing run off the Solomons.

1021
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:43,975
But it's the first time
I've ever gone back to Pearl

1022
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,935
with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

1023
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:49,606
-Kohler?
-Yes, sir?

1024
01:09:49,732 --> 01:09:51,858
-Better get the torpedo check started.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1025
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:54,569
Mr. Cartwright, do you think
we could've had him, sir?

1026
01:09:54,612 --> 01:09:56,905
-What?
-Well, suppose. . .

1027
01:09:57,114 --> 01:09:58,948
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

1028
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:01,159
You think that aircraft
was just playing games up there?

1029
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:03,119
The Japs had us detected
before we moved in.

1030
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:04,662
But the Captain said when we moved out. . .

1031
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:06,414
The Captain's flat on his back.

1032
01:10:06,457 --> 01:10:08,625
We'd be better off
if somebody put him there sooner.

1033
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,210
Kohler,
get started on that before the watch.

1034
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:11,961
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Mr. Cartwright?

1035
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:14,005
This time words just fail me.

1036
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,764
-It's this way, sir. I. . .
-Why didn't you stop him?

1037
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,808
-I didn't know it was gonna happen.
-You were here, weren't you?

1038
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:25,975
-Yes, sir, but. . .
-But you let it go on.

1039
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,310
-Well, no, sir, I. . .
-Then it didn't happen?

1040
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:28,478
Well, yes, sir, it happened, but. . .

1041
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:31,481
If I have to put
every member of this crew on report, I will !

1042
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:33,191
It was my fault, sir.

1043
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:37,987
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the O. D. you're on report.

1044
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,824
-Sir?
-What'd you say?

1045
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,617
-I only said. . .
-I told you once, Mr. Cartwright,

1046
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,411
to keep your opinions to yourself!

1047
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,204
Now get out of here.

1048
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:48,164
Yes, sir.

1049
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:56,339
I'm not gonna stand
for any fighting or insubordination.

1050
01:10:56,424 --> 01:11:00,009
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken ! You hear?

1051
01:11:05,724 --> 01:11:08,184
How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us.

1052
01:11:08,269 --> 01:11:09,686
He was chewing us all out.

1053
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,396
What's he so sore at us for?

1054
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:18,528
Turn it up a bit, huh?

1055
01:11:18,696 --> 01:11:20,071
It's okay. Let's leave it.

1056
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:27,162
What are you trying to do, break the plate?

1057
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,499
You are listening once again

1058
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:33,418
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.

1059
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:34,919
-Ed, turn it off.
-Did you like the music?

1060
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:36,045
Yes, sir.

1061
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,214
I play it tonight
for the wives and sweethearts

1062
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:39,966
of the submarine Nerka.

1063
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,135
You'll never see these men again.

1064
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,928
The Nerka has been sunk.

1065
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:46,431
It lies at the bottom of the Bungo Straits.

1066
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,224
They bought it! They chalked us up!

1067
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,226
We send you our regrets.

1068
01:11:50,311 --> 01:11:53,229
To the relatives of Captain P.J. Richardson,

1069
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:58,193
of Officers James Bledsoe,
Gerald Cartwright, Carl Beckman,

1070
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:01,529
of seamen Jessie Warner,
Kraut Mueller, Robert Hendrix.

1071
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,531
-"Kraut" Mueller? How could they. . .
-Listen.

1072
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:05,783
You'll never see them again.

1073
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,410
Think about it.

1074
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:10,121
Think what your country
has done to these men

1075
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:11,581
as you listen to the music.

1076
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:14,250
Why, they even named us!
The officers, the crew. . .

1077
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,252
How could they possibly know?

1078
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:25,762
-Welsh.
-Yes, sir?

1079
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:28,765
Were any dispatches, any messages
sent after we entered Area 7?

1080
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,725
No, sir. We cut off all radio transmission.

1081
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:31,809
Captain's orders.

1082
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:35,271
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat in 7?

1083
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:36,481
That's right, sir.

1084
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,281
Mueller!

1085
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,243
Yes, sir.

1086
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:51,120
Did you ever
sign your name "Kraut" Mueller?

1087
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:53,957
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

1088
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:58,586
Russo!

1089
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:00,588
Where's Russo?

1090
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:02,298
Yes, sir?

1091
01:13:02,383 --> 01:13:04,676
The trash you put in the garbage sacks.
How do you weight it?

1092
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,469
How do you weight it? Answer me!

1093
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,680
Well, some tin cans, broken tools,

1094
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:10,890
anything I can find
that'll help weight the sacks down, sir.

1095
01:13:10,975 --> 01:13:12,016
Does it sink?

1096
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:13,434
I think so, sir.

1097
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:14,519
You think so?

1098
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:17,272
Well, I can't say for certain, Mr. Bledsoe.

1099
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:19,399
Did you dump any sacks
off the Bungo Straits?

1100
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:20,692
Yes, sir.

1101
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,073
What have I done now?

1102
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,746
How do you feel?

1103
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,665
I'm all right.

1104
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:38,876
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

1105
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,588
The crew must be very happy.

1106
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,175
Aren't you?

1107
01:13:46,302 --> 01:13:48,636
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

1108
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,557
It's what I wanted.

1109
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,101
I see.

1110
01:13:57,938 --> 01:13:59,939
You're going back to the Straits.

1111
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:01,524
That's right.

1112
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,443
What changed your mind?

1113
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,236
I found out how they detected us.

1114
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:06,863
Those fishing barges along the coast

1115
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:08,698
have been picking up our garbage sacks.

1116
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:11,159
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

1117
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:13,911
Sure, Jim.

1118
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,414
I made the same speech.

1119
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,585
But you and I both know
that the odds are still against us.

1120
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:24,922
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

1121
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:28,801
Let's not kid ourselves.

1122
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:32,764
You're going back because
you've been through it.

1123
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,849
Because you have to go back.

1124
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:37,268
You knew all along I would.

1125
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:42,065
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

1126
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,737
Okay, Rich.

1127
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:52,742
I guess the real reason
I came in here was to tell you that I. . .

1128
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:54,160
Good luck, Jim.

1129
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:36,994
Now, we all know they think we're sunk.

1130
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:39,580
There's no
possible way for them to know we're here.

1131
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:42,709
Every angle has been covered,
except the risk of battle.

1132
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:44,585
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

1133
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,965
Any more questions?

1134
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:52,552
There must be something you want to ask.

1135
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,638
Well, sir, we all thought. . .

1136
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:59,892
Would you mind
stepping over here a moment, sir?

1137
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,899
Be my guest, Mr. Bledsoe.

1138
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,703
Thanks, Kohler. A privilege.

1139
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,095
Decoy leading as before.

1140
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:44,520
There she is, the Akikaze.

1141
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:46,564
Traveling about 30 knots and coming up.

1142
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:51,319
Stand by to surface.

1143
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:52,987
-Stand by to surface!
-Stand by to surface!

1144
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:56,783
-Surface!
-Surface!

1145
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,993
Blow main ballast, hard rise on planes!

1146
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:06,250
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1147
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,252
What is it, sir?

1148
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,713
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1149
01:17:10,798 --> 01:17:12,089
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1150
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:41,410
Port side clear, sir!

1151
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,122
Steady on course 050!

1152
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,708
-New course 050, sir!
-Very well.

1153
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:52,213
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1154
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:54,298
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1155
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,427
...main engines! All ahead one-third, sir!

1156
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,347
Very well. Lookouts to the bridge!

1157
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:04,267
-Mr. Cartwright.
-Yes, sir.

1158
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:05,560
Same plan of action.

1159
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:07,061
We'll draw the Akikaze to us

1160
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:09,021
by attacking
the last freighter in the starboard column.

1161
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:13,442
When the Akikaze comes in,
we'll give her a bow shot, as before.

1162
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,570
-All tubes ready for firing, sir.
-Very well.

1163
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:24,829
In firing position, Captain.

1164
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,163
Good setup on freighter.

1165
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:28,082
Outer doors open on tubes one and two.

1166
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,418
-Fire one!
-Fire one!

1167
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:31,502
Fire one!

1168
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,171
One fired, sir.

1169
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,339
One's away, sir.

1170
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:37,717
Fire two!

1171
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,302
-Fire two!
-Fire two!

1172
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:42,221
-Two fired, sir.
-Two's away, sir.

1173
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:45,892
Left 10-degree rudder. Come to course 041.

1174
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:30,144
Akikaze moving up starboard
side of burning freighter.

1175
01:19:33,273 --> 01:19:35,024
Bearing on Akikaze.

1176
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:38,903
089, sir.

1177
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:40,988
Come right to course 089!

1178
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,865
Coming right to course 089, sir!

1179
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:44,283
Very well.

1180
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:45,368
At what range will we fire, sir?

1181
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:46,953
1,500 yards.

1182
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:48,204
We'll take her with decks awash.

1183
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:50,873
Shift to battery. All ahead one-third.

1184
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,708
Shifting to battery. All ahead one-third, sir.

1185
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:53,834
Very well.

1186
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:56,420
-Control room.
-Control room, aye, aye.

1187
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:57,880
Flood down to 26 feet.

1188
01:19:58,215 --> 01:19:59,256
Aye, aye, sir.

1189
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:01,926
Open main ballast tank vents,
flood down to 26 feet.

1190
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,096
Range to Akikaze?

1191
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:07,431
Range, 2,400 yards.

1192
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,642
Use tubes three and four on this run.

1193
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,310
Tubes three and four. Aye, aye, sir.

1194
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:22,488
Rig out bow planes.

1195
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:35,710
Range, 2,100 yards.

1196
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,130
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

1197
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:42,925
Stand by to fire tubes three and four.

1198
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:45,011
Ready on tubes three and four.

1199
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:46,095
Outer doors open.

1200
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:50,850
Range, 1,800.

1201
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,810
Lookouts below!

1202
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,789
Range, 1,600.

1203
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,126
Commence firing at 1,500.

1204
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,961
-Stand by to fire!
-Stand by to fire!

1205
01:21:30,348 --> 01:21:32,058
-Fire three!
-Fire three!

1206
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,560
Three fired, sir.

1207
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:35,644
Three's away, sir.

1208
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:38,230
-Fire four!
-Fire four!

1209
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:40,566
-Four fired, sir.
-Four's away, sir.

1210
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,276
Clear the bridge!

1211
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,905
Dive! Dive!

1212
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,245
15-degree angle! Take her deep.

1213
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:09,970
That's it! We got her!

1214
01:22:11,223 --> 01:22:13,015
-All ahead one-third!
-All ahead one-third!

1215
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:15,017
Level off and bring her up
to periscope depth.

1216
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,186
Aye, aye, sir. Flow negative. Level off.

1217
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,188
Bring her up to periscope depth.

1218
01:22:19,272 --> 01:22:22,233
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1219
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:25,486
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1220
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,697
Take a look.

1221
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:30,783
Sir!

1222
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,201
Listen.

1223
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:36,372
That transmission again.
I can't make that out.

1224
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:23,586
Bledsoe! Take her down !

1225
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:25,671
Sound collision ! Take her down fast!

1226
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:27,214
Sound collision ! All ahead full !

1227
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:29,216
Flood negative! Take her down !

1228
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:31,719
Flood negative! Hard dive on planes!

1229
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,331
Torpedo coming down !
It's another runaway!

1230
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:01,999
It can't be! Both of them were hits!

1231
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:06,253
It's not ours, it's theirs.
It's from another sub.

1232
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,339
That's what sunk all our boats.

1233
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:10,257
A Japanese submarine.

1234
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:27,983
She missed us.

1235
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:31,820
Captain, hadn't you better go below?

1236
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:34,323
Passing 90 feet, sir.

1237
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,701
-All ahead one-third !
-All ahead one-third, sir.

1238
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:40,788
-Level off at 120!
-Level off at 120, sir!

1239
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:42,873
Rig ship for silent running !

1240
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,333
Rig ship for silent running.

1241
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:45,793
Shift to manual control.

1242
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:46,961
Shut down ventilation.

1243
01:24:47,003 --> 01:24:48,837
Secure all of the machinery.

1244
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:50,839
No unnecessary movement or talking.

1245
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,184
Here he is, sir.

1246
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,445
I've lost him.

1247
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,740
They've stopped their motors.

1248
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:00,993
Then let's make it a standoff.

1249
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:03,829
All stop.

1250
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:06,749
All stop, sir.

1251
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:47,206
We can't hold her down too long
without some speed.

1252
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:49,500
We'll have to start the motors soon.

1253
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:51,210
Let's hope they start theirs first.

1254
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:35,838
What was his last true bearing?

1255
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:37,506
1 35.

1256
01:27:38,591 --> 01:27:40,926
The bearing's no good
without knowing his depth.

1257
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,678
And we can't get that.

1258
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:44,555
We gotta get him to surface.

1259
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,225
There's a convoy still up there.

1260
01:27:48,309 --> 01:27:51,603
With the Akikaze gone, he's gonna have to
come up to protect those ships.

1261
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:54,022
Well, suppose we sink a couple?

1262
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,818
I have your permission, sir?

1263
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,194
You're the captain.

1264
01:28:00,321 --> 01:28:02,531
-Stand by to surface!
-Standing by to surface, sir!

1265
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:04,158
Secure from silent running and collision !

1266
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,409
Secure from silent running
and collision, sir!

1267
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:06,702
-All ahead full !
-All ahead full, sir!

1268
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:18,338
Reload forward tubes when we surface.

1269
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:20,090
Reload forward tubes when we surface!

1270
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,058
Shift targets.

1271
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:33,061
Angle on the bow,
70 starboard, bearing coming down.

1272
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:35,147
Commence firing when set.

1273
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:36,690
-Radar!
-Aye, aye, sir.

1274
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:37,858
Any sign of that sub?

1275
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:38,942
Not yet, sir.

1276
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:41,069
-Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson !
-Aye, aye, sir!

1277
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:43,655
-Fire three!
-Fire three!

1278
01:28:45,366 --> 01:28:46,742
-Fire four!
-Fire four!

1279
01:28:57,086 --> 01:28:59,087
New radar contact, bearing 303 relative.

1280
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:02,090
That should be our friend.

1281
01:29:05,386 --> 01:29:06,762
There he is.

1282
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:13,560
He's changing course.

1283
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:17,773
He's moving in behind the decoy,
using it as a screen.

1284
01:29:17,857 --> 01:29:19,107
Right standard rudder!

1285
01:29:19,275 --> 01:29:20,484
Come right to course 069!

1286
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,862
Right standard rudder!
Coming right to course 069, sir!

1287
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,405
Very well.

1288
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:28,158
That decoy, you say it has a shallow draft?

1289
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:29,743
Yeah, that's right.

1290
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:31,411
We could shoot under it and hit the sub.

1291
01:29:33,164 --> 01:29:35,165
Open outer doors on tubes five and six.

1292
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:38,043
Set torpedo depth at 16 feet.

1293
01:29:42,298 --> 01:29:44,424
Steady on new course, sir!

1294
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,013
Range, 1,500. Standing by to fire, sir.

1295
01:29:58,398 --> 01:29:59,856
He's all yours, Captain.

1296
01:30:05,488 --> 01:30:06,530
Fire five.

1297
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,740
-Fire five!
-Fire five!

1298
01:30:10,326 --> 01:30:11,493
Five's away, sir.

1299
01:30:12,161 --> 01:30:13,203
Fire six.

1300
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:14,997
-Fire six!
-Fire six!

1301
01:31:08,926 --> 01:31:11,470
SJ radar contact! Aircraft, coming in fast!

1302
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:13,388
Clear the deck.

1303
01:31:13,431 --> 01:31:16,558
Lookouts below! Hurry! Clear the decks!

1304
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,060
Stand by to dive!

1305
01:31:19,646 --> 01:31:21,063
Dive! Dive!

1306
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,399
Beckman, secure the hatch !

1307
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:52,094
It's 38 days now since we left Pearl Harbor.

1308
01:31:53,262 --> 01:31:54,763
I know how some of us felt then,

1309
01:31:54,847 --> 01:31:56,890
I think I know how some of us feel now.

1310
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:01,395
But let no one here,
no one aboard this boat,

1311
01:32:01,604 --> 01:32:03,355
ever say we didn't have a captain.

1312
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:14,533
"Unto Almighty God we commend
the soul of our shipmate departed,

1313
01:32:14,617 --> 01:32:17,160
"and we commit his body to the deep,

1314
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:21,581
"in the sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection unto eternal life,

1315
01:32:21,624 --> 01:32:24,292
"when the sea shall give up her dead

1316
01:32:24,377 --> 01:32:26,878
"and the life of the world to come."
