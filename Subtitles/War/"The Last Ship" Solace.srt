The harbor master log doesn't show one.

62

So it headed out to sea
to avoid the pandemic,

maybe create a safe hospital offshore.

64

command to run the ship,

68

00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:15,381
Doctor Milowsky,

703
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm so sorry that you all got
caught in the middle of this.

704
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:21,538
[Sighs deeply] We left
behind family, friends,

705
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:23,513
all of us working in isolation.

706
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:25,851
<i>Solace</i> was our last hope.

707
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:31,062
[Scoffs] You have the cure,
and they destroyed my lab.

708
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,162
It's a great loss for us all.

709
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,899
Chief Mate Gonzalez saved our lives.

710
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,758
I just wish I could've saved his.

711
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:43,209
So what happens to us now?

712
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:44,932
Well, your ship is seaworthy,

713
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:47,171
you have enough crew to
get you and your associates

714
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:48,818
back to Norfolk. We have people there.

715
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,857
You'll be needed and greatly appreciated.

716
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,654
We'll send you back with
doses of the cure, obviously.

717
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,896
I wanna stay here with you all.

718
00:37:58,103 --> 00:38:00,021
I'm an expert in vaccine manufacturing

719
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:01,712
and genetic engineering.

720
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,378
If you're spreading the cure,
I'd like to be a part of it.

721
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:07,494
I'm sure we could use the help.

722
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,040
It would be an honor to have you.

723
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,306
Hey.

724
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,346
You okay?

725
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:27,038
Yeah, it'd take, uh, more
than a bullet to knock me out.

726
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:30,691
I'm just glad we all got back
in one piece, more or less.

727
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:34,877
You, uh... did real good out there today.

728
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:38,633
I'm glad to have you on the team.

729
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:40,191
[Chuckles]

730
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:42,207
What?

731
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,652
I like you guys.

732
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,251
You're crazy.

733
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:52,452
[Chuckles]

734
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,494
It's a miracle he survived.

735
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,610
The lord works in mysterious ways, Deacon.

736
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,019
No doubt about that.

737
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,599
While he was conscious,

738
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:09,391
he was muttering what sounded like Spanish,

739
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:12,271
but you said your guy had a British accent.

740
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:16,552
An international band of thieves.

741
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,774
How'd they get their hands on a sub?

742
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:23,102
Well, if this man ever
wakes up, we'll find out.

743
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,973
[Engine whirring]

744
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:39,887
[Sonar pinging]

745
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,745
[Whistles]

746
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:47,421
So, you guys, is someone
gonna explain to me

747
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:50,206
where we're going in the
middle of the night here?

748
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:52,813
I told ya. There's someone
who wants to meet ya.

749
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,708
Was there a problem?
You didn't find the ship?

750
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,774
Oh, yeah, we found it.

751
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:03,574
So great news. You see? I
told you. Right? I was right?

752
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,031
Standard protocol for
emergency preparedness,

753
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,651
all hospital ships go offshore.

754
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,343
Niels, he said they found it.

755
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:13,785
He didn't say nothin' about good news.

756
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,016
What was the problem? You
didn't find what I told you?

757
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,041
No, we found the United States Navy...

758
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:19,432
A ship.

759
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:20,956
You found the Navy?

760
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:23,315
Yeah, it's like they knew we were comin'.

761
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,589
[Pinging speeds up]

762
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:28,522
You guys, that's them. That's them.

763
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:30,679
That's captain Chandler and Rachel...

764
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:33,565
That, um, Dr. Scott. I
mean, they have the cure.

765
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,340
Did you catch them?

766
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,617
[Pinging speeds up]

767
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,903
You think I had something to do with that?

768
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:46,147
You guys, I assure you, the
last time I saw that ship,

769
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:49,540
we were, like, a few miles
from Jamaica. I swear.

770
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:52,449
- If you suspect that I somehow set you up...
- [Shifts gear]

771
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:57,527
- [Engine slowing down]
- I categorically deny any involvement in any kind of...

772
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:01,190
Do us a favor, Niels. Stop talkin'.

773
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:03,382
You can save your bellyaching for the boss.

774
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,716
[Pinging rapidly]

775
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:07,240
The boss?

776
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:09,978
Let's go.

777
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:15,123
[Pinging continues]

778
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,081
[Pinging stops]

779
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:26,471
The boss.
