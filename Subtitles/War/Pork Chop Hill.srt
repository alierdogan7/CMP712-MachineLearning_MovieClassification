00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,945
(PA) Hello, my GI friends.

2
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,282
Good morning.
This is your regular morning broadcast,

3
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:34,787
courtesy of
the Chinese people's volunteer army.

4
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:44,046
GI friends, this is the dawning of
the 1020th day of the forgotten war,

5
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,715
what your politicians choose to call

6
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:51,554
"a police action", "a minor affair".

7
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:56,600
Which has already cost you more
casualties than your war of independence.

8
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:01,146
GI friends... you want peace.

9
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:05,276
We want peace.
We too are young.

10
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:09,488
We too had to leave our homes
to fight on foreign soil.

11
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:12,074
Why?

12
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,829
Show your stubborn generals
haggling at Panmunjom

13
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:20,207
that you will no longer fight
for a line on a map.

14
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:28,007
Show them that you want peace...
just as we want peace.

15
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:31,051
Lay down your arms

16
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:36,140
and we'll be glad to lay down ours.

17
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:56,076
Lieutenant Clemons, sir?
Lieutenant Clemons?

18
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,499
Oh, Forstman. I've been expecting you.

19
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:09,465
- Did you check with Battalion, sir?
- Yes, I did.

20
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,513
- Did you tell them about my 36 points?
- They say you're one short.

21
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:19,767
Sir, Battalion's got a million guys
to worry about. I got only me.

22
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,603
Who's the most apt to make a mistake?
I ask you.

23
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,772
(phone rings)

24
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:27,733
This is King Company.

25
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,110
Hey, get off there!

26
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,823
According to my figures, and
Fedderson checked it... Right, Chuck?

27
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,995
- Well, come on. Tell him.
- Besides, sir, he's got a new car.

28
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,791
Is it paid for?

29
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,755
No, sir. My kid brother's a boy scout. He
sent me a raffle ticket, I sent him a buck.

30
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,424
- He won a Cadillac convertible.
- (phone rings)

31
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,677
Yes, sir?

32
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:56,428
I mean, yes, sir!

33
00:04:56,554 --> 00:05:01,100
Sir, it's the colonel.
He's coming to the phone.

34
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:05,145
Maybe that's the armistice. Maybe those
jokers at Panmunjom wrapped it up.

35
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,108
- Battalion's found your 36th point.
- Not Battalion. Regiment.

36
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,152
- It's Colonel Kern, direct.
- Colonel Kern, direct?

37
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,698
- That's gotta be it, the old peaceola!
- Lieutenant Clemons, sir.

38
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:21,203
Lieutenant, prepare to counterattack
Pork Chop if necessary. You got that?

39
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:26,250
- You understand this is only an alert?
- I understand, sir.

40
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:33,465
Yes, sir, my men are all here, except my
weapons platoon, detached to Battalion.

41
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes, sir, I understand.
It's not definite.

42
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,056
Very good, sir.

43
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:51,775
We need two new squad leaders.
Take care of it, will you?

44
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,944
Is it good news, sir?

45
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,489
If it ain't good news, sir,

46
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:01,368
I can give you the exact hour, the minute,
the second, I got here to Korea.

47
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:04,622
You gotta count me out on this one, sir.

48
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:11,003
Forstman, I could tell you stories
that'd bring bitter tears to your eyes.

49
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,884
But sir, Battalion can't add.

50
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,180
I consider the rotation system a solid
contract between the army and myself.

51
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:23,974
You're right. Sue 'em.

52
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,366
Lieutenant O'Hashi, sir?

53
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,911
You're the executive officer.
Request permission to call Regiment.

54
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,915
- Permission refused.
- I wanna talk to the colonel.

55
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,876
Ever heard of channels?
You can't call Regiment.

56
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,045
Why not? They called us.

57
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,009
Get out of here, Forstman.
I just had my leave cancelled.

58
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:02,888
You're talkin' to a man in a black mood,
and I'm liable to shoot you.

59
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:08,894
OK, OK. If that's the way it is, I want
this registered as a formal complaint.

60
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,106
I'll have it entered into company records.

61
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,254
- Another raisin?
- No thanks, Lieutenant.

62
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,883
My mouth's full already. Cotton.

63
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:42,469
Why don't they get some heat in here?

64
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,597
Aren't you cold?

65
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,559
I'm from the Panhandle. That's cold.

66
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:54,523
Sometimes when we talked the words
comin' outta your mouth'd freeze solid.

67
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,693
Had to drop 'em in a frying pan
to thaw 'em out,

68
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:00,905
find out what we were talkin' about.

69
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,825
(phone rings)

70
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,913
King Company.

71
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,248
Yes, sir.
One moment, sir.

72
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:16,378
- Sir, it's Battalion. Colonel Davis.
- Guess this is the business.

73
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,715
Lieutenant Clemons.

74
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,385
Maybe it's a reprieve,
or news from Panmunjom.

75
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,933
Yes, sir.

76
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:41,820
Pork Chop's been lost. They were right
in the trenches before anybody knew it.

77
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:46,492
- Who goofed this time?
- Kreukenberg, get the men assembled.

78
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,372
Waldorf, maybe nobody goofed.
These Chinese are good.

79
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:56,210
They never heard of rotation.
All old hands, and tops at this night stuff.

80
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,421
- We've gotta counterattack 'em at night?
- That's right.

81
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:02,633
No time for a reconnaissance.
We'll have to go by the book.

82
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,928
Don't ask me how we're
gonna read it in the dark.

83
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,765
Let's go. We gotta make it before daylight.

84
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,368
Payne, your radio'll be on Company
frequency. Coleman, you're on Battalion.

85
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:33,581
- You got your letter written?
- The papers say the war's over.

86
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,046
Check that tailgate.

87
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,803
- All right, you guys, closing it.
- Take an ammo check.

88
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,558
I know how you feel, Joe.
It's a rough one to cut your teeth on.

89
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,352
But you're a pro - you'll do all right.

90
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:58,480
- I'd better do all right.
- Level with me, Joe.

91
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:04,153
Is Pork Chop worth all this?
A lousy, undefendable outpost?

92
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,073
Pork Chop's just cost one company
and may cost another. Us.

93
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,202
Are you telling me it's worth all that?

94
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,583
Well, look, Tsugi. Pork Chop is just
a chip in the big game at Panmunjom.

95
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,712
Every time the Reds win a chip here,
they raise the ante there.

96
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:27,843
I guess we gotta convince 'em we're
not about to give up any more chips.

97
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:32,431
Does that answer your question?

98
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:36,101
Hey, McKinley, you got
your St Christopher medal?

99
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:40,773
Yeah. You got
your picture of General MacArthur?

100
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,942
Right here.

101
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,325
- What colour's that car, Forstman?
- What colour?

102
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,494
Man, it's a Cadillac!

103
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,003
Keep that sight covered, soldier.

104
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,467
- What do you know about this guy?
- Somebody said he's regular army.

105
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:11,846
That tells me a lot.
Does he know anything?

106
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,683
Probably just enough to bury you,
according to regulations.

107
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,269
Anyway, we'll soon find out.

108
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,755
How you deploy your company
I'll leave up to you.

109
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,258
(radio operator) X-ray Yoke, Fox Able,

110
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,055
Mike Oboe, Charlie Dog...

111
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,018
The trenches are gonna be
tougher than the climb up.

112
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:46,232
I'll keep the third platoon in reserve
until we get up there.

113
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:51,737
I'll start with the first platoon on the left
and the second platoon on the right.

114
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:53,697
Right.

115
00:12:53,822 --> 00:13:01,121
Uh... this concertina wire is gonna be
pretty tough to get through in the dark.

116
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,376
No, the report has it,
it's been flattened by artillery.

117
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:10,297
I'd suggest you set up your aid station
here in this chow bunker.

118
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,759
We'll try to evacuate casualties
down this access road.

119
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:17,680
Don't forget your radio.
Keep me informed - that's what it's for.

120
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,850
I can't help if I don't know
where you are and what you're doing.

121
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,603
- We won't forget, sir.
- Remember this.

122
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:29,859
You've got 135 men, all of them
thinking of the peace talks at Panmunjom.

123
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:34,530
It's a cinch they won't wanna die
in what may be the last battle.

124
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:38,284
When you hit the line of departure,
deploy fast and get up there fast.

125
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,495
Lead them, push them, I don't care,
but don't let them stop.

126
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,125
Your only chance is to get into
these trenches before daylight.

127
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,672
What about this flank?
I haven't got enough men to protect it.

128
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,343
Love Company's assignment. They should
be in position by the time you get there.

129
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,848
As to artillery preparation, we've been
keeping fire on this hill right along.

130
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,393
So when you're ready, call me,
and I'll have it lifted.

131
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,399
Yes, sir.

132
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,864
- Anything else, sir?
- No, I don't think so.

133
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,158
Good luck.

134
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:44,016
They got a great sense of humour around
here. Why ain't somebody laughin'?

135
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,636
Tsugi, you stick with the first platoon.
I'll stay with the second.

136
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,077
Sir?

137
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:48,080
Love Company's having a bad time.

138
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,213
Blue Six, over.

139
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,846
OK, reorganise if you have to,
but get back up there.

140
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:07,266
King Company's depending on you. Out.

141
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,563
Love Company's got off
on the wrong foot.

142
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:17,985
Somehow they got the idea they're
reinforcing instead of heading into a fight.

143
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,696
Well, Clemons knows where he's headed.

144
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,838
Man, I feel like a packhorse
in all this gear.

145
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:42,218
- This bulletproof corset.
- Brother, you'll learn to love it.

146
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,894
- Fine way to spend my birthday.
- Many happy returns of the day.

147
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,522
- Yeah, congratulations.
- Thanks.

148
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,441
(close explosions)

149
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,414
- Battalion, Colonel Davis.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,418
Hello, Blue, this is King.
Put your six on. Over.

151
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,587
Colonel Davis, sir.

152
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,758
Sir, request fires be lifted. Over.

153
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,929
Yes, sir. Out.

154
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:46,866
No Chink fire yet. No Chink fire yet.

155
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:49,160
No, not yet.

156
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:57,001
(Chinese voice over PA)
Good evening. King Company, isn't it?

157
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,421
Nice to meet you, King Company.

158
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,756
Come on, come on.

159
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,760
You're coming to visit us
in our new home.

160
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:13,017
Care to hear what happened to
the previous tenants, Easy Company?

161
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:18,731
There were 96 men in Easy Company.
Now, as near as we can tell,

162
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:24,528
31 are dead, 34 wounded, 22 captured

163
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,406
and nine unaccounted for.

164
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,869
A company wiped out for a political whim.

165
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:36,999
To please chair-bound politicians sitting
fat and smug thousands of miles away.

166
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:43,923
Men of King Company,
you must know that this isn't your fight.

167
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:47,218
But if you insist upon coming, OK then.

168
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,346
Welcome to the meat-grinder.

169
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:55,142
We'll even play a little tune for you,
in honour of your dead,

170
00:18:55,267 --> 00:19:00,231
past, present and future.

171
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,157
(# "Taps")

172
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,531
- What's the matter?
- Let go of me!

173
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,242
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah, I'm hurt. Beat it!

174
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:57,997
- Twisted your ankle?
- Yeah, I twisted it bad. Beat it!

175
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,753
Hey. Maybe I'd better stay with you.

176
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,465
Scram!

177
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,350
- Get up.
- Sir, I'm hurt. I twisted my ankle.

178
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:21,478
Get up. What's your name?

179
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:26,942
- I said, what's your name?
- Franklin, sir.

180
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,779
Well, get out of there
and stick close to me.

181
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,996
Come on, come on.

182
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:55,888
(artillery launches)

183
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:58,390
Here it comes.
Here it comes!

184
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,699
Move! Keep moving!

185
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,394
(Coleman) I thought
they said it was knocked flat!

186
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:03,706
Set it up right there.

187
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:11,338
Half the men are not firing.
Make them use their weapons.

188
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:38,782
Come on! Over me! Over me!

189
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,365
Battalion.

190
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,496
King Six. Douse those lights!
You wanna murder us?

191
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,957
Turn off those damn lights!

192
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,090
Gimme your cutters.

193
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,636
Find Kuzmick.
Tell him to feed his men through here.

194
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,015
OK. Coleman?

195
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,982
Get up.

196
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,653
This'll cost you 10 years in Leavenworth.
Now get up!

197
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,822
You got a rifle. Use it!

198
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,829
And don't get any funny ideas.
Stay up even with me.

199
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,385
Roger. Out.

200
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:06,388
Sir, the searchlight guys
have just apologised.

201
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:10,809
- They got us mixed up with another hill.
- That's great(!)

202
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:17,858
- Soldier, where's your rifle?
- I don't know.

203
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,027
Pick up one.

204
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:26,659
Sir. Sir.

205
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:32,039
Lieutenant Cook sent me over. Our
platoon radio was knocked out by shells.

206
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:36,794
Tell Lieutenant Cook
I think he's bearing too far to the right.

207
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,422
- Leave that flank to Love Company.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,636
Sir. Sir.

209
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:53,644
Lieutenant O'Hashi isn't near the
first platoon radio. They can't find him.

210
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,191
You! You!

211
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,735
Without a rifle!

212
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,904
Come here!

213
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:07,408
Come on, come on.

214
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,036
- Sir, I don't know what happened...
- Get down.

215
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:13,789
- What's your name?
- Private Velie, sir.

216
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:16,709
Velie, you're a runner.
Find Lieutenant O'Hashi.

217
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,378
Find him over there with the first platoon.

218
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:22,798
Tell him when he hits the first trench
to pinch in this way.

219
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:26,385
That'll be to his right.
Repeat it back to me.

220
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,556
Lieutenant O'Hashi,
when he reaches the first trench,

221
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,934
- to pinch in this way, to his right.
- And report back to me.

222
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,937
- You'll find me with Lieutenant Cook.
- Report back to you.

223
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,357
- You'll be with Lieutenant Cook.
- Go.

224
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,841
- Sir?
- Hold it.

225
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:08,260
Come on, hurry it up!
Shake it up down there!

226
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:10,638
This sure is mountain-goat country.

227
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:15,851
When I get home, I'm gonna live
in an elevator, riding up and down.

228
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:19,855
Sir, can I give you this message
from Lieutenant Clemons?

229
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,159
Lieutenant Clemons says, when
you reach the top, at the first trench...

230
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,203
(gunfire drowns him out)

231
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:37,832
...that'll be to your right.
To your right.

232
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,515
(shouting)

233
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:32,428
Sir, Lieutenant Clemons says that...

234
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:36,182
Bugle. Chinese.
Up on the ridge.

235
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,857
I thought Love Company
were handling the ridge.

236
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:48,068
That's sure not Love Company.

237
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,493
Hold it.

238
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:59,330
We're flanked.
There's millions of Chinese up there.

239
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:05,586
- We're flanked. We'd better pull back.
- Hold everything.

240
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:17,097
Payne, see if you can
get me O'Hashi this time.

241
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:23,854
- How many men you got left?
- I don't know.

242
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,440
- Where the hell's Love Company?
- Hold back.

243
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:31,320
What about the third platoon?
Why don't you get 'em up here?

244
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,489
Cook, stop 'em!

245
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,578
- The flank's wide open!
- Get down!

246
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,248
Here he is, sir.

247
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:45,167
Tsugi? We're flanked.

248
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:48,420
I need help from you.
Can't you hear me? Over.

249
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,218
Sure, I hear you.
Did the runner get to you?

250
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:58,389
We had 25% casualties then
and more now.

251
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:04,395
Can't spare a single man over here, Joe.
Not without losing all we've gained.

252
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,274
- What about the third platoon?
- If I use them before I hit the trenches,

253
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,778
what happens then?
We might lose the whole company.

254
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:16,615
It's a cheaper gamble now, but be ready
to haul out in case we cave in here.

255
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,577
Hold it, Tsugi.
Round up a squad.

256
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:22,788
Take both machine guns.
Set one up to hold that ridge.

257
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:25,583
Hustle the other to
the trench under it. Block 'em.

258
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:29,670
One squad? Love Company couldn't
lick those Chinese! How can I do it?

259
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,256
Do it. Ask me how later. Go on!

260
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,176
Are you still there, Tsugi?

261
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,553
Pinch in as fast as you can.

262
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,931
We'll try to hold the flank with one squad
and advance with the rest.

263
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,767
I'll meet you at the CP, I hope. Out.

264
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,936
Kuzmick, let's go.

265
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,366
(mumbling to himself)

266
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:49,226
- Get ready. We're gonna rush the trench.
- What about the flank, Lieutenant?

267
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:53,480
It's taken care of. Let's go.
We'll all be safer in the trench.

268
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,317
Move, Sergeant.
Move, move, come on.

269
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,485
Move! OK, move!

270
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,543
Let's go! Keep moving!
We've got it made!

271
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,602
He's your squad leader, isn't he?
Take over the squad.

272
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,521
I don't know where the squad is!

273
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:35,689
- Can you make it back?
- I can see. Yes, sir.

274
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,692
Franklin, help him over the wall.

275
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:43,697
Sir, Lieutenant Cook thinks
he sees Love Company coming.

276
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:46,116
That'll be the eighth wonder of the world.

277
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,497
Hold everything, Franklin.

278
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:53,040
- Jurgens?
- Yes, sir?

279
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,626
He can make it by himself.

280
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:01,215
Keep an eye on that man.
Don't let him out of your sight.

281
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:07,096
After you, soldier.

282
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:13,227
The way things are going, I won't
have to keep an eye on you long. Let's go!

283
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,531
Hey, you! This way!

284
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,167
Who are you starin' at?

285
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,962
You. Who do you think I'm starin' at?

286
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,131
What for?

287
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,099
I got a special interest
in everything you do.

288
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:03,170
You think they've quit trying here?

289
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,382
I haven't seen a live Chinese
for at least five minutes.

290
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:10,302
- The runner said you saw Love Company.
- I thought so, but it was a while ago.

291
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:12,555
Since then, not a hair.

292
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,683
- Get me Battalion.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:18,686
- How many men you got left?
- One gunner here,

294
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:23,357
team on the gun below,
about one half of a rifle squad.

295
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:27,695
Leave that gunner where he is
and move in with the rest.

296
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,072
OK.

297
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:32,241
You did a good job, Cook.

298
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:37,329
Thanks.
Just send the bill to Love Company.

299
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,963
Colonel Davis, sir.

300
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,049
Lieutenant Clemons.

301
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:51,719
Both platoons are in position.

302
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:56,348
But there are a dozen trenches here.
We've got a foothold in only two.

303
00:36:56,473 --> 00:37:00,686
Yeah, I've got it.
What about the second platoon?

304
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:10,905
With both platoons pinching together,
shouldn't you have taken the CP bunker?

305
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:16,368
Maybe, but there's heavy pressure from
the right flank you said not to worry about.

306
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:18,537
Where are you now?

307
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:24,168
OK. You can hold that flank, can't you?

308
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:30,799
I'm not sure that we can. We can't do Love
Company's job with one machine gun.

309
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:36,138
Yes, sir.

310
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:39,808
Very well, sir.

311
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:47,650
Private Velie reporting back, sir.

312
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,236
Lieutenant O'Hashi said...

313
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:57,201
- Lieutenant O'Hashi said...
- Said what?

314
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:59,370
Uh...

315
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:08,003
Sir, I can't remember. I had a kind of an...
experience back there. I can't remember.

316
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,507
I know about the casualties.
What about the rest?

317
00:38:11,632 --> 00:38:14,343
- Well...
- His weapons?

318
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,637
Flame-throwers.
They didn't get up to 'em.

319
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:22,351
- Yes, sir, that's right. How did you know?
- Same thing over here.

320
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:30,317
Get that taken care of. There's an aid
station setting up at the chow bunker.

321
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,986
Yes, sir.

322
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:40,619
Sir, don't you need me
as a runner any more?

323
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:46,000
We'll make out all right.

324
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:48,836
Yes, sir.

325
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:05,769
Come on, come on!

326
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:19,783
- Brought a few late guests to the party.
- Well, we're glad you dropped in.

327
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:24,371
Make that casualty report 40%.
It's murder over there.

328
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:29,502
You clear out a bunker and try to
move ahead and they filter in behind you.

329
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:33,130
It's been the same kind of murder with us.

330
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:42,097
You'd better bring up the third platoon,
Joe. We're stretched mighty thin.

331
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:49,522
What's the sense of pushing your luck?
Let me go down and get 'em.

332
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:52,858
Not yet.
We've got to have something in reserve.

333
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:57,571
The Chinese love this eyeball-to-eyeball
stuff. This fight hasn't even begun.

334
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,740
And we're damn near finished.

335
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:04,495
No sense saving the third platoon
just to bury us, Joe.

336
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:10,042
Had your iron today?

337
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:17,466
OK, I'll shut up. I just hope
your hunch is better than mine.

338
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:23,055
That makes two of us.

339
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,976
If you run into any more stragglers,
push 'em up toward the CP bunker.

340
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,645
So I'm back to squad leader now.

341
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,148
Things are tough all over, Lieutenant.

342
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:38,112
(explosion)

343
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:41,323
- Here we go again.
- Sir! Sir!

344
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,370
Look, there, comin' through the wire.

345
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:50,499
Looks like Love Company, sir.

346
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:07,057
- Do I give Battalion the good news?
- Not yet.

347
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:12,354
- Marshall, Love Company.
- Where in the hell have you been?

348
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:16,025
- We haven't been pickin' daisies.
- You left my flank wide open.

349
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,446
Who's responsible? Where's Crittenden?
He's in command, isn't he?

350
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:24,074
He was, and then Bechtel,
and now it's me.

351
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,912
You'd better be damn glad
we got here at all.

352
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,510
Where's the rest of them?

353
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:44,595
What rest of 'em?

354
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,270
How many left?

355
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:57,191
Twelve.

356
00:41:57,316 --> 00:42:00,236
There were 42 in my platoon alone
when we started.

357
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:04,073
Now there's 12 men left
out of the whole company.

358
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:27,680
Put your men to work.

359
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,063
Now you can notify Battalion.

360
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:42,820
Tell 'em that Love Company
has arrived... on position.

361
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:47,199
Ten men... still full of fight.

362
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:50,035
Thanks.

363
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,497
Blue, this is King. Over.

364
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:12,516
- How is it, Saxon?
- How do you like this, sir?

365
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:14,685
Isn't this great?

366
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,606
I lug this damn bulletproof vest,
and they blow my foot off.

367
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,774
They blow my foot off!

368
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,236
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

369
00:43:24,361 --> 00:43:26,822
Hurry up, you guys, it hurts!

370
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:37,291
(clucking)

371
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:42,671
What's that?

372
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:49,970
- Chinese!
- (laughter)

373
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:01,982
Chickens.

374
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:07,321
You know, back home in the Panhandle,

375
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:10,241
Ma had an old club-footed hen one time.

376
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:13,035
She fed her sawdust by mistake.

377
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,121
She laid 12 eggs.

378
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:21,836
11 of those chicks had wooden legs,
and the 12th was a woodpecker.

379
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,715
What caused that, the cold?

380
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:54,910
Cover 'em.

381
00:44:57,454 --> 00:45:01,876
We'll have the CP for you
in no time at all, Lieutenant.

382
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:10,217
Holy cow!

383
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:17,808
Oh, brother, am I ever glad to see you!

384
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:21,437
Hey, guys, come on out!
The war's over!

385
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:30,946
- Joe Clemons.
- Hello, Tom.

386
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:33,407
- Ballie!
- Mother Kuzmick!

387
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:36,827
- (laughter)
- What do you say, boys?

388
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:40,831
Boy, I thought we were goners.
You're the last person I expected to see.

389
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,334
- Is anybody else up there?
- We don't know.

390
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:47,588
We don't know nothin',
except this is like Christmas.

391
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:51,425
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Here. Live it up, boy. Have a cigar.

392
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:56,096
- Hey, you're smilin'.
- I must be crackin' up!

393
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:59,099
- That's enough! Don't...
- (Iow-flying jet)

394
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:18,786
Spread out!

395
00:46:56,657 --> 00:46:58,951
- You OK?
- Huh?

396
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:00,911
OK?

397
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:03,956
Yeah, I guess so.

398
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:10,796
- Is there anybody left in there?
- I don't know, sir.

399
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:20,556
All you men, down here, on the double!

400
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:24,059
- Get a couple more men, Corporal.
- Right, sir.

401
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:28,689
Those shells were ours.
I could hear 'em comin' in.

402
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:32,485
- Those were our damn shells!
- I heard 'em too.

403
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,321
All right, now let's get with it!

404
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:38,949
There may be some men in the CP.
Let's dig 'em out.

405
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:41,160
That goes for you too, Bowen.
Let's go!

406
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:47,082
What's the use? We'll only get
murdered by our own lousy artillery!

407
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:52,505
- What was that?
- Everybody knows, sir.

408
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,633
Them shells were our shells!

409
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:58,844
- How does everybody know that?
- I heard 'em comin' in!

410
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:01,972
Sure, I could hear 'em
comin' in from over there!

411
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:06,894
Oh, I've had it. I'm not stayin' here
to get killed from both sides!

412
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:10,064
- I think he's right, sir.
- I heard 'em comin' too, sir.

413
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:12,525
Sure you heard 'em.
So did I.

414
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:18,280
Anybody ever tell you that
the enemy holds Old Baldy?

415
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:21,450
That's where those shells came from.

416
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:26,747
- Can you prove that?
- Can you prove that they didn't?

417
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:35,089
Our artillery is plastering the far slope, to
keep more Chinese from getting up here.

418
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:37,633
Let's break this up.
Clean up the bunker.

419
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:40,511
Come on, boys, move out. Move it.

420
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:48,477
Bowen, you want me
to draw you a picture? Come on!

421
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:54,567
Sir, that last shell got her.
She sure saved my life.

422
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:57,361
That makes you a runner. Tsugi.

423
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,575
Runner. And me the electronic type.

424
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:11,917
You were the electronic type.

425
00:49:28,893 --> 00:49:32,521
OK, now you can
bring up the third platoon.

426
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:36,275
Careful. I might keep right on goin'.

427
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,487
If I had my bags packed, I'd go with you.

428
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:42,698
- Adios.
- Hasta la vista.

429
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:48,454
- Battalion's trying to get through.
- What do they say?

430
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:52,791
The Chinese are jamming.
(imitates distortion)

431
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:11,268
- You made it just in time, sir.
- How's it going?

432
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:16,106
There are a lot of casualties, sir.
More comin' down every minute.

433
00:50:16,232 --> 00:50:20,194
- How's it up on the hill?
- The old man just took the Korea Hilton.

434
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,907
Unless those ammo bearers get up here,
he won't hold it long.

435
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,076
Sir, good luck.

436
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:46,178
Hello, Tsugi.

437
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:48,347
Come on in.
Sign the register.

438
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:51,600
Get one squad up ahead
to give us security.

439
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:55,646
Spread the rest of your men
along this trench.

440
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,320
Well, how was it? Rough?

441
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:08,909
Oh, not too bad. Lost six men
coming up here from the chow bunker.

442
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:16,083
Isn't that a great situation?
Not too bad when you lose only six men.

443
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,127
How's it been going up here?

444
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,380
The men have done everything
I've asked them to do.

445
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:26,552
Not sure I've asked them
to do the right thing at the right time.

446
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:28,721
Tsugi?

447
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:34,268
"Tsugi" scares me.
Always means something's coming.

448
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,437
Have some raisins.

449
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:39,648
OK, I'm bribed.

450
00:51:41,484 --> 00:51:45,779
We're getting no place. Every one
of these trenches is a separate dogfight.

451
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:50,701
As long as the Reds hold the crest
of the hill, they're in charge.

452
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:55,873
We have to take that high ground.
And we have to do it in one jump.

453
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,669
The old "over the top" stuff?

454
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:02,922
- With who?
- The third platoon.

455
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:05,591
The others are too exhausted.

456
00:52:07,343 --> 00:52:08,636
Bayonets.

457
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:12,640
Right outta the Stone Age.

458
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:16,894
Where's all this push-button warfare
we've been hearin' about?

459
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:18,938
We're the push buttons.

460
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,443
Well...

461
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:30,074
Lieutenant Waldorf's a little too green
to lead a bayonet charge.

462
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:33,160
And anyway, it is my old platoon.

463
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:39,875
You know, my ancestors were
pretty good at this banzai business.

464
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,879
What do you know?
A real live volunteer.

465
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:50,803
I never volunteer.
Let's just say... I accept your kind offer.

466
00:52:55,975 --> 00:52:58,227
We'll try to make it a coordinated attack.

467
00:52:58,352 --> 00:53:00,563
While you go over the crest of the hill,

468
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:04,775
I'll push through the trenches
with every man I can find.

469
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,613
You know...
you may become a historical figure.

470
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:13,826
The last man ever
to lead a bayonet charge.

471
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:19,623
Yeah, I'll tell my grandchildren about it...
if I live to have any.

472
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:43,022
Come on!

473
00:53:44,273 --> 00:53:46,108
Down!

474
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:51,113
Let's go! Come on!

475
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:00,748
(shouting)

476
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:52,466
Can you speak louder?
The shelling's heavy here.

477
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:58,222
It's no picnic here either, sir.

478
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:03,227
We've taken the crest of the hill
and the whole trench system.

479
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:09,358
There are still plenty of Chinese around.

480
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:13,654
I repeat my request for food, water,
medical supplies and ammo. Over.

481
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,823
Show them this, sir.

482
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:19,618
Blue Six. Blue Six, this is King.

483
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:22,663
Can you hear me? Over.

484
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:30,337
What'd he say, sir?
What did he say?

485
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:34,258
He's taken the hill.
That's all I could hear.

486
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:39,555
King Six, can you hear me? Over.

487
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,309
Nothin' but a lot of noise.

488
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:46,187
- Try 'em again later.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:54,111
That's what they look like alive?
That's what I've been afraid of?

490
00:55:54,236 --> 00:55:57,156
(Chinese PA)
Men of King Company, congratulations.

491
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:59,533
You hold the whole hill now

492
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:05,372
and your tactics and bravery
deserve our deepest respect.

493
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:09,960
However, I must point out a simple truth.

494
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:15,633
The more ground you take,
the more you have to try to defend.

495
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:22,515
Look around.
Is the man behind you a GI or a Chinese?

496
00:56:24,642 --> 00:56:30,856
It's hard to fight and look over
your shoulder at the same time, isn't it?

497
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:35,319
You'll excuse me.
You and Kissel, back to your positions.

498
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:41,033
Soldier, you take 'em to the rear,
then report to the aid station.

499
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:49,416
Olds.

500
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,419
Payne.

501
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:54,630
I want you to find Lieutenant Waldorf.

502
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:57,883
Tell him to expect shellings
at regular intervals.

503
00:56:58,008 --> 00:57:01,971
Counterattacks in between.
Tell him to keep his men in the bunkers.

504
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:07,017
Give every man an assigned defensive
position he can get to in a hurry.

505
00:57:07,142 --> 00:57:09,186
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:14,733
All right, head for the bunkers.

507
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:17,528
- You first. I need that radio.
- With pleasure, sir.

508
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:19,697
You pass the word along.

509
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:39,717
Hi, Sam.

510
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:43,470
- Have some?
- I'm not hungry.

511
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:47,683
Awfully good beans. You oughta have
some. You'll be eating chop suey soon.

512
00:57:47,808 --> 00:57:50,394
- And my name's not Sam.
- Look out!

513
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:52,855
(close explosion)

514
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,024
Comin' through.

515
00:57:57,151 --> 00:58:01,989
Who invited you here, anyway? Don't you
know there's a vital part of me exposed?

516
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:05,075
I've been invited to nicer places.

517
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:11,999
Come on, Chuck.
It's letting up. Let's go.

518
00:58:12,124 --> 00:58:15,961
Let's find a place where
we can get a warmer welcome.

519
00:58:16,086 --> 00:58:18,214
Yeah, and a thicker roof.

520
00:58:24,512 --> 00:58:26,639
Come on, come on, will ya?

521
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:31,227
Come on, will ya, clumsy? What do you
want me to do, carry you up the hill?

522
00:58:31,352 --> 00:58:34,522
- You are very funny today(!)
- OK, OK!

523
00:58:47,535 --> 00:58:49,578
Well, come on, will ya?

524
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:52,498
Chuck!

525
00:58:55,251 --> 00:58:57,294
Chuck!

526
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:01,215
Chuck? Chuck!

527
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,384
Charlie!

528
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:05,970
Chuck! Hey, Chuck!

529
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:08,889
Hey!

530
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,727
Ooh. What?

531
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,441
I'm sorry, Chuck.
I'm sorry, Chuck!

532
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:23,445
I'm sorry.
I'm so... sorry!

533
00:59:32,163 --> 00:59:34,832
- Come on.
- Let go of me, will ya?

534
00:59:34,957 --> 00:59:39,920
- I said, come on.
- I'm not gonna leave him! He's my buddy!

535
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:46,760
I can't leave him there, sir.
I'm going back.

536
01:00:13,078 --> 01:00:16,373
It's no use... trying to figure it out.

537
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,503
You just have to keep on going.

538
01:00:27,843 --> 01:00:32,056
The shelling has stopped.
They'll probably rush us.

539
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:36,811
You pass the word along.
Everybody out of the bunkers.

540
01:00:39,814 --> 01:00:41,857
Come on. Go.

541
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:55,496
I told you to hurry up, didn't I? Didn't I?

542
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:58,707
Yeah. Yeah.

543
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,656
- Hey, Corporal. Where's your CO?
- Just turn left.

544
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:36,954
Get up there fast. Keep your eyes open.
They can pop up from anywhere.

545
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:41,750
Hey, Lieutenant,
what's the situation here?

546
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:46,505
Walt.

547
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:52,052
- What the devil are you doing here?
- Lookin' for you.

548
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,513
Weren't you guarding prisoners
on an island?

549
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:57,391
Yeah, I was.
I'm commanding George Company now.

550
01:01:57,516 --> 01:02:01,896
Whitey, contact the platoon leaders.
Tell 'em to meet me at... what's your CP?

551
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:04,690
- The Korea Hilton.
- Yes, sir.

552
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:08,486
We're all strung out. We ran into
some heavy shelling down there.

553
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:11,280
Hey, uh, what's goin' on here?

554
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:14,283
I've had about 40 casualties
since I came up this hill.

555
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:19,288
The order I got was
to help you out with some mop-up.

556
01:02:19,413 --> 01:02:23,334
They must be crazy.
We're hangin' on here by our teeth.

557
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:25,920
Walt, feed your men in up here.
We need 'em.

558
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:29,548
Sergeant, move your squad right up here.

559
01:02:31,675 --> 01:02:33,719
Watch out for snipers.

560
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,475
Don't get trigger-happy.
I've got men up there.

561
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:43,145
Boy, am I glad to see a radio.

562
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,941
- What's the news from Panmunjom?
- They are still at it.

563
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:49,109
I'll be damned...

564
01:02:59,662 --> 01:03:01,705
Who lives upstairs?

565
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:09,755
- You bring us any supplies?
- Nobody said you needed any.

566
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,592
Try to get Battalion on that thing.
They seem to think we can live on air.

567
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:16,053
Blue, this is George. Over.

568
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:20,349
We're even short on ammo.
Can you spare me any?

569
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:23,894
I can let you have some.
How many men you got?

570
01:03:24,019 --> 01:03:26,522
I'm not sure.

571
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:29,650
I think I've got about... 35.

572
01:03:29,775 --> 01:03:33,988
- You lost over 100 men?
- I told you this is no mop-up.

573
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:40,202
There's about ten from Love Company,
a few odds and ends, and that's it.

574
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:42,913
- Can't you make that work?
- The Reds are jamming.

575
01:03:43,038 --> 01:03:46,625
- Try the emergency frequency.
- Yes, sir.

576
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,920
Blue, this is George. Over.

577
01:03:50,045 --> 01:03:52,798
- They're on this one too.
- Try the other one again.

578
01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:54,967
Here, let me have it.

579
01:03:59,388 --> 01:04:01,640
- Walt?
- Just keep trying.

580
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:10,816
When this shelling stops... you and your
outfit take over this whole right sector.

581
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:16,071
You'll have to get up there fast.
They won't give you much time.

582
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:21,076
I just flat don't get it. Back at the rear
they think this fight's won.

583
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:25,498
- This hill worth it?
- I wondered when you'd ask me that.

584
01:04:25,623 --> 01:04:29,543
Worth what?
It hasn't much military value.

585
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:33,589
I doubt if any American'd
give you a dollar for it.

586
01:04:33,714 --> 01:04:36,842
Probably no Chinese'd give you two bits.

587
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:40,304
The value's changed
somehow, sometime.

588
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:44,058
Maybe when the first man died.

589
01:04:45,476 --> 01:04:48,979
Oh, hell, Walt.
I don't know how to say it.

590
01:04:49,939 --> 01:04:51,190
I'm weary.

591
01:04:51,315 --> 01:04:55,778
Well, it's hardly beautiful.
Maybe it grows on ya.

592
01:04:56,862 --> 01:05:00,074
- Here.
- No, no. You're gonna need that.

593
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:02,243
Well, don't, dammit.

594
01:05:06,622 --> 01:05:09,458
OK. Too thirsty to be noble.

595
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,586
- What do you hear from Cecil?
- Oh, she's fine.

596
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:16,006
She just spent a week with your mother.

597
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:21,053
Put this back before I drain it.

598
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:26,517
I wrote to her you were safe and sound on
that tropical island. Now you cross me up.

599
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:29,645
Sounds like old home week, sir.

600
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,148
My brother-in-law.

601
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:35,609
OK, you stay here. Keep trying.

602
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:38,737
- Find me if you get 'em.
- Yes, sir.

603
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:40,030
Blue, this is George...

604
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:48,497
Sergeant, we'll take over the right sector.
I'll show you your position.

605
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:59,550
- Lieutenant.
- Hi.

606
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,975
Gave up trying to reach you on the radio.
Got a message from Colonel Davis.

607
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:18,777
- Oh, well, he can't mean this.
- He means it all right.

608
01:06:18,903 --> 01:06:23,949
I think the order originated
in Regiment, maybe Division.

609
01:06:26,744 --> 01:06:32,791
You're to withdraw your company at 1500.
That's just three hours from now.

610
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:39,048
Oh, no. Um... they must be sending up
another company to take our place.

611
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:41,383
I don't think so.

612
01:06:41,509 --> 01:06:46,889
From your messages, they seem
to think the show's over up here.

613
01:06:48,098 --> 01:06:53,604
Well, I don't get it. Every time I get through
this jamming, I've been asking for ammo,

614
01:06:53,729 --> 01:07:00,236
flame-throwers, medical supplies,
water, plasma, emitters, more radios!

615
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:06,200
Does that sound like
the show's over up here?

616
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:33,060
You take this message back.

617
01:07:36,522 --> 01:07:42,027
Tell 'em I do not think the crisis up here is
appreciated, by Battalion or by Regiment.

618
01:07:42,153 --> 01:07:47,116
Tell 'em I have very few men left,
and they're all exhausted.

619
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:54,248
Tell 'em Lieutenant Russell has only 55
men out of his company still able to fight.

620
01:07:55,332 --> 01:08:01,255
When they go out, it is not reasonable
to expect that we can hold the hill.

621
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,383
OK.

622
01:08:06,302 --> 01:08:11,265
I'll admit, it doesn't seem
much like a mop-up to me, but...

623
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,642
Well, good luck.

624
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,531
Well, Walt.

625
01:08:29,492 --> 01:08:36,373
Congratulations. In three hours you'll be
off to that dream world back there.

626
01:08:36,499 --> 01:08:43,631
Listen, they're gonna change the order
just as soon as they get your message.

627
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:45,591
You keep trying.

628
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:50,679
Payne, you stay here. I'll be in the George
Company sector with Lieutenant Russell.

629
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:54,308
If Jurgens shows up with any rations,
pass 'em out to the men.

630
01:08:54,433 --> 01:08:58,896
- Yes, sir. I'll be first in line.
- Hey, you. Velie!

631
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,358
I ordered you to the rear.
Why are you here?

632
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:07,905
They fixed my arm, sir. They gave
me a shot. It doesn't even hurt much.

633
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:13,452
Well, I started down the hill, and I decided
those Chinks aren't gonna push us off.

634
01:09:13,577 --> 01:09:15,955
So I turned around
and came back up again.

635
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,959
Who do you think you are?
Audie Murphy?

636
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:24,380
Turn around again.
You're no good up here with one arm.

637
01:09:44,358 --> 01:09:45,776
Now hear this.

638
01:09:45,901 --> 01:09:49,155
The first bulletin of the day
from Panmunjom.

639
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,116
Weather clear, but atmosphere stormy.

640
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:57,663
Casualty report. Your American
negotiators just broke three pencils

641
01:09:57,788 --> 01:10:00,291
in sharp fighting for Pork Chop Hill.

642
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,919
How much is it costing you?

643
01:10:04,044 --> 01:10:09,216
- Still playin' on it like a fiddle, sir.
- Looks like that message worked!

644
01:10:09,341 --> 01:10:13,137
George Company guys
aren't goin' anywhere.

645
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,726
I heard a bang.
I thought my head was gone.

646
01:10:18,851 --> 01:10:21,103
- Lieutenant Clemons?
- What's your outfit?

647
01:10:21,228 --> 01:10:24,106
- I'm from Division.
- Somebody has seen the light.

648
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:28,110
I'm the assistant public information
officer. I came to get a few pictures.

649
01:10:28,235 --> 01:10:32,990
- Pictures of what?
- Of a successful American action.

650
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:38,954
- Which?
- Sure, there haven't been too many lately.

651
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:42,291
And the folks at home
could use a little encouragement.

652
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:48,839
We don't wanna be in the way. Give us
a quick briefing, so we know where to go.

653
01:10:54,929 --> 01:11:01,602
Well, Walt, have you any suggestions
as to where these people can go?

654
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:06,023
I'd better not. I'd hate to live through this,
just to be court-martialled.

655
01:11:06,148 --> 01:11:11,028
Look, would you mind telling me,
when I can't get anything that I need,

656
01:11:11,153 --> 01:11:14,824
just how you two
managed to get up here?

657
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:18,661
- Will you cut that out?
- Hold it, Sergeant.

658
01:11:20,538 --> 01:11:22,581
Look, Lieutenant.

659
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:27,044
Nobody up here's in the mood for posing.

660
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:30,923
There's something you can do for me.

661
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:33,509
Take a message to Battalion.

662
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:41,559
I won't clutter it up with details.
I want this one to stand out crystal clear.

663
01:11:47,606 --> 01:11:51,527
"We must have help,
or we can't hold the hill."

664
01:11:57,533 --> 01:12:00,244
Do you mind if I let him take it?

665
01:12:00,369 --> 01:12:03,247
I'd like to stay here and help out.

666
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:08,669
You can help a lot more
by taking a good look around,

667
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:12,089
and telling Division what you saw here.

668
01:12:14,925 --> 01:12:18,929
Lieutenant, I guess
you must think that I'm...

669
01:12:22,475 --> 01:12:26,228
Anyway, I hope
everything turns out OK for you.

670
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:29,356
Thanks.

671
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:53,005
I don't think we have a right
to make this decision, Carl.

672
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:56,926
Think we should
buck it up to Corps, General?

673
01:12:57,927 --> 01:13:03,808
We've got to. For all I know,
they'll have to buck it higher than that.

674
01:13:06,393 --> 01:13:08,437
OK, sir.

675
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,317
Make sure the message
states clearly the basic question:

676
01:13:13,442 --> 01:13:17,279
Do they really wanna hold Pork Chop?

677
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:19,448
It's just that simple.

678
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:25,788
In the meantime, do we still take
George Company off at 1500?

679
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:36,632
Yes, Carl. The order stands.

680
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:41,762
We may lose the hill, but I'm not
about to spend any more men for it.

681
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:47,268
Not until I'm assured we don't intend
to give it away tomorrow.

682
01:13:56,902 --> 01:14:00,281
I'll... take your wounded down with me.

683
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:26,390
Joe, uh...

684
01:14:26,515 --> 01:14:31,562
You know when you said to me that
this damn hill was worth holdin'?

685
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:34,064
I think I know what you meant.

686
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:38,777
They say that nothing's got a value,
except the value that men put on it.

687
01:14:38,903 --> 01:14:45,326
I don't know how men can put a higher
value on something than by dyin' for it.

688
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:48,454
If that's what you meant,

689
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:53,959
I think that Pork Chop's already worth
all the gold in Fort Knox.

690
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:11,644
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- Oh, I guess not.

691
01:15:17,274 --> 01:15:19,860
You take care of yourself.

692
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,533
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.

693
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:27,701
Whitey, let's go.

694
01:15:38,587 --> 01:15:40,631
I'll see you, Joe.

695
01:16:05,906 --> 01:16:08,200
What do you make the count?

696
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:10,369
25 men, all told.

697
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:21,630
We can't hope to hold all this.
We have to pull in, concentrate.

698
01:16:23,382 --> 01:16:26,343
Try to hold onto this highest bunker,
right here.

699
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:29,430
There's high ground all around it.

700
01:16:31,432 --> 01:16:34,518
We won't have any link with the rear.

701
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:37,521
Hasn't done us much good, anyway.

702
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,621
- Hey, take that with you.
- There's no ammo for it.

703
01:16:53,746 --> 01:16:56,624
The Reds might find some. Take it.

704
01:17:00,169 --> 01:17:03,881
Ain't no use leavin' them behind.
Let 'em out!

705
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:07,635
Sure, why not?

706
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:13,057
It's every hen for herself, girls.
Let's go. Yeah!

707
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:19,355
Come on, soldiers! Up top!

708
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:22,149
Anybody in here?

709
01:17:29,365 --> 01:17:31,408
(man) Don't you move.

710
01:17:32,493 --> 01:17:37,748
I'm aimin' straight at your belly.
What is the countersign?

711
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:40,209
What are you talking about?
There isn't one.

712
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:45,422
The hell there ain't. They gave it to us
before we went up last night.

713
01:17:45,548 --> 01:17:49,510
Now you just say that word or I'll shoot.

714
01:17:49,635 --> 01:17:52,596
- Franklin?
- That's right.

715
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:55,975
But I don't know who you are,
not without that countersign.

716
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,477
But you know I'm no Chinese.
Get out of here.

717
01:17:58,602 --> 01:18:03,190
And serve ten years?
You think I'm stupid.

718
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:07,611
But I ain't that stupid. I could kill you
right now and nobody can call it murder.

719
01:18:07,736 --> 01:18:10,281
- Nobody but you.
- Not even me.

720
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:17,580
Ten years, you say.
Real quick like you say it.

721
01:18:18,497 --> 01:18:22,835
Ten years for what?
Cos I don't wanna die for Korea?

722
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,130
What I care about this stinkin' hill?

723
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:30,551
You oughta see where I live back home.

724
01:18:31,594 --> 01:18:34,805
I sure ain't sure I'd die for that.

725
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:39,059
It's a cinch I ain't gonna die for Korea,
or serve ten years for it, neither.

726
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:51,155
Chances are you're gonna die, like it
or not. So am I, if you shoot me or not.

727
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:55,701
At least we've got a chance to do it
in pretty good company.

728
01:18:55,826 --> 01:18:58,162
A lot of men came up here last night.

729
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:01,332
They don't care any more
about Korea than you do.

730
01:19:01,457 --> 01:19:05,419
A lot of 'em had it
just as rough at home as you did.

731
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:08,047
They came up and fought.

732
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:13,093
There's about... 25 of them left.

733
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:18,015
That's a pretty exclusive club.

734
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:22,269
You can still join up... if you want to.

735
01:19:29,276 --> 01:19:33,781
I'm gonna move, Franklin.
Make up your mind.

736
01:20:07,231 --> 01:20:09,275
They're all up there.

737
01:20:55,738 --> 01:20:58,532
You oughta stay down
in the bunker with the radio.

738
01:20:58,657 --> 01:21:01,952
Payne'll call me if they stop jamming.

739
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:11,921
Hello, GIs.

740
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:18,636
I hope you can hear me loud and clear,
because your very lives depend upon it.

741
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:24,600
I have been ordered to tell you that
you have just 45 minutes to surrender.

742
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:28,521
If you don't, we will attack
in overwhelming force

743
01:21:28,646 --> 01:21:33,108
and it is highly unlikely that
any prisoners will be taken.

744
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:37,363
That is the message.

745
01:21:52,127 --> 01:21:57,133
Now... I'm talking to you
on my own account.

746
01:21:58,843 --> 01:22:01,303
You are brave men.

747
01:22:01,428 --> 01:22:03,931
You have fought a good fight.

748
01:22:05,224 --> 01:22:10,104
I don't want you to die, any more
than I want our own soldiers to die.

749
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:14,024
You have earned the right
to surrender with honour.

750
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:18,821
And I'm glad I have 45 minutes
to persuade you, my way.

751
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,160
You are young, and I am young.

752
01:22:25,828 --> 01:22:29,623
We should be thinking
of long lives ahead of us.

753
01:22:29,748 --> 01:22:31,792
Listen.

754
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,303
(sentimental band music)

755
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,826
Go on, beat it!

756
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:09,622
Why are you hangin' around? You wanna
be made into chicken chow mein?

757
01:23:09,747 --> 01:23:13,542
I heard the Chinese don't eat chow mein.
It's an American invention.

758
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:19,423
You heard wrong. Chop suey's American,
chow mein is Chinese.

759
01:23:19,548 --> 01:23:22,426
I read it in Reader's Digest.

760
01:23:22,551 --> 01:23:24,595
I stand corrected.

761
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:35,815
Doesn't that make you think of
all the things you wanna live for?

762
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,818
Love. Marriage.

763
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:45,074
Why must you die before
you have even begun to live?

764
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:50,996
Think about it.
Just think about it.

765
01:23:52,915 --> 01:23:54,750
I'm thinkin' about it.

766
01:23:59,588 --> 01:24:01,632
43 minutes left.

767
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:05,761
All you have to do is
start walking this way.

768
01:24:07,054 --> 01:24:10,850
Hey, where do you think you're goin'?

769
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,897
Noplace.
Just sittin' on some barbwire, that's all.

770
01:24:30,536 --> 01:24:33,122
I'm gonna try that radio myself.

771
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:37,251
If you get through,
what are you gonna tell 'em?

772
01:24:42,256 --> 01:24:45,718
You think I oughta ask 'em
to pull us off of here?

773
01:24:45,843 --> 01:24:49,472
Let the Chinese walk right in,
blowin' that lousy bugle?

774
01:24:49,597 --> 01:24:51,640
You're the boss, Joe.

775
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:56,520
Doesn't mean I can think straight.

776
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:04,278
I guess I wanna hold this hill...
more than I ever wanted anything.

777
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:07,072
Stinking little garbage heap.

778
01:25:11,035 --> 01:25:13,787
Sir, I got Battalion on, clear as a bell.

779
01:25:22,755 --> 01:25:24,799
Whatever you do...

780
01:25:25,549 --> 01:25:27,593
it's OK with me.

781
01:25:37,895 --> 01:25:39,939
King Six.

782
01:25:44,568 --> 01:25:47,988
Look, uh... I've about 25 men.

783
01:25:49,073 --> 01:25:51,534
They're completely spent.

784
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:57,748
I expect a heavy attack about dark.
That'll be... half an hour from now.

785
01:26:02,127 --> 01:26:06,173
Unless we can be reinforced,
we should be withdrawn. Over.

786
01:26:08,175 --> 01:26:13,013
Clemons says, if they can't be reinforced,
he requests permission to withdraw.

787
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:14,473
Colonel, I know Clemons.

788
01:26:14,598 --> 01:26:19,562
He'd never send this message if he
thought he stood a chance of holding.

789
01:26:19,687 --> 01:26:23,107
- What'll I tell him?
- What can you tell him?

790
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,404
Even Division can't tell him anything
without a decision from higher up.

791
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:36,203
Lieutenant, we can't reinforce and we
have no authority to withdraw you. Out.

792
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:41,542
That's a hell of a way to run a railroad.

793
01:26:52,803 --> 01:26:55,806
Sir, what's the date today?

794
01:26:57,433 --> 01:26:59,477
It's April 17th.

795
01:27:01,896 --> 01:27:04,440
(Chinese PA) 40 minutes left/

796
01:27:04,565 --> 01:27:07,860
To surrender with honour.
40 minutes.

797
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:12,740
What are we talking about?
What are we arguing about?

798
01:27:12,865 --> 01:27:18,621
You know that this insignificant little hill
is of no importance to you or to us.

799
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:22,041
If we can settle on the truce line
to which I thought you had agreed,

800
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:24,585
this hill is in
the middle of the neutral zone.

801
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,671
So how can it be worth any man's life?

802
01:27:27,796 --> 01:27:32,051
Don't you feel some responsibility
towards thousands of...

803
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:58,452
Cigarette?

804
01:28:00,371 --> 01:28:04,875
Sorry. I had to get out of there
before I blew my cork.

805
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,921
They know we're not gonna
reinforce Pork Chop. You can smell it.

806
01:28:09,046 --> 01:28:12,007
And they'll keep us talkin' till they take it.

807
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:14,385
Why?

808
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:17,179
What do they gain if they do?

809
01:28:17,304 --> 01:28:20,766
What do they lose if they don't?

810
01:28:20,891 --> 01:28:23,727
They've gotta succeed or lose face.

811
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:25,896
I'd like to believe that.

812
01:28:26,021 --> 01:28:29,400
I could say, let 'em have their face
and let's get on with the truce.

813
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:33,028
These aren't just Orientals.
They're Communists.

814
01:28:33,154 --> 01:28:38,117
- Why did they pick Pork Chop to attack?
- Thought it'd be an easy nut to crack.

815
01:28:38,242 --> 01:28:43,789
No. I'm beginning to think
they picked it because it's worth nothing.

816
01:28:43,914 --> 01:28:46,959
Its value is that it has no value.

817
01:28:47,084 --> 01:28:50,838
That makes it a test of strength,
pure and simple.

818
01:28:50,963 --> 01:28:55,009
They're willing to spend lives for nothing,
or what seems nothing.

819
01:28:55,134 --> 01:29:01,015
That's what they want to know.
Are we as willing to do that as they are?

820
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:08,981
That's some question.

821
01:29:41,222 --> 01:29:43,432
(Chinese PA) Two minutes left/

822
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:45,601
Still time to live.

823
01:29:49,355 --> 01:29:53,150
Hold your fire to the very end.
Make it count.

824
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:57,029
Hold your fire.

825
01:30:13,212 --> 01:30:18,884
I'm goin' up to the top for a look-see,
so don't get trigger-happy.

826
01:30:23,764 --> 01:30:25,808
One minute/

827
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:32,022
Don't fail me, my friends.
Don't fail yourselves.

828
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:35,359
This is your last chance.

829
01:30:37,486 --> 01:30:39,530
(single fanfare)

830
01:30:53,502 --> 01:30:56,380
(multiple fanfare and shouting)

831
01:31:00,384 --> 01:31:04,305
Listen at 'em.
Sounds like all China's comin'.

832
01:31:05,389 --> 01:31:07,433
Call for flares.

833
01:31:09,393 --> 01:31:12,813
Blue, this is King.
Blue, this is King.

834
01:32:31,517 --> 01:32:33,561
Hey, Joe!

835
01:32:37,106 --> 01:32:41,902
Saw some men coming.
I think it's the rest of Love Company.

836
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,907
Sir? Sir, Battalion is on.

837
01:32:49,785 --> 01:32:51,287
King Six. Over.

838
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:56,041
You've got to hold out.
Reinforcements are on the way.

839
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:59,879
The advance element should be there
just about now. Repeat.

840
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:03,090
Hold out a while longer.
Reinforcements are on the way.

841
01:33:03,215 --> 01:33:06,886
The leading elements
should be there about now. Over.

842
01:33:07,011 --> 01:33:08,846
There's no more ammunition, sir.

843
01:33:08,971 --> 01:33:12,766
They're coming down behind us!
Everywhere!

844
01:33:12,892 --> 01:33:16,562
Sir, they're behind us, everywhere.
A million of 'em.

845
01:33:16,687 --> 01:33:20,274
All right, plug up these holes.
Sandbags!

846
01:33:22,735 --> 01:33:24,862
(shouting)

847
01:33:48,219 --> 01:33:51,096
- Welcome to the club.
- Some club!

848
01:33:52,848 --> 01:33:57,478
- Somebody give me a hand!
- Hold that door a minute.

849
01:34:02,733 --> 01:34:05,069
Hurry up, hurry up, inside!

850
01:34:18,582 --> 01:34:20,626
- Hurry!
- Come on!

851
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:25,965
More!

852
01:34:39,937 --> 01:34:41,564
A flame-thrower!

853
01:34:44,316 --> 01:34:46,360
Get 'em in there!

854
01:34:49,446 --> 01:34:51,991
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

855
01:34:54,076 --> 01:34:56,120
Come on, look lively!

856
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:04,795
Come on, come on!

857
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,424
- Hurry!
- Come on!

858
01:35:11,343 --> 01:35:13,387
(shrieking)

859
01:35:55,262 --> 01:35:59,266
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- They're GIs!

860
01:35:59,391 --> 01:36:02,478
Get 'em all down!
Open that door!

861
01:36:06,357 --> 01:36:09,652
- Let's get outta here!
- Come on, move!

862
01:36:10,736 --> 01:36:12,988
Let me out!
Let me out!

863
01:36:56,615 --> 01:36:58,909
(Clemons) Pork Chop Hill was held,

864
01:36:59,034 --> 01:37:02,746
bought and paid for
at the same price we commemorate

865
01:37:02,872 --> 01:37:07,376
in monuments at Bunker Hill
and Gettysburg.

866
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:11,130
Yet you will find no monuments
on Pork Chop.

867
01:37:11,255 --> 01:37:17,428
Victory is a fragile thing and history
does not linger long in our century.

868
01:37:17,553 --> 01:37:23,684
But those who fought there know
what they did, and the meaning of it.

869
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:28,647
Millions live in freedom today
because of what they did.
