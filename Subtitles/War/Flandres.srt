1
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,231
Shit!

2
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,555
Fuck!

3
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,030
Andre!

4
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,155
What?

5
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Where are you?

6
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:15,756
Here.

7
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,230
How's it going?

8
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,125
Okay.

9
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,991
Had your letter?

10
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,479
Yeah, Monday.

11
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
You're leaving Monday?.

12
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:25,277
Yeah.

13
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,676
That's okay, then.

14
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,360
Pleased?. Not pleased?.

15
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:35,349
Pleased.

16
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,953
So where's the war you're off to?

17
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,517
You don't know?.

18
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,039
Right.

19
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,645
Bye.

20
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,033
- I'm off.
- See you.

21
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,357
Andre. What are you doing?

22
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,948
Having a walk.

23
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,516
Seen Denis?.

24
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,635
He stopped by.

25
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,150
Had your letter?.

26
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,559
Yeah, I leave Monday.

27
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,593
How about that walk, then?

28
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,949
Let's go.

29
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,509
Bye.

30
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,629
- See you later.
- Yeah.

31
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,875
See you later.
I'll come with France.

32
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,669
Hey, Barbe!

33
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,311
There's nothing to keep me here.

34
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,513
I can leave.

35
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,109
What about me?.

36
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,839
Exactly.

37
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,597
I need money to live with you.

38
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,671
Are you two a couple?.

39
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,591
No, just friends.

40
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,589
We've known each other since
we were kids.

41
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,873
Her farm's near mine.

42
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,789
You're neighbors?. Got a farm too?

43
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,233
I thought you were a couple.

44
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,555
No...

45
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,834
Which regiment are you with?

46
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,750
The third.

47
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,475
Me too. That makes two of us.

48
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,476
You're not scared of dying?
Or of killing innocents?.

49
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,836
There are innocents in every war.

50
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,638
Children are always killed.

51
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,951
Okay?.

52
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,085
Yes.

53
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,429
You've been watching me.
Want a drink?

54
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,680
You've been watching me too.

55
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:58,590
- I have?.
- Yes.

56
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,352
You watch me, I watch you.

57
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,158
Got no time for a drink?.

58
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,725
Not really, no.

59
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,558
I've got my car outside.
Want a ride home?

60
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,398
Yeah, okay, you're on.

61
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,712
Guys usually do the picking up.

62
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,231
Come on, we'll drive you back.

63
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,391
Okay?. My name's Blondel.

64
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,149
You recognize me?.

65
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,673
I was at the bar.

66
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,314
Yeah, I recognize you.

67
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,799
Barbe said you're leaving

68
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,869
Yeah.

69
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,234
What regiment are you with?

70
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,514
The third.

71
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,520
We'll be together then?

72
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,805
Maybe.

73
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,068
- All the best.
- Yeah.

74
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,789
You know everyone's calling you a slut?

75
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,195
Don't you have any morals?

76
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,039
- Hey, Demester!
- Yeah.

77
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,439
Who lit the fire?.

78
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,509
A farmer.

79
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,509
It warms you up.

80
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,235
You're not worried, leaving the farm?

81
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,469
No.

82
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,160
But... Will he look after your animals?

83
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,309
I'm not worried.

84
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,273
I'll get some more branches.

85
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,111
- Set the trunks straight.
- What?

86
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,155
The trunks.

87
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,274
Got another beer?

88
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,349
A beer?.

89
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,069
Catch!

90
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,114
- I'm Mordacq.
- Hi.

91
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,390
I'm France.

92
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,509
Sit down.

93
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,555
This is great.

94
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,989
Are you okay?

95
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,675
Is something wrong?

96
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,233
I don't want you to leave.

97
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,035
We'll come back.

98
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,638
Remembered your gun?.

99
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,393
Are you ready, Demester?

100
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,716
Yeah.

101
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,992
Look at him with his pack.

102
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,950
Come on,

103
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,155
they're waiting for us.

104
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,391
Let's go, chief!

105
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,750
Yes, chief!

106
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,269
Debecker?

107
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,349
Present!

108
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,438
- Dune?.
- Yeah!

109
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,636
- Blondel?.
- Yeah.

110
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,959
- Mordacq?.
- Yeah.

111
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,600
- Denis.
- Yeah.

112
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,033
Demester?

113
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,435
Demester?

114
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,759
- Dune?.
- Yeah!

115
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,674
- Demester?.
- Yeah!

116
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,669
Mordacq?

117
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,599
Dune?.

118
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,593
- Blondel?.
- Yeah.

119
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,396
Steed?

120
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,197
Dung?.

121
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,115
Come on.

122
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,830
Come on.

123
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,995
Denis...

124
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,509
Okay, Barbe?

125
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,833
- Fine. And you?.
- Fine.

126
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,845
What's up?.

127
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,189
I'm going to my father-in-law's.
And you?

128
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,754
I'm heading home.

129
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,517
Can we walk together?

130
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,828
If you want.

131
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,471
Heard from your boyfriend?.

132
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,045
Which boyfriend?.

133
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,116
That last one you had, just recently.

134
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,391
He's gone away with the others.

135
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,754
He's gone away...

136
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,485
Aren't you going?

137
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,034
No, I'm too old and I don't want to.

138
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,953
I don't want to go.

139
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,508
So you're all on your own now?

140
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,314
Why?.

141
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,754
Perhaps we could go out together?

142
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,512
You've got a nerve!

143
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,432
I don't waste time.

144
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,760
- You want me, is that it?
- Yes. So?

145
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,514
You want me, is that it?

146
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,919
Why not?.

147
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,033
You're trying, right?

148
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,996
Yeah...

149
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,070
I can try my luck.

150
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,073
Anyhow, I can't, Denis.

151
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,069
Why?. Are you sick?

152
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,878
Yeah, that's right. I'm sick.

153
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,430
You can go out with me but that's all.

154
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,354
See, it's not very interesting.

155
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,234
Too bad.

156
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,714
I'll be going.

157
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,469
Right...

158
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,478
- I'll see you.
- See you.

159
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,676
Okay?.

160
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,219
Go on, Briche, slaughter him!

161
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:45,278
Hurry up, Briche. We're going.

162
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,553
We're going to wash, Briche.

163
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,231
Stop!

164
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,277
and I'll waste you!

165
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,396
Tough fight.

166
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,915
What was that?

167
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,754
Say it in French.

168
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,353
I didn't say anything.

169
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,471
I hope not.

170
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,915
He didn't say anything.

171
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,874
Steady...

172
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,276
Okay?.

173
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,793
Fuck, it's hot.

174
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,960
Fuck, they're firing at us!

175
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,679
Fucking bastards!

176
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,351
We move out in an hour.

177
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,555
Yes, sir!

178
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,913
When was the town bombed?

179
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,035
Yesterday.

180
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,473
We need to check it out.

181
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,435
You should be okay to the west of it.

182
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,793
Let me get you a beer.

183
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,469
I've got nothing.

184
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,713
No! I've got nothing.

185
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,725
Get lost!

186
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,398
Go on, get lost!

187
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,710
Dismount! Get to cover!

188
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,118
They're shooting at us!

189
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,350
Fucking get to cover!

190
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,151
Cease fire, for fuck's sake!

191
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,230
Got him.

192
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,752
Gimenez, Briche...

193
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,154
Demester, Leclercq...

194
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,149
Get down!

195
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,996
Shit, the cunt hasn't finished!

196
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,190
Get down!

197
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,909
Fuck, they're kids!

198
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Drop it, I said!

199
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:06,876
Shut up!

200
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,999
- Fucking hell! Fuck!
- Fuck!

201
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,039
Fucking hell! Fuck!

202
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,113
Fuck!

203
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,949
Let's pull out, guys.

204
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,150
Shut it!

205
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,316
Shut it!

206
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,875
Shut it!

207
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,717
Shut it!

208
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,349
Shut it!

209
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,750
Shut it!

210
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,195
Shut your mouth!

211
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,445
Shut the fuck up!

212
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,680
Mordacq, let go of him!

213
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:44,908
Shut it!

214
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,434
Shut it!

215
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,795
Let go!

216
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,195
He's dying anyway.

217
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,310
Okay?.

218
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,230
Yeah.

219
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,558
You're looking odd.

220
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,868
I'm tired.

221
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,718
So... have you written to Blondel?

222
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,759
Yeah, I wrote to him.

223
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,000
But I'm not keeping it.

224
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:44,672
Okay. And him?.

225
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,637
He won't know. I'll say I lost it.

226
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,791
It's not too late?.

227
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,158
No, I asked around.
I can do it Belgium.

228
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,475
You know,
I don't really want to have kids.

229
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,755
What shall we do?.

230
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,791
I'm going to have a smoke.
Coming?

231
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,360
Did you watch TV last night?.

232
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,392
No, I've stopped watching.

233
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,110
There's no change anyway.

234
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,355
It's nice here.

235
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,197
You know what I fancy?

236
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,915
What?.

237
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,310
Is she a soldier?.

238
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,433
Look at this, lads!

239
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,237
Go on...

240
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,510
Hold her other hand.

241
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,039
Go for it.

242
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,791
Hold her other hand.

243
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,230
Spread her legs.

244
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,996
Hold her other hand.

245
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,439
Hold her other hand.

246
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,605
Your turn.

247
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,438
- Go on, Demester.
- Hurry it up!

248
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,750
Spread her legs.

249
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,996
We'll rest here but stay on your guard.

250
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,511
Is it different if she was a soldier?

251
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,354
What did you say?.

252
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,590
How is it different?.

253
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,193
It's not. A hole's a hole.

254
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,837
What the hell do care?.
You didn't fuck her.

255
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,351
I'm just asking. Blondel said.

256
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,188
Shut your mouth, okay.

257
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,276
- Learning it by heart?.
- Yeah.

258
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,759
Had any news?.

259
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,273
Barbe's expecting a kid.

260
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,353
Your kid?.

261
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,078
Yeah, from my balls.

262
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,080
You're expecting a kid?.

263
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,149
Yeah, mate.

264
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,835
The fastest gun in the West!

265
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,989
Shut up.

266
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,034
Hey, Leclercq...

267
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,193
Are you queer?.

268
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,719
He proved that earlier!

269
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,077
Only natural we should wonder.

270
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,949
He likes men.

271
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,474
What the fuck's that?

272
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,796
We stay here.

273
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,276
Leclercq!

274
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,909
Let's go!

275
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,873
- Hey, Briche.
- What?

276
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,552
We should've waited.

277
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,870
Why?. We waited for them all night.

278
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,109
They got caught, that's all.

279
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,789
And we pull out.

280
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,350
Yes, we pull out.
I'll belt you one, you wanker!

281
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,470
Go and find them
if you want or shut up!

282
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,075
Stop!

283
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,509
Stop!

284
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,429
Leclercq, search him.

285
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,654
Briche, he's armed!

286
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:15,708
Down on your knees!

287
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,630
Down on your knees!

288
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,277
What's this?.

289
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,998
Where are the others?.
Where are they?

290
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,220
Where's the gun from?

291
01:00:28,255 --> 01:00:31,360
Where are the others?

292
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,509
Get up!

293
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,798
Get out of here!

294
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,680
Move it! Get out of here!

295
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:40,999
Turn round!

296
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,757
Turn round! Get out of here!

297
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,916
Hey, Blondel...

298
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,005
What did they do?

299
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,632
Punched me in the face.

300
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,233
- Fucker!
- And Mordacq?

301
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,753
- And Briche?.
- Dead.

302
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,710
Fuck...

303
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,954
That hurts!

304
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,153
Fucking stop it!

305
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,439
I didn't do anything!

306
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,236
"ll go and see your dad. Goodbye.

307
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,713
- Psychiatric hospital?.
- Yes.

308
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,990
First the mother, now the daughter.

309
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,392
She'll be better off in hospital.

310
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,548
She'll be well looked after.

311
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,118
Shall I get the ambulance
sent this afternoon?

312
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,036
Thank you.

313
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,633
Mr. Dethoor... It's going to be all right.

314
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,752
You heard what the doctor said?

315
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,189
Sit down.

316
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,071
You can wait here, Barbe.
I won't be long.

317
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,549
Miss Dethoor?.

318
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,670
Hello.

319
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,196
You have an appointment
with Dr Mondrian.

320
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,118
Bastard!

321
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,429
Fucking shrink!

322
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,919
Cunt!

323
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,833
I'll fuck you!

324
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,239
Patricia!

325
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,392
Calm down!

326
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,759
Calm down!

327
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,836
It's over.

328
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,035
It's over now.

329
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,516
There, it's over now.

330
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,635
It's over now.

331
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,473
It's over now.

332
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,910
Come on, let's go!

333
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,598
Let's go!

334
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,365
My legs!

335
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,392
No, don't leave me!

336
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,708
Don't leave me!

337
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,079
They got killed then?

338
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,991
You heard I was in hospital?

339
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,869
For my nerves.

340
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,471
You hadn't known him long.

341
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,674
It's not that.

342
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,959
You can't understand.

343
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,756
Come on.

344
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,796
Barbe!

345
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,828
Andre, you're back?

346
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,796
Yeah.

347
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,756
Go on.

348
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,150
Andre!

349
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,400
Can I have a word?

350
01:17:10,435 --> 01:17:11,116
Yeah.

351
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,879
Tell me about it.

352
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:16,916
It's not easy.

353
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,555
It was hell back there.

354
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,914
Come on, Andre.

355
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,438
How did Blondel die?

356
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,191
Answer me! How did he die?

357
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,508
A bullet in the head.

358
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,909
You're lying!

359
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,400
I saw. I was there!

360
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:44,897
I know everything!

361
01:19:44,932 --> 01:19:46,359
I know what you did!

362
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,592
You killed peasants and you left him behind
because he got me pregnant!

363
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,035
You want me but you won't have me!

364
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,439
You'll never have me!

365
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:37,990
What are you doing?

366
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,036
Nothing.

367
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,919
I'm off to Michel's.

368
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,910
Dad!

369
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,435
I'll come with you.

370
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,869
You were right.

371
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,833
I left him behind.

372
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,077
I'm a bastard.

373
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,956
Come on.

374
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,710
I love you.

375
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,914
Me too.

376
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:16,752
I love you, Barbe.

377
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,949
I love you.
