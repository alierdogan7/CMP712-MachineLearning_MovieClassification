00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,608
And the added gene might not
be one that I've identified

180
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,110
as of yet.

181
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,711
So you don't really have an answer

182
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,679
for what's going wrong?

183
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:56,715
I'm still trying to figure out
what the right questions are.

184
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,650
You've gotta be kidding me.

185
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:01,720
This is all part of the scientific process.

186
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,522
You heard what I told the crew earlier.

187
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,291
I did, and I kinda wish you
hadn't been so optimistic.

188
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,161
- Really?
- I said that I was ready to test.

189
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,396
I did not say that I had the vaccine.

190
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,199
You brought tea. You said you
would've brought champagne.

191
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,368
I am making progress.

192
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,902
It doesn't seem like it.

193
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,370
The biggest breakthroughs
almost always come

194
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,672
after the most enormous setbacks.

195
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,674
You just need to be patient.

196
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:25,409
[Sighs deeply] And how
you gonna dispose of them?

197
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,145
They're going to need
to be tossed overboard.

198
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,313
I can't leave them there rotting.

199
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,516
[Exhales deeply]

200
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,755
Do it at night.

201
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,156
Flight deck.

202
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:42,092
If anyone asks,

203
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:45,663
just tell them that's hazardous waste...

204
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:48,032
Which is what it is.

205
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,997
Slattery: There's no way they all died.

206
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,698
Chandler: Six for six. [Sighs deeply]

207
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,568
- She has no idea why.
- Jesus.

208
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,570
I thought you said she had it.

209
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,439
Apparently it's a little
more complicated than that.

210
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:05,373
She's got 28 more, right?

211
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,076
And if she keeps testing six at a time,

212
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,712
it might not leave her much wiggle room.

213
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:12,314
I don't wanna burn any more
fuel or time moving towards home

214
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:15,084
when we may be turning around
and heading back to Nicaragua.

215
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,152
So we're stopping the ship.

216
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,887
Well, the closer we get to home,

217
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,090
the harder it's gonna be on
everyone if we reverse course.

218
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,691
We just told everyone

219
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,727
she's on the verge of having the vaccine.

220
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,229
Now what are we saying?

221
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,797
She's gonna be discreet

222
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,734
with how she disposes of the monkeys.

223
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,609
Well, I'm good with that.

224
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,278
If we go dead in the water without a plan,

225
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,746
people are gonna start
scratching their heads

226
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:45,462
and chattering.

227
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:47,915
We just have to stall for a couple days,

228
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,851
just until we know what we're dealing with.

229
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,685
Yes, sir.

230
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,421
Sir.

231
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,624
Quincy: Any idea why the
captain stopped the ship?

232
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,926
The officers are just trying
to figure out where to go

233
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:00,261
to make the vaccine.

234
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,196
Really?

235
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,597
Well, they don't wanna waste fuel

236
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:06,033
going in the wrong direction now.

237
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,569
That's odd,

238
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,905
because the only possible
places which could

239
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,775
accommodate the manufacturing
are in North America.

240
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,242
Well, maybe they're thinking about

241
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:18,011
going to Brazil or Venezuela.

242
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm sure they got labs there.

243
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,447
Brazil and Venezuela were

244
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,483
the hottest zones in this hemisphere.

245
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:28,255
What does heat have to do with it?

246
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,090
Hot zones, <i>Bacon.</i>

247
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,792
98% death rates.

248
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,894
There is no way anchoring south of here

249
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:37,330
could even be contemplated,
and Dr. Scott knows it.

250
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm sure there's somewhere else.

251
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,036
Puerto Rico has a lab.

252
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,771
But would the captain
wanna go anywhere near there

253
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:49,141
when Ruskov may still be
somewhere off the Cuban coast?

254
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,911
Something's wrong, Bacon.
Let me assure you.

255
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,445
Wrong how?

256
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,748
Dr. Scott's experiments must be failing.

257
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,751
Well, you said yourself that
they should be using you.

258
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,054
If they were really failing,
don't you think they would be?

259
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,323
Your captain's a stubborn man.

260
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,458
He hates to admit he's
wrong, and as a result,

261
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,393
the wrong people get punished.

262
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,964
He just about tore a hole in
the hull evading the Russians

263
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,166
because he didn't wanna share
the ingredients for the vaccine.

264
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,634
Then he almost got everyone killed

265
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,369
when the water filtration broke.

266
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,139
That crazy stunt with the parachutes...

267
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,709
Nobody's knows what's
happening until it's over.

268
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,785
I speak the truth, Bacon.

269
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,488
Whether or not you want to
hear it is another matter,

270
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,357
but your captain is
hiding something from you.

271
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,758
[Chess piece thuds]

272
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,707
[Water splashes]

273
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,347
You're relieved, my man.

274
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,851
Anything?

275
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,686
Not a peep.

276
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,059
Think we're really the only ones left?

277
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,528
Russians are still out there somewhere.

278
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,368
[Water splashes]

279
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,073
[Water splashes]

280
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,474
What the hell is she doin'?

281
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:35,044
[Water splashes]

282
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,283
[Water splashes]

283
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,051
Chandler: She killed six more.

284
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,986
This time, it only took four hours.

285
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,521
How did that happen?

286
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,088
She tried something different.
[Sighs deeply]

287
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,157
She's obviously going
in the wrong direction.

288
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,591
Do we need to bring in Quincy?

289
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,327
Maybe she needs another set of hands.

290
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,663
Well, she said "no." [Exhales deeply]

291
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,399
He's not gonna be able to
help much at this point.

292
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,968
- Well, does she have a game plan?
- She's modifying

293
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,304
and experimenting.

294
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,638
That's all she can tell me.

295
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,706
Keep me posted.

296
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,275
I heard blood comes out
of, like, every orifice.

297
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:10,645
- Dude, come on.
- What?

298
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:13,414
We saw shit at Gitmo, and it wasn't pretty.

299
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,749
You saw a live one?

300
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,818
No, man, they were dead, but...

301
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Rats were chowing down on their bodies.

302
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,120
It was disgusting.

303
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,222
I hope those C.B.R. suits really work.

304
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:24,291
Man: Of course they work.

305
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,393
Yeah, but when we were at Gitmo,
we never even put our masks on.

306
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,228
It was just the protocol,
man, to save the oxygen.

307
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,730
And when you got near those
sick people in Nicaragua,

308
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,199
how long did it take to get your masks on?

309
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:35,402
Jesus! Will you fellas just relax?

310
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,104
Nobody got exposed,

311
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,973
and the lady doc gave us a
test when we got back on board.

312
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,075
- Now are we gonna play cards or what?
- [Poker chips clink]

313
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,345
Seven-card stud. Deuces and
one-eyed jacks are wild.

314
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:47,165
- Wild cards? Where you from, man?
- [Laughs]

315
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,248
Would've thought you were
more of a purist, Tex.

316
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,683
Ain't nothing about me that's pure.

317
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:53,019
I thought you'd figure that out by now.

318
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,687
Hey! Look what the cat dragged in.

319
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,323
[Speaks indistinctly]

320
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,493
You all right, sir?

321
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:02,528
Yeah, I just...

322
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,365
Oh! Whoa! Sir!

323
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,967
- Man, he looks bad.
- Sir!

324
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,469
Tex: You all right?

325
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,069
No! Hey, hey, hey! Stay away from him.

326
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:13,672
Hey, buddy? Buddy? You all right?

327
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,774
I thought you said he got tested.

328
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,710
- [Door opens]
- We got a game going on.

329
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:20,112
- Get outta here now!
- Talk to me.

330
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,681
All right, look at me. Look at me.

331
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,684
[Exhales sharply]

332
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:31,405
Woman over P.A.: Medical emergency.
Medical emergency.

333

<i>Medical emergency in department 12545L.</i>

334
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,134
<i>Crew lounge. Medical response team provide.</i>

335
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:39,807
How is he?

336
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,473
Sir, you shouldn't be in
here. You need a suit on.

337
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,977
He's not infected. What happened?

338
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,447
He came in looking for water.
He passed out. He is burning up.

339
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,947
Danny?

340
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,781
- Danny, can you hear me?
- [Whispering] Yeah.

341
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,084
Danny, how long have you
been feeling like this?

342
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,420
Just a few... just...

343
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,814
That's all right. I'm
gonna take care of you.

344
00:15:57,814 --> 00:15:58,457
[Coughs]

345
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,125
You're gonna be just fine.
It's just a fever.

346
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,059
[Coughs]

347
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,562
[Grunts] Do I have it?

348
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,531
No, you do not have the virus.

349
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,966
- Let's get him up.
- Little help here.

350
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:18,208
You have to understand, if
this is airborne or blood-borne,

351
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,210
we will all be infected.

352
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,780
The most likely scenario is
that he was bitten by an insect.

353
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,751
In which case, he will not be contagious.

354
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,255
Holy shit, doc. Is it Halloween?

355
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,323
Did you actually walk down
the P-way wearing that?

356
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,449
[Filtered voice] It's
for everyone's safety.

357
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:35,910
- We should all be wearing them.
- Don't you get it?

358
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,130
If Lieutenant Green has
it, we're all dead anyway.

359
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,899
Everyone just needs to stop panicking.

360
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:47,470
How long will it take to run a blood panel?

361
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,306
Four to six hours for the first set.

362
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,942
- If nothing pops up, it could take longer.
- Do it.

363
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,978
Something's not right here.

364
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,346
What do you mean?

365
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,482
Me and Cossetti saw her
dumping biohazard bags

366
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:00,916
off the flight deck.

367
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:02,285
And where the hell is she
heading with the captain

368
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,952
- in such a rush?
- I don't know.

369
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:07,356
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
Nobody knows anything.

370
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,024
This will keep him sedated.

371
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,160
It'll lower his fever and rehydrate him.

372
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,962
I'll be back to replace the
bag in a couple of hours.

373
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,831
<i>Rachel: I will do it.</i>

374
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,800
You just find out what is
actually wrong with him.

375
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:27,609
- [Door closes]
- Sir, you need to lockdown the ship.

376
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,080
No, he does not. I tested
everyone before we boarded.

377
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:32,681
That was two days ago.

378
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,683
I mean, maybe the virus
hadn't taken hold yet.

379
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,720
It doesn't work like that.
If he'd been exposed,

380
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,787
it would present itself in
his blood within a few hours,

381
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,288
if not a few minutes.

382
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,224
All right, everybody. Let's
put our panties back on

383
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,860
and see how we can help our friend.

384
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:50,297
You said the virus mutates.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,534
How do you know the strain in Nicaragua

386
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,536
isn't different from the
other ones you've seen?

387
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,040
Even if it was,

388
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,708
its essential core would be the same,

389
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,011
and that is what I test for.

390
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,812
But what if you're wrong?

391
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:08,181
The mistakes that I made with the vaccine

392
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:11,218
are an entirely different matter.

393
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,486
That was an experiment.

394
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,656
This test I am certain of 100%.

395
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,258
Sir, every minute we wait

396
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,726
is a minute people are
walking around the ship,

397
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,761
- spreading their germs.
- [Sighs deeply]

398

This is the X.O.

400
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,943
We're gonna have to take precautions.

401
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:40,045
Assume the worst until we learn more.

402
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,615
Circle William, set boundaries.

403

Until Doc Rios gets us more answers,

405
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,052
I don't wanna take any chances.

406
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:49,088
I can't leave the crew lounge.

407
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,390
You're gonna have to make the call.

408
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,732
- [Beep]

00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:04,569

[Beeping continues]

421
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,530
What the hell are you doing in here?!

422
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,798
If he has it, I have it.

423
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,266
We had lunch together, sir.

424
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,683
<i>Put this on. Now.</i>

425
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,124
She was throwing biohazard
bags overboard. At night!

426
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:05,261
If she dumps at night, it's
because she's working at night.

427
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,896
Then why is the lab under armed guard?

428
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,231
How come nobody can know
what's going on in there?

429
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:09,765
It is a biohazard area.

430
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,200
We know she's testing the
vaccine on the monkeys.

431
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:13,135
Is it working or not?

432
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:14,837
Is it working? Look, for all we know,

433
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,172
it's infected monkeys she's
been throwing overboard,

434
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,940
and that's what spreading
the disease everywhere.

435
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,277
Everyone calm down. The disease
is not spreading anywhere!

- Before,

when you were arguing with the captain,

443
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,500
you said you made some
mistakes with the vaccine.

444
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:25,939
We thought it was going
in the right direction.

Will you alert the X.O., please?

- Thank you, doctor.
- [Hangs up receiver]

451

It's dengue fever,

and it's not contagious.

453
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,867
What does that mean? Is
he gonna be all right?

454
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:58,337
The only treatment is fluid replacement

455
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,704
and acetaminophen for the fever.

456
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,772
The next 24 hours is crucial.

457
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,609
You gentlemen are dismissed.

00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,611
Now get some rest.

The biological threat has been disproved.

464

There is no biological threat.

- Well...

471
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:47,683
Now I know why he insisted on
being on that vessel with you.

472
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,452
Yes, sir.

473
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,287
And you were late that night.

474
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,990
Sir?

475
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,326
The timing was off to
impact with the <i>vyreni.</i>

476
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,796
What happened, lieutenant?

477
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,599
He slowed down, sir.

478
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,300
He wanted me to jump too early.

479
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,937
Because he was more concerned
about you than the mission.

480
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:14,010
We almost ran into the
coral waiting on you.

481
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:16,077
And now here you are,

482
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,379
possibly infected by the disease.

483
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,880
Running around the ship,

484
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,315
exposing everyone else to get to him.

485
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:27,020
You took an oath,

486
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:30,657
and you have a duty to your shipmates.

487
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:46,440
I'll have the doc come
back and relieve you.

488
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:49,576
I'm pretty sure you're
anxious to get back to the lab.

489
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:52,846
Captain.

490
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:01,521
I know that I kept things
from you in the Arctic,

491
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,323
but I thought that we understood

492
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,391
that we were in this together now.

493
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:08,561
And I will always be straight with you.

494
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:11,064
When I don't know, I will say it.

495
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,799
And when I say that I am

496
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,201
- absolutely 100% about something...
- I don't know you.

497
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:20,607
But I've risked <i>everything</i> for you,

498
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,041
killed for you,

499
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,577
lost men for you,

500
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:29,015

their backs on their families,

<i>for you.</i>

502
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:33,419
Not for me, captain.

503
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:34,954
For the human race.

504
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,723
I just happen to be who you're stuck with.

505
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,326
You might wanna figure
out a way how to trust me,

506
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,794
or I have a pretty strong feeling

507
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:43,496
that this whole thing is gonna fail.

508
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,522
Cossetti saw Dr. Scott
dumping biohazard off the deck.

509
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,324
No, I'm quite sure that was the monkeys.

510
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:04,158
Her vaccine is failing,

511
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,528
and the captain is covering it up.

512
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,164
So... those monkeys were infected?

513
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,666
Of course.

514
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,134
She's injecting them with the virus

515
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,102
to see if her vaccine is working.

516
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:16,670
And when it doesn't, they die.

517
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:20,208
Do you think that's why
captain called for the lockdown?

518
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,044
It sounds to me the captain
feared an outbreak on the ship.

519
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,511
Because of the monkeys?

520
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,147
Or because he doesn't trust her test.

521
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,515
Don't forget a bunch of
them were directly exposed

522
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:31,018
to the disease in Nicaragua.

523
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,854
But they wore the suits.

524
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:35,622
So did Frankie Benz, and
he didn't make it back.

525
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:37,825
Accidents happen.

526
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,260
I imagine you're not the only one

527
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,161
feeling out of sorts about all this.

528
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:44,498
No. There's a lot of grumbling.

At the beginning of this epidemic,

safest place on earth.

be further from the truth.

Their enlistments are up... All 16 of them.

597
00:28:57,955 --> 00:28:59,521
And since we didn't uphold them,

598
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:02,390
technically, they're not
even in the Navy anymore.

599
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,459
I didn't know what to tell them.

600
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:06,494
Are you suggesting we let them go?

601
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,663
How do you think they'll feel
if we try to stop-loss them?

602
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,998
It'll mean holding them against their will.

603
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,901
I mean, we're not El Toro.

604
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:16,604
And what kind of message will
that send the rest of the crew?

605
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:19,107
They can just leave when
things get uncomfortable?

606
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:22,910
Well, we all knew this
moment might come, didn't we?

607
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,176
So what did the master chief say?

608
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:43,678
He said he'd bring a
request to the captain.

609
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,713
- You didn't mention me?
- Not yet, no.

You save that for the last possible moment.

611
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:49,216
I don't see why he would ever let you go.

612
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:51,385
Because you can't survive
on land without me.

613
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:53,854
You make that painfully clear,

614
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:56,490
and at that point, the
captain will have no choice.

615
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:59,693
It will all blow up in our
faces if he keeps us here.

00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:13,562
of 99 different substrains
of the virus in their vaccine.

705
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:17,132
But each and every time, the mice died,

706
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:18,901
until finally,

707
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:21,403
on the 100th attempt,

708
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:23,171
they found it.

709
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:27,242
I don't have the answers today,

710
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,144
and I may not have them tomorrow.

711
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,480
But I can promise you this...

712
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:37,219
There's absolutely nothing
that will stop me until I do.

713
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,823
It's easy to believe in people

714
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:43,858
when they're succeeding.

715
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:48,062
But that's not what we're about.

716
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,066
We have to believe in
each other when we fail.

717
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,368
And if we have to go back to
Nicaragua for more monkeys,

718
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,903
we will.

719
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,605
If we have to go to Puerto Rico, we will.

720
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:00,942
If we have to go Bangladesh
to find a Bengal tiger,

721
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:03,210
that is what we will do.

722
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:05,179
<i>Now what I can promise you</i>

723
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:06,648
is that whatever we do from here on in,

724
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,582
we will do together.

725
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,418
And the chiefs and officers on this ship

726
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,920
will share with you what
we know... good or bad.

727
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,392
Now...

728
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:22,863
It has come to my attention

729
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:24,597
that there's a group of you

730
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,400
who may no longer wanna
continue on with this mission.

731
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:30,937
Your enlistments are up.

732
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,738
I will not hold you here.

733
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
As a matter of fact,

734
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:37,543
you are owed our gratitude
for your services.

735
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:42,414
And we have calculated what
you are collectively entitled to

736
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:44,550
in back pay...

737
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:49,088
$148,678.

738
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,458
Enough to buy you one used
R.H.I.B. with a full tank,

739
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,296
plus food, water, and medical supplies.

740
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,933
We have determined to set a
course towards home... again.

741
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:07,439
But for those of you who
still wish to leave us,

742
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:10,542
report to the fo'c'sle tomorrow at 0700.

743
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,877
Your boat will be waiting.

744
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:26,423
Hey, Commodore. Cubano?

745
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,229
Our girl was impressive.

746
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:37,000
Hard thing to come back from...[Sighs]

747
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,236
When you lose somebody's trust.

748
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:42,172
Well, I'd follow you
into the gates of hell.

749
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:45,708
[Chuckles] That's only 'cause
you think it'd be exciting.

750
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,676
[Chuckles] Well, there is that.

751
00:37:47,678 --> 00:37:51,513
It's just 16 guys, you know.

752
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:52,849
We can do without 'em.

753
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,017
Until the next group wants to leave.

754
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,953
We'll deal with that then.

755
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,188
[Sighs] This is the test.

756
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,758
If they go,

757
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,760
hope goes with 'em.

758
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:17,897
<i>[Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.]</i>

759
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,374
They're here.

760
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,037
Sir...

761
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,773
We all respectfully request to reenlist.

762
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,978
Men: I swear to support and defend

763
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,513
the constitution of the
United States of America

764
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,115
against all enemies, foreign or domestic,

765
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:50,653
that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

766
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,220
And that I will obey the orders

767
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,189
of the president of the United States

768
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,992
and the orders of the
officers appointed over me,

769
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,627
according to the regulations

770
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,796
and the uniform code of military justice,

771
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,198
so help me God.

772
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,302
[Clears throat]

773
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:10,438
[Monitor beeping steadily]

774
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,474
His fever's down. He's on the mend.

775
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:16,878
Can I have the room?

776
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,881
Aye, sir.

777
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:30,958
He's one of the best I've served with.

778
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:34,227
A true leader.

779
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:35,929
He is.

780
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,798
Doesn't mean I'm not gonna hand him his hat

781
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,700
as soon as he's well enough.

782
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,334
Yes, sir.

783
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:43,804
What do you think your
punishment should be?

784
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:46,172
Four weeks,

785
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:47,873
port and starboard.

786
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,241
Six and six.

787
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:52,544
I think two weeks oughta do it.

788
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:56,716
But I'd also like you to devise
and run a new training program

789
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,852
for the J.O's in the
engineering department.

790
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:03,723
I want them all qualified
on all stations in C.I.C.

791
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:05,424
Of... of course.

792
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:07,760
I think it would also be a...

793
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:10,162
Good idea for you to explain to people

794
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:12,697
why your behavior was so dangerous.

795
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:15,800
As a lesson.

796
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:18,370
I understand, sir.

797
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:20,005
Good.

798
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:26,111
Captain?

799
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:28,113
Thank you.

800
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:35,854
[Door closes]

801
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:50,368
I hear you and Bacon have been
doing quite a bit of talking.

802
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:57,074
No more talking.

803
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,988
