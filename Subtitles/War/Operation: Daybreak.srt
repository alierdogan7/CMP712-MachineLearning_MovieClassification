1
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,920
Jan

2
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Josef

3
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
They sent for you too

4
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
What the hell is
it doing about?

5
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,600
I was on leave, out of the
blue they called me back

6
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,520
That's all I know

7
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
So?

8
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,640
The general will
see you now

9
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Stand at ease

10
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you three know
each other?

11
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Uh... Kubis and I do
sir, but... uh...

12
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,920
Alright, introduce
yourselves

13
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,240
Karel Curda, sir
Born near Prague

14
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,840
I was a customs officer
before the war

15
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,600
Jan Kubis Born
in Vladaslov

16
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
I was a farmer

17
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Gabcik, sir Josef Gabcik Born
in Pilsum, Locksmith

18
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Good

19
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
The mission we
have in mind

20
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,640
can only be undertaken by men
with your qualifications

21
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,520
For the past three month
you've been closely observed

22
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
You're here now because you
shown us that you have courage

23
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,880
endurance and
resourcefulness

24
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,640
I am going to ask you to
undertake a mission

25
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
that regardless
of outcome,

26
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,720
will certainly be one of
the most dangerous of the war

27
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
I need hardly say it, you
are liberty to refuse

28
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,040
Good

29
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,000
First, I am gonna give you
some background information

30
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,840
And then I'll talk
about the mission itself

31
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,560
The Code name is
'Operation Day Break'

32
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,000
Reinhard Heydrich came to Prague
three months ago to take up his post

33
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,840
as acting right
protector

34
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,720
for what the Nazis now call
'Bohemia and maradia' that means

35
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,680
he has absolute power of life
and death over all Czechs

36
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,800
We believe if Adolph
Hitler were to die

37
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,680
That Heydrich would become
fearer of the third life

38
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,680
His orders, one to crush
all Czech resistance

39
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Two, to deport large numbers
of the community to work

40
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,480
in Germany as slave labor

41
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,800
Do not underestimate him

42
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,880
He is not a barbarian
like Hitler

43
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,120
He is the man of the
highest intelligence

44
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,560
ruthless, ambitious and
he is the only one

45
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,880
to whom Adolph Hitler
really listens

46
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,880
Your rights protector

47
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,040
I have a petition signed
by all the inhabitance

48
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,200
of a small village
near Pilsum

49
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Beggin you, sir to show mercy
to the nine young hostages

50
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,240
due to be executed tomorrow

51
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Not one of them is yet
twenty years old

52
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
and youngest is
only sixteen

53
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
The villagers
do feel that

54
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,520
Rights protector says that
whatever happens to the Czechs

55
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,840
or to any of Slav is of no
possible interest to him

56
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,600
We intend to parachute you
back into Czechoslovakia

57
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,520
To assassinate Heydrich

58
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,680
Heydrich is closely
gaurded night and day

59
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,680
When ever he travels, he is
escorted by highly trained SS men

60
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,200
So it will be up to you to formulate
a plan and to carry it out

61
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,800
You must find
a way to kill him

62
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,120
When do we leave sir?

63
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,120
You'll be confined to these
headquarters until further orders

64
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Thank you very much
Good luck

65
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,920
Stand by Champs
we are over Pilsum

66
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
Hold to your mama!

67
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,080
Stop

68
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't try anything

69
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,040
You Czech aren't you?

70
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,240
Keep walking

71
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
Well, I am Czech too.

72
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Move

73
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,240
Jan!

74
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,600
- Twisted bloody ankle
- Can I have a look?

75
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
Don't touch it for Christ sake

76
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,080
That guy's the basterd who said we
were gonna drop on a dry clear morning

77
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,520
Did you see Curda?

78
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,680
No, he dripped off
on the other valley

79
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,640
He could be anywhere

80
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,640
Let me lean on you

81
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
Damn shame

82
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,160
Not so bad if they make us go
after girls in Czechoslovakia

83
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Even the snow
tastes different

84
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,560
Safer though

85
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
You have no
feelings at all

86
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
Can you manage?

87
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,560
Feels worse than
it is, come on

88
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
Papers, your papers

89
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,800
Where are you going at
this time of the morning?

90
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,880
To work?

91
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,040
Where?

92
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,560
Pilsum

93
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
Walk to work everyday

94
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
You walk two hundred
kilometers everyday?

95
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,720
You're no way
near Pilsum

96
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,640
Where have
you come from?

97
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,200
Hands, Hands!

98
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,880
Come on!

99
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Let's go

100
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
Bastard R.A.F.

101
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,240
Two hundred kilometers
from Pilsum

102
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,520
Dropped in a wrong
bloody place

103
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,600
God knows
where Curda is

104
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,200
So now what do we do?

105
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,440
Lost the radio
operator

106
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't hardly walk

107
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,520
and the entire German
army looking for us

108
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,040
Never mind where we are going
we don't even know where we are

109
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,040
And you are
a lot of use

110
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,520
No feelings at all

111
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,200
Christ, we
are at quarry

112
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
Two men

113
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,120
I know you
are in there

114
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,760
It's alright we
won't harm you

115
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,600
I am comming in

116
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,800
Come inside both of you

117
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,480
Close the door

118
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,800
You can't stay here

119
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,560
You're parachutists

120
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
Look, we can
all be shot

121
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,800
I've got a wife
and children

122
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,640
I've hurt my foot

123
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,640
We need some help

124
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
But the place is
swarming with Germans

125
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,480
Really

126
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,160
I haven't
spoken to you

127
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,240
and I haven't
seen you

128
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,720
Please go away

129
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,720
See who it is

130
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,120
Germans

131
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Get into the vault

132
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Parachutists Have
you seen anybody?

133
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Tell him you've
seen nothing

134
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,680
- But what about...
- Do it before he comes

135
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Well, have you
seen anything?

136
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,960
It's serious

137
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Ah- it's you

138
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,720
What's going on
in there, eh?

139
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
One of my men got
hurt in the blast

140
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,560
His foot

141
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Give us a lift
to the doctor

142
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll make it
worth a while

143
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,160
You've been pitching some
of your stocks again?

144
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,440
Better unwrapped

145
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Bring him

146
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,080
Over here

147
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,760
Thank you

148
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,680
Good morning is
your father in?

149
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
What's it about?

150
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,960
Emergency We're
from quarry

151
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,800
This fellow's
hurt his foot

152
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
Come this way please

153
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,880
Father, two men
from the quarry

154
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,640
One's hurt his foot

155
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,200
Tell them in

156
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,040
Go in please

157
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Lie down Take off
your shirt and sock

158
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,240
How did it happened?

159
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,240
I have fell
twisted my ankle

160
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,000
Can you move the toes?

161
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
That's good

162
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,760
I haven't seen you
before, have I?

163
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,920
No

164
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,920
Does that hurt?

165
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,920
How long have you been
working at the quarry

166
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
Well, about
six months now

167
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,600
It's a sprain
Nothing serious

168
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
The Germans are
busy this morning

169
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,880
looking for
parachutists

170
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,600
Yes, we heard

171
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,600
Guess they've been
searching the whole area

172
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
I expect they were
up at the quarry

173
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
Oh yes

174
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Yes the quarry would be a good place
for the parachutists to hide

175
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
But I doubt it they'll
get pretty far

176
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,040
Not now

177
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,720
Now no one might
shelter them

178
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,720
Not after murdering
those Germans

179
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,160
Everybody will be
too frightened

180
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Put your finger
there, will you?

181
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,880
Stand up

182
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,680
That will do

183
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,000
I won't hesitate
to shoot

184
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,000
Sonia!

185
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,680
Yes, these are
the other two

186
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,200
You will forgive me?

187
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,120
We have to make sure you're not
spies planted by the Nazis

188
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,120
Welcome home

189
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh God!

190
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,960
You bastard!

191
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,200
Adult education?

192
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,640
Come in Find a place

193
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,480
Good afternoon

194
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,640
For the benefit
of the those

195
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,880
who are entering for
the higher certificate,

196
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,880
today we are going to talk about
positive and negative ileums

197
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,160
You managed to convince our friends
and countries to your identity

198
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,800
Now you must
convince us

199
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Miles isn't it? Come
a thousand miles to help

200
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,120
How do you mean
convincing?

201
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,800
We want proof

202
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,120
We don't carry papers signed by
Winston Church, if that's what you mean

203
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,120
What was the name of your
commanding officer in England

204
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,040
Answer the question

205
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,160
We are Czechs

206
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
We were born here and
we've come back to fight

207
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
and that's all
we're telling you

208
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
You say you're Czechs

209
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,840
Your home
where is it?

210
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,480
Vladaslov

211
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,840
I know Vladaslov

212
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,160
What's unusual about
the bridge there?

213
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,240
It doesn't exist

214
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Huh? Why?

215
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,680
It was blown up in 39

216
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,760
Anyone could know that

217
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,160
I was a member of the group
that lay the explosives

218
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,680
There were three of us caught by
the Germans, I was one of them

219
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
Anyone could
say that too

220
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,720
Get dressed

221
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
So now you see...

222
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,960
We have both positive and
negative particles in the vacuole

223
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,000
Karel

224
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,480
Where did you
come from?

225
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,040
Don't ask me any questions
I... can't say anything

226
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,200
I knew you'd come

227
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,200
I knew it I knew it

228
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,200
I was a bit worried I'll
meet somebody else

229
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,720
How? I said I'll
wait and I meant it

230
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,840
I never dreamed

231
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,840
How long you can stay?

232
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,920
I don't know

233
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,520
Day? Week?

234
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't know

235
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,440
I'll come to see whenever
I can I promise

236
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,560
See you in the morning

237
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,040
OK

238
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,640
- Good luck
- Thank you

239
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm Curda

240
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
Mommy, he's here

241
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,120
Good evening
and welcome

242
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
Thank you

243
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,040
My daughter
Jundriska

244
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,120
I'm Karel

245
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,640
Call me aunt Marie
everyone does

246
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
I'll show you
to your room

247
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,480
Thank you

248
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh... There's
just one thing

249
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,480
My husband works on the railways
and knows nothing of this

250
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,560
As far as he's
concerned

251
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,520
you are from the country and
looking for work in Prague, alright?

252
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,160
My son, Ata

253
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
- Hello
- He studied in the conservatory

254
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
I'll get you
something to eat

255
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,560
Thank you

256
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh... When you wanna contact
your friends, you tell me

257
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
- OK
- OK

258
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
There are eight streets
leading off the square

259
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Which one do you take if you
want to go to aunt Marie's?

260
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,080
One by the clock

261
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,920
And St. Nicholas
Cathedral

262
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,080
The next one
passed the clock

263
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,120
Walk straight past

264
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,880
Don't look side ways

265
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,800
You've seen nothing

266
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,720
What's happening?

267
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,720
I don't know but
we mustn't stay...

268
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Heydrich!

269
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,080
Come away please You
mustn't stand here

270
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,600
Josef

271
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,680
These are back up
I don't like it

272
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,080
Am I not right, eh?

273
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,680
You are right

274
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,200
It's funny in English

275
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,080
I desire my language

276
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,720
It's late

277
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,880
I didn't realize father

278
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
All well with you?

279
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,880
As usual Is Karel in?

280
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
Yeah

281
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,480
Good night

282
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,160
You're very late, Carl

283
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,840
I had a hard day

284
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,800
Panic from the
moment I went home

285
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,120
You should have
seen the chaos

286
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,520
Cattle trucks

287
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,200
The Germans want
every single one

288
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,520
Cattle trucks

289
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,680
God knows why

290
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,680
On top of all that we got an order
for Heydrich's special train

291
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,960
He's going to Berlin
in three days

292
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,120
Heydrich

293
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,800
I knew it

294
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
I knew it was
something important

295
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,200
All those scooters
always works

296
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
Well?

297
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,640
I don't know

298
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm not sure

299
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,480
I have to
think about it

300
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,600
Perhaps we should wait for the
other parachutists to arrive

301
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,000
No We can't
take the risk

302
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,000
We have to do it the day
he leaves for Berlin

303
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,960
It might be the only
chance we get

304
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,440
Have you thought
what they will do

305
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,440
if you succeed
in killing him?

306
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
We have our orders

307
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,680
People who gave you those
orders are safe in London

308
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,000
They don't have to suffer
what that are priceless

309
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
Think what they
will do to this country

310
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,120
The world would
come down on our heads

311
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,520
It's a chance
we have to take

312
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,200
My God they send
us children

313
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,800
Do you imagine we didn't think
about assassinating Heydrich?

314
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,040
Why didn't you then?

315
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,800
Because we know the
consequences will be

316
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,120
We are soldiers
This is a war

317
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,120
If you won't help
us we'll do it alone

318
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,880
We never said we
would not help you

319
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
What do you
want us to do?

320
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,480
Where is the best
place to kill him?

321
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,880
It's comming

322
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,560
So our beloved furiortics
takes time off

323
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,680
from the heads of state
to welcome to Berlin

324
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,520
one of the man who was helping
him in the glorious task

325
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,080
of governing
the third life

326
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,000
SS Overcopen furior
Reinhard Heydrich

327
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,800
Rights protector of
Bohemia and Bohevia

328
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,520
Icefuraskis him love watches
as the presentations are made

329
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,880
The furior and his two
most trusted advisors

330
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,680
are to meet in secret conference
at Ice Transli in Berlin

331
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,200
before the furior leaves for
the ceremony at Vegetor's Garden

332
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,520
Decorate out
victorious generals

333
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,480
who have brought honor and glory
to the third life and to the furior

334
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,640
We should have stopped
that other train

335
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,200
God if only we can get
accurate information

336
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,720
We've got to send those
man from London now

337
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,720
Wireless operators to set up
a communications network

338
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,680
Lose of time and energy
and thought and for what?

339
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,000
Killing

340
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,680
Christ
we are young

341
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,480
We should be out
enjoying ourselves

342
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,240
If it was peace time
suddenly... now

343
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,680
What would you do?

344
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,800
I'd go out and
buy a dress

345
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,760
A bright red
dress made of silk

346
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,680
I'd see a good
football match

347
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,120
Maybe get drunk
afterwards

348
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,120
Parties, dancing!

349
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,640
It's bad luck to
be over age

350
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,880
Yes, bad luck

351
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,200
Oh, don't bother to
iron on the back

352
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,680
Nobody sees

353
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,560
Dance with me?

354
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,040
I... I don't know how to

355
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,000
You don't know
how to dance?

356
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,160
No I never
had the chance

357
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,840
Never?

358
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,200
Shouldn't you
be leaving?

359
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,880
It's late

360
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,880
He's getting
use to you

361
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The messeges arrived
from Berlin

362
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,840
which I've been
authorized to translate

363
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
For the duration
of war emergency

364
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,160
I hereby appoint you
commissioner and protector

365
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,760

terratories in Europe

366
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,760
Arrange your affairs in order to
arrive in Berlin without delay

367
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,000
Adolf Hitler

368
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,040
- Thursday... Are you sure?
- I'm sure

369
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,680
What's happening?

370
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,680
Next thursday

371
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,200
He didn't give
us much time

372
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,040
He must give us time

373
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,120
We'll use one to
the New Post

374
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,680
No no Curda is right
It's too dangerous

375
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,880
That's for us
to decide

376
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,800
It's not for
you to decide

377
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,720
There are too many
Czech lives at stake

378
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,800
I am gonna stop this

379
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,720
I am gonna
notify London

380
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,840
London's orders were
perfectly clear

381
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Kill Heydrich
at all costs

382
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,000
We've been here weeks

383
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,240
Well I think it's
only in four days

384
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,560
Perhaps it's because we've
been looking for a safe way

385
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,560
Maybe we're going to
have to risk everything

386
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,560
What do you
mean everything?

387
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,720
Something we've been thinking
about for some time

388
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,000
He rises at 7 AM

389
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,760
Breakfast, bathes and he's
dressed by his vallet

390
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,720
7:45 precisely, he usually
says goodbye to his daughter,

391
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,920
gets into his Mercedez, which
is driven by a Chauffeur Glen

392
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,040
When the car proceeds
down the drive

393
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,520
he's escorted by
armed troop carrier

394
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,880
one jeep and
an armered car

395
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,840
The convoy traveles very slowly
at about 40 miles per hour

396
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,880
The first part of the journey
is through the country side

397
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,720
Tree lined roads
and small villages,

398
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,560
along order of specially constructed
to take him into Prague

399
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,560
He enters the out skirt of
the Prague at this point here

400
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,040
Proceeds around the bended
Vulsavitcha junction

401
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And then enters Harry Channy
castle at 8:05 AM precisely

402
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,520
And he's been doing the
samething every day without fail

403
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,520
It never varies

404
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,080
What do you think Jan?

405
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,960
There's only one place

406
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,440
Here

407
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,640
We kill him there as he comes
around Vulsavitcha junction

408
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,520
But he's heavily
guarded all the time

409
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,480
He slows down

410
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,040
You are gonna
stand there?

411
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,120
Pointing your guns a few
feet from Heydrich,

412
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,040
in full view of
his escort?

413
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,800
We'll never get
away with it

414
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,960
It's the only place

415
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,960
It's suicide

416
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,840
Run!

417
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,800
Alright, you two!

418
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,960
Pick him up, put him in the
back of the bakers land

419
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,200
Come on!

420
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,680
Be careful

421
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,120
Easy, easy

422
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,520
Vlavika hospital quickly

423
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,160
I said it was impossible
we should never even have tried

424
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,800
It's on the radio
he's still alive

425
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,800
They are offering reward of
ten million crowns

426
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,520
It jammed

427
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,880
I had him!

428
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,560
I had him!

429
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,240
Mommy, have you
seen my bicycle?

430
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,080
Oh Christ, I left it
outside of Kinsles

431
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,160
Quickly Jundriska get it
and bring it back here

432
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,600
No I must go

433
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,120
No go alone Jundriska
it's safer

434
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,960
Hundreds of splinters
from the grenade...

435
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,520
penetrated deeply into
the lumbar region

436
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,600
We removed
what we could

437
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,600
but his spleen and kidneys
are seriously damaged

438
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,640
But much more dangerous

439
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,520
is the fine splinters
of horse hair

440
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,200
and material from the car appulsory
had entered the blood stream

441
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,040
We may have to
operate again

442
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,200
No you are not
to touch him

443
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,120
But dear Frank?

444
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,800
The furior's own sergeons are
comming Keep him alive untill then

445
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,480
But if blood
poisoning sets in?

446
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,640
Oh father of mercy

447
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,640
We pray to thee for thy
servant Reinhard Heydrich

448
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,480
We remember now who lord his
qualities of his leadership

449
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,640
his sense of service

450
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,640
the inspiration he has
been to all the people

451
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,480
And we pray

452
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,480
that he may long
continue to lead

453
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,480
to serve and
to inspire

454
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,960
Amen

455
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,960
It is only these two?

456
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,200
Oh...
sort of...

457
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,440
What do you
mean sort of?

458
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,040
Is it or isn't it?

459
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,200
How many will
there be?

460
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,120
Three...
four...?

461
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,640
Seven?

462
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,880
- We must go
- Where's Curda?

463
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,960
He should have been
here hours ago

464
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,600
We have to leave
without him

465
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,000
But we can't leave
without Curda

466
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,600
The longer you stay here
more dangerous it is

467
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,840
You'll have to go

468
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,160
No I am sorry We can't
leave without him

469
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,160
Listen to Janak

470
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,760
It's too risky

471
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,000
Talk to him, make
him see sense

472
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,000
Nope, I'm with Jan

473
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,680
Three of us landed together
we are gonna stay together

474
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,520
We wait

475
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,120
How long for god's sake?

476
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,680
We'll give him...
12 hours?

477
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,000
Now state secretary
Frank salutes

478
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,080
He has vowed to root
out the criminals

479
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,920
who are responsible
for this crime

480
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,920
Anyone who assisted them or fail to
give information will be executed

481
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,520
They and their families
until justice is done

482
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,080
Now it is the turn of
proud Heydrich

483
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,680
Her face failed to kneel
and kiss the flag

484
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,920
She steps back as the six officers
take up their positions

485
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,280
either side of
the gun carriage

486
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,800
The coffin is raised
the command is given

487
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,480
Escort comes to attention

488
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,640
and the sad prosecution makes
its way towards the train

489
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,040
Karel

490
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,040
I never lost you for
anything have I?

491
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,040
Don't go now
please?

492
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,720
No I wouldn't

493
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,160
I won't ever
leave you

494
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,560
Where he would be laid to rest
in presence of the furior

495
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,560
Liditz

496
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,840
Liditz?

497
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,880
When he came from the office of
the acting rights protector

498
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,880
In the course of the search for
the murderers of Heydrich

499
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,200
it was found that the population
of village of Liditz

500
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,480
approximately 20 kilometers
northwest of Prague

501
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,480
had helped and cooperated with
the perpetraters of this crime

502
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,680
Accordingly a detachment of
SS division Prikcks Barugie

503
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,640
commanded by SS Overstune
Van Furior Max Roshnov

504
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,840
was dispatched
for Liditz at dawn

505
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,640
All the man have
been shot,

506
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,520
women deported to
concentration camps,

507
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,520
the children sent to appropriate
houses for re-education

508
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,880
All the buildings of this
village have been destroyed

509
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,840
and the name of the village
removed from the land register

510
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,720
The village of Liditz
has seized to exist

511
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,880
And it's name will never
again appear on any map

512
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,960
Come I'll take
you to the others

513
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,920
Father, I want
to confess

514
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,800
I confess father
to murder

515
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,480
Mass murder

516
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,520
The people of Liditz
I am responsible

517
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,800
How were you
responsible?

518
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,160
I killed Heydrich

519
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,560
What happened to Liditz
is because of that

520
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,840
You are wrong

521
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,840
By that crackening, I am
just as responsible

522
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,520
Simply for harboring
you here

523
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,960
No, but at war...

524
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,960
War is the
greatest evil

525
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,920
In war, no man could hold himself
responsible for the sins of his enemy

526
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,800
But Father

527
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,840
I can't help
I feel it

528
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,120
I'll give you a penance
if it's penance you want

529
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:44,680
Anything father
anything

530
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,160
Learn to forgive
your enemy

531
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,480
Pray for them Jan

532
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,160
Pray for them

533
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,880
and for the souls
of the departed

534
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,760
I forgive you in the name of
the father and of the son

535
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,480
and of the holy
ghost, Amen

536
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,960
Hi, Josef

537
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,960
Hello

538
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,960
- Hello, Josef
- Hi

539
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,800
Isn't Curda with you?

540
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,120
No

541
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,520
We couldn't
wait any longer

542
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,440
I've got some
information

543
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,520
Yeah?

544
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,960
About the rights
protector

545
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,520
Sit down over there

546
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I got some
cheese for you

547
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,640
Thank you

548
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,720
It could be one guess

549
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,560
Don't tell me
don't tell me

550
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,160
- Yeah, sausages
- Sausages

551
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,240
Good news

552
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,160
Yeah, four aces

553
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,240
You'll be out of
here in 24 hours

554
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,920
The R.A.F. Is sending a plane
they've given us map reference

555
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,680
Marvelous!

556
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,040
You have to be out
of here by day break

557
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,840
We'll make all the
necessary arrangements

558
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,200
I want to ask a favor.

559
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,680
I want to go out this
afternoon, Janak

560
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,600
I need to meet Anna

561
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,040
It's only for an hour

562
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,800
Alright

563
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,480
Good

564
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,480
Have her meet me on the embankment
of Charles bridge at 2:30

565
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,200
Thank you

566
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,560
Ata, you prepare to bring
in some provisions tonight

567
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,640
OK

568
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,840
Yeah, and champain
and some caviar

569
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,040
we'll have ourselves
a bonvoyage project

570
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,040
Come this way

571
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,640
Name?

572
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,040
Karel Curda

573
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,480
Occupation?

574
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,480
I'm parachutist
dropped by the R.A.F.

575
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,960
I understand you wish
to make a statement

576
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,040
Yes

577
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,160
You realize that
whatever you tell us

578
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,040
may not have the
value you put on it

579
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,640
I am a member of the group
that killed Heydrich

580
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,560
and I can identify
the others

581
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,480
First you must give
me an insurance

582
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,480
But before we make a...
let's say bargains,

583
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,840
we must find out
what you know

584
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,720
then we will see

585
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,720
Oh

586
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,720
Please sit down

587
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,840
Who are these men?

588
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,760
Can you give us
their names?

589
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,080
Where they are hiding?

590
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,040
Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis
We were dropped together

591
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,960
Why are you
telling us this?

592
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,720
Is it for the reward?

593
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:27,720
I want to protect
my family

594
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,680
I don't want my wife
and child shot, please

595
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,080
What do you think
you could tell us

596
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,040
about what's found at the
scene of assassination?

597
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,440
This one is Gabcik's

598
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,640
Carried his
stun gun in here

599
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,800
Where are these two men?

600
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,640
I don't know Hiding
in Prague somewhere

601
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,520
You'll have to do
better than that

602
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,520
Where are they?

603
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,640
I don't know

604
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,880
Mr. Curda

605
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,800
How old is your child?

606
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,440
Who is it?

607
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,000
It's alright
I'll get it

608
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,640
Raise your hands, turn
your face to the wall

609
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,160
What... what
do you want?

610
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,000
Where are they?

611
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,040
What are you doing?
Tell them to stop

612
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,560
I want to know
where they are

613
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,560
Who? Who're you
talking about?

614
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,880
Kubis and Gabcik

615
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,000
Assassins
where are they?

616
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,120
Assassins...
there's no one here

617
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,520
Only my wife

618
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,160
Just take me

619
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,000
My husband know
nothing about it

620
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,160
Hey Blashure!

621
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,200
I am sorry

622
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,040
Mommy

623
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,560
Quickly, you
must warn Ata

624
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,880
Go to the
conservator

625
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,600
Tell him he
must not go home

626
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,480
He's to go straight
to the crypt

627
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,760
and you...
Hurry up!

628
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,760
What's the matter?

629
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,760
I haven't any money
for the traffic

630
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,680
There

631
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,480
Mama!

632
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,960
Jundriska!

633
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,440
Papa!

634
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,880
My Evil-

635
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,480
Just tell me
where they are

636
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,000
Why protect them?

637
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,000
Why be so obstinate?

638
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,200
You are music
student, I see

639
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,880
Ah yes, you play
the violin

640
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,160
We are leaving
at day break

641
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,840
I know

642
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,160
The war will be
over someday

643
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,000
I'll be back

644
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,080
Stay with me

645
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,840
I can't

646
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,840
I'll hide you.

647
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,680
You'll be safe We'll leave
Prague and go somewhere else

648
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,760
Anna, it's
not possible

649
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,080
Why?

650
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,520
Try and think
of afterwards

651
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,200
That's what I do

652
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,000
When it's over I
think of coming back

653
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
Seeing you again

654
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,840
I wish I knew you better
I wish we had more time

655
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,200
You're right We don't
know each other at all

656
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,280
I know nothing
about you Anna

657
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,040
You don't even
know my real name

658
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,120
It's not important

659
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,800
I never did get
that red dress

660
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,800
No, I never saw
a football match

661
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,000
Curda?

662
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,000
It's pleased to
see you Curda

663
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,840
I... I didn't tell them

664
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:00,760
about the church...
I didn't tell him

665
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,200
What church Ata?

666
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:09,200
Sunsils, at the
Slover street

667
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,800
I... I didn't
tell them

668
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,960
I didn't... l...
I didn't tell them

669
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,080
Come back soon

670
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,640
Jan

671
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,880
What happened?

672
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,800
My mother's...

673
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,000
There's nothing
for you here

674
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,000
Kubis

675
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,200
Lieutenant!

676
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,680
- What's the matter?
- They found us

677
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,880
The street is
swirming with them

678
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,960
How did they find us?

679
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,800
Who the hell talked?

680
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,640
What difference
does it make?

681
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,560
Hundreds of them

682
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,040
I could've warn
the others

683
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,640
No, there
isn't time

684
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,120
- Bahtz take cover Bubrich
- follow me

685
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,000
Father Patrek?

686
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,760
Father Patrek?

687
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,520
Give me a hand

688
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,960
The passage!

689
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,880
Father Patrek thought it
might lead to the river

690
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,120
At least this must go
onto the street

691
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,160
They are re-grouping

692
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:53,760
Jesus christ there's
more bastards up there

693
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,640
Alright, who are
these men?

694
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:04,920
Are these the
assassins?

695
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,000
No

696
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:10,000
Who are they then?

697
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,520
Bach...

698
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,120
Bubrich

699
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,840
and Korel

700
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,040
They were
dropped after us

701
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,840
Where are the others?

702
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,880
Come on! It's
our only chance

703
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:36,960
It's hopeless

704
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,200
The priest was wrong

705
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,520
There is no passage

706
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,960
Here it is

707
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,720
Tell him to
surrender

708
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,760
Jan!

709
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,160
Josef!

710
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,680
Josef, give up!
It's useless

711
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,480
Here!

712
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,160
Josef, Jan!

713
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,920
Listen!

714
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,240
Jusech, help Josef
go up the stairs

715
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,520
Go on!

716
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:26,720
Josef!

717
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,120
How many you got?

718
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,520
Enough

719
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,960
It's all over
move out

720
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,960
Move out
it's all over
