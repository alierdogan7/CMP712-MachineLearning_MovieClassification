00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,549
On the Centenary of Russian Cinema

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,475
With the support of the
Russian Ministry of Culture

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,959
Channel One

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,472
Film Direction

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,708
I checked in the studio photo records.
It's definitely her.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,799
Dago Film Productions

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,074
Present

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,076
Konstantin Khabensky

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,958
The wife on an enemy of the revolution.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,077
Where am I going to find a face like that?

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,999
Elizabeta Boyarskaya

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,997
Sergei Bezrukov

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,759
In a film by
Andrei Kravchuk

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,038
ADMIRAL

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,593
Baltic Sea, Pillau Region.
German Waters. 1916

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,036
Look sharp. Mines at least
seven meters from the surface!

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,990
82 feet under the keel

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,029
85 feet under the keel

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,750
- Officers on deck.
- At ease!

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,996
- Well?
- It's foggy.

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,997
No signals from the "Sentry"
or the "Hunter" for a while.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,988
Try signaling them again.

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,156
I'll be with the Commander.

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,557
- May I come in?
- Yes. So?

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,951
Everything's calm,
Alexander Vasilievich.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,111
- Will you have some tea?
- Thank you.

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,152
That's the Kazan Mother of God,
if I'm not mistaken?

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,751
Sofia Fyodorovna gave it to me,
before our marriage.

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,994
Anna Vasilievna gave me this.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,236
As a memento. Look...

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,593
Beautiful.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,874
Beautiful.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,190
- Yes?
- May I come in?

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,036
Gentlemen. Your presence on the
bridge is needed at once.

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,832
The Germans, gentlemen.
The Germans...

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,111
Their 210 mm cannons
against our 45s.

37
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,470
- The "Friedrich Karl".
- So much for your "Sentry"...

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,073
Thank God they're quiet.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,999
They've missed us.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,036
All hands to battle stations!

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,111
All to fighting stations!

42
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,714
Battle stations! Attention!

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,110
- Full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,592
Helmsman, full speed ahead.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,996
Battle! Cut the ropes!

46
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,039
Hold her steady!

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,675
- Why have we slowed down?
- Engine room!

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,955
Why have we slowed down?
What's happening?

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,599
A shell got the pipes
in the engine room!

50
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,109
- How long to fix it?
- Half an hour.

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,793
You have 15 minutes.

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,118
In 15 minutes they'll
turn us into a sieve.

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,112
Yes, we're a sitting duck!

54
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,557
Why have you stopped firing:

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,228
Midshipman!

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,870
Are you alive?

57
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,870
Alexander Vasilievich!

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,031
Should we get the orderlies?

59
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,872
Get on the tower.

60
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,633
Gurov, you alive?

61
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,792
Man the guns!

62
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,155
To arms!

63
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,111
To arms, I said:

64
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,514
Lads!

65
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,034
Fire!

66
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,912
- Yes!
- We got them on the running tower!

67
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,111
They're off us now.

68
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,999
The Germans' bridge is damaged!

69
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,833
Relieve the gunners!

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,958
Third gunners to the main guns,

71
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,997
Good thing we dropped the mines:

72
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,676
- What?
- I'm sorry.

73
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,678
Good that we dropped the mines,
if not:

74
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,115
Your Excellency, they've
repaired the pipes.

75
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,994
- The main bridge can't be mended in an hour.
- Put on the reserve one.

76
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,189
We need to get out of here,
while there's still time.

77
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,996
Mines, mines

78
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,790
Full speed ahead!

79
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,038
- Steer course for Pillau!
- But that's our minefield!

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Assemble the officers
on the starboard deck.

81
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,156
At attention!

82
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,831
Gentlemen!

83
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,589
There's a German squadron behind us.
The "Friedrich Karl" is in front.

84
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,711
There's no way back to base.

85
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,152
So I see no way out except
to lure the Germans onto our mines.

86
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,070
Steer course for Pillau.
Onto our minefield. Questions?

87
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,158
I have a question.

88
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,838
One meter from the mines!
We won't make it.

89
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,231
Our own mines. We're
digging our own graves.

90
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,870
Calm down, midshipman.

91
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,759
We're going onto the mines.
Gold help us!

92
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,559
Let us pray.

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,036
Remove your headwear.

94
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,116
All powerful God

95
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,591
Lord our Saviour

96
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,118
Pardon Your faithful servants
hear and protect us

97
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,036
- Mine at port side!
- Stop engines.

98
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,671
Ready to reverse.

99
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
- Mine at port side!

100
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,672
Calm down, gentlemen.

101
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,113
God have mercy...

102
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,070
The Germans are opening sights.

103
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,551
Right, now they're all together.

104
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,156
Reverse.

105
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,834
We've missed the mine.

106
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,154
- That's the end...
- Goodbye, my friends.

107
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,638
They're going to get us.

108
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,911
What a shame, gentlemen...

109
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,713
Give the order for battle.

110
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,079
Stop! Into battle.

111
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,476
Slow ahead!
Previous course.

112
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,835
We're past the minefield.
Head home, gentlemen.

113
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,149
Champagne for the captain.

114
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,190
Podgorsky, come back here.

115
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,551
- You've already completed your dare.
- No!

116
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,638
I promised to stay until
the end of the game.

117
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,637
Russian naval base.
Helsingfors, Finland.

118
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,077
What should the dare be?

119
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,039
A new uniform!

120
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,029
Down a glass of cognac
for our victory.

121
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,952
That'll be a pleasure for him.

122
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,952
But something more challenging!

123
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,672
Make him kiss someone.

124
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,917
The first person to come
through the door.

125
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,196
Yes! Passionately.
And with feeling.

126
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,990
That's your dare,
Alexander Vasilievich.

127
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,993
- Quite a situation...
- Gentlemen, this is not funny.

128
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,073
The first through the door will be
the sailor I sent for champagne.

129
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,080
- Have you no conscience?
- That's how it is in war time:

130
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,231
Rear Admiral Kolchak
kissing a common sailor.

131
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,992
Until he comes in,
I suggest we continue.

132
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,749
What should this dare be?
Vladimir, we're waiting.

133
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,071
Attention!
And here's the sailor.

134
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,631
I was just looking for you.

135
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,799
I've been summoned to headquarters urgently.
Afraid I won't be back tonight.

136
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,755
Will you see my wife home?

137
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,156
If I don't have the time,
as a friend...

138
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,474
This is Anna Vasilievevna.
My wife.

139
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,991
I ask you...

140
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,877
What's going on here,
gentlemen?

141
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,200
Alexander Vasilievich just
took on a dare.

142
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,070
To kiss the first person
to come through the door.

143
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,476
That is, your wife.

144
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
So off you go to your watch.

145
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,038
Alexander Vasilievich.
We implore you...

146
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,597
You ought to honour it!

147
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,112
Rules of the game -
Like service regulations!

148
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,716
Come on Annushka, the dare!

149
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,474
You really should obey!

150
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,473
Dares are more serious
than debts at cards.

151
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,876
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your attention please!

152
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,679
- Slavushka, run off and play.
- All right, papa.

153
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,718
- Volodya, see what a
ship I have!

154
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,395
I'm starting to believe in fate,
Anna Vasilievna.

155
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,310
Today, when I came to
Helsingfors,

156
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,719
For some reason
I was sure

157
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,796
- that I would meet you.
- Really?

158
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,196
Yes, indeed.

159
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,233
Sonechka, do you remember
when we left Moscow so suddenly?

160
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,754
Your father had the bad luck
to fall in love.

161
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,958
Why are you telling me this?

162
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,430
Your neighbour is just
too beautiful.

163
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,597
Sasha is prone to infatuation.
But it doesn't normally last long.

164
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,118
Yes, and I wanted to ask,

165
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,435
There'll be a ball at the
Podorgskys tomorrow. Are you coming?

166
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,395
Kirill Fyodorovich,
come over here!

167
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,520
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

168
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,989
Why on earth do you have
to entangle all these balls of yarn?

169
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,754
How did the Tsars
choose their brides?

170
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,596
The brides would untangle a yarn.
The Tsar watched through the keyhole.

171
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,594
If a girl fidgeted, or lost her temper,
that was it.

172
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,753
Out you go, lazybones!

173
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,113
Because the Tsar's wife
must have patience,

174
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,828
and self-restraint.

175
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,799
That's how my grandmother
prepared me to be a bride.

176
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,199
Interesting:

177
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,156
And why did your grandmother
call you a Shelkova cossack?

178
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,713
Because I am a Shelkova woman.

179
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,872
Our Cossacks married Turkish women.

180
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,794
I have Turkish blood too.

181
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,109
So, let's drink to the Turks!

182
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,915
With pleasure.

183
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,148
- Mama, is father an Admiral?
- A rear-Admiral.

184
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,316
Better if he'd stayed a captain.

185
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,637
I like him as a captain better.
Rear-Admiral is hard to say.

186
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,272
Better if you got some sleep.

187
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,991
Go to sleep, my dear.

188
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,518
Or you won't go swimming
again with father.

189
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,117
So what did you find out?

190
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,910
It turns out, these
Turkish ladies, from the harems

191
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,038
Would not give anyone anything!

192
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,394
A traveler comes along,
and asks for a glass of water.

193
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
What does the lady of the house reply?

194
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,758
"When Ivan comes, he will
give it to you, traveler."

195
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,075
Slander! Slander and calumny!

196
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,036
I for one would never
turn you down.

197
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,672
I fear, Anna Vasilievna, you
would have your hands full.

198
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,512
I'm very partial to drinking.

199
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,468
I understand you perfectly.

200
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,395
Generally speaking, it seems to me that

201
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,558
water and war are the only

202
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,835
loves in your life.

203
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,077
It seems to me you know
perfectly well -

204
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,277
that's not how it is.

205
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,872
Well:

206
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,071
It's getting late:

207
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,673
We had a nice walk,

208
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,158
and now it's time to go our separate ways.
Who knows, Anna Vasilievna -

209
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,437
whether we'll ever have such a
good time as we did today?

210
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,316
Thank you: Dear
Alexander Vasilievich.

211
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,876
Go now: Go.

212
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,028
This is the light signal of a sinking ship,
Anna Vasilievna.

213
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,790
Good night.

214
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,189
I was thinking that something had happened:

215
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,358
Sasha:

216
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,910
Is everything all right between us?

217
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,992
Not exactly.

218
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,712
Have you fallen in love?

219
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,428
Tell me if this is -
but...

220
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,508
Are you sure this is serious?

221
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,432
I don't know:

222
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,910
I have no intention of getting in your way,

223
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,874
Slavushka, Mother and
I will leave. For Petersburg.

224
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,030
Sonya, I:

225
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,111
You don't need to go anywhere.

226
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,676
Everything will be all right. I promise.

227
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,918
You are my wife and I am your husband.
That's the way it will always be.

228
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,118
How is Slavushka?

229
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,554
His temperature is nearly normal.
Shall I wait for you at lunch?

230
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,756
No, I'll be dining at the Assembly.

231
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,035
Alexander Vasilievich, congratulations
on your new assignment!

232
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,272
What a brilliant career!

233
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,791
No, I understand well that you can't force

234
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,519
someone to love or hate
against his or her will.

235
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,038
- But we took vows before God
- So what?

236
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,839
You swore before God,

237
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,872
to love me and remain faithful.
You understand perfectly well that:

238
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,998
Remain faithful - what do you mean?

239
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,478
Not go to bed with someone else?

240
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,716
If that's what you mean, I haven't
been unfaithful to you.

241
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,514
God, you're still such a child...

242
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,237
I don't understand.

243
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,431
What on earth are you doing here?

244
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,709
Nikolai Alexandrovich, tell headquarters
that the mining operation is

245
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,951
complete and there are no losses.
We're heading back to base.

246
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,712
Thanks for your service, gentlemen.

247
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,919
Alexander Vasilievich, please submit
my report to Naval Command.

248
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,752
- What is this report?
- I request to be transferred to another ship.

249
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,353
Have we let you down somehow,
Sergei Nikolaevich?

250
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,550
Rear-Admiral, Sir,

251
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,316
a radio message from the coast.
From Prince Melikov. To all at sea.

252
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,555
Ragotsem Cape, Gulf of Riga, 1916

253
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,918
- We're heading towards a communications buoy.
- Stop engines.

254
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,031
- Engines stopped.
- Drop anchor!

255
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,788
Your Excellency.

256
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,918
We received a radiogram

257
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,908
- "I arrived with the"Glory"." Kolchak.
- Go.

258
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,750
The cable is connected.
The communication is established.

259
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,516
Alexander Vasilievich, we're
connected with the coast.

260
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,235
Man the starboard battle stations.

261
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,630
Man the battle stations.

262
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,198
Hurry!

263
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,834
This is the commander of cruiser the "Glory",
Rear-Admiral Kolchak.

264
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,190
The situation is critical. The Germans
are squeezing us on the right flank.

265
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,910
I will coordinate  your
firing operation myself.

266
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,196
Grid thirty. Coordinates:

267
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,274
Three thousand five hundred.
Two thousand two hundred.

268
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,712
Battle stations! Man the guns!

269
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,597
Sight eighteen.
Deflection forty three. Fire!

270
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,315
Twenty more to the left. Three higher...

271
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,275
The Germans are turning their guns!!

272
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,433
Hello! Hello!

273
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,792
Hello!? I can't hear you.

274
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,633
Man the guns! In place!

275
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,033
The Germans have opened fire on us.

276
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,352
- So?
- We're a sitting duck now

277
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,316
- We need to head out to sea.
- Then how do I adjust the line of fire?!

278
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,677
We're staying in place.
Check the communication!

279
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,199
Are you wounded?

280
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,753
Let me help: This is not the time
or place, Sergei Nikolaevich:

281
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,714
But as a military officer you surprised
me with your report.

282
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,519
To leave your comrades with whom
you have served so long:

283
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,713
Given the situation that has arisen between
the two of us. A personal situation

284
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,275
What situation?

285
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,792
The only situation now is war -
fighting the enemy

286
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,437
and doing your duty to the homeland. Yes!

287
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,758
Rear-Admiral Kolchak. What are your
new firing coordinates?

288
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,679
Ten to the left and five higher!

289
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,237
Open fire!

290
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,473
Mates! Attack! Hurray!

291
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,557
Stop! Stop!

292
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,959
Here is a letter in Morse code.

293
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,159
I did my best with a textbook at home.

294
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,794
Thank you. But today is the
last time we shall see each other.

295
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,591
We can't meet again.

296
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,157
What happened?

297
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,838
Did we do something wrong:?

298
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,556
Anna Vasilievna:

299
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,836
We didn't even dance.

300
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,794
Why Alexander Vasilievich?

301
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,472
Because I love you.

302
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,588
Farewell!

303
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,077
Alexander Vasilievich.

304
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,039
Give me the letter.

305
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,832
My darling Annushka! You're all wet.

306
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,192
Be careful or you'll fall ill.

307
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,197
- I'm very tired.

308
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,276
Sure Annushka, I:

309
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,797
Mogilev, 1916 the Emperor's
General Headquarters

310
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,872
The Emperor will see you here in the park.

311
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,873
- I wish you health, Your Majesty.
- Greetings.

312
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,791
I have been told of your bravery.

313
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,909
Of the courage you showed
on the Baltic Sea.

314
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,838
I acted according to the call
of duty, Your Majesty.

315
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,509
I invited you here to inform
you of my decision.

316
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,111
You have been assigned
the rank of Vice-Admiral,

317
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,872
and become the Commander-in-Chief
of the Black Sea fleet.

318
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,038
Thank you for your trust,
Your Majesty.

319
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,912
Take this, and may the icon

320
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,749
of the long-suffering Job
give you strength.

321
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,869
Thank you.

322
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,993
I wish you good luck!

323
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,554
Allow me to take my leave,
Your Majesty.

324
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,956
Godspeed, admiral.

325
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,798
"I must know that you're alive".

326
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,119
Driver!

327
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,032
To the train station on the double!
Faster, please...

328
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,472
Gentlemen.

329
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,792
Alexander Vasilievich needs
protection from the sun!

330
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,709
- It's a resort area.
- There's more sun in Sevastopol...

331
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,874
When are you going there,
Sophia Fyodorovna?

332
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,871
Tea, gentlemen.

333
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,637
This is your fleet!

334
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,875
Yesterday I was walking
by Mikhailovsky castle

335
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,029
when I heard children arguing:
"Mine, give it me", "No"...

336
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,713
Then all of a sudden it
became crystal clear to me

337
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,951
"Everything will come in due time.
It already has come".

338
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,069
There is no more mine or yours.

339
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,991
Every morning I open my eyes
and smile... I'm alive...

340
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,997
I am waiting... This is a reward,

341
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,752
not a punishment.

342
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,038
Because against all the laws
of physics you give,

343
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,756
the more you give
the more you receive.

344
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,797
Just imagine,
I can feel in the palms of my hand

345
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,595
a big and unbelievably
shiny ball.

346
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,114
This is Grace.

347
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,039
A gift...

348
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,639
Happiness... That's the
way it is.

349
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,712
Don't laugh. I know.

350
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,675
I stand on the edge
of a vast unseen world.

351
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,510
And although we see the future
unclearly, as the Apostle said:

352
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,432
"Through a glass darkly...

353
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,875
And now abideth faith,

354
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,712
hope and love.

355
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,110
But the greatest of these is love".

356
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,750
Alexander Vasilievich,

357
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,155
I heard that you
will be in Petrograd...

358
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,877
How soon? March or April?

359
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,836
For some reason it seems
to me that it won't be long.

360
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,712
May I come in? Your Excellency,
a wireless message just came in.

361
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,990
On March 2nd the Emperor Nicholas
the Second abdicated the throne.

362
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,593
Power is with
the Provisional Government...

363
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,912
The monarchy has fallen.

364
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,190
A Provisional Government...

365
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,509
What does that mean?

366
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,030
I don't think it bodes
at all well for Russia.

367
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,791
I think you're right.

368
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,553
Anna Vasilievna, unfortunately...

369
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,559
KRONSTADT, 1917
The revolution has eclipsed our future.

370
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,712
The darkness is moving in.

371
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,839
- Where are you taking us?
- Wherever...

372
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,917
Gentlemen, are we just
a herd of animals?

373
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,474
- We should do something!
- Hands off, sailor!

374
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,438
Please, obey.

375
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,153
It's treason.

376
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,798
- Listen to my command.
- My God!

377
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,476
We're at war. Come to your senses!
What are you doing?

378
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,673
- Sort out the Admiral.
- Fear the Lord.

379
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,992
Gentlemen! Save yourselves,
that's an order!

380
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,155
- Run!
- Shoot them...

381
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,435
Kolya!

382
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,035
May God be with you!

383
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,037
SEVASTOPOL

384
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,036
Annushka, good you're
home. Pack your bags.

385
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,473
- What happened, Serezha?
- Admiral Nepenin has been killed!

386
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,992
- How did he die?
- I said he was killed!

387
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,713
He was clubbed with rifle butts
and stabbed with bayonets. Brutes!

388
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,475
Serezha, I can't understand
what's happening.

389
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,992
God! What on earth
is happening?

390
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,195
Serezhenka, calm down, explain.

391
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,632
Podgursky has also been killed.
He died in my arms.

392
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,638
Out of the way!

393
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,630
- What's the matter?
- The first order...

394
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,558
of the Petrograd Soviet

395
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,791
is for all officers
to hand over weapons.

396
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,880
To prevent a counter-revolutionary
conspiracy.

397
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,949
Turn in your weapon, Admiral.

398
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,478
- We're leaving for Petrograd...
- Why are we leaving?

399
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,992
- I was able to take some leave...
- Hold on now!

400
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,668
What are you waiting for?
Pack your bags...

401
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,910
Admiral, follow
this order immediately.

402
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,718
- Get out of here!
- Listen here, Admiral...

403
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,838
Get out!

404
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,835
All right men,
we'll figure this out on deck.

405
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,992
Officer of the watch, tell everyone
to line up on deck.

406
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,751
Wait, Serezha, how can I...
how can I go...

407
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,120
All letters come to this address.
I'm waiting...

408
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,759
At least close your suitcase?

409
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,070
Anya. Anya,

410
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,475
Anechka, please my dear.

411
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,876
I'm begging you.

412
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,433
The boat leaves in half an hour.

413
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,555
We're finished
if we don't make it on time.

414
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,749
Arms!

415
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,193
As you were!

416
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,033
Attention! Order revoked!

417
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,119
Fall in!
Who are you obeying?

418
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,871
- You afraid, lads!
- Fall in!

419
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,039
Quick.

420
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,517
Officers, gentlemen.

421
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,468
- Weapons up.
- I'm sorry!

422
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,152
At ease.

423
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,597
To avoid bloodshed,

424
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,432
I order the officers

425
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,038
to turn over their weapons.

426
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,196
Admiral, sir, your weapon...

427
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,031
Sir.

428
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,720
PETROGRAD (ST. PETERSBURG)

429
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,030
To the meeting?
Kerensky will be there himself.

430
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,709
Come with us, lady... Let's go!

431
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,717
You weren't home today.
I got the mail and there is a

432
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,874
letter for you.
From Sevastopol.

433
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,994
It's strange that mail
still arrives.

434
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,718
I'm feeling tired today.

435
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,672
In three days I'll be in Petrograd.

436
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,228
Seeing you is all
I'm dreaming of.

437
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,715
SEVASTOPOL

438
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,518
Hearing your voice.

439
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,117
- Kerensky has summoned me.
- It's dangerous in Petrograd...

440
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,751
the sailors and workers
have rebelled.

441
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,795
Admiral Nepenin was stabbed
to death with a bayonet.

442
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,875
- Can I see you to the station?
- Sonya, I...

443
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,831
Rostislav is waiting for you.
Go to him.

444
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,475
- Will you come back?
- Of course.

445
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,150
What silly thoughts.

446
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,711
Petrograd

447
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,713
Kerensky wants to offer you
the post of war minister...

448
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,029
Let's see. I wish he would
see me on time.

449
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,715
But he is late.

450
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,471
Today...

451
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,836
at the Mikhailovsky Castle...

452
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,433
Today...

453
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,870
I can see we have a different
view of the war...

454
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,758
By condoning anarchy
you have broken up the army

455
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,473
- and destroyed the Russian navy.
- Don't forget, Admiral...

456
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,632
Unless I have authority
to impose strict order

457
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,794
your proposals
are unacceptable to me.

458
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,430
Former procedures in the army
are not acceptable to us.

459
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,989
I was the first to swear allegiance

460
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,871
and I'll be the first
to leave the Navy.

461
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,720
In this way,
I will make a public statement

462
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,798
that the current state of affairs
is ruinous for Russia.

463
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,668
I accept your resignation.

464
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,552
I am honoured.

465
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,719
You should be arrested for your
counter-revolutionary leanings.

466
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,478
But given your merits,
I offer you to go to America.

467
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,789
I'm giving you the chance to
continue the war against Germany.

468
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,477
Are you exiling me from Russia?

469
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,832
The Americans need an expert who can

470
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,752
conduct a landing
and seize Constantinople.

471
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,996
My family is still in Sevastopol.

472
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,832
I'll take care of them.

473
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,110
I'll ask the allies to have
them brought to you overseas.

474
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,991
Thank you.

475
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,158
Dear...

476
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,753
My darling, Anna Vasilievna.

477
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,037
You are my happiness;

478
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,876
I can't live without you...

479
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,438
What?

480
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,558
Their times are over!

481
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,677
I'm leaving Russia.

482
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,110
Why?

483
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,751
What tired eyes you have.

484
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,030
I love you.

485
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,633
And I always will.

486
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,756
Forgive me.

487
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,072
Farewell,

488
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,548
Alexander Vasilievich.

489
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,833
I know that you are alive.

490
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,714
SEVASTOPOL

491
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,230
Is it ready?

492
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,716
At least let me pray.

493
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,069
You can pray if you want to.

494
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,797
Listen, bring the rope.

495
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,435
Let's go while he draws the
Sailors away!

496
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,679
Stop!

497
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,509
Quick, let's go...
we can't wait for him here. A

498
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,994
Stop!

499
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,711
Mrs. Kolchak! Open the
door, Mrs. Kolchak!

500
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,796
Document check!

501
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,792
Break it down!

502
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,312
Break the windows!

503
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,548
It's time, the British ship
sets sail in an hour.

504
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,629
TRANS-SIBERIA RAILWAY
AUTUMN 1918

505
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,629
I think I'm doing it better.

506
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,910
Take your place.

507
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,270
What a good shot!

508
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,397
Let's drink to our wishes.

509
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,152
Even the ones that don't come true?

510
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,116
Does that make them
any less wishes.

511
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,072
- Excuse me, Madam.
- Yes, of course.

512
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,831
- Mikhail Ivanovich.
- Anna Vasilievna!

513
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,953
- My God!
- What a surprise!

514
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,434
I haven't seen you for a year...
What brings you here?

515
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,911
Sergei Nikolaevich has been
sent to the Far East.

516
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,238
He's on a mission to
disarm the Pacific fleet.

517
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,437
Sergei Nikolaevich?

518
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,157
...So he's in power now?

519
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,878
- A red commissar.
- I have no right to judge him.

520
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,834
At a time like this.

521
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,719
It's the same time for everyone.

522
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,188
- Where are you going?
- To Omsk.

523
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,633
But the Soviets are in
power there too?

524
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,791
No. Kolchak is there.

525
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,711
But I thought Alexander
Vasilievich was abroad?

526
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,474
Kerensky did send him abroad:

527
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,753
But after the Bolshevik coup
he returned to Russia

528
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,032
to fight the Bolsheviks.

529
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,558
I'm sorry, Anna Vasilievna,
I must go.

530
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,512
Goodbye.

531
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,112
Serezha:

532
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,913
Aha... yes... yes, Anya!
What is it?

533
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,998
Kolchak is in Omsk
gathering an army.

534
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,715
Anya, if this is a rebuke,
you know I agreed to collaborate

535
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,594
with the authorities because
they allowed us

536
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,515
to go far away from

537
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,355
this fratricidal madness...

538
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,757
To Japan, China...

539
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,669
It's all for your sake, Anechka.

540
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,156
I don't blame you for anything.

541
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,396
But I love Alexander
Vasilievich, Serezha.

542
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,395
And now I need to be with him...

543
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,516
I realize that these are harsh words,

544
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,551
but I have never
stopped loving him.

545
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,236
I see! ...Stop, stop...

546
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,111
Let me help.

547
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,957
So there it is. A time of wars
and revolutions.

548
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,672
Anything goes.

549
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,791
The time has nothing
to do with it.

550
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,478
When I fell asleep I
was your husband.

551
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,230
I wake up and I am
no longer your husband:

552
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,998
I know it's hard for you

553
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,238
but you've got to be strong.

554
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,198
You'll forget me before long.

555
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,194
Let me be the one
to decide that.

556
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,913
Siberia, Eastern Front.
November 1918

557
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,428
I pledge and swear

558
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,277
before Almighty God,

559
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,318
His Holy Gospel

560
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,638
and the Life-Giving Cross:

561
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,919
To be faithful and ever true.

562
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,918
To the Russian state

563
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,278
as my Homeland.

564
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,875
I pledge and swear

565
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,356
to serve it

566
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,269
as the Supreme Ruler of Russia,

567
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,396
without regard for my life,

568
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,634
family ties or friendship,

569
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,433
enmity, or gain,

570
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,952
and mindful only of the revival

571
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,719
and success of the Russian state.

572
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,075
Hereby I make the sign
of the cross,

573
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,593
and kiss the words and
Cross of my Saviour.

574
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,359
Amen.

575
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,712
OMSK.

576
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,712
Hello, my lady!

577
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,956
Who are you looking for?

578
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,712
You, I think.

579
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,836
How can I help you?

580
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,193
I'm the one who would
like to help you.

581
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,077
My dear

582
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,716
sweet Alexander Vasilievich,

583
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,314
I have realized that I simply
can no longer wait!

584
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,557
Do you remember how I dreamed
to be on the deck of your ship?

585
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,196
Just to see you.

586
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,716
You would not even notice me,
I would not disturb you;

587
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,992
all I need is to stand nearby:

588
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,752
And now it seems that I will
experience this happiness.
