THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY
FOR OUR COUNTRY,

724
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,217
FOR PRESIDENT MADERO,

725
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:23,719
FOR THE REVOLUTION.

726
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,156
IS IT NOT?

727
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:26,622
YES, MY GENERAL.

728
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:27,658
THEN LOOK HAPPY.

729
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:30,626
COLONEL, DETACH
YOUR TROOP TRANSPORT CARS.

730
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,663
I WANT TO BE IN PARRAL
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

731
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,130
BUT GENERAL
HUERTA--

732
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,166
YES?

733
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:37,668
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
ISN'’’T IT DANGEROUS

734
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,403
TO FACE VILLA
WITHOUT YOUR ARMY?

735
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,173
DO YOU THINK
IT'’’S LESS DANGEROUS

736
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:44,740
TO FACE VILLA
WITH MY ARMY?

737
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:51,182
THE ONE PREDICTABLE THING
ABOUT PANCHO VILLA...

738
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:54,750
IS THAT HE WILL OBEY
PRESIDENT MADERO.

739
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,255
AND I HOLD ORDERS
FROM MADERO.

740
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,758
YES, MY GENERAL.

741
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,905
GRINGO.

742
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,841
YOU GET
THE MONEY?

743
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,941
I GOT IT, YEAH.

744
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,948
DON'’’T GO, GRINGO.
DON'’’T GO.

745
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:39,915
STAY WITH ME.

746
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:40,951
YOU FOUGHT WELL TODAY.

747
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:42,953
WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
SENORITA?

748
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:44,920
MY NAME IS EMILITA,
MY GENERAL.

749
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,457
EMILITA?
MM-HMM.

750
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:48,557
EMILITA AND PANCHO.

751
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:52,528
SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.
THINK ABOUT IT.

752
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:53,929
CHIEF.

753
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,432
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'’’M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

754
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,468
CHIEF.

755
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:58,969
BUT I HAVE A MAN,
MY GENERAL.

756
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,537
YOU'’’RE MARRIED?

757
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:02,473
NO.

758
01:09:02,573 --> 01:09:03,974
HEY, CHIEF.

759
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:05,441
THEN IT MUST BE

760
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,444
THAT HE DOESN'’’T
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

761
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,980
BUT I LOVE YOU.

762
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,080
AND I WILL MARRY YOU.

763
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,551
URBINA, GET A PRIEST.

764
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:16,987
OHH.

765
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,555
[TALKING AT ONCE]

766
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,998
SEE, GRINGO,

767
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:30,000
ALL WOMEN
WANT TO GET MARRIED,

768
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,002
NO MATTER WHAT
THEY SAY, RIGHT?

769
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,102
NOW, YOU KNOW
AND I KNOW

770
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:35,971
THAT THESE MARRIAGES
DON'’’T MEAN A THING.

771
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,007
I DIDN'’’T KNOW.

772
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:39,107
BUT IT
MAKES THEM HAPPY.

773
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:42,012
IT'’’S THE 11th TIME FOR ME, I THINK.

774
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:45,015
THE ONLY THING I WANT TO DO
IS MAKE THEM HAPPY.

775
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:47,240
THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT.

776
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,086
AND SO NOW,
MY CHILDREN,

777
01:09:51,121 --> 01:09:54,089
I PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

778
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,092
[CHEERING]...

779
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,599
...¡¡VIVA VILLA.

780
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,607
¡¡VIVA VILLA.

781
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:16,102
YOU REALLY GOTTA HAND IT
TO THAT FELLOW, THOUGH.

782
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:19,550
YES, SIR, YOU'’’VE REALLY
GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM.

783
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,650
HAND HIM WHAT?

784
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,555
PANCHO VILLA
IS A BANDIT, A BIGAMIST,

785
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,655
AND A BARBARIAN.

786
01:10:26,657 --> 01:10:28,058
IT TAKES
MORE THAN DUMB LUCK

787
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:30,526
TO TURN THAT
INTO A NATIONAL HERO.

788
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,063
THE CHILI PICKER'’’S
GOT BRAINS.

789
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:34,565
I MAY HAVE STEPPED
INTO A MANURE PILE,

790
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:38,033
BUT I JUST MIGHT COME UP
WITH THE GOLDEN HORSESHOE.

791
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,571
ONE OF THESE DAYS, THAT MAN'’’S
GONNA OWN THIS COUNTRY.

792
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:43,539
HE DOESN'’’T WANT
TO OWN THE COUNTRY.

793
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,575
HE DOESN'’’T?

794
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:48,644
NO. HE WANTS
THE PEOPLE TO OWN IT.

795
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,546
AFTER ALL
YOU'’’VE BEEN THROUGH,

796
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,082
YOU STILL BELIEVE
THAT HE'’’S FOR THE PEOPLE?

797
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:54,182
N.
HE'’’S A GOOD MA

798
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:57,244
HOW '’’BOUT ME?
AM I A GOOD MAN, TOO?

799
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,154
YES.

800
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,095
WELL, I'’’LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, HONEY.

801
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,097
I'’’M AS GOOD A MAN AS VILLA,
AND THAT'’’S NOT SAYING

802
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:10,257
A HELL OF A LOT
FOR EITHER ONE OF US.

803
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,168
I DON'’’T CARE
WHAT YOU ARE.

804
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,217
Gen. Huerta: THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

805
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,003
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

806
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,408
WHY?

807
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,409
TELL HIM
TO STAND UP.

808
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,446
STAND UP WHEN YOU
ADDRESS THE GENERAL,

809
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:57,546
DAMN YOU.

810
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:06,422
I AM GENERAL HUERTA
OF MADERO'’’S REPUBLICAN ARMY.

811
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:07,458
GET COLONEL VILLA.

812
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:09,558
WHO?

813
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,463
COLONEL FRANCISCO VILLA.

814
01:12:12,563 --> 01:12:15,531
HE IS TO
TURN PARRAL OVER TO ME,

815
01:12:15,566 --> 01:12:16,967
BY ORDER
OF PRESIDENT MADERO.

816
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:19,067
YOU UNDERSTAND?

817
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,540
NOW, WHERE IS VILLA?
GET HIM.

818
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,550
OHH.

819
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,559
HE'’’S NOT HERE.

820
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,499
I WILL FIND HIM
FOR YOU, THOUGH.

821
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:49,910
.
BUT I WARN YOU,

822
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,050
HE'’’S VERY HARD TO FIND

823
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,568
I WILL TRY.

824
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:14,590
COME ON.
YOU'’’RE TAKING ME TO MADERO.

825
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,026
WHAT?

826
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:18,028
HURRY UP.
GET YOUR PANTS ON.

827
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:19,995
HOW?

828
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,070
WELL, FIRST ONE LEG,
THEN THE OTHER.

829
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,535
WHERE IS MADERO?

830
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,036
MEXICO CITY.

831
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:29,104
MEXICO...

832
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:30,506
WHAT ABOUT
THE GASOLINE?

833
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:33,326
DON'’’T WORRY ABOUT
THE GASOLINE.

834
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,050
WHERE IS HE?

835
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,653
IN THE ANTEROOM,
MY PRESIDENT.

836
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,655
EXCUSE ME.

837
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,664
PANCHO, MY FRIEND,
CONGRATULATIONS.

838
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,166
WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL.

839
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:32,568
HAVE YOU EATEN?
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

840
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,604
NO, THANK YOU,
MY PRESIDENT.

841
01:14:33,704 --> 01:14:35,704
I'’’LL EAT LATER.

842
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,173
COME WITH ME.

843
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,702
WELL...WHAT IS IT?

844
01:15:06,737 --> 01:15:08,103
T.
DON'’’T MAKE ME DO I

845
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,203
DO WHAT?

846
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,643
DON'’’T MAKE ME
GIVE PARRAL

847
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:14,743
TO GENERAL HUERTA.

848
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,218
PANCHO, THIS IS DANGEROUS.

849
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,160
WHAT IS DANGEROUS?

850
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,470
YOUR CONFLICT WITH HUERTA.

851
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,666
HOW COULD I HAVE
A CONFLICT WITH HIM?

852
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:38,231
I HAVEN'’’T EVEN
SEEN THE MAN.

853
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,170
NOR DID ANYONE ELSE
IN PARRAL,

854
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,565
UNTIL AFTER
I TOOK THE CITY.

855
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,240
THEN HE CAME.

856
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,745
CAME.

857
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,185
PANCHO, PLEASE DON'’’T
MISUNDERSTAND ME.

858
01:15:55,285 --> 01:15:59,025
I'’’M HAPPY YOU'’’RE HERE,
VERY HAPPY, BUT...

859
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,156
YOU HAVE JUST CREATED
A TERRIBLE PROBLEM.

860
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,697
OH? YOU DON'’’T
WANT PARRAL?

861
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:08,797
OF COURSE I DO.

862
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:10,580
E,
BUT WHEN HUERTA FINDS OUT

863
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,703
THAT YOU'’’VE COME DIRECTLY TO M

864
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:17,673
HE WILL THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE PLOTTING BEHIND HIS BACK...

865
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,775
AND THAT'’’S DANGEROUS.

866
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,212
WHO THE HELL
IS HUERTA, ANYWAY?

867
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:24,780
DID HE WIN PARRAL?
NO.

868
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:26,717
HE'’’S NO GOOD.
HE DRINKS.

869
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:29,877
HE'’’S NOT FOR YOU,
JUST FOR HIMSELF.

870
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,223
DON'’’T PUT ME
UNDER HIS COMMAND.

871
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:35,726
GENERAL HUERTA IS HEAD
OF THE REPUBLICAN ARMY.

872
01:16:35,826 --> 01:16:38,228
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

873
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,230
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR WORD TO ME?

874
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,231
DON'’’T YOU
OWE ME SOMETHING?

875
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:43,233
I TOOK PARRAL
FOR YOU, NOT HUERTA.

876
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,628
NO NATION
CAN HAVE 2 ARMIES.

877
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,031
UNDER HUERTA, ONE ARMY
IS ONE TOO MANY.

878
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,621
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE
AGAINST HUERTA?

879
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:04,254
I DON'’’T THINK
HE'’’S LOYAL TO YOU.

880
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:06,256
YOU PERSONALLY KNOW
THAT GENERAL HUERTA

881
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:09,161
PLANS TO OVERTHROW
THE REVOLUTION?

882
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,829
NO, MY PRESIDENT.

883
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:15,766
HAS ANYONE INDICATED TO YOU,
EVEN BY RUMOR,

884
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:17,866
THAT HE HAS SUCH PLANS?

885
01:17:17,868 --> 01:17:19,269
NO, MY PRESIDENT.

886
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:21,369
THEN WHAT?

887
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,775
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
SPEAK UP.

888
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,778
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE.

889
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:29,745
FACTS.
I WANT FACTS.

890
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,225
GET OUT
OF THIS FANCY PALACE.

891
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,784
GIVE ME PROOF.

892
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,285
I CANNOT GIVE
YOU PROOF, BUT I KNOW.

893
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:37,385
I CAN SMELL IT. I KNOW.

894
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:50,365
PANCHO, DO YOU THINK THAT...

895
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,290
THAT I AM BETRAYING
THE REVOLUTION?

896
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,869
NO, BUT...

897
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:00,876
HOW CAN YOU TRUST HUERTA
AND NOT ME?

898
01:18:00,911 --> 01:18:03,378
YOU'’’RE MY PRESIDENT.

899
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:05,315
I ASK YOU

AH, VERY WELL,
MR. ARNOLD.

1079
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:42,616
BUT YOU NEGLECT
TO MENTION ONE THING.

1080
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:46,901
IT SEEMS THE AIRPLANE
WASN'’’T YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.

1081
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:51,060
COGNAC, MR. ARNOLD?

1082
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,627
I BELIEVE I WILL, YES.

1083
01:38:53,662 --> 01:38:56,065
ORDERLY, A COGNAC
FOR MR. ARNOLD.

1084
01:38:56,165 --> 01:38:59,133

1085
01:38:59,168 --> 01:39:01,070
YOU'’’LL BE PROVIDED

1086

TO THE AMERICAN CONSULATE
IN LAREDO.

1087
01:39:03,172 --> 01:39:05,574
FROM THERE, THEY WILL
CONDUCT YOU BACK TO EL PASO,

1088
01:39:05,674 --> 01:39:10,859
WHERE YOU WILL ANSWER TO CHARGES
OF GRAND THEFT, AMONG OTHERS.

1089
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:13,355
TO YOUR HEALTH,
MR. ARNOLD.

1090
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:18,652
I, UH--I DON'’’T SUPPOSE

1091
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:21,090
THERE'’’S ANYTHING I CAN
SAY THAT MIGHT, UH...

1092
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:22,591
I'’’M AFRAID NOT.

1093
01:39:22,691 --> 01:39:26,060
I'’’M DOUBLY SORRY,
MR. ARNOLD. I ASSURE YOU,

1094
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,562
WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU
HAVE DONE FOR THE REVOLUTION,

1095
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:31,100
BUT YOU MUST ALSO APPRECIATE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

1096
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,103
THAT I, UH...
OR MY GOVERNMENT, THAT IS,

1097
01:39:34,203 --> 01:39:37,571
MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

1098
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:39,108
YOU CAN SEE THAT,
CAN'’’T YOU?

1099
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:40,109
OH, YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

1100
01:39:40,209 --> 01:39:41,610
GOOD.

1101
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:43,710
YOU'’’RE UNDER ARREST.

1102
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,186
HEY, GRINGO...

1103
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:53,622
THAT'’’S ME.

1104
01:39:53,722 --> 01:39:55,722
LEARNING PRETTY FAST...

1105
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,126
PRETTY FAST.

1106
01:39:57,226 --> 01:39:58,627
YEAH,
YOU'’’RE ALL RIGHT.

1107
01:39:58,727 --> 01:40:00,629
YOU'’’LL BE ABLE
TO WRITE YOUR WILL

1108
01:40:00,729 --> 01:40:01,630
BEFORE THEY
SHOOT YOUR TAIL

1109
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:04,025
ALL OVER
THAT PARADE GROUND.

1110
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:10,601
YOU'’’VE GOT TO KNOW
SOMETHING I DON'’’T.

1111
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,147
ANSWER ME.

1112
01:40:18,247 --> 01:40:20,149
YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH HUERTA, HUH?

1113
01:40:20,249 --> 01:40:22,716
HE WON'’’T LET IT HAPPEN.

1114
01:40:22,751 --> 01:40:24,618
OH, HE WON'’’T?

1115
01:40:24,718 --> 01:40:26,718
HOW?

1116
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:27,656
HE WON'’’T.

1117
01:40:27,756 --> 01:40:29,756
[SIGHS] CHIEF...

1118
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:32,161
MADERO IS A LONG WAY
FROM HERE.

1119
01:40:32,261 --> 01:40:33,515
Y.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1120
01:40:33,615 --> 01:40:34,628
HE'’’S IN MEXICO CIT

1121
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:36,665
NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU
AND MR. MADERO

1122
01:40:36,765 --> 01:40:38,167
ARE THE BEST
OF FRIENDS,

1123
01:40:38,267 --> 01:40:40,169
NOBODY HAS ANY MORE
RESPECT FOR THE MAN

1124
01:40:40,269 --> 01:40:43,237
THAN I DO, BUT,
UH, IT WOULDN'’’T

1125
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:45,174
BE THE FIRST TIME
IN THIS REVOLUTION

1126
01:40:45,274 --> 01:40:47,176
THAT SOMEBODY FORGOT
TO PROTECT A FRIEND,

1127
01:40:47,276 --> 01:40:48,677
NOW, WOULD IT?

1128
01:40:48,777 --> 01:40:51,745
GRINGO, YOU'’’RE DUMB.

1129
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,780
ALL RIGHT.

1130
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:55,649
I MAY BE.

1131
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:57,686
BUT YOU THINK ABOUT
WHAT I JUST SAID, HUH?

1132
01:40:57,786 --> 01:41:00,254
[SIGHS]

1133
01:41:00,289 --> 01:41:03,657
MADERO WON'’’T PROTECT ME
JUST BECAUSE HE'’’S A FRIEND.

1134
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:04,693
NO?

1135
01:41:04,793 --> 01:41:07,261
OF COURSE NOT.

1136
01:41:07,296 --> 01:41:10,199
NOW, TO BE SHOT,
I HAVE TO BE SENTENCED.

1137
01:41:10,299 --> 01:41:12,701
TO BE SENTENCED,
I HAVE TO BE TRIED.

1138
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:15,204
TO BE TRIED,
I HAVE TO BE ACCUSED

1139
01:41:15,304 --> 01:41:17,206
OF HAVING DONE
SOMETHING WRONG.

1140
01:41:17,306 --> 01:41:19,208
NOW, ALL THIS
TAKES A LONG TIME.

1141
01:41:19,308 --> 01:41:21,710
BESIDES, I HAVEN'’’T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

1142
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:25,779
BUT EVEN IF I HAD,
MADERO WOULD PROTECT ME,

1143
01:41:25,814 --> 01:41:30,219
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'’’T WANT A MAN
TO BE DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS.

1144
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,686
HE WON'’’T STAND FOR INJUSTICE,

1145
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:35,224
SO HUERTA CANNOT
SHOOT ME TOMORROW.

1146
01:41:35,324 --> 01:41:37,324
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1147
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,794
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

1148
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:44,490
D.
I UNDERSTAND

1149
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,630
YOU'’’RE OUT OF YOUR MIN

1150
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:50,302
CHIEF...

1151
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:51,240
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

1152
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,241
IS TO GET THE WORD
TO YOUR MEN,

1153
01:41:52,341 --> 01:41:53,742
AND THEY'’’LL HAVE Y
OU OUTTA HERE.

1154
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:54,743
IT'’’S THAT SIMPLE.

1155
01:41:54,843 --> 01:41:56,245
IT'’’S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

1156
01:41:56,345 --> 01:41:59,713
WELL, YOU CAN'’’T FIGHT
FOR THE REVOLUTION

1157
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:00,749
IF YOU'’’RE DEAD.

1158
01:42:00,849 --> 01:42:05,319
I'’’M FIGHTING FOR IT
RIGHT NOW, HERE.

1159
01:42:05,354 --> 01:42:08,757
THIS IS UNJUST,
TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY LIBERTY.

1160
01:42:08,857 --> 01:42:10,857
YOUR LIBERTY?

1161
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:13,327
WHAT'’’S THAT?

1162
01:42:13,362 --> 01:42:19,333
'LIBERTY IS THE RESPECT
FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.'

1163
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:22,336
THAT IS WHAT
BENITO JUAREZ SAID.

1164
01:42:22,371 --> 01:42:24,273
THAT IS WHAT MADERO
BELIEVES IN.

1165
01:42:24,373 --> 01:42:26,775
THAT'’’S WHAT WE'’’VE
BEEN FIGHTING FOR.

1166
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:29,278
NOW, IF I WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT A TRIAL,

1167
01:42:29,378 --> 01:42:32,846
I DENY THAT
AND BEHAVE LIKE A BANDIT.

1168
01:42:32,881 --> 01:42:36,285
WELL, JUST WHEN HAVE YOU
STOPPED BEING A BANDIT?

1169
01:42:36,385 --> 01:42:37,751
WHAT ABOUT
THAT LITTLE CAPER

1170
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,788
UP IN CONEJOS
THE OTHER DAY?

1171
01:42:39,888 --> 01:42:44,858
THOSE MEN WERE TRAITORS,
AND HUERTA KNOWS IT VERY WELL--

1172
01:42:44,893 --> 01:42:48,123
THERE'’’S NO POINT
IN TALKING ABOUT IT.

1173
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:51,865
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME,
CHIEF?

1174
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,302
HOW '’’BOUT ME?

1175
01:42:53,402 --> 01:42:55,769
I'’’M ONE OF YOUR MEN,
TOO, RIGHT?

1176
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:56,770
SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO YOU,

1177
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,307
THEY MAY
AS WELL SHOOT ME.

1178
01:42:58,407 --> 01:43:00,809
I'’’M DEPRIVED OF 20 YEA
RS OF MY LIBERTY.

1179
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:03,312
I'’’VE GOT NOTHING.
I'’’VE GOT NO--NO PLANE,

1180
01:43:03,412 --> 01:43:04,313
NO MONEY.

1181
01:43:04,413 --> 01:43:06,413
I WIND UP WITH NOTHING.

1182
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:13,887
GRINGO...

1183
01:43:13,922 --> 01:43:16,890
YOU NEVER
DID HAVE ANYTHING.

1184
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:21,895
YOU HAVE LIVED
JUST FOR YOURSELF,

1185
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,398
NOT FOR A CAUSE,

1186
01:43:24,433 --> 01:43:26,433
NOT EVEN FOR A WOMAN.

1187
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:32,406
WHY, YOU HYPOCRITICAL,
FATHEADED GREASEBALL,

THE NEW PRESIDENT OF MEXICO?

1344
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,123
THE SAME GENERAL HUERTA.

1345
01:54:55,223 --> 01:54:58,126
PRETTY FUNNY GAMES
THEY PLAY DOWN THERE, HUH?

1346
01:54:58,226 --> 01:55:00,226
WHAT ABOUT VILLA?

1347
01:55:00,228 --> 01:55:02,130
YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM--PANCHO VILLA?

1348
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:04,230
YEAH, YEAH. HE, UH...

1349
01:55:04,232 --> 01:55:06,134
HE ESCAPED FROM JAIL
IN MEXICO CITY.

1350
01:55:06,234 --> 01:55:08,136
HUERTA HAS PRACTICALLY
HIS ENTIRE ARMY

1351
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:09,602
LOOKING FOR HIM.

1352
01:55:09,702 --> 01:55:11,139

PRETTY BAD, HUH?

1353
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:13,239

LEE, IS THIS VILLA
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

1356
01:55:19,247 --> 01:55:21,247
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

1357
01:55:35,728 --> 01:55:39,132
WELL, AND THEN I HAD TO
FIND SOMETHING TO WEAR

1358
01:55:39,232 --> 01:55:40,668
WITH THE NEW JEWELED
COLLAR DADDY BOUGHT ME.

1359
01:55:40,768 --> 01:55:42,170
AND I WAS SO WORRIED

1360
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,172
ABOUT FINDING EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING,

1361
01:55:44,272 --> 01:55:46,174
WELL, IN EL PASO,
ESPECIALLY,

1362
01:55:46,274 --> 01:55:48,176
BUT THEN
I SAW THIS GOWN.

1363
01:55:48,276 --> 01:55:50,643
IT WAS IN A LITTLE SHOP
RIGHT CATTY-CORNER

1364
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:52,180
FROM THE HOTEL,
OF ALL PLACES.

1365
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,248
OH, IT'’’S MARVELOUS.

1366
01:55:55,283 --> 01:55:56,684
T,
IT'’’S PITCH-BLACK VELVE

1367
01:55:56,784 --> 01:55:58,784
YARDS AND YARDS OF IT,

1368
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:01,189

1369
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:03,756
AND, OH, I JUST LOVE IT.

1370
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:06,259

1371
01:56:06,294 --> 01:56:08,761

BUT I JUST
HAD TO BUY IT. ANYWAY,

1376
01:56:15,803 --> 01:56:18,171
DADDY SAYS THERE'’’S GON

01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,207

01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:26,279
HEY, DARLIN'’’...

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
'DO WHAT'?

1403
01:57:31,879 --> 01:57:32,780
TAKE IT.

1404
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,880
GET RID OF HUERTA.

1405
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:38,851
YOU SEE, WE THOUGHT...

1406
01:57:38,886 --> 01:57:41,289
WITH OUR MONEY THAT YOU'’’VE
BEEN KEEPING FOR US,

1407
01:57:41,389 --> 01:57:42,790
WE WILL BUY GUNS.

1408
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:44,792
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE,

1409
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:46,294
WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'’’S ALL OVER.

1410
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:47,760
CAN'’’T YOU SEE THAT?

1411
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:49,797
THE REVOLUTION
IS FINISHED.

1412
01:57:49,897 --> 01:57:52,265
YOU GAVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT, CHIEF,

1413
01:57:52,365 --> 01:57:54,802
BUT AFTER ALL, HUERTA'’’
S SITTING IN THAT PALACE,

1414
01:57:54,902 --> 01:57:55,803
AND MADERO IS DEAD,

1415
01:57:55,903 --> 01:57:57,305
AND THERE'’’S NO WAY
IN THE WORLD

1416
01:57:57,405 --> 01:57:59,307
YOU THREE ARE GONNA
CHANGE THAT. NO WAY.

1417
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:02,375
WE WOULD LIKE OUR MONEY,
GRINGO.

1418
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:05,555
[SHOUTING] I WOULDN'’’T

1419
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:08,881

01:58:08,916 --> 01:58:10,318
WHAT FOR?

1421
01:58:10,418 --> 01:58:12,785
TO GO DOWN THERE AND SHOOT
UP A LOT OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE

1422
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:15,823
JUST SO SOME OTHER DICTATOR
CAN CALL HIMSELF PRESIDENT?

1423
01:58:15,923 --> 01:58:19,392
