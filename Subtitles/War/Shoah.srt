At my transport, I was waiting, already naked.</i>

1187

<i>A man came over and asked,
“You, you, you, step out.”</i>

1188

<i>We stepped out,</i>

1189

1190
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:26,287
<i>Some of the people from the transport,</i>

1191

<i>they had an idea what is going on,</i>

1192
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:33,912
<i>and they know already
that they will not stay alive.</i>

1193

The cries and the hollers

1200

for days and days,

1201
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,825
and, at night, the same thing.

1202
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:13,410
From that hollering, you could not
even sleep a couple night of that.

<i>Like everything was dead.</i>

Then, they told us
to make clean the whole place.

1210
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:11,555
It was about 2,000 people

1211

which they undressed on the outside.

1212

To take the whole thing away
and to clear up the place,

1213
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:25,069

faster to the main place,

<i>His armband said, “Squad Leader.”</i>

1242
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,473
<i>He shouted,</i>

1243

<i>and I understood that I was also
to pick up clothing, bundle it,</i>

1244

<i>and take it somewhere.</i>

1245
01:50:12,397 --> 01:50:15,947

<i>"What is going on?

1247

<i>And he replied, “Dead! AH dead!”</i>

1248
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:33,754
<i>But it still hadn't sunk in,
I didn't believe it.</i>

01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:41,970
<i>It was the first time
I'd heard Yiddish spoken.</i>

1251
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:48,976
He didn't say it very loud,

1252
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:54,941
and I saw he had tears in his eyes.

1253
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:59,829
Suddenly he started shouting

1254
01:50:59,903 --> 01:51:01,905
and raised his whip.

1255
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:07,208
Out of the corner of my eyes,
I saw an SS man coming.

1256
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:11,416
And I understood
that I was to ask no more questions,

1257
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:18,014

with the package.

It was impossible to say something

“Richard, my father, mother, brother...”

and without any guilt of the people,

1328
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:19,810
because the people were not guilty at all.

1329

The only guilt from them was
because they were Jewish people.

in the same barrack.

I picked up a poker

1688
02:26:32,951 --> 02:26:35,670
and did as he was doing.

1689
02:26:35,745 --> 02:26:38,089
[ Lanzmann ]
A poker?

1690
02:26:38,164 --> 02:26:40,132
A steel poker.

1691
02:26:41,209 --> 02:26:44,634
I obeyed Fischel's order.

1692
02:26:44,713 --> 02:26:49,765
At that point I was in shock
as if I'd been hypnotized,

1693
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:56,313
ready to do

1694
02:26:56,391 --> 02:26:58,894
whatever I was told.

1695
02:26:58,977 --> 02:27:05,701
I was so mindless, so horrified

1696
02:27:05,775 --> 02:27:13,876
that I did everything Fischel told me.

1697
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,413
So the ovens were fed,

1698
02:27:18,163 --> 02:27:21,963
but we were so inexperienced

1699
02:27:23,001 --> 02:27:31,477
that we left the fans on too long.

1700
02:27:31,718 --> 02:27:34,767
- The fans?
- Yes.

1701
02:27:34,846 --> 02:27:39,147
There were fans to make the fire hotter.
- Mm-hmm.

1702
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:43,526
They worked too long...

1703
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:48,907
The firebrick suddenly exploded,

1704
02:27:49,903 --> 02:27:55,125
blocking the pipes

1705
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,625
linking the Auschwitz crematorium

1706
02:27:59,412 --> 02:28:02,712
with the smokestack.

1707
02:28:04,626 --> 02:28:08,847
<i>Cremation was interrupted.</i>

1708
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:13,139
<i>The ovens were out of action.</i>

1709
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:20,191
<i>That evening, some trucks came,</i>

1710
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:22,898
<i>and we had to load the rest,</i>

1711
02:28:22,977 --> 02:28:26,072
<i>some 300 bodies,</i>

1712
02:28:26,147 --> 02:28:29,071
<i>into the trucks.</i>

1713
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:34,156
<i>Then we were taken...</i>

1714
02:28:36,157 --> 02:28:39,252
<i>I still don't know where...</i>

1715
02:28:39,327 --> 02:28:44,299
<i>but probably to a field at Birkenau.</i>

1716
02:28:48,586 --> 02:28:55,014
<i>We were ordered
to unload the bodies</i>

1717
02:28:55,343 --> 02:29:01,726
<i>and put them in a pit.</i>

1718
02:29:02,308 --> 02:29:06,279
<i>There was a ditch, an artificial pit.</i>

1719
02:29:06,354 --> 02:29:09,904
<i>Suddenly, water gushed up
from underground</i>

1720
02:29:09,983 --> 02:29:13,203
<i>and swept the bodies down.</i>

1721
02:29:18,658 --> 02:29:23,585
<i>When night came,
we had to stop that horrible work.</i>

1722
02:29:24,539 --> 02:29:27,042
<i>We were loaded into the trucks</i>

1723
02:29:27,125 --> 02:29:31,551
<i>and returned to Auschwitz.</i>

1724
02:29:36,176 --> 02:29:37,849
<i>The next day,</i>

1725
02:29:38,136 --> 02:29:44,769
<i>we were taken to the same place.</i>

1726
02:29:52,567 --> 02:29:55,571
<i>But the water had risen.</i>

1727
02:29:57,238 --> 02:30:01,118
<i>Some SS men came
with a fire truck</i>

1728
02:30:01,201 --> 02:30:04,705
<i>and pumped out the water.</i>

1729
02:30:05,955 --> 02:30:10,005
<i>We had to go down
into that muddy pit</i>

1730
02:30:10,084 --> 02:30:13,805
<i>to stack up the bodies.</i>

1731
02:30:17,091 --> 02:30:18,843
But they were slimy.

1732
02:30:18,927 --> 02:30:23,353
For example, I grasped a woman,

1733
02:30:23,431 --> 02:30:25,775
but her hands...

1734
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,194
Her hand was slippery, slimy.

1735
02:30:28,269 --> 02:30:30,863
I tried to pull her,

1736
02:30:30,939 --> 02:30:37,618
but I fell over backward,
into the water, the mud.

1737
02:30:39,197 --> 02:30:41,700
It was the same for all of us.

1738
02:30:41,783 --> 02:30:47,881
Up above, at the edge of the pit,
Aumeyer and Grabner yelled,

1739
02:30:47,956 --> 02:30:51,961
“Get cracking, you filth, you bastards!

1740
02:30:52,043 --> 02:30:56,719
We'll show you, you bunch of shits!”

1741
02:30:56,798 --> 02:30:59,972
These were the names they were calling us.

1742
02:31:00,301 --> 02:31:02,144
And in these...

in the mud.

1751
02:31:37,839 --> 02:31:41,764
Aumeyer called one of his SS men.

1752
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:45,689
“Go on, finish off those swine!”

1753
02:31:48,641 --> 02:31:53,192
They were exhausted.
And they were shot in the pit.
