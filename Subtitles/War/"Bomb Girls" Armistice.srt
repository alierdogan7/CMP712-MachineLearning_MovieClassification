1
00:00:00,693 --> 00:00:01,897
Oh well would you look at this.

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,251
Oh Archie don't, leave it.

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,068
LORNA: I have two sons overseas.

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,754
They're alive !!

5
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:08,888
Well Yeah.

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,297
Girls these days haven't figured beauty's
in what a woman hides.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,609
Witham foods has unparallelled food supply contacts.

8
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,426
Together we'll make millions.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,676
Last night was the best of my life.

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,426
Marry me Gladys, the woman that I can cling to
while I'm over there.

11
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,592
Unless you're in a uniform nobody sees you
as a man, they think I'm a coward.

12
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,926
An affair with Hazel somehow
proves that you're not.

13
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,860
What if I were the one that strayed, what
would you do ?

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,109
Don't make me answer that.

15
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,491
I thought Lewis had forgotten all about
me look at this.

16
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,032
Thirteen letters, a bakers dozen.

17
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,194
When a soldiers mail comes it comes in spurts.

18
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:45,906
Betty !!

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,782
The censors are so heavy handed.

20
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,706
I thought you were engaged to a rich
American.

21
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,593
Well now she's engaged twice.

22
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:54,048
Is he romancing you ?

23
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,157
Truth be told it's mostly about food.

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,456
"There's not much beef to be had in the
market and eggs are a dollar a dozen"

25
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,423
Boy the guy oooozes charm.

26
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:05,329
How am I to write him back if I want to
stay true to James ?

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,844
You should have thought of that before you
gave him my address.

28
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:13,300
" I dream of holding you in my arms to
once again kiss your ............... "

29
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:19,430
Oh my, soldiers don't write me letters like that.

30
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,681
It's your day off Lorna, have some fun.

31
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,580
You can't be here I have neighbours, thin walls !!

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,222
And what'll they say huh ?

33
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:35,179
What'll they say about a poor Pusan who's bringing
fresh Pomadories from his victory garden ?

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,080
My husband could come home
from the Legion any minute.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,504
Well then we'll make him an Egg Plant Parmigiana.

36
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,081
No we won't make him anything.

37
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,385
You gotta take these, their from my best batch.

38
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,614
Marco, what happened the other
night, that was a mistake.

39
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:45,709
I'm married.

40
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,786
If I thought it wasn't written
in your body I wouldn't be here.

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,332
Oh you don't make this easy.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,210
Then I'm doin' it right.

43
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,553
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.

44
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:08,745
My God, stay here.

45
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,645
Thank you for the delivery.

46
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,162
Military telegram.

47
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:37,037
Hey don't worry about it, there's plenty
of reasons for them to send a cable.

48
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,162
Must be about my boys.

49
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:42,225
- Here
- No !!

50
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:48,162
I have to wait for Bob,
this is for him and me.

51
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,259
You need to go.

52
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,600
You shouldn't be alone Lorna.

53
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,463
Please Marco, this has nothing to do with you.

54
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,214
Please.

55
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,255
This family understands soldiers Major,

56
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:34,068
unlike another grocery firm
which shall go unmentioned.

57
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,339
I'll mention it "Steinem"

58
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,261
Game face Gladys, the army just sprung the news,

59
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,887
their awarding the rations
contract in the next 48 hours,

60
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,761
it's down to us and the Steinems.

61
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:48,325
I'll take it, I'll take it.

62
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:50,559
Those are the rations James
and daddy manufactured ?

63
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,981
Indeed.

64
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,699
Swanky.

65
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,499
Your father thinks the product
speaks for itself but

66
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:59,150
until the ink is dry
presentation is everything.

67
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,308
Give them a big smile Mrs. Witham.

68
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,713
I'd show them some leg if I thought it would help.

69
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:08,688
Your fathers playing up his time in
the great war for all it's worth.

70
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:11,012
I think he had a rather cushy
time of it to tell the truth.

71
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,514
According to him he defeated
the Huns single handedly.

72
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,247
The naybobs here are lapping it up.

73
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,625
So he's paving his way with lies.

74
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,848
Gladys, we need this win, this
contract will set us up for life.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,248
Come James, the Colonel seems to think
your the brains of the outfit.

76
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:27,828
Oh he is father.

77
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,974
You too Glady, I told them
about your war effort as well.

78
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,749
Even if you're only sorting
files in a munitions factory.

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,732
Only.

80
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:39,686
Now there's the fire we need.

81
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:55,429
Gin ....... I'll take those.

82
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,454
No need for coppers where I'm Goin'.

83
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,642
You're gettin' outa here in a coupla days.

84
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:04,765
I not gonna live like this, Archie,

85
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:07,501
not out there in the big bad world.

86
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:10,314
You know what I'm working with.

87
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,644
Fancy a kiss ?

88
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,266
Maybe I do.

89
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:24,177
With my luck this scar
will travel to my eye.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,189
Tonights pills makes 39, tomorrows
40, 40 winks to follow.

91
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,832
40 winks forever.

92
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:52,010
Whatya wanna do, about our Two year anniversary ?

93
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,759
Surprise me, you always do.

94
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,399
VOICES: Just drop that mess in the kitchen,

95
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,029
we'll deal with it later.

96
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,058
Nearly caught by the help.

97
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,166
These aren't the rations we ate,

98
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,321
they've gone off.

99
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,997
That's why we couldn't serve em'.

100
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:21,681
Still a few kinks we have to iron out
before we go into full production.

101
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,232
They're out there conning the
army with tricked out fakes.

102
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:27,280
They're enjoying French Pate
mixed with Broiled Brisket.

103
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,731
They're just rations Gladys.

104
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,606
Who knows if the soldiers will
even need to eat this stuff.

105
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,043
James, I know that soldiers
are obsessed with food.

106
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:40,043
Most times a decent meals the
only pleasure they see in a day.

107
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,454
They're out there living off a dogs breakfast,

108
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,282
what kind of army are we gonna have ?

109
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:48,533
What kind of business am I going to
have if we can't make a profit ?

110
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:53,472
Oh yeah, go on then, eat it yourself.

111
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,411
We'll fix the rations once we
get into production I promise.

112
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,481
DOOR CLOSES

113
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,203
Bob, you back ?

114
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,372
Oh dammit, where are you ?

115
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,373
You reek of drink, you know that ?

116
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,141
This telegram came last night,

117
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,436
and where were you, out getting
drunk with your buddies.

118
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,296
Is it the boys ?

119
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,752
I don't know but it won't
be any good will it.

120
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,624
Nobody ever delivers
good news in a telegram.

121
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,687
I fell asleep waiting !!

122
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,642
I couldn't open it without you.

123
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,655
You've got to be kidding me.

124
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,327
What is it ?

125
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:06,937
They're handing out the tin already ..... military medal.

126
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:17,611
" For courage and utter disregard for personal safety"

127
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:23,938
Stanley risked his life to
save someone elses, he's okay.

128
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,394
LORNA: He must be in North Africa

129
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:31,208
Barely into this mess and they're already
givin' out medals like gum drops.

130
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,162
Stanley's a hero, huh, Stanley.

131
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:40,566
It's a game Lorna ......it's like
kids swappin' baseball cards.

132
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,785
Is your heart so dead you
can't even take a moment

133
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,737
to feel proud of the man our sons become.

134
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,486
I'm relieved as hell but it doesn't make me blind

135
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:57,665
to the war machine buying off our boys with bits of brass.

136
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:01,663
Since when do you get dressed up for work ?

137
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,960
Just showing a little pride Bob.

138
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,896
Leon.... your singing at the canteen dance was amazing.

139
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,192
LEON: Uhhh it's good of ya to say

140
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,176
I wish I could sing like that.

141
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:26,256
That'd be a novelty act, you look the
way you do sounding the way I do.

142
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:32,147
I wonder, do you think I might ever be
good enough to sing with the band ?

143
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:37,147
Uh huh hmmm ..... yeah, let me know when you find one.

144
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:45,089
- Hey Kate.
- Hey hi

145
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:51,239
Lorna ... Lorna the telegram, I'm worried.

146
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,604
It was good news,

147
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:55,008
my boy Stanley got the military medal for bravery.

148
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,333
Then you must be relieved, and proud.

149
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,084
I am, very.

150
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:02,892
Maybe I was your good luck charm.

151
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,142
Be careful Mr. Moretti.

152
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,000
I always am.

153
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,249
KATE: Letters mean so much to soldiers
even when they don't know a girl they

154
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,857
like knowing someone's thinking of them.

155
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:30,701
GLADYS: But I do know this soldier, it makes writing
to him worse because I'd be lying to 2 people.

156
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:34,000
KATE: You can't break his heart
before he goes into battle.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,108
GLADYS: Does seem a wretched thing to do.

158
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:40,829
Stop by tonight,t I'll show you some of the letters
the girls at the rooming house write the boys.

159
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,940
That'd be swell.

160
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,512
I'll even nick a few bottles of bubbly for your trouble.

161
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,061
- Champagne
- Yeah

162
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:56,271
Another one pregnant.

163
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,974
Well, happy news for the husband.

164
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,985
Her husband shipped out a year ago.

165
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:04,843
I don't know where your girls find all these men.

166
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,476
I sure would like to have a few
of them around here though.

167
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,860
Perhaps love would be a better recruitment tool.

168
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,062
What about you, Mrs Corbett ?

169
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,646
How's your heart these days ?

170
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,915
Strong and able.

171
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,894
Not bursting with emotion ?

172
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:26,236
I don't know what you're insinuating.

173
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:30,314
Well your son, he's one of our first
boys to receive the military medal.

174
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,206
Ah yes we're very proud.

175
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:38,478
Which makes you the perfect speaker for
the factories armistice day service

176
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:42,583
11am on the 11th, the boss has approved the work stoppage.

177
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,675
I'm hardly the type to give speeches sir.

178
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:49,666
You're exactly the kind of woman
our workers need to hear from.

179
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,517
And uh, families welcome, we're clearing the

180
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:57,877
line to make it safe for civies and veterans.

181
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,175
JAMES: It's me

182
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,878
Come in.

183
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,785
Your mother said I could come up.

184
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:12,097
Our business won't take long, sure
you don't want to go out later.

185
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,755
GLADYS: Sorry, girls night.

186
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:15,268
We still quarreling ?

187
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,898
GLADYS: That depends, are the rations still vile ?

188
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,990
Vile is a little strong.

189
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,675
GLADYS: So was the smell.

190
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,990
I spoke to a manager at Tenants plant, he says the
canning sealant has a 3 per cent spoilage rate.

191
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,926
GLADYS: And ?

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,228
And increasing the thickness of the seal
would reduce the risks substantially.

193
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,426
GLADYS: It's simple, increase the seal.

194
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,458
Except the process is more costly.

195
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,304
GLADYS: But you know it's
the right thing to do.

196
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,879
GLADYS: James if you win this contract ......

197
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,770
There's no if, I'm here to sign it.

198
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:57,380
Withams is now the official supplier of
quality rations to our men overseas.

199
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,805
I want to congratulate you but if
those rations aren't improved.

200
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:05,029
We won't poison our troops Gladys.

201
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,021
As you say, they do so much for us.

202
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:16,033
We are all asked to make sacrifices

203
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:26,487
and while not every sacrifice is rewarded ........
it is our duty to do so.

204
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,412
I'll tell you how armistice day should be marked,

205
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:36,784
they should drag out the bodies of about 200
teenage boys scatter 'em in the streets

206
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:40,175
and let the rats have a go at 'em
that'd be something worth remembering.

207
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,317
It's been 25 years Bob, 25 years since you went over that god dammed trench,

208
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:50,238
we have raised 3 children, buried our parents and somehow managed

209
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,804
to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads.

210
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,197
But it's like non of that ever happened, non of it

211
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,774
because you see everything through the lens

212
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:00,338
of a few terrible months you had 25 years ago !!!

213
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,008
You have no idea what that war .......

214
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:08,427
Because you'd never tell me, I asked, I
hinted, I tried and then finally I gave up !!!

215
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,286
You want drag you in to to live
again to some muddy gash of earth,

216
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,335
tell you how everything bled out
on me the day I did my duty

217
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:17,867
and jumped over that trench well I
won't do it, no decent man would !!!

218
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,838
Yeah well I think a decent father ......... !!!!

219
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,037
Don't you start with ........... !!!

220
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,510
A decent father would let go of his own pain

221
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:29,117
when his learned what a brave
and honorable son he raised !!!

222
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,679
- To our boys.
- To our boys !

224
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,531
So it isn't half bad.

225
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:07,341
Careful Betts, champagne has a terrible
reputation for giving girls terrible reputations.

226
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,902
Not to mention terrible hand writing,

227
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:12,138
I can barely read what you've
written these last Two soldiers.

228
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,930
Gladys give us what you've got.

229
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,978
GLADYS READING: " Dear Lewis, how
lovely to receive your letters,

230
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,478
each time I read one I feel closer to you "

231
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,540
BETTY: Though not as close as you got
when you mauled me against a brick wall.

232
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
KATE: Betty !!

233
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,950
GLADYS READING: " closer to you and proud of the sacrifice
you are making for the safety of our nation. "

234
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,029
So Poetic, you'll stoke his heart Gladys.

235
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,667
Especially if his hearts a
little lower than it once was.

236
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,903
I think I'm walking the line impeccably,

237
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,884
cheering him up without leading him on.

238
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:47,871
KATE: You should send him some photos.

239
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,061
Now that would give him false hope.

240
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,932
Oh give him a kick where it counts.

241
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:55,541
Want a kick, lets go see Leon and his band play.

242
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,325
You know where Leon plays ?

243
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:00,266
I got a rough idea, yeah.

244
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:03,729
Isn't it a bit late.

245
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,385
No one said you had to come.

246
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:13,781
You girls hold the fort.

247
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,246

Are we business men or charity carers ?

254
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:41,013
I'm all for healthy profits but it'll cost us less to fix now

255
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,482
than if the government forces us to do it later.

256
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:46,124
James you were the one that had a
problem with this spoilage issue.

257
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,998
97 per cent of this product is flawless,

258
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,395
good enough for any man, especially a soldier.

259
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,326
If you don't like risks don't be a soldier.

260
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,375
I've changed my attitude.

You should be sleeping ?

And Archie should be on the mend.

DOCTOR: We think it's Sepsis, which means his whole body

How about the pain he's in,
can't you do anything ?

Next thing you know she'll move out
of the rooming house and go on tour.

297

importance on this speech Lorna.

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,680

GLADYS: My fiancee found the
letters Lewis wrote from overseas.

323
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,541
Maybe I miscounted, after all
he would have said something.

324
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,406
- So you say something first, tell him you were just .....
- Randy

325
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:01,933
Patriotic !

326
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,774
No fiances going to understand that much patriotism.

We're having dinner tonight,
it's our Two year anniversary.

329
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:22,596
BUZZER SOUNDS.

330

Yeah.

00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,013
Betty at the door ba deep ba
door ba beep ba doeee yaaa.

345
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,439
That's scat singing.

346
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, I've heard about it.

347
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,702
I think I'm getting the hang of it not exactly
Ella singing mr Paganini yet but .......

348
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:47,092
Scatting, singing the blues .......

349
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,561
Not everybody can do it.

350
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:55,501
Betty , you sound kind of prejudiced.

351
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,421
Kate  it's a bad idea,

352
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:04,974
goin' to sing at the club you make one little
mistake and they will tear you to shreds.

353
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,660
That's not the impression I got from Leon.

354
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,484
Yeah well he'd have his own reasons for
giving you a different impression.

355
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:13,691
He's been nothing but decent to me.

356
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:14,842
I'm just trying to spare you.

357
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,534
From what, happiness ?

358
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,284
No, from getting hurt.

359
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:24,563
I found something I love, I don't
care if I fall on my face.

360
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:41,376
Did I surprise you with my restaurant choice ?

361
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,550
You surprised me alright.

362
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:49,987
You haven't said anything about
how your present looks on me.

363
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:53,987
The ear rings, they look lovely.

364
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,206
You always look beautiful.

365
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:59,082
Thank you.

366
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:06,255
I see you got some mail.

367
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:09,924
Go on, it seems I'm not the
only one who thinks so.

368
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:11,598
Oh James.

369
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,333
You can do better than that,

370
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,725
you're never at a loss for words.

371
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:21,346
He was an airman, shipped out
the next day, he was scared.

372
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,237
He needed to know that somebody would
care for him while he was overseas,

373
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,739
somehow that became me.

374
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,855
Somehow, I told you about
Hazel, I prostrated myself

375
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:34,303
before you and all the time
your the cat who got the cream.

376
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,379
Huh !!!

377
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,901
It happened so quickly.

378
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,195
You promised to marry him !!!!

379
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:48,256
It was only words, they didn't mean anything.

380
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,879
Apparently none of them do.

381
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,007
You can keep the engagement ring.

382
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:02,629
James please.

383
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:06,054
Please get out of the car.

384
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:29,881
Harps ?

385
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,631
Bag pipes, it's Armistice day dope.

386
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,428
Hey you're still here.

387
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,758
I told you, I'm waitin' until you get better.

388
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,774
COUGHES

389
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:44,993
Okay, shhh

390
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:49,041
It's got a hold of me Vera, I can't do it.

391
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,044
Sure you can, this can turn around.

392
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:57,882
You got a choice Vera, I got none.

393
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:03,029
You gotta help me Vera, I'm not gonna make it.

394
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:12,510
Okay .......... okay.

395
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,710
Lorna !

396
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:32,337
I barely recognised you, quite the show huh ?

397
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,565
Your family here ?

398
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:35,027
No they were busy sir.

399
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,892
Shame, I'd like to meet your husband.

400
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,432
A soldier who survived the
Somme, far too few of them.

401
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:44,980
I lost my brother and Three
cousins there, excuse me.

402
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,752
Which one of us has been asked to
make sacrifices at times when they

403
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:57,253
seem impossible but it is our duty to think of ...
.................

404
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,400
Marco, someone will see.

405
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,876
Mama mia who is this woman ?

406
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,974
I don't know her anymore.

407
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,429
I'm gonna find us a place.

408
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:19,913
Make it soon.

409
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,195
Look there's mum, doesn't
her new dress look swell.

410
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,944
Let's get up front.

411
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:45,291
Uh no, take me over there.

412
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,506
I don't want to be in the line of fire
when all the show boating starts.

413
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:58,335
BAG PIPES PLAYING

414
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:07,634
Good morning family friends and co workers.

415
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:11,726
I am honored to be addressing you today.

416
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:17,244
This is a time ..................

417
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:29,336
A time when each one of us has
been asked to make sacrifices.

418
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:33,698
At times they may seem impossible,

419
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:38,636
but it is our duty to think of the greater good.

420
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:48,609
Forget our solitary, I'm a little nervous,
my husband is here I .......................

421
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:54,909
I didn't expect that.

422
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,029
We're a typical married couple

423
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:01,478
neither one of us knowing what the other ones doing.

424
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:22,416
Bob doesn't have much use for this kind of ceremony.

425
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:27,447
When he came back from the first
war he was badly injured and felt

426
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:32,619
like everything that had happened
to him had been for nothing.

427
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:38,389
Sometimes I can see how he'd
feel like that used and spat out

428
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:43,416
by folks who honestly couldn't
give a damn if he lived or died.

429
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:49,079
But if he hadn't fought in that
war, if all those other soldiers

430
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:55,949
hadn't made their sacrifice, we
wouldn't be standing here today.

431
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,470
I have Two sons overseas,

432
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:09,426
they've seen dangers I can't even
know the shape of and here

433
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:13,367
we are building the bombs
that make them strong.

434
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,459
You can't say we don't pay a price.

435
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:25,528
Sometimes you know when a thing is right.

436
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:29,741
What's a few small sacrifices on our part

437
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,177
when we stand to win back  the happiness

438
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,099
and freedom we deserve. Thank you.

439
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,009
They all gotta go down Archie.

440
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,916
That a boy.

441
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,849
Don't you fall asleep yet.

442
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:12,393
You know, after my accident

443
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:16,533
Edith told me Lorna argued with doctor Poytche,

444
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:20,521
said he had to do right by me with surgery.

445
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:26,432
She called me a soldier, same as any man here.

446
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:31,913
And I liked that, I suppose I still do.

447
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,895
That's the Two of us Archie, we're soldiers .........

448
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,881
on the home front.

449
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:46,847
Come on, one last mile you can do it.

450
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,318
I am with you.

451
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:05,865
Well done darling, we're home.

452
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:47,709
Mum look at you, and that speech, sure wasn't the one you were practicing.

453
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,038
I wouldna let you out of the house if it was.

454
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,211
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

455
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:54,007
You didn't, you did good, real good.

456
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,666
Thank you.

457
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,776
BOB: The things I say I don't mean any harm.

458
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:05,417
I know Bob, same here.

459
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:11,040
MUSIC PLAYS.

460
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:26,412
- I'm a clot.
- With tin ears.

461
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:29,478
Both.

462
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,492
- Has he asked you up yet ?
- No

463
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:43,207
We'd like to ease our way into the
evening with a special guest.

464
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:47,162
Go, he's not going to wait forever, go go !!.

465
00:35:57,806 --> 00:36:05,309
KATE SINGS: I wished on the moon for something I never knew.

466
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:21,290
Wished on he moon for more than I ever knew.
A sweeter rose a softer sky on April days,

467
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:28,713
that would not dance away.

468
00:36:53,582 --> 00:37:09,371
I begged on the stars to throw me a beam or Two.
Wished on the stars and asked for a dream or Two.

469
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:24,717
I looked for every loviness it all came true,
I wished on the moon for you.

470
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:31,487
CLAPPING AND APPLAUSE.

471
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:36,059
Kate Andrews.

472
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:47,326
GLADYS: Dear Lewis, the day we met I
let my good judgment get swept away.

473
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:54,169
First in attending the dance and
then in, in our further intimacies.

474
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:57,817
Lewis I am engaged to another man.

475
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,530
I was wrong to have pretended otherwise and I

476
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,579
was thoughtless in accepting your proposal.

477
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:08,749
Although he has no reason to believe
it I love my fiancee deeply.

478
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:13,345
My heart belongs to him ....

479
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,518
What he wanted was so simple,

480
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:26,671
and he made me feel like only I could give it to him.

481
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,570
Is there some way ?

482
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,751
You were intimate with this man.

483
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:44,693
It was just some kissing and petting,

484
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:46,378
you had a full fledged sexual affair.

485
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:47,582
It's not the same thing.

486
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:48,250
KATE: Why not ?

487
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,693
Because I didn't care about her,
she meant nothing to me.

488
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:56,519
Except you showed her more of
yourself than I have ever seen.

489
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,321
What are you afraid of James ?

490
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,641
That this is me, that this is all there is.

491
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:10,051
That's all I've ever wanted.

492
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:13,489
If  I've done this all wrong I'm so sorry,

493
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,959
I'm so sorry.

494
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,380
Make it up to me.

495
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,133
You sure ?

496
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:27,175
Yes.

497
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:35,849
I love you.

498
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,564
I love you too.

499
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:52,676
- James.
- I told you I learned a thing or Two.

500
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,817
Was it worth the wait ?

501
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:02,036
Only if we make up for lost time.

502
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:06,100
Your letter to that airman,
what was his name ?

503
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,474
Lewis.

504
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,974
You can't send it.

505
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,195
I have to tell him the truth,
he needs to know it's over.

506
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:17,053
Right now he thinks that he's
taking you into battle with him.

507
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:19,927
You can break his heart when the war is over.

508
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:23,216
I'm sure he'll have forgotten me by then.

509
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:26,554
I don't think that's possible.

510
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:32,475
Your top drawer James Dunn.

511
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:48,570
You're here to see Vera ?

512
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:54,378
Yes .... I heard about your friend, I'm so sorry.

513
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,799
There's people.

514
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:05,348
I'm merely comforting a co worker,
nothing more nothing less.

515
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,800
Yeah.

516
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,659
Were you close ?

517
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,082
Not really but somehow I'm the
one they asked to touch his things.

518
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:19,395
What about Archie's family ?

519
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,706
He was alone Lorna.

520
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:24,910
No family no friends, that's
how it is in the end.

521
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,832
Well, lucky we have our families.

522
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,551
Yeah, I saw your husband yesterday.

523
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:30,972
Yes you did.

524
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,599
Not exactly what I was expecting.

525
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,761
Bob's a good man.

526
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,381
Why, because he wheeled out for one speech.

527
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,321
How dare you !!

528
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:39,742
You're not happy with him Lorna.

529
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:44,941
I know what it cost him to do
that, to be there, you don't.

530
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:50,770
There isn't going to be a
safe place for us is there ?

531
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,473
I wish there were.

532
00:41:53,681 --> 00:42:01,334
So brief you know Lorna, if your
gonna burn why not burn bright ?

533
00:42:06,163 --> 00:42:09,431
I rang cook, requested
something special for lunch.

534
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:13,324
Not yet married and already acting the hostess.

535
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:20,210
It seemed appropriate to mark Armistice day
with an act of solidarity with our soldiers.

536
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,185
A day late, but not a dollar short.

537
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:24,476
Not even a dime.

538
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,124
You think this is funny ?

539
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,086
Of course if this comes from one of those

540
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,747
Three per cent cans that may be spoiled,

541
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,042
Whataya you think James,

542
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,683
about Ten minutes from here to the hospital ?

543
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,183
Sounds about right.

544
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:36,998
Get this outa my face!

545
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,017
All the more for me.

546
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:45,078
Hmmm Ptomaine poison.

547
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:46,165
Gladys !

548
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:48,715
You've no clue the compromises that come with doing business.

549
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:50,977
I know all about compromise father,

550
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:52,916
doing the right thing for as many people as possible.

551
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,126
If we increase the density of he interior lag the spoilage rate

552
00:42:56,524 --> 00:43:00,137
goes down to almost nil production costs up two per cent.

553
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:02,228
Next thing you know we'll be doing this for nothing.

554
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:05,338
I have as much say in this as you do.

555
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:11,697
Well, I've lost my appetite.

556
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:17,463
Where'd you dream up this little antic,
last nights sleep over with Carol.

557
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:21,840
Turns out I didn't get much sleep.
