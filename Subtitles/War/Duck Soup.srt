00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,700
  NO ONE MUST TAKE
  A BIT OF GRAFT UNLESS   HE GETS HIS SHARE 

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
 IF ANY MAN SHOULD COME BETWEEN
  A HUSBAND AND HIS BRIDE 

162
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
  WE FIND OUT
  WHICH ONE SHE PREFERS   BY LETTING HER DECIDE 

163
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,100
 IF SHE PREFERS THE OTHER MAN
  THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE 

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
  WE STAND THEM UP
  AGAINST THE WALL AND   POP GOES THE WEASEL 

165
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,100
  THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE   RELINQUISHES HIS BRIDE 
 AAAA 

166
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
 THEY STAND HIM UP AGAINST THE
 WALL AND TAKE AWAY HIS BRIDE 

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
 GOOD HEAVENS !
YOU CAN'T GO WITH YOUR TROUSERS UP !

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,900
 I'M IN A HURRY.
IF YOU RUN OUT OF GAS, GET ETHYL.

174
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
IF ETHYL RUNS OUT, GET MABEL.
NOW STEP ON IT.

175
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
IT CERTAINLY FEELS GOOD
TO BE BACK AGAIN.

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
  I HAVE FAILED,  AMBASSADOR.
I KNOW IT, YOU IDIOT !

177
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
 I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE MUDDLED EVERYTHING.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
IF YOU'D STARTED THE REVOLUTION
AS I PLANNED...

179
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
 I COULD'VE STEPPED IN
AND PLACED FREEDONIA UNDER THE SYLVANIAN FLAG.

180
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
BUT FIREFLY BLOCKED US !

181
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
  YOU HAVE NO IDEA  HOW POPULAR HE IS.
I'VE KNOWN OF THAT TOO.

182
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TWO SPIES
SHADOWING HIM.

183
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
TO DISGRACE HIM.

184
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
TO DISCREDIT HIM
WITH THE PEOPLE.

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,700
