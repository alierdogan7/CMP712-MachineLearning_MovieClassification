00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,648
[Wind Whistling ]

849
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,985
[Speaking Dutch]

850
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:58,206
- Ready!
- [Guns Clattering ]

851
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,209
George!

852
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,293
[ Gunshot ]

853
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,601
- Fire!
- [ Gunfire ]

854
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,573
[Thomas ] I propose to settle,
once and for all, sir...

855
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,246
the matter of whether or not orders
were issued to shoot prisoners.

856
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,450
Do you, Major Thomas?

857
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,411
Major Bolton has proved
there were no standing orders...

858
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,496
and Captain Hunt is dead.

859
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,271
A formal request that Lord Kitchener
attend this court-martial.

860
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,441
- Kitchener?
- Lord Kitchener?

861
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:06,146
He can tell us himself
whether or not such orders were issued.

862
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,606
You are impertinent, Major Thomas.

863
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,363
Are you suggesting that the most senior
soldier in the British Army...

864
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,491
a man venerated throughout the world...

865
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,039
would be capable of issuing
an order of such barbarity?

866
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,083
I don't know, sir.

867
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,460
But I do know...

868
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,797
that orders that one
would consider barbarous...

869
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,473
have already been issued in this war.

870
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:39,019
Before I was asked
to defend these men...

871
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:44,225
I spent some months
burning Boer farmhouses...

872
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,480
destroying their crops...

873
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,657
herding their women and children
into stinking refugee camps...

874
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,486
where thousands of them
have died already from disease.

875
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,164
Now, these orders were issued, sir.

876
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:03,085
And soldiers like myself
and these men here...

877
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,255
have had to carry them out
however damned reluctantly!

878
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,585
There is no precedent for this request.

879
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,012
There's no obligation whatever
for Lord Kitchener to attend this courtroom.

880
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,009
Oh?

881
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,020
“The accused is allowed full liberty...

882
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,848
to cross-examine
any witness against him...

883
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:30,108
and to call any witnesses
or make any statement in his defense.”

884
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,787
May I join you?

885
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:57,135
Well, our little case seems be attracting
quite a lot of interest.

886
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,012
Oh, yes, there've been requests...

887
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,934
of some of those correspondent fellows
to attend the court.

888
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,138
All turned down, of course.

889
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,723
Of course.

890
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,728
I've been wondering if you realize...

891
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,560
how anxious your own government is
for a conviction.

892
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,397
- What do you mean?
- You've just become a commonwealth.

893
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,482
Your prime minister, Mr. Barton...

894
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,943
wants to dissipate
any lingering impressions...

895
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:21,075
of a frontier colony, frontier behavior.

896
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,498
You can be quite sure
a quick conviction of these men...

897
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,167
will meet with Australian approval.

898
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,291
And of course,
Morant and his friends are guilty.

899
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,496
Are they?

900
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,083
Why not arrest the firing squad?
They did the actual killing.

901
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,964
But they were only following
Morant's orders.

902
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,513
That's right, just as Morant
was following orders.

903
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,392
You do realize, of course, that when high
command denies that the orders are issued...

904
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,014
your whole case will collapse.

905
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,181
Perhaps your request
that Lord Kitchener attend this court...

906
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,562
is not in your clients' best interest.

907
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,690
- I hadn't thought of that.
- Then you will withdraw the request?

908
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,863
No.

909
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:00,653
It seems quite simple to me.
I don't know how it's come to this.

910
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,783
You said our fellow there,
that damned Irishman-

911
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,990
Captain Taylor, sir. Anglo-Irish.

912
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:09,453
Taylor, yes, Taylor. Assured you the case
against the Australians was overwhelming.

913
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,086
Now he seems to spend most of his time
giving evidence on their behalf.

914
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,792
Certain proprieties
have to be observed, sir.

915
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,924
And Taylor fought with Morant.
It creates a bond.

916
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,677
I don't think he's the problem.

917
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,383
Major Thomas is putting up
an unexpectedly good defense.

918
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,936
Two of the court members are showing
some sympathy for the Australians.

919
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:30,312
I dare say, it's too late
to transfer <i>them</i> to India.

920
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,233
I did mention it one time, sir-

921
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,437
the complexities
of charging soldiers with murder...

922
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,317
while they're actually in the field.

923
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:40,822
Good God, Johnny, I'm not trying
to prove some academic point.

924
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,949
I'm trying to put an end
to this useless war.

925
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,703
The Boer leaders
must see in this court-martial...

926
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:50,411
a demonstration of our impartial justice.

927
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,087
If these three Australians
have to be...

928
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,844
sacrificed to help bring about
a peace conference...

929
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,670
small price to pay.

930
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:04,554
I quite agree, sir, though I doubt
the Australians shared our enthusiasm.

931
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,684
You go to Pietersburg, Johnny.

932
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:13,609
You deal with the order
to shoot the prisoners.

933
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,152
What do I say?

934
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,104
I think you know what to say.

935
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,157
- [ Officer] Shall be the truth.
- Shall be the truth.

936
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,908
- The whole truth.
- The whole truth.

937
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,911
- And nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.

938
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,369
Thank you, sir. If you'd like
to take the witness chair, please.

939
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,931
Colonel Hamilton...

940
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,729
last July, Captain Hunt
took two polo ponies...

941
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,900
to Lord Kitchener's headquarters
in Pretoria.

942
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,818
At which time,
you had a conversation with him...

943
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,067
regarding Boer prisoners.

944
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,241
Do you recall that conversation?

945
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,445
I have no recollection whatever.

946
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,201
I have never spoken to Captain Hunt...

947
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:12,079
with reference to his duties
in the northern Transvaal.

948
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,580
- You're a liar!
- Order!

949
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,412
You are under oath, sir.

950
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,963
I am aware of that.

951
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,168
Major Thomas, I trust you'll agree
that closes the issue...

952
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,004
of the alleged orders
to shoot prisoners.

953
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,190
On the contrary, sir...

954
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,359
I regard Colonel Hamilton's denial...

955
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,534
as having no bearing at all
on the defense.

956
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,409
I submit that it is, in fact...

957
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,035
inadmissible evidence.

958
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,250
A conversation
is stated to have taken place...

959
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:03,460
between Captain Hunt
and Colonel Hamilton...

960
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:08,174
which conversation
was relayed by Captain Hunt...

961
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,884
to Lieutenant Morant.

962
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,313
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Captain Hunt had his instructions.

963
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,390
The fact is clear from the evidence...

964
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,774
that Captain Hunt did tell
his subordinates not once...

965
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,652
but several times
that no prisoners were to be taken.

966
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:29,077
This fact is admitted
by witnesses for the prosecution.

967
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:35,785
Captain Hunt's instructions
were entitled to be obeyed...

968
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,336
which goes to remove any suggestion...

969
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,382
of malicious intention
on the part of the defendants.

970
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:47,338
This entire court-martial, sir,
should be dismissed!

971
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,848
Let us pray.

972
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,642
O Lord of hosts...

973
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,017
we entreat thy blessing
for the soldiers of our race...

974
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,439
called to do battle in South Africa.

975
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:02,190
Be thou a strong tower for them
against the enemy...

976
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,691
O thou who doth accomplish thy will...

977
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,240
by war as well as by peace.

978
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:10,694
Order the minds
of statesmen and generals...

979
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,576
that they may ever love
righteousness and equity.

980
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,874
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.

981
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,667
No trams or anything.

982
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:21,042
On a hot day, couldn't even get down
to Saint Kilda for a swim.

983
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,249
- Did you have family readings?
- No.

984
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,084
We did.

985
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,843
I had to sit in a high-backed chair
wearing a white lace collar...

986
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,301
while my father read selections
fro m <i>Pilgrim</i> is Progress.

987
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,768
“How glorious it was
to see the open region...

988
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,099
filled with horses...

989
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,810
and trumpeters and pipers...

990
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,067
singers, players.”

991
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,615
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

992
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,740
Sunday was a good day for chasing
a few tarts around Bathurst.

993
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,196
[ Morant Chuckles ]

994
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,907
- Everyone else was in church.
- N' [ Men Singing ]

995
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,085
I used to whip down the river bank
for a bit of smooching.

996
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,005
Worst thing about dying -
no more girls.

997
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,799
Well, coming up for the home stretch.

998
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,969
- Any news on the other two cases?
- No, nothing.

999
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,513
In my view, everything hinges
on the last one -

1000
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,512
the German missionary.

1001
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,636
Are you sticking with that story?

1002
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,471
Why? What's wrong with it?

1003
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:21,977
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.

1004
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,275
A few hours later,
you leave with a riﬂe.

1005
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,852
In the morning, he's dead.

1006
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,939
And you trot out some fairy tale...

1007
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,529
about shooting game.

1008
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,612
Eh?

1009
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,032
Harry?

1010
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,537
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.

1011
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,840
But refusal will be equivalent
to an admission of guilt.

1012
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,391
Sir, I was in a public house
a few nights ago, sir.

1013
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,889
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,562
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.

1015
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,811
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.

1016
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,149
<i>[ President]
We will proceed, gentlemen...</i>

1017
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,951
<i>with the final one
of the three charges</i> -

1018
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,031
<i>the death
of the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.</i>

1019
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,912
<i>Lieutenants Morant and Handcock
have pleaded not guilty...</i>

1020
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,996
<i>respectively, to inciting
and committing the murder.</i>

1021
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,080
<i>Major Bolton?</i>

1022
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,336
You realize you're under oath,
Corporal Sharp?

1023
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,883
Yes, sir, right, sir.

1024
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,131
This bloke'd say anything
except his prayers.

1025
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,509
On the 23rd day of August last...

1026
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,512
that being the last day
the Reverend Hesse was seen alive...

1027
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,060
you were on sentry duty,
is that correct?

1028
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,933
<i>[ Sharp ]
Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

1029
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,482
Did you - Did you see
the deceased that day?

1030
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,810
What, sir?

1031
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,942
The deceased. The Reverend Hesse.

1032
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,570
Ah, yes, sir, yes.
I saw the deceased that day, sir.

1033
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,401
<i>It was about 10:00 in the morning, sir.</i>

1034
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,781
- Lovely day, sir?
- Whoa!

1035
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,204
We could do with a drop of this weather
in London, you know?

1036
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,577
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah, it gets very foggy there, sir.

1037
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,705
You know, you can't see
a foot in front of your face.

1038
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,129
That's a hand, see? it's a joke.
Silly old bugger.

1039
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,877
I hope you drown
in your communion wine.

1040
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,004
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.

1041
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,757
It was signed by Captain Taylor.
And then he went off, sir.

1042
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:18,386
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?

1043
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,887
No, sir, not again, sir.

1044
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,597
Did you witness anything else
which might affect this court-martial?

1045
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,558
Yes, sir.
About a half an hour later, sir...

1046
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,735
<i>Lieutenant Handcock rode up
to Lieutenant Morant, sir.</i>

1047
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,233
<i>It was alongside a tent line, sir.</i>

1048
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,414
How did Lieutenant Handcock look?

1049
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,919
Like he was thinking, sir.

1050
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,422
Um, like, uh -

1051
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,969
I can't think of the -

1052
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,467
Did he look like he was agitated?

1053
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:02,596
Agitated. Yes, yes, that's it, sir.
Yes, sir, he looked agitated.

1054
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,973
Objection!
Major Bolton is leading the witness.

1055
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,054
I will rephrase the question, sir.

1056
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,317
Tell me, Corporal Sharp...

1057
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,520
how did Lieutenant Handcock look?

1058
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,480
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.

1059
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,191
Is there anything else
that you wish to tell the court?

1060
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,948
No, sir. Uh, yes, sir, yes, sir.

1061
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,534
They, sir -
Lieutenants Morant and Handcock -

1062
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,332
they weren't like real soldiers, sir.

1063
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,035
The troopers would actually call them
by their first names, sir.

1064
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,792
Right to their face, sir.

1065
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,544
Thank you, Corporal Sharp.
That'll be all.

1066
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,593
- Thank you, sir.
- Corporal Sharp.

1067
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,169
Sir.

1068
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,508
Why did you leave the Bushveldt Carbineers?

1069
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,809
I requested a transfer, sir.

1070
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,979
Were you not made to transfer?

1071
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,148
Were you not punished
by Lieutenant Handcock...

1072
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,727
for stealing a Boer's property
while on patrol?

1073
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,866
I can have your charge sheet
brought into the court, Corporal.

1074
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,078
Yes, sir. That's true, sir.

1075
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,952
And have you not been stating
in the hotels of Pietersburg...

1076
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,880
that you would walk barefoot
from Cape Town to Pietersburg...

1077
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:17,459
to be on a firing party
to shoot Lieutenant Handcock?

1078
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:21,263
Uh, I-l might have said that
over a pint, sir.

1079
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,341
You know, it'd only be the beer talking, sir.
Not me, sir.

1080
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,761
You testified previously...

1081
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,688
that you told the Reverend Hesse
not to speak with Boer prisoners.

1082
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,390
- Why was that?
- He was German.

1083
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,101
It was for security reasons.

1084
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,653
But we are not at war with Germany.

1085
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,608
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy
that Germany shows towards the Boers.

1086
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,783
Were you on good terms
with the Reverend Hesse?

1087
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,582
Yes, cordial.

1088
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,043
When he left Fort Edward...

1089
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,963
you knew that he was going to report
back here to the authorities in Pietersburg.

1090
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,211
I had no way of knowing
what he was going to do.

1091
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,090
But it would have been in your interest,
would it not, to prevent him?

1092
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,381
Well, I - I hardly know about that.

1093
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,592
All I do know
is that someone prevented him...

1094
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,598
and I'm still here on trial.

1095
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,308
I suggest that you
instructed Lieutenant Handcock...

1096
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,485
to follow the Reverend Hesse
and to shoot him.

1097
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,064
I had sent a message
to Colonel Hall in Pietersburg...

1098
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:24,071
informing him of my intentions
towards the Boer prisoners.

1099
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,528
- I have nothing to hide.
- [ Scoffs ]

1100
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,410
I find that-
that statement hard to believe.

1101
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,788
Then I suggest, sir, that you recall
Colonel Hall from India.

1102
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:35,165
He will confirm it.

1103
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,746
I don't mind waiting.

1104
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,050
Thank you, Lieutenant Morant.
That will be all.

1105
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,593
Thank you, sir.

1106
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,514
Call Lieutenant Handcock
to the witness chair, please.

1107
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:53,017
I would like to request an adjournment,
sir, until tomorrow morning.

1108
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,145
Do I understand, Major Thomas,
that Lt. Handcock will not be giving evidence?

1109
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:01,320
No, sir, I simply need more time
to discuss the case with my client.

1110
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,693
I have no objections, sir.

1111
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,822
Request granted.

1112
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,706
For God's sake, tell me the truth, Peter.

1113
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,038
If you're concealing something,
I want to know it.

1114
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,332
If you killed Hesse, I want to know.

1115
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,470
It's not just your life.
You'll take Morant and Witton with you.

1116
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,015
- We've got no bloody chance anyway.
- I think you have.

1117
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,890
They obviously regard this
as the most serious charge.

1118
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,688
Now, if I can convince
the court members...

1119
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,481
that you're innocent on this one...

1120
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,560
I think you could all be acquitted.

1121
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,737
- N' [ Bugle ]
- All right.

1122
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:47,074
But we've got to be careful.
I don't want these witnesses in court.

1123
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,527
Why not?
Do you want to be executed?

1124
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,328
Of course not.

1125
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,248
But I made a promise.
Two promises.

1126
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,341
Where did you go
when you left Fort Edward...

1127
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,965
approximately half an hour
after the Reverend Hesse?

1128
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,340
- I went visiting.
- Visiting?

1129
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,093
- Visiting?
- Visiting?

1130
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,765
Who-Who could you
possibly have visited?

1131
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,720
Well, I went to the farms owned
by the Shiels and the Vanderbergs.

1132
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,429
Why? Who was at these farms?

1133
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,186
Well, nobody.
Well, only the ladies, sir.

1134
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:23,236
And they received you
into their homes alone?

1135
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,356
Well, I was quite well known to them.

1136
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:31,195
You mean to tell me you were on
intimate terms with two Boer ladies?

1137
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:36,037
Yeah, well, you could put it that way, sir.

1138
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,117
Where were the husbands?

1139
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,374
Well, one's a prisoner of war,
and the other's with the Boer commandos.

1140
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,081
I was just checking they were all right.

You spent the full afternoon

My oath, sir.

01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,670
<i>It was about 5:00
when I got to the Shiels's place.</i>

1154
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,342
- Handcock!
- Good day, Mrs. Shiels. How are you going?

1155
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,223
Hey, listen.
Can I have a cup of coffee?

1156
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,055
I mean, I'm tired.
I've been riding all day.

01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:47,437
Okay, you talked me into it.
[ Grunts ]

1159
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,951
I would like to present the court
with written depositions...

1160
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,699
from both the ladies in question.

1161
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:28,274
Lieutenant Handcock, what does
Mrs. Vanderberg mean by “entertained”?

1162
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,063
Did you sing to her?

1163
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:34,651
Sir, you can appreciate
that these ladies' reputations...

1164
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,235
are in a vulnerable position...

1165
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,571
and as these letters confirm...

1166
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,329
Lieutenant Handcock's whereabouts
on the day in question...

1167
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:46,083
could they not forego the embarrassment
of actually appearing in court?

1168
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,961
- Major Bolton?
- I have no objection, sir.

1169
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,590
I must say, I find this sort of behavior...

1170
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,922
from a soldier in the British Army...

1171
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,133
morally disgraceful.

1172
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,888
These were married women.

1173
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,104
Well, they say a slice
off a cut loaf's never missed.

1174
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:09,065
[Thomas] Lieutenant Handcock's
personal morality is not on trial, sir.

1175
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:10,645
Regrettably.
