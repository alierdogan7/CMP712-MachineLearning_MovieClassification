<i>a fleet of pirates attacked the harbor.</i>

<i>There was some confusion
about their identity,</i>

59

60
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,319
and their speed through the water,

61
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:16,623
the Emperor recognized
them at once as Northmen.

62
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,229

70

These Northmen never like to
venture far from their ships

79

drawn into pitched battle.

<i>Don't you want it?</i>

361
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:11,795
Are these not the images of your God?

362
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,283
I told you before, and
I will tell you again:

363
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,318
My God is Odin, the all father.

364
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,020
I know you told me.

365
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:24,658
Only... I don't believe you.

366
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:29,696
And this? Ragnar gave me this.

367
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:33,366
Wearing a dog-turd doesn't make you a dog.

368
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:36,569
Oh.

369
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,776
<i>I have something else for you.</i>

370
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,982
The hand of your holy man, I believe.

371
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,452
(Giggles)

372
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:56,264
Ragnar: So tell me,

373
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,583
how do you find England?

374
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:06,064
Horik: It is a pleasant
land, rich with treasure.

375
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:09,888
You are right. This land is rich.

376
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:14,973
But here... here is the real treasure!

377
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,675
(Inhales deeply)

378
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:20,578
Earth? Have you not seen?

379
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,514
Everywhere we go, there are crops.

380
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,849
There is food growing.

381
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,852
I am a farmer and the son of a farmer,

382
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,122
and this is what I understand.

383
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,659
Compared to our poor countries,
where it is hard to farm,

384
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:36,728
hard to live.

385
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,997
Here, it is easy.

386
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,401
If we lived here, we could feed everybody.

387
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,537
There would be no hunger.

388
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:50,007
I like your thinking,
but here is my question:

389
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,976
Will the Saxons simply invite us

390
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:54,411
to live among them, hmm?

391
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,149
<i>(Loud cheering and applause)</i>

392
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:03,754
(Music and applause fill the great hall)

393
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:05,556
- Man: Jarl Borg!
- Man 2: To your new bride!

394
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,157
(Applause)

395
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,627
Man 3: A fine choice this day!

396
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,028
Jarl Borg: Thank you!

397
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,398
(Loud cheering and applause)

398
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,872
<i>Man 4: A fine choice, my lord!</i>

399
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,941
<i>(Excited buzz of chatter and applause)</i>

400
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,179
(Quiets down)

401
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,489
So I am married for the second time.

402
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,590
As most of you know,

403
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,692
my first marriage lasted less than an hour,

404
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,562
because my own brother
poisoned the drinks that day.

405
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,164
Of course, the same thing
can never happen twice,

406
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,100
so let the wine be poured.

407
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,868
Men and women: (Cheering) Yeah! Here, here!

408
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:54,970
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)

409
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:04,112
Now who will be the first
to drink in celebration?

410
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,151
I will.

411
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,761
No! No, I could not bear
it. Not a second time.

412
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,164
Let me taste the wine.

413
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,101
(Gulping)

414
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:30,638
(Uneasy silence)

415
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:37,845
It's quite all right.

416
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,547
Skol!

417
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,649
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)

418
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:46,153
Jarl Borg: I have something
else important to say.

419
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,721
I don't wish to dampen the celebrations

420
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,858
but you all know that the
agreement between myself,

421
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:54,627
King Horik, and Ragnar
Lothbrok has been broken.

422
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,230
They have gone raiding
west without me, without us,

423
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:59,032
which is an insult not only to myself,

424
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,500
but to all of you,

425
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:02,802
<i>and now also to my wife,</i>

426
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,672
and to my wife's family.

427
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,874
(Murmurs of agreement)

428
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:10,577
I have to do something about this insult.

429
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:13,613
Frankly, I blame King Horik
more for what has happened,

430
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,981
<i>but at the same time,</i>

431
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:18,685
<i>consider what is happening
to Earl Ragnar's lands.</i>

432
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:21,120
He has abandoned them

433
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:24,923
to the care of his wife
and his drunken brother.

434
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:27,026
(Laughter)

435
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:28,594
In order to punish those

436
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:31,697
who have insulted me and my family,

437
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:33,732
I declare today that I will seek vengeance

438
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,934
against Ragnar Lothbrok.

439
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,871
By all our gods,

440
00:28:38,938 --> 00:28:43,675
I swear that we will seize all his lands

441
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,844
and that I will repay
his brother's treachery

442
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:47,145
with the axe.

443
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,147
<i>All: (Cheer in agreement)</i>

444
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,485
(Birds chirping)

445
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,289
(Foliage rustles underfoot)

446
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,763
(Hooves plod, horses snort softly)

447
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:14,273
(Horses snort and whinny)

448
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:25,116
Bishop Edmund: Who can speak to us?

449
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,521
I can.

450
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:34,993
I have been sent here by Ecbert,

451
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,594
King of Wessex.

452
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:39,931
<i>The king regrets your attack</i>

453
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,033
<i>on the holy church at Winchester.</i>

454
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,302
<i>He wonders how much longer</i>

455
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:48,239
<i>you intend to remain in his kingdom?</i>

456
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:51,075
(Nervously clears throat)

457
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,945
Ragnar: Well, that depends.

458
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,684
Bishop Edmund: Upon what?

459
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:03,220
Ragnar: Upon what he'll
offer us to leave...

460
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:09,193
or what he'll offer us to stay.

461
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,496
Stay?

462
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:18,468
Ragnar: Yes, we want to
make peace with the king.

463
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:21,504
Peace.

464
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,610
(Tries to clear throat)

465
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:30,547
So we don't have to kill any more of you.

466
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:35,118
I will relay your message to the king.

467
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,855
<i>(Floki giggles)</i>

468
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,522

King Horik: (In Old Norse) Wait!

Vikings: (Laughing)

479
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:24,965
Sigvard: Not hungry, Bjorn?

480
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,468
No.

481
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,003
Sigvard: Any reason?

482
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,238
No reason.

483
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,474
Sigvard: Are you unhappy?

484
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,581
<i>What can I do to make you happy?</i>

485
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,551
Shall I raid one of my
unsuspecting neighbours,

486
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,454
so you can show off your fighting skills,

487
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,790
and maybe slaughter them all?

488
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:53,493
<i>Show that you are truly

I do not like to see you so solemn.

492
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,439
So tell me, what can I do?

493
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:11,478
Bjorn: You can let me go live
in a cabin in the mountains.

494
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,147
Sigvard: By yourself? In the mountains?

495
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:17,050
Bjorn: Yes. I'd like to test myself.

496

<i>Get away from all this. All these servants!</i>

<i>All these people doing everything for us.</i>

I want to know what is essential to life.

What is really important.

500
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,301
<i>Will you let me?</i>

501
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:41,306
No, of course not.

502
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,276
I am the Earl here.

503
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:47,479
What would folk think if
I let my beloved stepson

504
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:50,682
starve or freeze to death
in some mountain pigsty?

In any case,

00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:00,058
I have solemnly sworn to Lagertha

00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:36,260

<i>Siggy: Who are they?</i>

519
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:44,401
Rollo: I think I can guess.

520
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,537
Go back to the town.

521
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,305
Find anyone who can fight,

522
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:50,206
anyone who can hold a weapon.

523
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,077
We're under attack.

Aslaug: Rollo, what is
it? What is happening?

00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:10,593
Rollo: Jarl Borg! He has
come back to attack us.

527
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:11,894
Aslaug: Jarl Borg?

528
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,564
Rollo: (Panting) I'm sure it is him.

529
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,233
Ragnar and King Horik broke
their agreement with him.

530
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,837
He has returned to gain his revenge.

531
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,772
What are we going to do?

532
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,176
(Panting) What do you
think we're going to do?

533
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:29,178
We're going to fight.

534
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,248
Aslaug: Come. Go! Go!

535
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,418
(Panicked chatter)

536
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:41,423
Rollo: Torfin! Olaf!
One of you on each flank.

537
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:45,861
Help with the barricades.

538
