Yes, yes, thank you, Jones.
Thank you, thank you.

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,750
Yes, they've been dragging
their feet a bit lately.

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,195
Yes, they have
been a bit lax.

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,716
There's no need
for Latin, Wilson.

190

If the King's English is good enough
for him, it's good enough for you.

In the light of
the forthcoming mission,

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,715
we shall adapt
today's exercise.

195
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,871
One of the men
shall be a Nazi spy.

196
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,110
We'll drop him off
at the crossroads.

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,918
Are you sure
that's wise, sir?

198
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,157
Meanwhile, we shall lie in wait
and attempt to intercept him.

199
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,789
Lying in wait sounds awfully damp,
don't you think, sir?

200

Pull over, Jones.
Pull over, Jones.

201

MAINWARING: I want
a word with you, Wilson.

203

How dare you question my
authority in front of the men?

204
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,471
Well, I just don't want
anyone catching a cold.

what Frank's like.

206

Are we nearly there yet?

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,592
As you were, Pike.

208
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,756
You're trying to undermine me,
usurp my position.

209
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,797
I'm really doing
nothing of the kind.

it won't work, you know.

You waft along with that
superior look on your face.

No backbone,
that's your trouble.

215

Well, I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

your chance to prove it.

You're not taking this seriously,
are you, Walker?

it was me?

No, thank you, Pike.

You put some
thought into this, Jones.

Thank you, Captain.

227
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,669
Mrs. Fox lent it me from last
year's production of <i>Robin Hood.</i>

You look like you're on a
cruise to the South Seas.

Thank you so much, sir.
That's very kind of you.

I got the idea from a picture I saw
last week, <i>South of Pago Pago.</i>

I thought it was
rather open air.

be excused, please?

called rather loudly.

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,797
Well, I look forward to getting to
know you more in the coming days.

352
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,672
England can sleep soundly knowing
that you're watching over her.

353
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,111
Sir.
Thank you.

354
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,993
ALL: Bye-bye.

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,433
ROSE: Cheerio.
Bye.

356
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,995
(EXHALES)

357
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,709
Is that everything?

358
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,956
Ah. Allow me.
Oh, no, it's...

359
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,155
No, it's...
It's my, it's my...

No, I'll, I'll...
It's my typewriter.

361
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,834
Oh. I want to get
a start on the article.

362
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,558
First impressions,
you understand.

363
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,795
Hmm.

364
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,674
Might we have tea tomorrow?
Say 5:00?

365
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,829
Well, that would be...

366
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,276
Oh, no, there's a briefing
on some patrol thingy.

367
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,079
Patrol?
Yes, of the Dover base.

368
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,432
Dinner afterwards, then?

369
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,873
There must be
somewhere in town.

370
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,398
Well, yes, there's
The Oak Hotel, but...

371
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,914
7:00. I insist.

372
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,157
Right. Yes.

373
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,279
How nice.
Thank you, Rose.

374
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,550
Goodbye.

375
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,395
Oh.

(HUMMING)

377
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,670
I want you to have
a word with Frank.

378
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,433
He's got it into his head he
wants to be a Spitfire pilot.

379
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,556
He gets dizzy
standing on a chair.

380
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,710
Well, he lives in his head,
that's his trouble.

381
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,795
WILSON: Ah.

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,233
Must have been a racer.

383
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,519
Where do you
keep your...

384
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,839
He told me about
that journalist woman.

385
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,674
Arthur?

386
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,836
Shall I roll
out the pastry?

387
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,400
Frank said
you drove her home.

388
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,555
Did I?

389
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,477
Oh, yes, that's right,
I believe I did.

390
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,669
Ever so glamorous,
Frank said.

391
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,274
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

392
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,752
Just you remember which
side your bread's buttered.

393
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,195
Pass me that bird.

394
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,599
Here you go.

395
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,958
Thank you for taking me to the
pictures again, Frank. It was...

396
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,393
It was ever
so romantic.

397
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Thanks for
walking me home.

398
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,034
Mum doesn't like me
being out after dark.

399
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,755
Ooh.

400
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,234
What're you doing?

401
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,276
Kissing you.
What's wrong with that?

402
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,389
People only kiss
like that in the films!

403
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,277
That's what you think.

(RADIO BEEPING)

405
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,758
Morning, Miss Winters.
Corporal Jones.

406
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,353
A butcher by trade.

407
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,675
But a soldier by nature, ma'am.

408
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,672
More notches on my rifle
than you've had hot dinners.

409
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,152
Not that you've had
too many hot dinners.

410
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,879
You've a fine fettle of
a figure, if I may say.

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,475
Here.

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,474
Welcome to Walmington.

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,834
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,195
Good day.

415
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,959
I saw that,
Jack Jones.

416
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,758
You just slipped
her a sausage.

417
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,989
I didn't mean
nothing by it.

418
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,640
And you never stamped
her book, neither.

419
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,634
Good morning.

420
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,233
Lovely morning.

421
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,950
Quite, quite lovely.

to be brisk.

Very young for the Home Guard, Joe.
Didn't you enlist?

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,509
Color blind.

432
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,910
Oh. Thought it was an
allergy to corned beef.

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,433
Yeah, that and all.

William Hodges,
ma'am, air-raid warden.

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,635
Of course, it's me you should be
talking to, not the Home Guard.

441
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,676
I'm the one who gets
things done around here.

Look at the color,

I'm telling you,
it's Chanel.

447
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,519

interested in hearing about

that butcher's just now.

supposed to mean?

Is she?

467
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,078
Wouldn't know.

468
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,033
Seems a good sort.

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,035
To be writing
about us, I mean.

470
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,556
Seeing her again after so long is
really rather discombobulating.

471
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,991
Well, you know, confusing.

472
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,550
Yes, I know what discombob...
Discombobu...

473
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,713
I know
what it means, Wilson.

474
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,592
So, you knew
her at Oxford.

475
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,271
I was her tutor
for a while.

476
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,397
But you two weren't...

477
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,914
Weren't...

478
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,473
Well, it looked
like maybe you were...

479
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,479
Were...

480
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,074
Or had been, you know.

481
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,195
Hmm?

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,395
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

would you, Wilson?

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,833
Certainly, sir.

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,835

may I say,

502
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,790
you do look lovely tonight.

503
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,434
I beg your pardon.

504
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,475
Ah!

505
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,913
Colonel. (CHUCKLES)

506
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,911
I didn't mean
you look lovely.

507
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,560
No, no, no, of course not.
Far from it.

508
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,753
Not that you look unlovely.
I'm sure to many you are lovely.

509
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,950
(COUGHS)
Not really my area.

510
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,268
About the patrol.

511
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,430
Ah. Yes,
a great honor.

512
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,954
Sergeant Wilson will be here
any moment for your briefing.

513
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,915
We'll crack on without him.
Golf club do. Wife in the car.

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,228
Your orders are simple,
Mainwaring.

515
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,390
You're to stick to the
coastal path at all times.

516
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,516
Do not approach the base in any way.
Understood?

517
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,431
Not approach the base?
But surely we need...

518
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,317
Are you questioning
an order, Mainwaring?

519
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,949
As you know, the Home Guard
have been asked for cuts

520
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,598
to help with the
big push into France.

521
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,715
Has it?

522
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,353
We'll be reviewing
the troops.

523
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,874
Sorting the wheat from
the chaff, as it were.

524
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,112
I won't beat
about the bush.

525
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,556
Walmington feels chaffy.

526
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,839
My men are as

00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,473
And they know
nothing about it, or you.

882
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,793
You're on the run
from the police.

883
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,797
You killed a man
with your umbrella.

884
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,991
Oh, I do apologize,
Miss Winters.

885
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,432
She is cursed with
a romantic spirit.

886
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,794
I know.

887
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,511
You're a secret agent.

888
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,714
A German spy

889
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,115
sent here to discover
the invasion plans

890
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,475
and bring
the Allies to their knees.

891
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,994
I'm afraid the truth is far less
colorful than that, ladies.

892
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,112
I work for
the Associated Press.

893
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,273
They place all their
articles uncredited.

894
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,632
I hope that's cleared up
the confusion for you.

895
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,994
Good day.

896
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

897
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,316
Hello, Captain. Welcome.

898
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,159
I do like your hat.

899
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,390
Oh. This old thing?

900
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,476
Please, come on in.
Yeah.

901
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,591
Sorry about the manner
of my invitation.

902
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,511
No, no.

903
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,514
No. Not at all.

904
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,276
ROSE: <i>I was hoping
you'd tell me more</i>

905
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,397
about your unique
leadership style.

906
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,715
Well,

907
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,713
I'm not one to
blow my own trumpet,

908
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,156
but I lead by example.

909
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,389
There's nothing I would ask my men
to do that I would not do myself.

910
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,555
Hmm.

911
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,389
Cake?

912
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,877
It's rather small,
I'm afraid.

913
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,348
We eat

914
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,757
as a free people,
not under the Nazi heel.

915
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,709
One thing my
men know for sure,

916
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,951
the jackboot will not tread
upon this hallowed land

917
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,479

breath in this...

(COUGHING)

919
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,315
Are you all right?

920
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,799
Gone down the wrong way.

921

922
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,595
You speak so
eloquently, Captain.

923
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,517
Have you never committed
your thoughts to paper?

924
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,276
No, there's not enough
hours in the day, I'm afraid.

925
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,876
Leadership is many things,
Miss Winters.

926
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,270
Rose, I insist.

927
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,951
Leadership is
many things, Rose.

928
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,354
But most of all,
it's about vision.

929
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,475
(CLATTERS)
Oh.

930
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,079
Oh. (GROANS)

931
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,592
Cake on the floor. Cake on the...
You're quite right, though.

932
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,432
MAINWARING: So sorry.

933
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,076
Europe is crying out
for a man of vision, clarity,

934
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,275
even ruthlessness.

935
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,469
Quite.

936
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,033
Get the trains
running on time.

937
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,796
I believe you're destined to play
a huge part in this war, George.

938
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,789
Really?

939
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,073
I do hope so.

940
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,150
I'm only sorry I won't be
able to write about it.

941
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,635
But you must.

942
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,514
What is the matter?

943
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,119
ROSE: (CRYING)
It's my editor.

944
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,634
He said if I don't write about
your patrol in my article,

945
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,635
then he won't publish it.

946
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,997
Come, now. Here.

947
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,831
Maybe if your
editor insists upon it,

948
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,234
then...

949
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,639
What?

950
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,760

No, no.

I'm not here. I'm in Eastbourne
with my area manager.

I've been doing
that all my life,

965
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,759
saying I'll come back
when I wanted to stay,

966
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,030
staying when
I wanted to go.

Rose, that night
at the summer ball,

968
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,152
I wanted to kiss
you very, very much.

969
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,391
I should have
kissed you, like this.

Sorry.

974
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,348
I had feelings for you
then, Rose. I still do.

975
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,829
Perhaps I haven't been
everything I could have been,

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,712
but perhaps
it's not too late.

977

Perhaps I still could be,
with a little help from someone,

Mr. Frazer and Mr. Jones
fought in the First War.

1401

a stretcher bearer.

Evidence has been found indicating
Sergeant Wilson is the spy.

1414
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,313
Sergeant Wilson?
No, he's not good-looking enough.

1415
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,119
He can't be the spy.
He'd have told us.

1416
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,430
It's over, Mainwaring.
Go home, man.

1417
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,960
You've been stripped
of your command,

1418

1419

1420

discovered a crystal radio set

1421

I never liked Wilson, anyway.

Well, I take no pleasure in this, Frazer,
but a spy is a spy.

We just couldn't
put our finger on it.

1433
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,038
Turns out it was
staring us in the face.

1445

So, we phoned the
fashion house in Paris

1446
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,630
to ask if anyone
there knew her.

1447
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,718
DOLLY: A very nice young
man in records confirmed

1448
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,395
that she bought regularly
from their collections,

1449
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,598
and they sent them
directly to her home.

the jigsaw, wasn't it, Cissy?

me to see her off.
