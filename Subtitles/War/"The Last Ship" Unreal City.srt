Man on bullhorn:<i> Everyone
into the helicopter bay!</i>

<i> Come on, soldiers! Get in there!</i>

4
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,517
<i> Now, people! Move it!</i>

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,553
<i> Move it!</i>

6
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,189
<i> Do as you're told!</i>

7
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:32,192
Man: Everybody stay where you are!

8
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,527
C.I.C.: Freeze! Freeze!

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,830
Security breach!

10
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,098
Where's the master-at-arms?

11
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,936
We need the armory. Come on.

12
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:43,770
M.A.!

13
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:50,210
<i> Now, people! Move it!</i>

14
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:52,446
<i> Everybody, get in the helo bay now!</i>

15
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,981
This is our chance ...

16
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,949
before they get reinforcements on board.

17
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,885
No, we do anything to provoke them now,

18
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,219
they'll mow everybody down.

19
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,187
There'll be a time, but it's not now.

20
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,794
You were vacationing in
Jamaica when the virus broke.

21
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:08,495
You were stranded on the fishing boat.

22
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,229
We picked you up there with bertrise.

23
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:11,632
I don't understand.

24
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:13,133
They're here to steal the cure.

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,102
You cannot be related to Quincy.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,439
Kara: Come on, Quincy. Stay with us, okay?

27
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:20,808
Quincy, look at me.

28
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:23,143
He's losing a lot of blood.

29
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,478
He's bleeding out!

30
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,746
Hand me that rag!

31
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,581
What? What? What ... what rag?

32
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:28,381
Right there ... hand it to me!

33
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:29,881
Okay.

34
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,081
Okay.

35
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:34,381
Listen, asshole, anything
happens to Dr. Scott,

36
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,176
this man is your insurance policy.

37
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:39,181
You need to get our ship's
doctor up here<i> now!</i>

38
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,707
[Indistinct shouting in distance]

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,418
Hamada: Search the lab.
Find the primordial.

40
00:01:57,443 --> 00:02:00,322
We'll move the heavy equipment out
and load them onto the boats later.

41
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:04,919
Right now, I want computers,
samples, cultures, research.

42
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,356
We leave nothing behind.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,083

told, and nobody gets hurt!</i>

45
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,701
This is not good. Not good.

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,441
We get locked in there,
we're gonna be toast.

47
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,167
What the hell are we supposed to do?

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,669
<i> Come on, people! Move it!</i>

49
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,171
We got to make a play here.

50
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:28,001
Rally at the D.C. locker.
Get there when you can.

51
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:29,294
What?!

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,302
Stop!

54
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,807
All right, let's get these pallets unloaded

55
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,567
and get this van back to Avocet.

56
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,427
Man: All right, boss.

57
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,795
Make sure those cases are sealed.

58
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,196
Will do.

59
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:46,128
Keys to the van.

60
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:47,922
Now.

61
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,332
Burk: Cobra team, this is
vulture team. Do you copy?

62
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,807
- Daddy?
- Cobra team, do you copy?

63
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,936
It's okay, sweetheart. We're okay.

64
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,012
We're gonna make it through this.

65
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,170
Do you copy?

66
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:07,564
There's no contact.

67
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,174
But the rally point's still
got to be the container yard.

- [Engine turns over]
- That hasn't changed.

69

They're still killing
people inside that stadium.

70
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,048
I know.

71
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,955
How hard can they be to find?

72
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,291
They're wearing Navy uniforms.

73
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:27,159
They shot two troopers ...
probably long gone by now.

74
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:29,695
Nothing slows down at Olympia. You hear me?

75
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,031

76

move it into the hangar.

Man: Sit down! Put your
hands where I can see them!

82
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,766
Do a sweep, see if we missed anyone.

83
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,748
Yes, sir.

This man has to go to
the medical bay right now!

90

you got to do it<i> here.</i>

00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,588
Captain. She took over our ship.

104
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,718
Can't get through to comms,
the bridge, or the C.I.C.

105
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,610
I don't get it. What's her game plan?

106
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:58,810
You wouldn't believe it.

107
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,304
What the hell country are we even in?

108
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,160
Have you guys heard from Alisha?
Is she involved with this?

109
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,154
Never mind that now.

110
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,480
How you feeling?

111
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,460
It was through and through.

112
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:06,620
He's lost a lot of blood, sir.

113
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:08,230
I'm fine. What's our play, sir?

114
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:09,558
Got to get back to the<i> James.</i>

115
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,886
Plenty of small boats in
the harbor. Maybe a rhib.

116
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,880
Nah, she's taken the pier by now,

117
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:15,800
and those helos circling our ship ...

118
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,861
no way we could even make an approach.

119
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,317
Right now, Dr. Scott's our primary mission,

120
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:23,207
and she's Granderson's prisoner.

121
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,154
Avocet's got armed guards, electric fences,

122
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,293
security cams on every floor.

123
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,447
We saw armored cars and
plenty of weapons at Olympia.

124
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,511
So, then, what ... we take on

125
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,038
all of her troopers without our ship?

126
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:32,911
4 of us against 80 of them ...

127
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,971
I don't like those odds.

128
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,299
[Door opens]

129
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,811
You guys remember Russ, right?

130
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,164
Okay, guys, here's the plan.

131
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:44,500
Russ is gonna hang with you guys
and grandpa for a while, all right?

132
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,222
You're gonna die ... like mom.

133
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,081
You can't leave us.

134
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,409
No, no, Sammy, I'm not.

135
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,838
It's okay, Sam, do what dad says.

136
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,543
Come on. Give your pops a hug.
We all have things to do now.

137
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,212
I love you, dad.

138
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:59,916
I love you, too, son.

139
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:01,962
Come here, sweet girl.

140
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:06,488
Be safe, dad.

141
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,405
Chandler: Let's move.

142
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,957
Where are we going, sir?

143
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,757
Taking down the queen bee.

144
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:25,185
To do that...

145
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,162
We hit her where it hurts the most.

146
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:39,380
Granderson: We have successfully taken
control of the<i> Nathan James.</i>

147
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:43,143
My people are collecting
all your work as we speak.

148
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:46,880
Now, with your research and your samples,

149
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,669
Dr. Hamada and his team

150
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:51,425
will eventually learn to
make the cure themselves.

151
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,610
Wouldn't it be better for everyone

152
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,600
if you just agreed to work together?

153
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,926
Work together?

154
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,889
What, on your Darwinian experiment?

155
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,444
Save those that you deem worthy

156
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,897
and, what, just forget the rest?

157
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,523
Perhaps I was overzealous in ...

158
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:07,783
"barbarians at the gate,"

159
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:10,018
I believe, is what you called them.

160
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:14,725
Doctor, I watched a grown man
beat a 12-year-old boy to death

161
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
over a gas mask.

162
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:19,592
I saw a woman stab her sister in the back

163
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:21,086
for a can of beans.

164
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,613
The apocalypse is here.

165
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:25,037
It's been here for a long time.

166
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,704
But I am willing to adjust my philosophy

167
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:31,530
to suit your sensibilities

168
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:35,392
if you just help me get
the lab up and running.

169
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:39,143
What about the captain?

170
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:40,849
And my friends?

171
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,502
The best thing you can do for your friends

172
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,111
is to let them know you've
decided to cooperate with me.

173
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:47,663
That will end this foolish bloodshed.

174
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,291
You say you'll help everyone?

175
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:51,158
I will.

176
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,551
Well, then, prove it.

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,896
And how do you suggest I do that?

178
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,165
You're wasting doses
here on healthy people.

179
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,901
Let me out into the street
with what I have left ...

00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:07,481
because no one's down there to correct it.

361
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,090
If the reduction gear blows,

362
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:11,426
the ship will be totally useless to anyone.

363
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,660
I'm assuming this is an asset

364
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,094
your people can't afford to lose.

365
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,097
Can you fix it?

366
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,366
My engineer can.

367
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,102
But in exchange, you
move us to the mess decks.

368
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:24,439
There's food, water.
People can use the bathroom.

369
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:27,441
You're not in any position
to be horse-trading with us.

370
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,522
You're right about that.

371
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,106
You're absolutely right.

372
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:34,997
But do you see what's happening here?

373
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:39,720
I won't be able to control my people.

374
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,460
Come on!

375
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:47,629
Can't rush it.

376
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:51,165
The whole engineering
plant could go up in flames.

377
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,635
Okay.

378
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,504
[Machinery slowing]

379
00:22:58,238 --> 00:22:59,406
[Machinery stops]

380
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,442
Okay, there. Just made it.

381
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,545
How long till it cools down?

382
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:05,980
The air pumping through
those vents is 40 degrees.

383
00:23:06,014 --> 00:23:08,449
It won't take long.

384
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,976
Is<i> this</i> really necessary?

385
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:28,837
How are we supposed to use the head?

386
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:30,505
This is not what we agreed to.

387
00:23:30,537 --> 00:23:32,392
Malone: I said I'd move you.

388
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,253
Didn't say you'd be comfortable.

389
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,176
Let's go.

390
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,419
Move!

391
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,090
Keep moving.

392
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,661
Jed: It's okay, buddy. Stay strong.

393
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,121
He's burning up.

394
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,959
You sure there's nothing
in those medicine cabinets?

395
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:06,421
Not even an aspirin.

396
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,466
We can't let Sam die. We can't.

397
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:11,150
The cure works. I'm sure he's
just having a bad reaction.

398
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:13,057
We got to get this fever down.

399
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:15,738
You got water. Run him a cold bath.

400
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,156
I'll be back in a few minutes.

401
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,616
Where are you going?

402
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,111
To find a pharmacy.

403
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:23,855
Here. Let's get him upstairs.

404
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:25,455
Come on, buddy.

405
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:26,223
[Coughs]

406
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,954
Is it gonna hurt?

407
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:30,981
No. It won't hurt at all.

408
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,276
We'll all feel better soon.

409
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:35,169

00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,907
[Voice breaking] I'm so sorry ... I...

411
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,376
I only have one more.

412
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,550
My baby will live?

413

[Crying]

414
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:13,057
You're a big, brave boy.

415
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:16,626
[Gasps]

416
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:19,087
[Crying]

417
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:27,084
Woman: Welcome to Avocet.

418
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,386
Inside and to the left.

419
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,887
What's your qualification?

420
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,889
Man: Electronics.

421
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:33,758
I need to see wristbands.

422
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,556
Qualification?

423
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,735
I need to see wristbands

424
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,063
to prove you've already been tested.

425
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:40,798
I need to see wristbands.

426
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:43,189
- What's your qualification?
- Man: I don't understand.

427
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,069
But we're healthy ... all of us.

428
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:46,704
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

429
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:48,906
Well, if you won't let us in,
where are we supposed to go?

430
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:49,824
[Scanner beeping]

431
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,551
Woman: Thank you. Welcome to Avocet.

432
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:53,545
Thank you.

433
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,946
What's your qualification?

434
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,106
Security.

435
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:58,832
Thank you. Welcome to Avocet.

436
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,926
Thorwald: No, no, no.

437
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,826
We'll need bigger explosives
if we go to that side.

438
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,964
The hell are you doing here?
Why aren't you at the plant?

439
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:08,948
- Freeze!
- No, no, no! They're cool. They're cool.

440
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:10,503
They're with me.

441
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,262
They took out the power plant,

442
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:13,998
got a bunch of Granderson's guys.

443
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,666
So we lost our jump? She's
gonna know we're coming.

444
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,768
We took out the plant.

445
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,636
Doesn't mean we cut off the electricity.

446
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:22,686
As far as Granderson knows,
her empire's still intact.

447
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,781
This is Lieutenant Burk.

448
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,253
I'm commander Tom Chandler,
United States Navy.

449
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,445
Our ship made port this morning.

450
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,735
I know who you are.

451
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,985
I saw you making nice with
Granderson at the pier.

452
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,712
I don't know you.

453
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:37,688
At this point, I don't trust
anyone I meet in this town.

454
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,890
But I know Granderson fears and hates you,

455
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,459
so I'm operating on the premise

456
00:26:41,492 --> 00:26:43,793
that my enemy's enemy can be my friend.

457
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:46,463
If that's the case, we can help each other.

458
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:50,134
Granderson's choppers
hovering over your ship ...

459
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,968
not there for your protection?

460
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,738
Not quite, no.

461
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:00,178
Relax your weapons.

462
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,887
She fooled you.

463
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,790
She had good references.

464
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:14,324
Is it true you have the cure?

465
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,027
The doctor who invented
it is being held at Avocet,

466
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,361
along with the facilities
she needs to make more of it.

467
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:21,537
Both she and the lab
must survive the fight,

468
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:22,332
no matter what.

469
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:24,202
You're late.

470
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:25,890
We're taking Avocet tonight.

471
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,050
You guys?

472
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:28,543
You're outmanned and outgunned.

473
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,536
What?

474
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,309
You two are gonna call Granderson

475
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:32,576
ask for her surrender?

476
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,011
As soon as we cut off
the flow of electricity,

477
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:37,914
she'll send everything
she's got to get it back ...

478
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,621
from Avocet and my ship.

479
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:44,206
Both will be vulnerable.

480
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,470
Both will be taken by us.

481
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:51,028
Then we can stop the killing at Olympia

482
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,665
and get back to the
business of curing the world.

483
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:58,461
Help me execute my plan, and
we'll take her out together.

484
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:01,838
Even if she does send two
dozen troopers to the plant,

485
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:04,841
you can't take Avocet
with a frontal assault.

486
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,377
You got a better idea?

487
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:10,421
What do you think we're
all doing down here?

488
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:17,975
It's okay, Quincy. Doing okay?

489
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,723
I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

490
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:21,792
If we just give it up, we can
get him to the medical bay.

491
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:23,782
No, if they find what they're looking for,

492
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:26,264
it'll be open season on all of us.

493
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:30,470
Well?

494
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,680
I can't rush the adrenaline
drip. It'll blow out his heart.

495
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,580
I need a couple more minutes.

496
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,032
Watch them.

497
00:29:42,688 --> 00:29:44,991
You got five minutes.

498
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:56,187
You crazy mo-fo. How the hell
did you get back on the ship?

499
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,732
Climbed up the anchor chain.
Came right over the nose.

500
00:29:58,757 --> 00:29:59,669
Unbelievable.

501
00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:00,436
Yeah.

502
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,666
So, what the hell do we do now?

503
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,197
Get to the armory. Blow it up.

504
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:08,332
And kick some ass.

505
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:09,901
And kick some ass.

506
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:30,465
Found it in Dr. Tophet's cabin.

507
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:34,758
Malone: Mom, you and the
girl are coming with me.

508
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,925
Bacon: Hey, yo.

509
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,395
They ain't going nowhere.

510
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:38,898
No way, no how.

511
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:41,559
Now, just hang on,
everybody. Let's just be cool.

512
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:44,053
There's 170 of us on this ship

513
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:46,100
and, what ... 25 of you?

514
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,923
You might take down<i> some</i> of us,

515
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,726
but we<i> will</i> overrun you.

516
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,456
I'll go! I'll go.

517
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:01,085
Just ... just leave my daughter here.

518
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,372
- Mom!
- I'll be all right, darling.

519
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:07,231
Garnett: It's all right, sweetie.

520
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:09,526
She's gonna see your dad,
and they'll be right back.

521
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,625
Malone: Sit him down.

522
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:18,328
Where'd you stash it, big
man? I know it had to be you.

523
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:20,426
[Weakly] Even if I did...

524
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:22,827
Why would I tell<i> you?</i>

525
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,947
God damn it.

526
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:26,429
You tell me, or I'm gonna blow your ...

527
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:27,554
Nothing they can do to you, Quincy.

528
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:28,848
They need both you<i> and</i> Dr. Scott.

529
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:30,675
Got a present for you.

530
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,476
Quincy!

531
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,296
Whatever it is they want,
just give it to them!

532
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,295
Please!

533
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,421
Yeah. You might be right.

534
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:40,132
We may need him, but we
don't need<i> her.</i>

535
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,089
So somebody better start talking.

536
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:43,631
Goddamn coward!

537
