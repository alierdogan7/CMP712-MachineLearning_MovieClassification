to property speculators.

I can assure you it's
a filthy political move...

by the opposition.

373
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:44,780
From what I've read, there
are three points in the case...

374
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:46,783
which I find intriguing.

Do you think
the gentlemen are guilty?

376

I beg your pardon,
but if surprise evidence...

then nothing can be done except...

378

380
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,200

No, at the core there is a liberal,
fair-minded ruler...

many different kinds of people.

- And a lifetime of oppression!

- Tell that to his victims.

528
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,895

The only thing keeping

"Liberal tolerance"?
Is that some sort of joke?

543
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,871
You mean tolerance
for misery and hunger...

544
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,377
for watching hundreds of thousands
of workers sink into poverty.

545

Where do you get the nerve

547
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,617

- Or a Jew like you.
- Exactly!

549

Without the Emperor, you'd be
selling tonic like grandfather.

550
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:57,156
You only believe in this fairy-tale
Emperor out of pure greed.

551

I believe in a strong
judicial system...

552

553

You'll never be accepted here.
You'll be treated with suspicion.

- Yes, the Workers' Movement.

No, I want freedom.
For freedom, one must fight.

559
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:23,518

- Yes, please, let it flow!

560
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:25,647
- That is my wish!
<i>- [Ignatz] You know what I wish?</i>

your sick, vile...

563

Ignatz! No.

564
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,855
Perfect.
You put a curse on me.

565
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,925
<i>You're better off silenced by</i>
<i>my curse than by a prison sentence.</i>

566
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,632
Stop it! You're like two rabbis
fighting over the Torah.

Your husband's in love with success.

568
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,643
Yes, and I lust after power.

That's what makes you happy.
You love the Emperor.

571

Exactly.
You're on his side, aren't you?

572

<i>- You two looking at each other.</i>

- Are you completely insane?

Stop it, both of you!
Do you know what I want?

575
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,257
I don't want to be accepted
by people in power...

576

577

You want to know

I want to look out of the window and
see a country that I know and love.

580

What did you tell him?

868

things like this. I'm Italian."

885

01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:32,665
We're alone. I wanted us
to celebrate your victory alone.

1328
01:36:32,733 --> 01:36:34,667
You don't want to hear me, do you?
It won't happen.

1329
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:36,703
I won't betray my wife
or my brother.

1330
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:39,638
We've already betrayed them
with every thought that we've had.

1331
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:42,801
Whenever your brother
touches me, I think of you.

1332
01:36:42,877 --> 01:36:45,471
- Do you have a mistress?
- [Scoffs] Are you mad?

1333
01:36:45,546 --> 01:36:47,878
- Don't lie to me!
- How dare you call me a liar!

1334
01:36:47,949 --> 01:36:50,281
You're ready to lie to your husband,
so you expect me to lie to my wife,

1335
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:52,285
my brother,
you want to ruin my family?

1336
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:54,287
You'll be lying to me soon enough.

1337
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:58,758
What's all this honorable behavior?
It's only coming out of fear.

1338
01:36:58,826 --> 01:37:02,762
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Yes, you are. You're a hypocrite.

1339
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:05,424
I'm ready to run away with you,
Adam, anywhere you say.

1340
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,298
I thought you were a free spirit.
I was wrong.

1341
01:37:08,369 --> 01:37:11,429
You wouldn't know how to love me.
You only love yourself.

1342
01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:17,109
Don't walk away from me.
Come here.

1343
01:37:49,977 --> 01:37:52,207
Why do you love me,
Greta?

1344
01:37:54,649 --> 01:37:56,947
Because when you found out
you were really left-handed,

1345
01:37:57,018 --> 01:37:59,452
you let yourself
be left-handed.

1346
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,454
That was a miracle.

1347
01:38:01,522 --> 01:38:04,184
Fine. So I'll wait
for the next miracle.

1348
01:38:04,258 --> 01:38:07,625
You don't expect a miracle
from Istvan?

1349
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:09,629
No.

1350
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:14,363
- Poor Istvan.
- Don't feel sorry for Istvan.

1351
01:38:14,435 --> 01:38:16,369
Istvan's
a deeply satisfied man.

1352
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:18,371
He'll never change anything
about his life ever.

1353
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:20,964
- Stop it, Greta.
- It's how I feel, Adam.

1354
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:25,069
You want me to go home now and say,
"How was your day, darling,"

1355
01:38:25,146 --> 01:38:28,912
and slip into bed next to him and
carry on having an affair with you?

1356
01:38:28,983 --> 01:38:31,781
- I won't do that. I really can't.
- Nor could I.

1357
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:35,447
Fine. Run along home and tell Hannah
a horrible thing's happened...

1358
01:38:35,523 --> 01:38:38,515
- so both of you can hate me.
- I'm not gonna tell anything.

1359
01:38:38,593 --> 01:38:40,527
I certainly don't hate you.

1360
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:43,957
So what do you want?

1361
01:38:44,031 --> 01:38:47,262
Me to leave my husband,
you to stay with your wife?

1362
01:38:47,335 --> 01:38:50,099
Neither of us
leaves anyone?

1363
01:38:51,973 --> 01:38:55,101
Yeah. I suppose.

1364

your mother.

get out of my bed?

- You wanted this too.

1454
01:43:40,728 --> 01:43:42,889
I certainly did not.
You started this. You wanted it.

Adam, me or this country?

1456

You don't stop, do you?
If I'm going to choose,

1457
01:43:48,269 --> 01:43:51,033
I'm gonna stay with Hannah, who's
only exempt because she's my wife.

1458
01:43:51,105 --> 01:43:53,039
- Give this up.
- I won't give you up...

1459
01:43:53,107 --> 01:43:55,735
because I can't give you up because
that's what love does to people.

1460
01:43:55,809 --> 01:43:58,369
Evidently not to you.
I don't care about your family.

1461
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:00,379
- You want me to kill my family?
- Yes, yes, kill them.

1462
01:44:00,447 --> 01:44:03,177

- Jesus, you're monstrous.

That was my father.

1648

- Adam Sors was your father?
- Yes.

1649
01:58:49,269 --> 01:58:51,863
I used to fence a bit,
but I never had natural talent.

1650

Your father was unbeatable.
He was a magician.

1658
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:27,739
It was organized
by Hungarian authorities.

1659
01:59:27,807 --> 01:59:30,401
It was carried out
by Hungarian civil servants:

1660
01:59:30,477 --> 01:59:34,675
Village mayors, local police,
railway officials.

1661
01:59:36,349 --> 01:59:41,252
Nice, ordinary Hungarian people
did the dirty work.

1662
01:59:41,321 --> 01:59:45,189
Who came up with the Jewish laws
in the first place? Parliament.

the other way.

I got orders to shoot films that
looked like it came from the front.

Stage set, scenery.

- Cross him off.
- But he wrote pro-Nazi articles.

He turned down anyone

He advised people being
investigated to commit suicide.

Good morning, Comrade.

1817
02:10:04,176 --> 02:10:09,443
I saw you and Carole Kovacs slip out
of the opera together last night.

1818

I should warn you,
she's definitely spoken for.

She told me she had a husband
and two children.

1821
02:10:23,028 --> 02:10:25,724
Her husband blew up
Gestapo headquarters in Paris.

1822

He's one of the heroes
of the French Resistance.

You don't want to make
an enemy of him.

Her husband belongs to
the Comrade General's circle.

Mmm...
I admire him.

1844
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:34,414
During the war, in the Resistance,
he made me feel safe.

1845
02:13:34,486 --> 02:13:37,080
- He's a very brave man.
- But you don't love him?

I do, but...

1847
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:42,753
I think I married him because
I knew he would protect me.

- They were terrible times.
- He doesn't protect you now?

02:22:21,346 --> 02:22:25,442
You yourself could be highly suspect
because of being so close to Knorr.

1978
02:22:25,517 --> 02:22:28,077
Keep Jews off your team.

1979
02:22:43,568 --> 02:22:45,536
[Groans]

1980
02:23:01,853 --> 02:23:04,253
Tell me what
they're accusing me of.

1981
02:23:04,322 --> 02:23:06,483
A Zionist conspiracy.

1982
02:23:06,558 --> 02:23:08,549
Intention to overthrow
the Socialist state.

1983
02:23:08,627 --> 02:23:10,993
[Softly]
Are they crazy?

1984
02:23:11,062 --> 02:23:14,054
I have been ordered
to interrogate you.

1985
02:23:16,001 --> 02:23:18,435
Let's get started.

1986
02:23:20,138 --> 02:23:21,332
Thank you.

1987
02:23:27,679 --> 02:23:31,115
When did you first enlist in
the conspiracy against the State?

1988
02:23:31,182 --> 02:23:34,640
Never. I've never enlisted in
any conspiracy against the State.

1989
02:23:34,719 --> 02:23:37,779
We have filmed proof of your
meeting with Zionist agents...

1990
02:23:37,856 --> 02:23:39,790
<i>in the museum garden</i>
<i>on the fifth of this month.</i>

1991
02:23:39,858 --> 02:23:42,122
Made by your film director friend?
Who played my part?

1992
02:23:42,193 --> 02:23:44,627

<i>This is not a joke.</i>

1993
02:23:44,696 --> 02:23:47,631
<i>What connections do you have</i>
<i>with Zionist agents?</i>

1994
02:23:47,699 --> 02:23:50,463
None.
I told you.

1995
02:23:50,535 --> 02:23:52,469
I've never met
with Zionist agents.

1996
02:23:52,537 --> 02:23:55,301
I don't even know
any Zionist agents.

1997
02:23:55,373 --> 02:23:58,137
- Not even before the war?
- No.

1998
02:23:58,209 --> 02:24:00,200
What about at your orphanage?

1999
02:24:01,713 --> 02:24:05,479
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>the word "Zionism"?</i>

2000
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:08,781
- Of course I have.
- Where?

2001
02:24:08,853 --> 02:24:12,914
At the orphanage,
I had a friend.

2002
02:24:14,626 --> 02:24:18,062
He and some of his friends
wanted to emigrate to Palestine.

2003
02:24:18,129 --> 02:24:22,896
I joined the Young
Socialists instead.

2004
02:24:25,036 --> 02:24:27,197
So...

2005
02:24:27,272 --> 02:24:31,732
why didn't you go to Israel
if your best friend was with them?

2006
02:24:33,144 --> 02:24:38,912
Because they were religious,
and I was not.

2007
02:24:38,984 --> 02:24:40,918
If there hadn't been
the Young Socialists,

2008
02:24:40,986 --> 02:24:43,921
<i>I'd probably be living</i>
<i>on a kibbutz in Israel now.</i>

2009
02:24:43,989 --> 02:24:46,787
- Well, don't you see?
- I didn't have to be ashamed...

2010
02:24:46,858 --> 02:24:49,918
of my origins, and I didn't have
to be proud of them either!

2011
02:24:49,995 --> 02:24:51,758
What happened to you
during the war?

2012
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:55,732
- I was caught and put in Auschwitz.
- Any Zionists there?

2013
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,258
Sors.

2014
02:24:59,337 --> 02:25:01,567
- Enough of this nonsense.
- No, it's not nonsense.

2015
02:25:01,639 --> 02:25:03,607
You better understand,
this is not a game.

2016
02:25:03,675 --> 02:25:06,940
I'm asking you questions on orders
from people way up there.

2017
02:25:07,012 --> 02:25:09,708
As an officer of this department,
you are a suspect.

2018
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:12,909
You're under arrest.
If you don't answer thoroughly,

2019
02:25:12,984 --> 02:25:15,544
things are going to get tougher,
and you know what I'm saying.

2020
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,554
There's a lot of evidence here
that singles you out...

2021
02:25:17,622 --> 02:25:20,022
as one of the leaders
of this conspiracy.

2022
02:25:20,091 --> 02:25:22,184
<i>If you don't give me a confession,</i>
<i>you aren't going to leave here.</i>

2023
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,251
Don't hold your breath.

2024
02:25:24,329 --> 02:25:26,388
Why are Jews involved
in everything?

2025
02:25:26,464 --> 02:25:28,398
Wasn't Auschwitz
enough for you?

2026
02:25:28,466 --> 02:25:31,060
Even you will never
be free of Auschwitz.

2027
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:33,400
Auschwitz
was our baptism.

2028
02:25:33,471 --> 02:25:36,269
There is something
you must know, though.

2029
02:25:36,341 --> 02:25:38,741
Surviving Auschwitz doesn't
make a man better or greater.

2030
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:43,577
It's just burnt into your brain!
It can never be erased!

2031

Life itself,

A long time ago
we were happy.

No.

2040
02:26:44,476 --> 02:26:47,240

Only two Sonnenscheins.

2044
02:26:56,588 --> 02:26:59,887
The man's gone through a lot of
suffering. He survived Auschwitz.

2045
02:26:59,958 --> 02:27:03,416
Strange how the suffering
of Jews seems to touch you.

2046
02:27:03,495 --> 02:27:06,089
Don't you know that
other people suffered?

2047
02:27:06,164 --> 02:27:09,691
Ordinary people were shipped off
to the front to fight...

2048
02:27:09,767 --> 02:27:11,826
or else they stayed at home
and fought on their own doorsteps.

2049
02:27:11,903 --> 02:27:14,303
Don't these kind of people
matter to you too?

2050
02:27:14,372 --> 02:27:16,533
With all due respect,
after surviving Auschwitz,

2051
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:18,542
I don't think a beating
is going to break him.

2052
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:22,171
It's not the quality of the man.
It's the quality of the beating.

2053
02:27:22,247 --> 02:27:24,579
I'm not sure Knorr's guilt can ever
be proven without a confession.

2054
02:27:24,649 --> 02:27:27,516
- Then get one out of him!
- He calls himself a Communist.

2055
02:27:27,585 --> 02:27:30,713
Are you a policeman
or a fucking Boy Scout?

2056
02:27:30,788 --> 02:27:32,722
If he keeps saying
he's a Communist,

2057
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:37,056
make him understand that his
confession's important to the Party.

2058
02:27:37,128 --> 02:27:40,393
Our number one priority
is to let the world know...

2059
02:27:40,465 --> 02:27:43,730
the Workers' Movement is not
under Zionism's thumb,

2060
02:27:43,801 --> 02:27:48,067
and Marx and Engels
are not Jewish prophets.

2061
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:52,735
By the way, you don't know how lucky
you are that your uncle died.

We'll have these traitors
in our net in two weeks.

2065

Another question: Who does your
grandmother take pictures for?

2066
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:12,525
My grandmother takes pictures for
herself. She's just a photographer.

2067
02:28:12,597 --> 02:28:17,534
"A photographer"? You're surrounded
by questionable people.

2068
02:28:17,602 --> 02:28:19,695
Do you have
a girlfriend?

2069
02:28:19,771 --> 02:28:22,205
If you do,
have her investigated.

Don't get me mixed up in any

Who benefits... from turning me
into the enemy?

2078
02:28:52,637 --> 02:28:56,403
Or is it we've just gone back
to anti-Semitism as a solution?

02:28:56,474 --> 02:28:58,408
No new ideas?

2080
02:28:58,476 --> 02:29:01,240
In October, 1944, you were
recaptured by the fascists,

2081
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:03,246
sentenced to death and shot.

02:29:40,118 --> 02:29:42,313
I am convinced that
Andor Knorr is innocent...

02:29:42,387 --> 02:29:45,379

and of conspiracy to overthrow...

We believed we were going to make

to do everything to punish those

2178
02:36:02,166 --> 02:36:05,932
Just after the war, I found a framed
quotation on my father's desk.

2179
02:36:06,003 --> 02:36:10,030
It said: "We are afraid

to the police once a week.

2303
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:19,384
Difficult.

2304
02:45:19,456 --> 02:45:22,220
We should try
and find the recipe.

2305
02:45:22,292 --> 02:45:24,817
It's still hidden
in this house somewhere.

2306
02:45:24,895 --> 02:45:27,557
Search through
everything thoroughly.

2307
02:45:27,631 --> 02:45:30,191
Searching's the only job
I've ever done.

2308
02:45:32,069 --> 02:45:34,902
Are you sure
this recipe book exists?

2309
02:45:34,972 --> 02:45:38,373
- Or have you only heard about it?
- I saw it as a girl.

2310

<i>- [Knocking]</i>
- Hmm?

2311
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:43,911
Ilona, would you mind letting my
grandson look through the bookcase?

2312
02:45:43,981 --> 02:45:46,575
- We're searching for something.
- Come right in, Granny.

2313
02:45:50,988 --> 02:45:52,922
Start at the bottom?

2314
02:45:55,492 --> 02:45:56,960
[Gasps]
No, no.

2315
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:57,927
[Gasps]
No, no.

2316
02:45:58,996 --> 02:46:01,590

2323

I'm here.

2324
02:46:25,789 --> 02:46:28,349
What's your name, dear?

2325
02:46:28,425 --> 02:46:30,723
Can you say
your name, please?

2326
02:46:33,997 --> 02:46:36,431
Valerie Sonnenschein.

2327
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:40,061

2331
02:47:16,340 --> 02:47:18,774
[Softly]
Hello.

2332
02:47:24,648 --> 02:47:27,515
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

2333

- And the children?
- Very well.

2334
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:34,217
- Nothing's changed?
- No, not really.

2335

I'm sorry I couldn't say
anything else at your trial,

2336
02:47:39,463 --> 02:47:42,193
but... my children

2337
02:47:42,265 --> 02:47:44,233
Oh, that's all right.

2338
02:47:44,301 --> 02:47:47,896
Wouldn't mind talking to you if you
wouldn't find it too unpleasant.

2339
02:47:47,971 --> 02:47:50,098
No, of course not.

2340
02:47:50,173 --> 02:47:53,074
- I need your phone number.
- Excuse me.

Glad that you're

<i>[Emmanuel's Voice]</i>
<i>My dear son, Ignatz.</i>

2349
02:50:56,126 --> 02:50:59,220
<i>You've now left the safety of the</i>
<i>house in which you were born...</i>

2350
02:50:59,296 --> 02:51:03,392
<i>in order to achieve your</i>
<i>life's goal: To become a judge.</i>

2351
02:51:03,466 --> 02:51:05,900
To create laws,
as Moses did.

2352
02:51:05,969 --> 02:51:07,903
To render justice,
like King David.

2353
02:51:07,971 --> 02:51:12,067
To exercise power, from which
the Almighty has barred us...

2354
02:51:12,142 --> 02:51:16,909
or, perhaps, protected us for
thousands and thousands of years.

2355
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:20,575
You are entering a new world where
you will certainly be successful...

2356
02:51:20,650 --> 02:51:22,584
because you have knowledge.

2357
02:51:22,652 --> 02:51:25,246
Study has always been
our religious duty as Jews.

2358
02:51:25,322 --> 02:51:28,917
Our exclusion from society has given
us an ability to adapt to others...

2359
02:51:28,992 --> 02:51:32,257
and to sense connections between
things which seem diverse.

2360
02:51:32,329 --> 02:51:35,924
But if you feel you have power,
you are mistaken.

2361
02:51:35,999 --> 02:51:38,433
If you feel you have the right
to put yourself ahead of others...

2362
02:51:38,501 --> 02:51:41,902
because you think you know more
than they do, you are wrong.

2363
02:51:41,972 --> 02:51:45,271
Never allow yourself to be driven
into the sin of conceit.

2364
02:51:45,342 --> 02:51:49,608
Conceit is the greatest of sins,
the source of all other sins.

2365
02:51:49,679 --> 02:51:52,443
Never give up your religion,
not for God.

2366
02:51:52,515 --> 02:51:54,608
God is present
in all religions,

2367
02:51:54,684 --> 02:51:56,948
but if your life becomes
a struggle for acceptance,

2368
02:51:57,020 --> 02:51:58,954
you'll always be unhappy.

2369
02:51:59,022 --> 02:52:02,287
Religion may not be perfect,
but it is a well-built boat...

2370
02:52:02,359 --> 02:52:05,920
that can stay balanced
and carry you to the other shore.

2371
02:52:05,996 --> 02:52:08,829
Our life is nothing,
but a boat adrift on water,

2372
02:52:08,898 --> 02:52:11,867
balanced
by permanent uncertainty.

<i>They'rejust people,</i>
<i>like us.</i>

2376
02:52:20,910 --> 02:52:24,175

<i>Do not undertake</i>
