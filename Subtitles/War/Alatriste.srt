1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,640
In the 17th century,
though surrounded by enemies,

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,040
Spain still dominated the world.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,079
The king was Philip IV,
the "Planet King",

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,080
and his territories were ruled
with an iron hand by his favourite,

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,559
the Count-duke of Olivares.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,759
To Flanders, the Americas,
the Philippines,

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
part of Italy
and North Africa,

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Portugal and its colonies
had been added,

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
but it was in Flanders,
in a long, cruel war,

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,720
where the battle for the Empire's
survival was to be fought.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
An Empire sustained
by professional armies

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,679
whose main core were veterans

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
of the dreaded Spanish
infantry regiments.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,920
This is the story
of one of those men...

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Flanders, winter, 1622

16
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Here, Count!

17
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Count, cover us!

18
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Retreat!

19
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,159
Stay close to me, Count.

20
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Hold on to my shirt.

21
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Die, Catholic dog!

22
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Damn.

23
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Lope.

24
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,679
My son...

25
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,279
My son, Diego...

26
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,280
My son, Diego.
My son.

27
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Don Diego Alatriste: In compliance
with the wishes of my father,

28
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
who died, may God rest his soul,
in the land of heretics,

29
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I send you my brother Inigo, whom
I have not the means to maintain.

30
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,079
He knows mathematics,
can read and write,

31
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,319
is obedient and quick to learn,

32
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,999
though somewhat given
to fantasy and stubborn.
MADRID, ONE YEAR LATER

33
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,479
As you know, my father
wanted him to study,
MADRID, ONE YEAR LATER

34
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,480
to go to university,
but he wants to be a soldier.

35
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I pray that God and Your Honour
may forbid such a thing.

36
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,839
Ana Balboa,

37
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
OÃ±ate, Guipuzcoa.

38
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,559
Which one's that?

39
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
"M".

40
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,560
You're glum today, don Francisco.

41
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,360
How fares your memorial?

42
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,399
I do believe Philip the Great
and his favourite Olivares

43
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
have wiped their arses on it.

44
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,039
That's still a great honour.

45
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,040
An honour for his royal arse.

46
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,720
It was good paper, costing
half a ducat per ream,

47
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,599
and in my best hand.

48
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Rumour has it that Olivares
begins to hold you in esteem.

49
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,039
Yes.

50
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,040
He even gives me leave
to live in Madrid.

51
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,999
He needs your verses.

52
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Damn you, Captain!

53
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,880
You make a better friend
than an enemy.

54
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
So they say.

55
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,599
Excuse me, senor de Quevedo.

56
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
My friends and I were wondering
if certain verses were yours...

57
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,080
"Here lies, in black tomb hemmed,
lifeless and condemned

58
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,639
who sold his soul for profit vile

59
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
and e'en in death
lacks flair and style."

60
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,799
"In black tomb hemmed..."

61
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,799
Might be improved if they were mine.
Right, Inigo?

62
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,559
Of course, don Francisco.

63
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,599
In any case,

64
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
is Gongora so ruined that
they dedicate epitaphs to him?

65
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,279
Not that I know of.

66
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,280
I hear don Luis de Gongora
still enjoys good health.

67
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,280
So good that he still writes
the best poetry in Spain.

68
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Don't waste your steel so early
in the day, don Francisco.

69
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And on such a trifle.

70
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
The merriment's over.

71
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,919
The cuckold constable.

72
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,119
Quiet,

73
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
or I'll kick your arse
to kingdom come.

74
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Back to work.

75
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Diego, I have work for you.

76
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,599
There's someone who needs you.

77
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,799
Safe work,

78
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,079
no risks involved,

79
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
save the usual ones, of course.

80
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,759
And for a good purse...
to share.

81
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,719
To share?

82
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
With whom?

83
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Follow me.

84
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,519
Two foreign gentlemen.

85
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
They'll enter Madrid alone,
on horseback, this Friday night.

86
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,199
Payment for your services

87
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
will be 6O escudos in doubloons.
To share. Agreed?

88
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,039
That suits me.

89
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
We are each
three gold pieces short.

90
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
To be paid when the work
is done to satisfaction.

91
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,399
To whose satisfaction?

92
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,079
My sons,

93
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,719
I am Father Emilio Bocanegra,

94
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,720
President of the Council
of the Inquisition.

95
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
The two heretics must die.

96
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,799
Mercy!

97
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,479
Mercy!

98
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Mercy for my companion!

99
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
-Leave him!
-Do you jest?

100
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
None of this is clear.

101
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
They are not simple heretics.

102
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
We can kill them another day.

103
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,440
We shall meet again.

104
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Diego, you are in a fine mess.

105
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,080
I imagine so.

106
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,160
The news will soon spread and
all Madrid will be in an uproar.

107
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Now to the point.

108
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,399
Who commissioned you?

109
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,479
People.

110
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,079
Don't annoy me, Diego.
What people?

111
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,719
That's what I'd like to know,
Excellency.

112
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,079
I didn't see their faces.

113
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,080
And your companion in the ambush?
Didn't you see his face either?

114
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
As Your Excellency knows,
I always hunt alone.

115
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Diego, this is not
an interrogation by the Inquisition.

116
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,159
Well, it's up to you.

117
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
It's your neck, not mine.

118
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,199
But, out of curiosity...

119
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,519
Do you know who
you almost killed last night?

120
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,319
No, Count.
I give you my word on that.

121
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,999
I believe you.

122
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,279
Then why didn't you kill them?

123
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,999
I had a presentiment.

124
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sir, matters of extreme gravity
took place last night.

125
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,799
The Prince of Wales
and the Duke of Buckingham

126
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
have entered Madrid incognito.

127
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
They wish to be received
by Your Majesty.

128
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,440
They were almost
killed in an ambush.

129
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
I have ordered an investigation
to find the culprits.

130
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Sir, this unexpected visit
obliges us to take a decision

131
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,119
concerning the possible marriage
of your sister,

132
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Princess Maria,
and the Prince of Wales.

133
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,999
I have called the Council of State

134
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and the Committee of Theologians
to give you their opinion.

135
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,599
Thrust!

136
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,839
Go on!

137
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,119
You're not so good.

138
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Come on, thrust!

139
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,080
What is it, Inigo? You look
as though you'd seen a ghost.

140
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,959
No, no.

141
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,960
They say the English prince
was ambushed.

142
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,239
Well.

143
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,599
Do they know who did this?

144
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,719
Thieves, they say.

145
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
People have
too much imagination.

146
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Go get some wine.

147
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,439
You brute.

148
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Help me up.

149
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I can't walk.

150
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,919
How shall I get home?

151
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,679
I'll carry you.

152
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,999
Am I very heavy?

153
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,119
No.

154
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,639
No.

155
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,159
What's your name?

156
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,919
Inigo Balboa.

157
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Page to Captain Diego Alatriste.

158
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,239
I like soldiers.

159
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,839
My name's Angelica.

160
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,679
Will you remember?

161
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,559
Of course I'll remember.

162
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,159
I hope so.

163
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
You can put me down now.

164
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,799
I hope you know what you're doing.

165
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I know, don't worry.

166
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Dismiss those men.

167
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't kill that Batriste...
Latriste, whatever his name is, yet.

168
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,720
-But, madam...
-I have plans for Inigo.

169
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,360
I need that captain to look
after him until the time comes.

170
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Then you can kill him.

171
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,519
Yes, Captain, 'tis a comedy.

172
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,759
Commissioned by Olivares
for the queen.

173
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,519
And don Rafael here
will produce it.

174
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,159
-A great honour.
-And will you be paid

175
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
or will it be on account
for future favours as usual?

176
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
I know nothing of favours. Today is
yesterday, tomorrow is yet to come.

177
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
For the present
Olivares has promised 5OO reals.

178
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,359
A comedy...

179
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,399
Not your speciality.

180
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,159
-How dare you?
-No, the captain's right.

181
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,160
But if poor Cervantes tried one,
why can't I?

182
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Don Francisco, my wife,
the great actress Maria de Castro.

183
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,839
And Captain...

184
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,239
Alatriste.

185
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Diego and I know each other.

186
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,559
What are you thinking?

187
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I should stay away
from married women.

188
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Unless she's the most
desired woman in Spain.

189
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I haven't seen this one before.

190
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
It's been a long time.

191
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,159
Almost three years.

192
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,359
I've missed you.

193
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,679
Not in Italy.

194
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,680
It came to a bad end.
She finally married another.

195
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,959
I heard that.

196
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,960
You've changed, Diego.

197
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Perhaps I'm getting old.

198
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Or because of that boy
who lives with you.

199
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,879
You know I like
to know everything.

200
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,880
He's the son of a friend
who died in Flanders.

201
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,039
I promised to look after him.

202
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,639
And?

203
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm afraid of bungling it, Maria.

204
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,559
Everything happens
when you're a child.

205
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,039
You'll do it well.

206
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
You're a good man.

207
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,520
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

208
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,840
You have few dealings with people.

209
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,199
Maria, it's time!
Get ready!

210
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,879
Don't worry, keep going.

211
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,839
He's a reasonable man.

212
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I earn him a lot of money.

213
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,519
Is it worthwhile?

214
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,319
I'm a practical woman.

215
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,199
I have to think of the future.

216
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,599
To hell with the future.

217
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
In the future we'll all be dead.

218
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Diego Alatriste, I arrest you
in the name of the Inquisition.

219
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Take his weapons.

220
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Search him for hidden weapons.

221
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Clean.

222
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,480
He's clean.

223
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Kneel.

224
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,240
My son, you are a traitor
and an incompetent.

225
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,479
With your inopportune scruples

226
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,479
you have aided
the enemies of God and Spain.

227
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Actions you will purge
with hell's worst torments.

228
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,240
But first you will pay, here
on earth, with your mortal flesh.

229
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,959
You have seen too much.

230
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,919
Heard too much.

231
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,119
You have strayed too far.

232
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Your life, Captain,
is no longer worth a fig.

233
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,759
You are a corpse

234
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,719
that, by some whim of fate,

235
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
still remains standing.

236
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,280
You may go.

237
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Free?

238
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,439
In a manner of speaking.

239
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
God's wrath will know
where to find you.

240
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,879
Put that thing away.

241
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,479
It'll be of no use to you.

242
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,759
I haven't come to kill you

243
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
but to save you from others.
I didn't know

244
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,799
you were afraid of sheep.

245
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Only when they come
without shepherds.

246
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Take this in case.

247
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Strange shepherds.

248
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,600
No stranger than you.

249
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Your attitude saddens me,
though I was afraid it might be so.

250
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,880
You Spaniards are
so vain and coarse.

251
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,480
You lack finesse.

252
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,199
Perhaps that is why
you rule the world...

253
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
for now.

254
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
We shall meet again.

255
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,919
I hope so.

256
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I like you, Captain.

257
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,399
That is why I look forward
to fighting you.

258
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,999
Whenever you please, senor...

259
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,599
Malatesta.

260
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Gualterio Malatesta of Palermo.

261
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
If you please.

262
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Ah, I almost forgot...

263
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,279
A memento,

264
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,280
to keep me forever
in your thoughts.

265
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,079
Well?

266
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,759
The idea was
Friar Emilio Bocanegra's.

267
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,760
A secretary of the king's had
the assassins recruited and paid.

268
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,159
I see.

269
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,719
I see.

270
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,399
What more?

271
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,039
One was a Flanders veteran,

272
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,040
a protÃ©gÃ© of the Count of...

273
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,880
You may go.

274
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,519
This unites us forever.

275
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Now you'll never be free of me.

276
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I would die for you.

277
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Some day you may.

278
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Inigo.

279
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,639
You must be careful.

280
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,640
For a man, a woman's beauty
always ends in tyranny for a man.

281
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,119
'Tis the law of life.

282
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,759
I don't know you.

283
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
You will.

284
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,319
I need a favour of you.

285
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Look after the captain,
I need him alive.

286
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,520
I should kill you now,
while you're still a lad.

287
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,279
What do you think?

288
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,280
I bought it from a Sevillian
painter who works for the king.

289
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,359
They say he can only paint heads

290
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,360
but I suspect he has talent.

291
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,839
Well...

292
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,039
Let's get down to business.

293
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
An important person
wishes to see you.

294
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,279
A serious matter?

295
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,519
It may be.

296
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,839
Well...

297
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,799
I've probably seen worse.

298
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,799
No.
You've never seen worse.

299
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,399
You cannot fence
your way out of this one.

300
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,119
It is Count-duke Olivares.

301
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Be more honest with him
than you've been with me.

302
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,279
I'll try to be.

303
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,280
You will be.

304
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,759
That water was cold
as death, Your Excellency.

305
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,159
Yes...

306
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,160
But you never trembled.

307
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I trembled inside, like everyone.

308
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,119
I'm not everyone.

309
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,919
I am a Spanish grandee.

310
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,079
In combat we are all equal.

311
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,679
You're wrong there, Alatriste.
Not even in combat

312
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,959
are we all equal.

313
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
God didn't want it so.
You should know that.

314
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
If you're going to see Olivares,
buy some new boots.

315
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,840
Well...

316
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,920
I've spent more than enough
time on you. I've things to do.

317
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,319
And don't forget the boots.

318
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
If you have no money,
ask my majordomo.

319
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Thank you.

320
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,839
"Captain" is a nickname,
I presume.

321
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,919
Yes, Excellency.

322
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,920
I see you've served
in Naples and in Flanders

323
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,920
and against the Turks
in the Levante

324
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
and on the Barbary coast.

325
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,719
A long life as a soldier.

326
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Since I was thirteen, Excellency.

327
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Is it true that you saved the life
of a certain English traveller

328
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
when your companion
was about to kill him?

329
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Excuse me, Excellency,
I don't remember.

330
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
It would be best
for you if you did.

331
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,439
As to who recruited you,
for instance.

332
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,719
I'm afraid I can't.

333
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,159
I have a terrible memory.

334
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,160
I see...

335
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Call don Luis de Alquezar.

336
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,080
It seems, don Luis, that
a few days ago there was a plot

337
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to teach two English gentlemen
a lesson.

338
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,079
As His Majesty's secretary

339
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,080
and a man acquainted
with court bureaucracy,

340
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,639
perhaps you have heard something?

341
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm afraid I can be
of little use there, sir.

342
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,039
Well, you must be.

343
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,599
Perhaps the church...

344
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,600
The church is broad.

345
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,839
Might you mean Father Bocanegra?

346
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,839
Excellency, I...

347
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,559
You are right, don Luis.

348
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,279
The good Father is a saintly man.

349
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
As we all know.

350
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,119
Tell me...

351
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Are your boots a sign of lack
of means or soldierly arrogance?

352
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Both, Excellency.

353
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,679
As you see, don Luis,

354
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
senor Alatriste
is both poor and haughty.

355
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,079
But he also appears to be

356
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,839
brave, discreet

357
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,399
and trustworthy.

358
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
It would be a pity if some
misfortune were to befall him.

359
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I would not wish it so.
I imagine you agree with me.

360
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,319
Of course, Excellency.

361
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
But with the kind of life
I imagine senor...

362
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,879
Batriste...
whatever his name, leads,

363
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,279
he must often
be exposed to danger.

364
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,559
No-one could then
take responsibility.

365
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,759
Naturally, don Luis.

366
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,760
In order to spare you any such
inconvenience, I have decided

367
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,279
that henceforth
you will serve your king

368
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,439
in the Indies.

369
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Men like you are needed there.

370
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,920
You may begin preparations
for the voyage.

371
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,879
As for you...

372
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,439
Your former general,
Ambrosio Spinola,

373
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,439
wishes to win more battles
for us in Flanders.

374
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
It would be considerate of you
to be killed there, not here.

375
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I'll bear that
in mind, Excellency.

376
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,279
Come with me.

377
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,799
For four long years

378
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,719
I've studied this map every night.

379
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,799
I know every port,

380
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
every canal, every estuary,
every fortress...

381
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Flanders deprives me of my sleep.

382
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Yet I've never been there.

383
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,480
It is the end of the world,
Excellency.

384
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,720
When the Lord God created Flanders,
he lit it with a black sun.

385
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
A heretic sun

386
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,720
that neither warms you nor dries
the rain that soaks you to the bone.

387
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
It is a strange land,

388
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
inhabited by strange people
who fear and despise us

389
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,560
and will never give us peace.

390
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,120
It deprives one
of more than sleep.

391
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Flanders is hell itself.

392
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Without Flanders
there's nothing, Captain.

393
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
We need that hell.

394
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Breda, 1625. After one year's siege
by the Spanish

395
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,239
They're close now, curse it!

396
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
They'll blow our balls off
with their mines.

397
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,639
Keep down!

398
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Sons of bitches!

399
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,079
Did you find eggs?

400
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,999
Yes.

401
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,879
How many?

402
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Two.

403
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Wine.

404
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Clumsy!
Give me that.

405
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,760
I hear you had
a letter from the Indies.

406
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,599
Yes.

407
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,600
And who wrote to you,
if I may ask?

408
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Angelica de Alquezar.

409
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Alquezar...

410
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,799
A name that brings us bad luck.

411
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,959
I almost have him.

412
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Give me that bread.

413
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,439
Do you have him or not, damn it!

414
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,159
Not now.

415
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,159
But he occasionally looks out.

416
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,719
I'll be ready the next time.

417
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,159
Shit!

418
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Portuguese, see if
you can draw him out.

419
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Dutchman!

420
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,439
Did you kill him?

421
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
One bastard less...

422
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,719
Another Dutchman

423
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,599
dead in mortal sin.

424
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,239
Like you when they kill you.

425
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,759
What did you say?

426
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,719
What did you say?

427
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,720
You can't fool me,
however much you cross yourself.

428
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
You Portuguese
are all half-Jews.

429
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Do you want to die?

430
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The Captain!

431
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
I bring orders.

432
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Perhaps these gentlemen
have something to say.

433
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,759
No-one has anything to say.

434
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I do.

435
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,959
I have three things

436
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,960
to say to Captain Bragado.

437
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,479
First, I don't care who I fight.

438
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Turks, Dutchmen
or whoever fathered them.

439
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,959
And the other two things?

440
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Second, we haven't been given
clothing and we're dressed in rags.

441
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,879
I see.

442
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,880
And the third thing?

443
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Third and most important of all...

444
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Stay there.

445
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,119
Third, these gentlemen

446
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,120
have not received their pay
for five months. Five months!

447
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,160
No-one has received their pay.

448
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,559
Neither you gentlemen nor I.

449
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Nor the field marshal
nor General Spinola.

450
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I thought I was talking
to Spaniards, not Germans.

451
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Only soldiers of other nations
ask for their pay in advance.

452
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,199
What are the orders?

453
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
You are to go down
to the tunnels.

454
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Sulphur!

455
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,879
Copons is missing.

456
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,599
Sebastian!

457
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,279
One's enough.

458
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,280
Diego!

459
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Breda has surrendered.

460
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,519
Spit it out.

461
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,520
Spit it out.

462
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Breda has surrendered.

463
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,479
Any booty?

464
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,480
No.

465
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,120
MADRID, 1O YEARS LATER

466
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,639
Excellency.

467
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,599
Excellency.

468
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,600
I'm Inigo Balboa.
You called for me.

469
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,959
For Captain Alatriste.

470
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Urgent.

471
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,680
Port Caleta, Cadiz.
Landing of Flanders veterans

472
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Come on!

473
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,959
Mother!

474
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,119
What are you doing here?

475
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,120
My son, I have some bad news.

476
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,120
Bad news!

477
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Look who's here.

478
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,999
I thought you were in Madrid.

479
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,679
I've a letter from the palace.

480
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,679
Work?

481
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,239
I suppose so.

482
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,240
If you need us,
you know where, Diego.

483
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,999
Won't you open it?

484
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What for? They always want us
for the same thing.

485
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,959
How are you?

486
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Worse.

487
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,479
You look well.

488
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,479
How are things at the court?

489
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,239
I can't complain.

490
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,679
How was the voyage?

491
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,680
Hectic. We ran into
a Dutch fleet and, well...

492
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,639
you know I don't
much like fighting at sea.

493
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,640
I know.

494
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,159
Tell me,

495
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,999
what's happened in Madrid
while I've been away?

496
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,879
There's to be war with France.

497
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,959
So they say.

498
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Don Francisco's married a widow.

499
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,079
God, no!

500
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,080
And Velazquez's finished
"The Surrender of Breda".

501
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,839
Have you seen it?

502
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,319
He changed the flags for lances.

503
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,320
And well, softened
the attitudes somewhat.

504
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,519
But it's a grand painting.
You'll love it.

505
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
I'm sure.

506
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,479
Anything else?

507
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,959
Angelica de Alquezar

508
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,960
has returned to Spain.

509
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,999
There'll be killing
and plenty of it.

510
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,879
I only have two hands.

511
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,439
Four.

512
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,359
We'll see about that.

513
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,519
Why?

514
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,520
I said we'll see.

515
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,559
What's the work?

516
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,560
I'm just a go between.
Guadalmedina has the details.

517
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,959
But there'll be no lack of gold.

518
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,960
The commission is private
but the command is sovereign.

519
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,959
What an honour!

520
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,399
With such high-ranking
personages involved,

521
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,400
it must be that someone
has stolen more than they should.

522
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,079
You've been away too long, Captain.

523
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,759
Someone always steals
more than they should.

524
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,760
Yes.

525
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,879
We'll meet later.

526
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Of course.

527
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,639
The ship is the "Virgen de Regla".

528
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,640
She has 2,OOO ingots
of undeclared gold in her hold.

529
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,360
Have they nothing
to say in customs?

530
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,519
I find you rather naive
this evening, Diego.

531
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,520
Bribes keep mouths shut
and minds open.

532
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,840
That includes
high-ranking courtiers.

533
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,280
The plan is that
before unloading

534
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,319
officially in Seville, the ship

535
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,320
will anchor offshore and the gold
be transferred to a Flemish boat,

536
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,480
the "Niklaasbergen".

537
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And I suppose that for
the gold to return to the king,

538
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,040
the Flemish boat will have
to be boarded. Am I right?

539
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,360
What I like about you is that you
never need things explained twice.

540
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,920
And once the gold's
been returned to the king,

541
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,120
where will it go?

542
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,760
I don't understand you.

543
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,359
I'm asking, Excellency,

544
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,360
if the gold will go for the work
on the Buen Retiro Palace

545
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,199
or to pay the wages
of the soldiers who die in Flanders

546
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,200
or are to die in France.

547
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,120
You drink too much, Alatriste.

548
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,599
Words cost little.

549
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,279
What did you say to her?

550
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,199
How, Teodoro,

551
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,200
do men pay amorous
compliments to women?

552
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
As if you were in love,
you dress a thousand lies in truth,

553
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,999
and hardly that.

554
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,799
Yes, but with what words?

555
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Strangely do you press me,
my lady.

556
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,359
"Those eyes," I said,

557
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,360
"those lovely orbs are the light
with which my own eyes see..."

558
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,600
And, "The coral and pearls
of your celestial mouth..."

559
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,519
Celestial?

560
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Such things are the primer
of all who love and desire.

561
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,719
Your taste is bad, Teodoro.

562
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,679
You disappoint me.

563
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,680
Marcela's good points
are outnumbered by her flaws.

564
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,880
She is not clean in her person...
But I would not want you

565
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,520
to stop loving her, though
a few things I could tell you...

566
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,719
But let's say no more
of her charms or lack of them.

567
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
I want you to love and marry her.

568
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Now, as you think yourself
an expert on love, counsel me.

569
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,559
And so possess Marcela.

570
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,319
Now that friend of mine

571
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,320
has no rest for she's in love
with a man of lowly station

572
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,079
and "twould be
dishonourable to love him.

573
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,080
Yet were she to lose him,
she'd be consumed by jealousy.

574
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,360
And he, unsuspecting
of her love, is shy

575
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,120
and treats her with deference.

576
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,519
Hello, lad.

577
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,199
You've grown.

578
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,239
You're a man.

579
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,919
I thought you dead.

580
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,559
Maybe I am.

581
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,560
That wouldn't surprise me.

582
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,399
We'll meet again, I imagine.

583
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,919
Count on it.

584
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,920
Then we'll see
whether you're alive...

585
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,880
or dead.

586
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,559
Would it not be best

587
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,560
to have him killed?

588
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
It's been a long time.

589
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Very long.

590
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,879
What have you been doing
all these years?

591
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,319
Killing heretics

592
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,320
and writing verses.

593
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,320
And are those verses
worthy of reading?

594
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,239
No, I don't think so.

595
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,240
But it was the only way
of imagining you.

596
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,560
I see you still know
how to talk to women.

597
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,200
I thought I'd never see you again.

598
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,160
They say you're still
with that captain.

599
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,840
Of course.

600
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,639
I have plans for you, Inigo.

601
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,159
The trouble is...

602
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,160
that I also have plans for you.

603
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,919
Teodoro,

604
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,639
you're leaving.

605
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,479
And I love you.

606
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,239
I leave because of your cruel ways.

607
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,599
You know me,
what am I to do?

608
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,319
-Do you weep?
-No.

609
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,319
There's something in my eye.

610
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,919
Is it love?

611
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,879
Yes, it must be.

612
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,479
It's been there some time
but now it's out.

613
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,480
I leave, my lady,
but my soul does not.

614
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,799
I must leave without it.
I've done

615
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,800
no wrong loving you, for your beauty
commands the very soul.

616
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,279
Command me, for I am yours.

617
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,199
-What a sad day!
-I leave, my lady, I leave

618
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,999
but my soul does not.

619
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,439
Do you weep?

620
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,359
No, there's something in my eye,

621
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,759
as was in yours.

622
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,759
My tears brought yours on.

623
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,759
That must be the case.

624
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,760
A thousand childish things
I've put in a chest for you.

625
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,639
Forgive me, I had to.

626
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,319
If you open it,

627
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,320
be sure to say, as if they were
the spoils of some victory,

628
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,879
"Diana put those there

629
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,880
with tears in her eyes."

630
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,999
Did you like the play?

631
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
You were marvellous.

632
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Have you seen
what the king sent me?

633
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,759
He'll expect
something in return.

634
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,759
Don't talk of your king like that.

635
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,239
Yes,

636
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,039
he's my king.

637
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,040
But there are kings and kings
and this one should govern.

638
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,679
One day they'll kill you, my love.

639
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,680
Maybe.

640
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,600
My husband's dying.

641
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,159
I'm sorry.

642
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,679
Yes, poor thing.

643
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,599
And when he dies,
I'll have to remarry.

644
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,600
I don't like living on my own.

645
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,119
I was thinking

646
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,120
that as you were
the first man I knew...

647
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,960
Maria, I'm dirt-poor.

648
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,760
I'll provide the money
and you the rest.

649
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,640
And your...

650
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,399
admirers?

651
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Diego, I'm an actress
and I'm starting to age.

652
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,640
Spain's full of young girls
eager to take my place.

653
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,479
I need friends who'll protect me.

654
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,199
If we married,

655
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,200
I'd kill the first man
to approach you, whoever he was.

656
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,760
I'd end up on the gallows
and you a widow once more.

657
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,720
Don't be old-fashioned.

658
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,399
Anyway, what would you care?

659
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,400
You're not in love with me.

660
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,920
What do you know?

661
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Make way!

662
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,319
"Thus on this day,

663
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,359
this sentence is read
to the prisoner

664
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,360
and tomorrow he will be taken
from prison on a mule

665
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,359
to the plaza de San Francisco,

666
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,119
where a gallows will be
erected for the occasion,

667
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,120
and there he shall be hanged
by the neck until he is dead.

668
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,479
This justice do I order done."

669
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,480
Signed by the king, our lord.

670
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,399
Do you need something?

671
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Your advice.

672
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,319
I need men for a job.

673
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,320
Brave men and discreet.

674
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,919
All those here present are.

675
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,039
You can trust them all.

676
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Trouble is, most of them
are serving long sentences.

677
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I can get them all released.

678
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,359
Except you.

679
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,360
I'm sorry.

680
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,880
A pity.

681
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,479
Well...

682
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,480
Death's but a formality.

683
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,559
I have things to do.

684
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,959
I'll see you on the beach.

685
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,199
I'm not going.

686
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,919
Why not?

687
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,920
The Inquisition's after me.

688
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,040
They've already arrested
my father and my brother...

689
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,639
The torture...

690
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,839
I can't take it...

691
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,359
They've nothing on you.

692
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,360
You were a soldier
and are innocent.

693
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Luis Pereira, I arrest you
in the name of the Holy Office.

694
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,360
God's will is done.

695
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,720
God has nothing to do with this.

696
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Nothing!

697
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,079
You're late.

698
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,080
A matter detained me.

699
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,280
A matter of blood?

700
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,960
What did you want to tell me?

701
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,280
You seem in a hurry.

702
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,919
Perhaps my company discomforts you.

703
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,920
No, I have some business
to attend to.

704
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,160
You should know that you have
some inconvenient friends.

705
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,519
Friends who are enemies
of my friends.

706
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,520
Captain Alatriste

707
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,239
is my business.

708
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,240
Mine alone.

709
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,719
Stay with me.

710
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,720
I cannot.

711
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,720
You must not go
to that appointment.

712
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,239
Mustn't I?

713
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,199
Tell me why not.

714
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,200
Because I cannot marry a corpse.

715
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,920
This group will go first
and board the stern.

716
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,919
And the leaders?
Who will they be?

717
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,399
Sebastian will board
the prow, I'll be astern.

718
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,839
That's good with me.

719
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,559
Glad to hear it.

720
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,199
No prisoners are to be taken.

721
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,919
There will be no plunder.

722
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,639
And no-one...

723
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,640
under any circumstance,
is to go down into the hold.

724
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,080
Good luck.

725
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,999
Ambush!

726
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Take cover!

727
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,239
Shit!

728
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Shit!

729
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,640
I'm late. Sorry.

730
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,719
Diego...

731
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,720
We're fools.

732
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,040
Mother of God!

733
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,280
Diego.

734
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,800
It cannot be.

735
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,399
And you?

736
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,400
No.

737
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,759
A pity.

738
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Yes.

739
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I had to try.

740
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,239
You know that, don't you?

741
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,240
Yes, I know.

742
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,679
We all love once.

743
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,479
Or several times.

744
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,919
Then one day it stops happening.

745
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,999
And that's all.

746
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
As simple as that?

747
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,040
As difficult as that.

748
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,519
Look, Inigo...

749
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,119
She's true to her own kind.

750
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,399
And I to mine.

751
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,679
Really?

752
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,680
Tell me about it.

753
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,760
Angelica de Alquezar
is my business.

754
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,159
All right.

755
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Sit down.

756
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,800
They wouldn't allow it,
even if she wanted to.

757
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,159
She has her obligations.

758
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,439
What do you mean by that?

759
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,159
That I too have mine?

760
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,279
God! There are rules.

761
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,399
What rules?

762
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,319
Those of a captain
who's not a captain?

763
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,320
Or those of a sword-for-hire
who kills even his friends?

764
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I expect we'll meet in Madrid.

765
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Well, well.

766
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,200
If it isn't Captain Alatriste!

767
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,639
I see your acts of charity

768
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,439
extend to visiting the sick.

769
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,279
I'm a good Catholic.

770
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,199
Have you come to kill me?

771
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,200
Or do you wait for the consequences
of your latest adventures

772
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,119
to catch up with you?

773
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,799
There's no need
to tell me anything.

774
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,800
I know full well
who's behind it all.

775
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,479
Then...

776
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,480
let us proceed.

777
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,960
I'd greatly appreciate your trying
to use that pistol or your sword.

778
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,679
Not a chance.

779
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,680
Can you really
not move from that bed?

780
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,199
Come, Captain.

781
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,200
You sound like a nun of St. Clare.

782
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,760
Don't let your conscience
trouble you now.

783
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,720
You're right.

784
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,240
Say your prayers.

785
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,920
I never waste my time
on such nonsense.

786
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,440
Go ahead.

787
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Good day to your worship.

788
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,040
His Majesty wishes you
to have this chain.

789
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,040
Must I wait all day?

790
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,639
Why are you dressed as a man?

791
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,640
That's prohibited.

792
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Would you have me come out at night
in a skirt and farthingale?

793
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,039
Do you still feel
resentful towards me?

794
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,359
I may have saved your life.

795
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,360
While I betrayed
those close to me?

796
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,520
I also lost some who were
close to me. Then we are even.

797
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,159
It's not the same, Angelica.

798
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,999
No.

799
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But I'm sure you didn't call me
just to scold me.

800
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,599
The other day,

801
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,399
-you said...
-I know what I said.

802
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,839
And I maintain it.

803
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,840
But you'll agree that
it won't be an easy matter.

804
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,400
I know.

805
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,480
I expect you know
I'm lady-in-waiting to the queen

806
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,879
and that she is fond of me.

807
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,799
What is your point?

808
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,800
There is a vacancy for second
lieutenant in the Royal Guard...
