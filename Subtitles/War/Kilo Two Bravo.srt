01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,449
SMUDGE:
No. Two more.

Jack the Ripper.

1180
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,364
SMUDGE:
No. Last guess, make it a good one.

1181
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,154
Come on, give me,
give me some more...

1182
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,673
- Eh? What did you say?
'Rules is rules, Stu.

1183
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,403
I just had my fucking leg blown off, mate.

1184
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,639
Is that how it's gonna be now?
'Oh, my poor leg.

1185
01:22:56,665 --> 01:22:58,629
Oi, lend us a quid, Smudge.

1186
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,007
Alright, fuck off.

1187
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,448
Hannibal Lector?
- Nah.

1188
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,446
Let's call it quits.

1189
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,521
Harold Shipman.

1190
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,406
Harold fucking who?

1191
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,043
Harold Shipman, the doctor of death.

1192
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,405
No, I've never heard of him.

1193
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,208
Of course you have. He killed, like,
two-hundred people, maybe more.

1194
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,111
He's not, like, fucking
world famous, is he?

1195
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,608
- He's from your
neck of the woods.

1196
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,210
You know exactly who I'm talking about.

1197
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:38,723
Well, there's not a fucking plaque to him.
- He's up there. You'd be surprised.

1198
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,200
We're never getting out of here.

1199
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,609

I reckon you made him up.

Kenneth Arthur Barlow.

1202
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,207
Hey, Ken!

1203
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,331
It still fucking hurts.
- Yeah, that's good, mucker.

1204
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,930
If it's hurting it means
you're alive, mate. Alright?

1205
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,402
Stu.

1206
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,286
Stu, punch your card.

1207
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,689
My camera...
- ...Fucking camera, pal.

1208
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,884
I need more fucking morphine.

1209
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,847
You take the pain, Stu.
You're a big lad, you'll be alright.

1210
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:52,848
Mark?

1211
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,927
No fucking snoozing, boys, yeah?

1212
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,089
Prosser? You with us?
- Yeah.

1213
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,244
Y... yeah. Yeah.

1214
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,165
Keep talking to me, Prosser.

1215
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,011
Talk about what?

1216
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,127
You tell me, pal.

1217
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,445
We could talk about the weather.

1218
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,130
Short, fucking conversation.

1219
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:27,521
T... tell you what, I'm trying to think
if I've had worse birthdays than this.

1220
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,365
And I've had some shit ones.

1221
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,248
When I was eight, my...

1222
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,368
mum and dad clean out fucking forgot.

1223
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,528
All day long I was thinking
they're just pretending.

1224
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,402
They're gonna spring this monster
fucking surprise on me.

1225
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,248
Even when I'm having my tea

1226
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,804
in the bath

1227
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,762
getting into fucking bed...

1228
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,962
I'm thinking, 'Oh these guys are good.

1229
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,365
Then they shut the door,
turned out the lights

1230
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,925
and that was it.

1231
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,888
I cried like a burst fucking drain.

1232
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,685
Then they came back in though, yeah?
- No.

1233
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:32,126
No. They fucking forgot.

1234
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,765
But this is shitter.

1235
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,368
Well, we can do something
about that, can't we boys?

1236
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,841
Stu.

1237
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,243
Ken, Mark.

1238

One more time, boys, loud.
Nice and loud, let him hear you.

a bottle of champagne

It's funny...
- What's that?

1284
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:42,003
My mum always said
I was born under a lucky star.

1285
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,088
How?

1286
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:51,565
Kept on winning things,
you know, like raffles and stuff.

1287
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,408
Yeah.

1288
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,809
I won her a pair of diamond
earrings at the Sabre Centre.

1289
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,002
She always wore them when I came home.

1290

I am.
- No, you're not. You're alright... Fine...

1310
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,290
Tell Gill that I love her.

1311
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:55,766
Tell her I want her to be happy...
want her to marry some other fella.

Tell them have a piss-up on me

No cash bar.

1316

Tell my uncle that I died
being a good soldier, eh? A good Para.
