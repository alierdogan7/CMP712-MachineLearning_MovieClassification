1
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:04,315
Yes, sir. I understand completely, sir.

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,175
Things go that way sometimes.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,946
Yes, sir, I will. You can count on me.

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,785
Kids, come on out. Time
for deployment gifts.

5
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:16,953
- Ashley: Coming!
- Sam: I'm coming, too!

6
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:19,121
Photos, videos, and playlists.

7
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:21,324
Not as good as a warm body in your bed,

8
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,026
but it'll just have to
do till I see you again.

9
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,195
Sam: Wait, Ashley. Let me get it!

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,930
[Sprinkler hissing]

11
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,732
Darien, I'm not going to the med.

12
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,934
Navy's sending us to the Arctic.

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,670
The Arctic? That's crazy.

14
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,706
Some cold weather test
on a new weapons system.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,976
It's all classified.
It's happening very fast.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,944
We're gonna be at complete radio silence.

17
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,379
No e-mails, no calls.

18
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,914
For how long?

19
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:48,084
Six months, maybe five.

20
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,753
- Figures.
- It's my last tour for a while.

21
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,822
Then I'll be around the house so much,

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,157
you'll be sick of me, I promise.

23
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:57,126
Sit down.

24
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,131
Did you wrap this yourself?

25
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,366
I did.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,737
It's from the championship game.

27
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:10,006
Keep it next to your bed.

28
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,409
I love it, buddy. That's really great.

29
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,378
- Thank you.
- [Papers rustle]

30
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,980
[Sighs]

31
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,853
- It's beautiful.
- It's not regulation,

32
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:28,090
so I know you can't wear it.

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,293
How about I keep it in the front pocket

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,395
of my uniform right over my heart?

35
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:42,838
[Sighs]

36
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,843
Man over radio: I need help,
if anyone out there can hear me.

37
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm just outside... [Speaks indistinctly]

38
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,715
[Switch clicks] Woman:
I need help, please.

39
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:54,183
If you can hear me...

40
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,018
[Switch clicks, man speaking Spanish]

41
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,820
[Switches clicking,
woman speaks indistinctly]

42
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:00,423
[Static, man speaking indistinctly]

43
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,058
[Door opens]

44
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,260
[Sighs]

45
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,965
I sent the guys on a break.

46
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,266
[Sighs] Figured I'd see what's going on

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,268
in the outside world.

48
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:15,705
It's a lot of static.

49
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:16,906
Yeah, whatever you might hear out there

50
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:19,041
is not gonna be particularly uplifting.

51
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,343
Well, my dad had an old ham radio

52
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:21,978
set in his cabin,

53
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:24,914
and I thought maybe if Darien was...

54
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,351
It's our anniversary.

55
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,255
You never come down here.

56
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,757
[Sighs] No.

57
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,193
Yeah, I don't think
Christine's looking for me.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,928
Come on.

59
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:40,997
Well...

60
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,766
Before we left, things were
pretty ragged between us.

61
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:47,737
When I finally got her on the phone

62
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:52,742
after we lifted EMCOM,
she... told me about Lucas.

63
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,013
Losing a son is one thing,

64
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:01,283
but dealing with it on your own is just...

65
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,152
There was nothing you could do.

66
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,988
That is not what she wanted to hear.

67
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:10,259
I'll leave you to it.

68
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,398
There's still a chance, Mike.

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,435
For all of us.

70
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,376
[Door closes]

71
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,391
Jordan!

72
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,093
[Man shouts indistinctly]

73
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,429
- On the side! Shoot it! Shoot it!
- Hey!

74
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,863
I'm open! I'm open!

75
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,465
- Right here!
- That's what I want.

76
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,966
Come on, Miller. Thought you could hoop.

77
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,301
- Yeah, I can.
- You can, huh?

78
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,303
[Grunts]

79
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:56,105
[Indistinct shouting]

80
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,807
- [Water splashes]
- Oh, man. That was our last ball.

81
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:00,176
[Hip-hop music playing]

82
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:02,912
Nice, buddy.

83
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,014
So why Costa Rica?

84
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,583
Dr. Scott's gonna need some
primates to test her vaccine.

85
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:09,085
Apparently, there's a monkey reserve

86
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,419
a few miles upriver.

87
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,488
She doesn't have the vaccine, does she?

88
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:16,092
She's working on it.
Meanwhile, we move forward.

89
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:18,461
Hey.

90
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,831
You think there'll be a beach?

91
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,899
I could really use a beach right now.

92
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,305
What? What the hell is this?

93
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,941
Wasn't this on the list to be rebuilt?

94
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,209
Yes, sir.

95
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:34,543
The chief engineer put the hts on it,

96
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,312
but we're out of spare parts.

97
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:37,613
They're cobbling everything
together from scratch.

98
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,115
Well, she's laid up in medical bay,

99
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:40,549
and it's on me now if that gasket blows.

100
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,418
No one gets off watch till it's done.

101
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:49,058
[Chugging sound]

102
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,459
Does anybody hear that?

103
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,995
- Hear what, sir?
- She's not purring.

104
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,199
[Sighs]

105
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,072
This is the messdecks
for the enlisted in here,

106
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,540
although I think you'll
probably take your meals

107
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,909
with the officers in the wardroom.

108
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:08,511
Man, these are some cramped quarters.

109
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,579
I don't know how y'all do it.

110
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,048
Four months you've been on this ship now?

111
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,918
- Almost five.
- Five? Wow.

112
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:17,419
Ma'am.

113
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:24,260
Whoa. She is tasty.

114
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,562
Now is she not?

115
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,964
Oh, lighten up, dude. I'm just saying.

116
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,432
- It's the end of the world, right?
- Excuse me.

117
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,968
Nothing wrong with spreading
a little love around,

118
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:36,272
and I ain't Navy, so...
Yeah, well, they are,

119
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:38,474
which means no fraternizing, period.

120
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,975
Oh, I get it. I get it.

121
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,511
Hey, um... Where is the lab?

122
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,513
Maybe pay a visit to that scientist.

123
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:48,150
She's a civilian, right?

124
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,485
I can't believe I have to bunk with you.

125
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:52,221
Seriously, where's the lab?

126
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,157
[Machines beep steadily]

127
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,159

[Computer beeping]

00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:22,351
[Exhales deeply]

131
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,053
I need to complete the sequence analysis

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,421
of the three known virus strains...

133
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,156
Primordial, Egyptian,

134
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,557
and the sample that I
extracted from the cruise ship.

135
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,159
You do what you gotta
do, but you do it alone.

136
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,527
I'm not letting him back in that lab.

137
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,195
Believe me, Quincy is the last person

138
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:36,198
that I wanna see right now, but I need him.

139
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,101
And we're right on the verge here.

140
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,604
That man tried to infect this entire ship.

141
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:44,306
You're not listening to me.

142
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:47,977
This is one procedure
that I cannot do alone.

143
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,545
What about Doc Rios?

144
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,514
I am sure that he is an
excellent ship's doctor,

145
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:55,584
but I need a highly trained
expert in bioinformatics

146
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,186
just for a few hours.

147
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,388
I promise that I won't
let him near anything

148
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,090
that could endanger the ship.

149
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,636
[Sighs]

150
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,107
What do you want?

151
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,577
I managed the sequencing.

152
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:25,047
All three strains.

153
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,583
Wasn't sure that I was
gonna be able to do it

154
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:30,352
with the equipment on
hand, but the data is in.

155
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,655
And you need me to analyze it.

156
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,457
Yes.

157
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:42,398
Look, Quincy, I am sorry
for you and for your family,

158
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,134
for... Kelly.

159
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,435
And Ava, of course.

160
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,138
And I know there's nothing that I can say,

161
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,372
but I also know that you understand

162
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,274
that the world needs us right now...

163
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,276
Please don't preach to me, Rachel.

164
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,812
I've had it up to here
with your high-mindedness.

165
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:58,280
- I'm not preaching.
- <i> The world needs you,</i>

166
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,382
and that's just the way you like it.

167
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,684
Quincy, what are you talking about?

168
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,019
I know that you're in pain
here, but there's nothing...

169
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,121
I told you we should share our information,

170
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,691
that sneaking off to the Arctic
wasn't the way to do this,

171
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:11,060
but you loved the whole "top secret" thing.

172
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,629
That's not fair, because
we both agreed...

173
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,797
This was the only way we
knew what we were doing.

174
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,732
Quincy, where is this coming from?

175
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:19,101
This plague is the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

176
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:21,503
Rachel Scott saves the day.

177
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,406
- This is not my fault.
- No, it's mine...

178
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:28,444
For following you.

179
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:33,349
I mean, what were you risking, really?

180
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,518
You've got no family.
You've got no friends.

181
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:40,322
Truth is, you don't have
any skin in the game.

182
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,427
You have no idea what I have lost.

183
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,596
The guy who pops into town
for a twice-monthly screw

184
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,164
doesn't count.

185
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:52,468
[Scoffs] You don't know about loss

186
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,470
because you don't care
about anyone but yourself.

187
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,805
Where the hell do you
get off thinking your pain

188
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
is any greater than anyone else's?

189
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,243
There's a whole ship
full of people out there

190
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:02,845
who've lost just as much as you,

191
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,614
and yet they keep finding
a way to march on, but you...

192
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,319
You're a coward.

193
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:13,255
Nothing more.

194
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,491
Probably a great deal less.

195
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,495
[Huffs]

196
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:23,599
Diplomacy's not necessarily
your strong suit.

197
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,200
I can't even look at him.

198
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,736
Well, you said you can't do it without him,

199
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,304
so one way or another,

200
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,806
we're gonna have to
get him on board, right?

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,375
You do it. You talk to him.

202
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,278
I'm not that good with people anyw...

203
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:37,813
[Electricity crackles, power surging]

204
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,815
What on earth is that?

205
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,284
[Equipment beeping]
Bridge, this is M.P.A.

206
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,886
We've got high temperature
on number 1 and 2 generators.

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,522
Commencing stage one load-shed.

208
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:49,858
I just lost surface search radar.

209
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,161
[Electronic whir, power surges down]

210
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,762
[Door creaks]

211
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,798
Tell Captain Chandler
that we need A/C and power,

212
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,233
or everything will be lost, and hurry!

213
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,702
- Right away.
- [Under breath] Damn it.

214
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,771
No, that's not it. Trace the line.

215
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,440
We can't run at this temperature.

216
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,208
We're gonna overheat!

217
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,743
Pull the filters. Let's see
what's going on in there.

218
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:10,412
[Explosion] Whoa!

219
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,781
- Damn it!
- We got a fire!

220
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,951
- Okay! Okay, I'll call the bridge!
- [Alarm sounding]

221
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,619
[Bell clanging] Fire, fire, fire.

222
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,488
Class Bravo fire, main engine room two.

223
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:22,458
Away the at-sea fire party,
provide from repair five.

224
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:25,160
D.C.A., it's the captain.
What's the status?

225
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,529
I say again, D.C.A., what is the status?

226
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:33,183
[Coughing]

227
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,419
[Alarm sounding]

228
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,522
Mr. Chung! Everybody okay?

229
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,158
- Yes, sir. The fire's out.
- What's our sitrep?

230
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:44,127
It started in the seawater
service system intake, sir.

231
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,196
Something must have torn off the filters,

232
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,998
and sea life bloom got in...

233
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,200
That's on me. We cut it a little
tight getting out of Gitmo.

234
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,270
Corals must have knocked off
the filters. How bad is it?

235
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:56,139
It's too soon to tell, sir,
but with the intakes down,

236
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:59,443
we've lost our ability to cool
the engine oil for the mains.

237
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,279
What about the generators?
Did they survive?

238
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,814
Just generator three, sir,

239
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:06,083
and we're lucky it was
offline during the time.

240
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:09,086
I want all the electricity
diverted to the C.I.C.

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,854
And Dr. Scott's lab.

242
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,457
Under any circumstance,
she needs that room cooled.

243
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,426
- Do you understand?
- Aye, sir. Sorry, sir.

244
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:17,961
Don't be sorry.

245
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:20,197
Let's just get it fixed. Yes, sir.

246
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,469
[Clank, power surges on]

247
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:30,140
[Sighs] Thank you. Thank you.

248
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,044
- Captain's on the bridge.
- Report, sir.

249
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,081
R.O. system's down for now.
Let's initiate conservation.

250
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,450
Salt water shaving only, no showers.

251
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,353
Water strictly used for
cooking and drinking.

252
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,422
[Sighs] It's gonna be 100 degrees today.

253
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,958
I'd like to reduce Manning
at all watch stations

254
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,759
and suspend all non-essential activities.

255
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:53,297
Good. Meanwhile, I've got
other fish for you to fry.

256
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:55,098
[Tears paper]

257
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:03,407
Good. I didn't wake ya. [Sniffs]

258
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,841
[Sighs]

259
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,476
A hot one, huh?

260
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:10,247
Reminds me of August in Chicago.

261
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:13,383
That's where I'm from. You know that?

262
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:18,288
Yeah, I was a cop. Homicide.

263
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:22,593
South side. I was good at it, too.

264
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,428
[Mouth full] You mind if I smoke?

265
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,662
Please don't.

266
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:27,598
Mm. Mmh-mmh.

267
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,299
[Lighter clicks]

268
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,567
[Exhales]

269
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,139
[Exhales deeply] You
ever hear of Keelhauling?

270
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,541
Can't say that I have, no.

271
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,976
Really?

272
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,613
See, back in the mid
1800s when a sea Captain

273
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:46,450
encountered a particularly
problematic sailor,

274
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:48,185
he'd have him bound with rope,

275
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,953
thrown over the side of the ship,

276
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:53,023
dragged underneath the hull.

277
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:56,360
Poor bastard would bounce
and scrape along the keel,

278
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:57,661
barnacles and such.

279
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,530
But when he'd come up on the other side,

280
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:04,034
if he wasn't drowned or decapitated...

281
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,437
He tended to be a lot more cooperative.

282
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,409
Keelhauling. [Sniffs]

283
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,247
Just off the top of my
head, I can think of about

284
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,182
200 sailors on board this ship

285
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,418
who'd like to try that out on you.

286
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,287
Captain Chandler would
never allow such a thing.

287
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:27,124
Hmm, maybe.

288
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,525
Maybe not.

289
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,429
Personally, I never found
torture that effective

290
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,364
in my line of work. I told
you I was a cop, right?

291
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,700
- You did, yes.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,568
See, I always found that

293
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,271
if you just laid out the facts for a guy,

294
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,006
treated him with a little respect,

295
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,243
maybe give him a chance to redeem himself,

296
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:49,613
earn somethin' back...

297
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,548
He'd make the right choice.

298
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,383
You can't force me back into the lab.

299
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,651
I won't do it.

300
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,220
Well, suit yourself. [Exhales]

301
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:01,191
But remember, we got a hard
and fast rule on this ship.

302
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,128
[Sighs] Anything that
doesn't serve a purpose is gone.

303
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,032
Ain't no fat on the bone here.

304
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,334
[Sniffs] Hope you can hold your breath.

305
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,303
I want sunlight.

306
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,377
And someone to play chess with.

307
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,646
Someone good.

308
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,250
Did you reset the
electronic governor controls?

309
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,386
Cycled them three times.
They're completely wiped.

310
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,421
[Sighs] Did you try to
rig casualty power cables

311
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:32,523
from main one?

312
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,558
There's no way to do it. The
main cable riser's melted.

313
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,661
Mr. Chung, you qualified E.O.O.W. faster

314
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,262
than anyone I've ever seen,

315
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,031
and you could rebuild
most of this power plant

316
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,666
with your eyes closed.

317
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,434
You're going to handle this.

318
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,603
[Sighs]

319
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,273
[Door creaks open]

320
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,119
[Door closes]

321
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,557
I'm guessing the gene sequencing

322
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,426
showed a high degree of variation.

323
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,827
You're having trouble distinguishing

324
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,529
what's causing the enhanced pathogenesis

325
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,498
and what's just background noise.

326
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:19,369
Right you are... As usual.

327
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,273
Let's get to it, shall we?

328
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:28,245
It's gonna take a week,

329
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,280
maybe 10 days at all stop

330
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,783
- to repair the engine damage, sir.
- A week?

331
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,651
We can run one of the
four turbines on manual,

332
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,486
but... the seawater system's fried,

333
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,188
so we... we can't cool the engines.

334
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:39,656
And how long can we
run without overheating?

335
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,258
Maybe an hour, but then another five

336
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,559
to let it cool down,

337
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,494
but I'll have to wash down the engines

338
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,163
before we can even try that.

339
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,064
So what's the issue? Something
with the R.O. systems?

340
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:49,866
The circuit breakers in the load centers...

341
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:50,801
They're completely burnt out.

342
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,303
We can't make fresh drinking water.

343
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:54,771
And how long to fix that?

344
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,440
Also a week, sir. And
that's the real problem.

345
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,309
The entire time we were in Gitmo,

346
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,278
we weren't filtering water from the harbor

347
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:03,747
because we didn't know if it
was contaminated by the virus.

348
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,383
[Sighs] So we're down to...

349
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,553
What, 3,000 gallons of fresh water?

350
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:14,858
- Just about, sir.
- [Sighs]

351
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,227
- Slattery: Costa Rica will have to wait.
- Agreed.

352
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:20,730
We'll have to dead-stick until
we get that one engine on line.

353
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:23,500
We got an hour every six to
make as much distance as we can

354
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,269
to find the safest place to
make port and get fresh water.

355
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:29,439
I'm recommending we head
here... Serrana Bank.

356
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,607
It's uninhabited, which means

357
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,242
it should be untouched by the virus,

358
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,177
and it gets over a hundred
inches of rain per year.

359
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:35,412
We can anchor there

360
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,380
until the engineers get us back on line.

361
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,817
E.T.A.? Given our current
limitations with engine output?

362
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:44,354
Taking into account
projected winds and current...

363
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:46,289
Six, six and a half days.

364
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:48,325
They've gotta be someplace else.

365
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,593
The area has been
pretty well-charted, sir.

366
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:51,561
Maybe we can find an abandoned ship

367
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,231
with a fresh water supply.
All right, send the U.A.V.

368
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:56,333
Widest possible range in all directions.

369
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,003
It finds any source of water,
I wanna know about it.

370
00:16:59,028 --> 00:16:59,836
Aye, sir.

371
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,638
Set course for that island.

372
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,139
Let's get that engine back on line.

373
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:04,741
Yes, Captain.

Six days. Even at our most severe rations,

376
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,884
we're gonna have to travel
the last two without any water.

377
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,719
Day three...

378
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:19,256
Day three, people start to die.

No sign of land, sir.

382
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:36,073
U.A.V.'s got nothing either. Keep looking.

383
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,910
Careful. Don't spill that.

[Indistinct conversations]

385
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:51,122
All that water in the
ocean... It's almost impossible

386
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,858
to make it drinkable. Hence, the stills.

387
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:57,094
Oh, yeah. I am dying over here.

00:17:57,129 --> 00:18:00,564
- [Can tab fizzes]
- Ah. You heard of water into wine?

389
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,800
This is beer into water.

390
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:06,437
That is enough to make a grown man cry.

391
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:09,006
Tell me about it.

392
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:14,812
Sir, 10 seconds until engines up.

393
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:23,454

we'll always be together.

Well, you said you wanted
a rain check on the tea.

Sorry, I'm not equipped with
finger sandwiches or scones.

436
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,247
I'd have thought you
would've used your water

on a colder drink.

438
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,087
This can't be tea.

It's Camellia sinensis.
It's an organic green.

440

I actually save it for special occasions.

441

I've been working towards.

I have a vaccine prototype,
and it's time to test.

I would've brought champagne, but...

446
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,247

Ma'am, the relay switch overheated

460

and shorted out the breakers
on the last generator.

00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:53,655
Afraid so.

463
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,357
You understand that without power,

464
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,292
the temperature inside my
cooling units are rising.

465
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,795
If they go over 41 degrees fahrenheit,

466
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,630
we'll lose the primordial sample,

467
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,633
the sample from the cruise ship,
and the experimental vaccine.

468
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,568
What about the portable
generator in the r&a locker?

469

That seized up during
maintenance in the Arctic.

470
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,272
Every time we run the engines,
you get power to the lab.

471
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,642
I made sure... Power for one hour
for every six is not sufficient.

472
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:18,681
I need the virus at a
constant low temperature.

473
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:20,316
We can throw it overboard.

00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,621
All your work, into the
water, to cool it down.

476
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:29,024
We're in the tropics. The
water must be 80 degrees.

477

- Not at the bottom.
- Well, even if the water is cold enough,

478
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:34,363
the pressure will crush
the glass containers.

479
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,332
Well, I'm sure we can
rig something for that.

480
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:38,133
- Can't we, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

481
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,970
Look, I appreciate that,
but if you sink the samples,

482
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:42,905
there's no way that you
can move the ship forward

483
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:44,740
without raising that
case towards the surface.

484
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:46,242
She's right. We'll be stuck in place

485
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,877
until we get the engines repaired,

486
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,345
and we're already running
out of drinking water.

487
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:51,180
If we can figure out a
way to spin the propellers,

488
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:52,848
we can generate enough electricity

489
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,250
to cool the lab, correct?

490
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:56,351
Yes, sir, but how can
we spin the propellers

491
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,287
- without the engine?
- Rig the case now.

492
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:02,191
Get your samples ready
to put 'em in the ocean.

493
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,195
- Please be certain they're secure.
- It's good to go.

494
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,235
Easy!

495
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:17,339
Due respect, Captain, we only
have a small window of time

496
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,308
to make it to the island
on the water we have.

497
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:22,845
The hours we spend doing this
we will not be able to make up.

498
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:24,246
Gator checked the barometer.

499
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,982
Said there's a low front
coming in from the east.

500
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,418
We get the winds we need, we can do this.

501
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,153
Relying on the winds?

502
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:33,355
Our entire mission is in that case.

503
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,990
I have to say this, sir.

504
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:37,893
If the winds don't blow
our way, we kill our crew.

Well, you got your sunshine.

532

Never seen a day as windless.

533
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,289
I'm a gambling man myself.

534
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,327
Captain's put all his chips in
the middle of the table here.

535
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:21,397
Sure hope he's got an ace up his sleeve.

536
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:26,335
Sir, the boatswain's mates

537
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,203
have loaded pilot chutes into launchers.

538
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,239
Strong enough breeze, and we'll shoot them

539
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:32,207
high enough to engage the larger chutes.

540
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,176
That should give us just enough speed

541
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,145
to turn the prop and get electricity.

542
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,814
- Won't help us make water, but...
- So where's the wind?

543
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:52,094
Gator said the wind was coming.

544
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:54,530
It's gotta come, right?

545
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:02,337
I'm guessing the Navy told
you about my car accident.

546
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,407
Yeah. Yeah. They did.

547
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,811
Well, there's something

548
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,279
<i>they don't even know about.</i>

549
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,049
It was my fault.

550

Tried to pass a car on a curve.

551

Didn't see the oncoming truck.

552
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,058
I killed my wife and my girls.

553
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:29,031
I was in the I.C.U. for 82 days.

554
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,334
Seven times I coded, seven
times they brought me back.

555
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:34,870
In between, I had plenty of
time to think and to wonder,

556
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:38,607
why did God leave me here?

557
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:41,210
Why did he spare me?

558
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:46,048
There must be a purpose, some reason.

559
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,417
Well, that's what I told myself.

560
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:50,853
That's how I woke up every day

561
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,254
and put one foot in front of the other.

562
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:56,225
It was faith that got me through.

563
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,659
But these past weeks,

564
00:27:57,694 --> 00:28:01,430
that faith has been
replaced with certainty.

565
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:03,632
I am here for a reason, as are you,

566
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,934
as is everyone aboard this ship.

567
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:09,037
You are here to lead us,

568
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,507
and we are here to follow,
to execute your vision.

569
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:15,344
I don't have a vision.

570

You do.

00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:21,116
When you stuck your
hand in that engine fuse,

572
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,252
and you turned us away from home,

573
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:26,588

574
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:30,259
there's a... A voice inside you.

575
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,094
Maybe it's your highest self,
maybe it's the voice of God.

576
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,133
I don't know, but...
It's a voice of... hope.

577

You've listened to it so far.
