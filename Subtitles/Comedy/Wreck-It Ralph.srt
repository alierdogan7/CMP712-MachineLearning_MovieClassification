881
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,947
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

882
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,828
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

883
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,287
I can't help you!

884

Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

893
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,062
So here's what I'm thinking.

894
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,445
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

895
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,577
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

896
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,284
You want me to help you?

897
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,749
All you got to do is
break something for me.

898
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,581
Come on. What do you say, friend?

899
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,287
We are not friends.

900
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,458
Oh, come on, pal. You son of a gun.

901
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,968
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

902
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,466

Do we have a deal or not?

906

(GRUNTS) You better win.

907
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,229
Well, I'll say this much,

908

they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

909
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,533
There's the shuttle.

910
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
Is he in there?

911
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,283
Nope. Lucky for him.

912
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,957
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

913
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,622
No Cy-Bug, either.

914
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,422
Got to find it before it
lays its filthy eggs.

915
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,010
It came this way,

916
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,755
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

917
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,306

918
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,808
Can't get a read on it.

919
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,219
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

920
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,474
Why did he go AWOL?

921
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,097
I wish I knew, ma'am.

922
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,933
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

923
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,644
Going on about cake and medals...

924
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,696
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

925
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,027
"Go Turbo"?

926
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,947
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

927
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,492
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

928
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,412

932
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,254
<i>and stole Turbo's thunder...</i>

933
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,836
New game. All right!

934
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,845
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

935
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,350
<i>So jealous that
he abandoned his game</i>

936
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,014
<i>and tried to take over the new one.</i>

937
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,376

That looks like Turbo.

940
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,680

in this game? Aw, come on!

I know, right?

947
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,627
That's why I have to get Ralph home

948

hit it again with your hammer.

1228
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,736
Oh, that's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1229
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,617
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1230
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,452
Okay.

1231
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,866
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1232
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,580
You are one dynamite gal.

1233
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:08,628
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1234
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,255
One dynamite gal.

1235
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,464
Dynamite gal.

1236
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,926

1238
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,686
Get out.

1239
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,639
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1240
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,266
I said get out!

1241
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,826
Oh. Jiminey jaminey.

1242
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,667
Yes?

1243
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,119
Oh.

I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game <i>Fix-It Felix Jr.</i>

1245
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,425
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1246
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,960
Wreck-It Ralph?

1247
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,758
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1248
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,931
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1249
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
Locked him up?

1250
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,220
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,860
Come on, Ralph!

1254
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,896
This is it. This is really happening.

1255
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,276
I almost don't believe it.

1256
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,326
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1257
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,573
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1258
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,030
I mean, I think I might puke.

1259
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,701
- You know, like a "vurp."
- A what?

1260
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,540
Vomit and a burp together,

1261
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,956
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1262
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,378
Oh, this is so exciting!

1263
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,255
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1264
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,458
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1265
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,668
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1266
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,179
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1267
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,637
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1268
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,390
- Because you're a winner.
- I'm a winner.

1269
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,310
- And you're adorable!
- I'm adorable!

1270
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,019
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1271
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,559
Yeah!

1272
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,857
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

just keep telling yourself,

"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1275
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,696
- And have fun. Got it?
- Got it.

- You!
- I come alone, unarmed.

I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1292
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,905
You hit a guy with glasses.

Listen, I just want to talk to you.

I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1296

How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1297

My medal. How did you...

It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

About what?

1303
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,432
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1304
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,096
about being a king is?

1305
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,895

1306
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,142
Get to the point.

Point being, I need your help.

I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

talk a little sense into her?

Wait. First, kneel down.

- What? No, we really...
- Will you just do it?

- I've been thinking.
- That's dangerous.

this stupid race anyway? Right?

- Yeah.

I can win the race on my own.

I don't care! You're a liar!

You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

you go down with the ship, little sister!

1776
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:54,927

built myself a little shack</i>

lift me up,</i>
