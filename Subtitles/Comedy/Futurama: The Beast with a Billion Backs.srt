Yivo is the lover of all beings,

But Yivo has no gender,
thus Yivo has proclaimed

that instead of "he" or "she,"
we are to use the word "shklee."

Well, then perhaps you misunderstood

- (SCOFFS) That wasn't love.
- What? How can you say that?

Because Bender knows love.

And love doesn't share itself
with the world.
