1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,834
[cell door slams]

2
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:09,335
[theme song playing]

3
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,134
[cell door slams]

4
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,693
[cell door slams]

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,700
I got 'em when I was 15,
and then, like, 19,

6
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,703
and then other times,
but I never got it on my arms.

7
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,247
And I haven't even been
putting 'em near nobody's cha-cha...

8
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:32,126
except for, like, once,
and it was a while ago and by accident.

9
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,253
You don't get crabs on your arms.

10
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,630
So, what?
I got imitation crabs?

11
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,674
Shit.

12
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,053
It's fuckin' bedbugs.

13
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,221
Like scabies?

14
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,931
-[sighs]
-[softly] I thought it was crabs.

15
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,682
Me, too.

16
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,476
[sighs] I miss Ian.

17
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,813
-Aw, that's so sweet.
-Ugh.

18
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:53,439
You got some shampoo or something?

19
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:56,317
They don't live on you,
just in your sheets and clothes and shit.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,776
So now we gotta wash everything.

21
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,945
What, you gave 'em to me?

22
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,488
Someone gave it to me first.

23
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,031
-Fuck!
-What's going on?

24
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:03,574
Flaca's got scabies.

25
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,244
-It's bedbugs. It's different.
-Cooties are cooties.

26
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,037
I probably got it
from your dirty little sister.

27
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:10,414
They probably been living
in your hairy Chia Pet poon

28
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,499
since before you got here.

29
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,542
First of all, I keep my lawn mowed.

30
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,003
Second, weren't no problems

31
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:18,840
till Pocket Daya snuck in last week
to follow in the family footsteps.

32
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,591
-Eat it.
-[speaking Spanish]

33
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,675
They got scabies.

34
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,719
Bedbugs, and it's Flaca.

35
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:26,514
[speaking Spanish] Fucking shit.
You bitches stay on your side of the dorm.

36
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,016
[speaking English] Now what?

37
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,808
[speaking Spanish]
They're infested. Bedbugs.

38
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:31,602
Ay, dios. We're all gonna get 'em.

39
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,688
-You don't have a magic cure or something?
-Hey, hey, hey.

40
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:35,773
[speaking Spanish] Clean zone.

41
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:36,900
[speaking English] I just walked up.

42
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,359
[speaking Spanish] Look at you.
Did you scratch?

43
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,861
[speaking English] No.

44
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,154
So what?

45
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:43,781
You hear the one
about the pregnant bedbug?

46
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:45,909
-She gave birth in the spring.
-[chuckles]

47
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:48,786
But these are just pads.
We don't got bedsprings.

48
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:49,870
Oh, Jesus.

49
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,872
Okay, everybody,
start stripping the beds!

50
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,919
Fuck!

51
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,211
[man on PA] Attention, ladies,

52
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,964
remember to remove
all pens from your uniform

53
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,341
when dropping off your laundry.

54
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,097
Red, you're back...

55
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,560
and you're not talking to me.

56
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:16,730
Now what did I do?

57
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:23,071
My post-slock resolution was to
stop giving liars second chances.

58
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,530
When did I lie to you?

59
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,412
"Business is booming.
There's a line out the door."

60
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,872
-[sighs]
-You were much more convincing

61
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,375
than my husband,
but you were just as stupid.

62
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,752
You could have said
you didn't make your way there.

63
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:43,549
Instead, you said...
you ate my vatrushkis.

64
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,552
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:48,637
I...

66
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,681
I thought that
I was doing the right thing.

67
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,266
By lying?

68
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,268
We read different children's books.

69
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:59,107
You know... many cultures
value a person's dignity over the truth.

70
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,317
In Korea, they actually call it kibun.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,611
I heard that on
The World with Marco Werman.

72
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,155
In Russia, we call it "bullshit."

73
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,157
Look, there was nothing
you could do about it,

74
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,326
and I thought that
I was saving you some pain.

75
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:13,537
You thought
if you didn't bring me bad news,

76
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,206
I won't kill the messenger.

77
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:21,337
I said what I said because
I am a nice person and it felt right.

78
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:25,508
Nice is for cowards and Democrats.

79
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,594
You're a selfish little person.

80
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,347
You wanted me to like you.

81
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,475
Now I like you less.

82
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,146
[Bennett] Next.

83
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:43,067
Powell. P-O-W-E-double-L.

84
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,611
Ah, here you are. ID?

85
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,784
Oh, Bennett. [chuckles] Good.
You're George's friend.

86
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,787
-Uh... Yeah, George?
-My son.

87
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,414
He used to work here.
George Mendez.

88
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:03,421
His father, my first husband, is Cuban.
I never could resist an accent.

89
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,550
Guess that runs in the family.

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,639
I'm sorry.
That was a coping mechanism.

91
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,642
Uh...

92
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:19,270
Thank you.

93
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,354
George, um...

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,359
George says he loves her.
What do you think?

95
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,698
I... I don't know. Maybe.

96
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,119
[stammers] I'm sorry,
who are you here to see?

97
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,874
I know I need to apologize,

98
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,461
but "I'm sorry"
feels a little inadequate.

99
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,754
That baby's got my daughter out to here

100
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:48,341
and it's too late to Dyson it out of her.

101
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:51,260
So I hope you're here
for more than a clean conscience.

102
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:54,012
I'm a concerned grandmother
just like you are.

103
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:56,557
Although you look
nothing like a grandmother.

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,934
Hispanic women have amazing skin.

105
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,437
Let's hope the baby
gets my complexion.

106
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,689
What's it gettin' from you?

107
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,443
I know that...

108
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:13,073
nothing can ever undo
what my son did, but...

109
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,283
this child is part of my family.

110
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,076
He's gonna live with my family.

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,205
Your... husband?

112
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,207
My domestic partner.

113
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,128
Who is not actually
related to the baby by blood.

114
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:29,382
No blood, but he's got
the sweat and tears part down.

115
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:33,051
He's takin' real good care of my babies,
and he'll do the same for Daya.

116
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,891
I want to adopt the child.

117
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:46,815
I'm... up nights... haunted...

118
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,781
I can't bear the thought of
the baby winding up like--

119
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,574
Go ahead, say it.

120
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,909
Like her mother?

121
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:59,828
Like George.

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,626
So... you want to raise the baby

123
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,921
so it don't turn out
like the baby you raised?

124
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,839
I have two other boys.

125
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:15,052
One is in dental school
and the other is an art historian.

126
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:19,056
So you raised a sadist,
a dentist and a homo.

127
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,891
Two sadists and a homo.

128
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,311
Okay, look...

129
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:27,690
you have every right
to hate me and George...

130
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,442
but...

131
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,444
I can do right by this child.

132
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:35,448
I can offer love and... attention

133
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,284
and a certain... lifestyle.

134
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,828
Money don't mean nothing to a child...

135
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,457
-No, but I--
-You're not listening.

136
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,124
To a child.

137
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,630
But my daughter...
can't be un-raped...

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,470
and she's gonna suffer
bad emotionals her whole life.

139
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,597
We all are.

140
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,098
Well...

141
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,480
I know money could never make that right,

142
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:11,484
but of course, I would want to help
the mother of my grandchild

143
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,444
in any way I could.

144
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,866
Perhaps on a monthly basis.

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,038
And the grandmother of your grandchild?

146
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:27,291
Of course.

147
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,167
That's the team spirit.

148
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:44,933
Hey... lady guards only.

149
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:48,312
Your mom is in visitation right now
with Mendez's mother.

150
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,273
-What the fuck?
-Yeah, did you know she was coming?

151
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,733
-What are they talking about?
-I don't know.

152
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,110
Lady Pornstache wrote me a letter.
She wanted to meet...

153
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,281
but I said no.

154
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:01,492
I mean, I didn't say nothing
which means I said no.

155
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,620
-Aleida must've written her.
-[sighs]

156
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,330
[Dayanara sighs]

157
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:10,334
Relax. It's my baby, ours.

158
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:13,296
Aleida's just probably
trying to shake her down.

159
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,131
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-[sighs]

160
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:20,010
[chuckles] I don't usually get to see
this much of you all at once.

161
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,888
You like it?

162
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,139
You're into big bellies?

163
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,812
Listen up, ladies!

164
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:34,608
Until every uniform in this prison
is washed and re-washed...

165
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:39,071
you'll be wearing Office Depot's...
new fall line.

166
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:40,155
[woman] Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

167
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:41,990
I ain't wearing that fucking paper shit.

168
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:45,118
That's my color. I'm wearing it.

169
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:51,083
There is one
maternity-sized paper suit.

170
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,918
I suggest you grab it...

171
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:57,005
before one of your plus-sized dorm-mates
claims it for her food baby.

172
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,597
I asked you more than once
to stay away from her

173
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,684
and yet, with the whole dorm half-naked,
here you are.

174
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm writing you up, Bennett.

175
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,690
Mendez's mother
is meeting with Aleida Diaz.

176
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:17,693
I don't care...
and neither should you.

177
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:20,863
That's my kid we're talking about here.

178
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,616
This is not 3 Men and a Baby.

179
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,036
You and Mendez
are not Guttenberg and Selleck.

180
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,458
You are two morons
and a ward of the state.

181
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,711
Let go. Let go of the dream.

182
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,254
[Maxwell] Mr. Caputo.

183
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,632
One box per dorm. That's all there was.

184
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:42,300
-[sighs]
-[Maritza] I can't walk around

185
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:46,054
in my butt-bag panties
and my granny bra.

186
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,557
There are more
paper uniforms on their way.

187
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,308
And they'll get here when?

188
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,937
[stuttering] Sometime soon...

189
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,481
hopefully.

190
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,816
Uh, be thankful the weather is nice.

191
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,402
[speaking Spanish]

192
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,363
-CO Bennett, make yourself useful.
-Sir?

193
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,532
Go down to the storage room.

194
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:06,867
Don't come back
until you find some uniforms

195
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,370
or something
uniform-like and disposable.

196
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,622
Sir. Yes, sir.

197
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,249
Where's the S1?

198
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,584
[indistinct radio chatter]

199
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,045
[helicopter blades whirring]

200
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:26,303
Corporal John Bennett
reporting as ordered, Sergeant.

201
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:30,265
Care to let me in on the joke,
Corporal Whoever-the-fuck-you-are?

202
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,976
No disrespect, Sergeant.
Just ready to get in the shit.

203
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,687
Well, look at that, Goggles!

204
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,357
Corporal America is here
to save us from the ragheads.

205
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,318
Hooah!

206
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,487
IA, fall in!

207
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:46,532
Rifle.

208
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,874
You know, it's always the guy
who thinks he's John Wayne McCain

209
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,502
who shits his pants
and needs rescuing.

210
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:02,130
But out here, we prefer to
let the camel cowboys do the dying.

211
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:04,592
It's their goddamn country.

212
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,388
Look at you,
all nicely starched.

213
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:11,765
I have a travel iron.

214
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,934
[sniffs]

215
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,273
I smell a fobbit.
You know what a fobbit is?

216
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,735
-I'm not--
-Not what I asked!

217
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:25,654
Army hobbit. Too chicken
to leave his forward operating base.

218
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,907
You think this shitbag's a fobbit?

219
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,076
Maybe. Don't know...

220
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,911
but he's got the whitest teeth
I've ever seen.

221
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,412
Sergeant, I am not a coward,

222
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:36,915
and I'm sure as shit
not sorry I'm squared away.

223
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,877
I'm here to soldier,
save lives and get some.

224
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,138
Jesus. What a cluster-knuckle.

225
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,891
Could this be our fault?

226
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,434
[gasps]

227
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,104
-The new couch?
-I did an inspection at the curb.

228
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:02,775
We're okay except for the mystery stain,
but we febrezed.

229
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:06,987
If anybody asks anything...
it came from JC Penney.

230
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,865
[man on PA] Work line, cell block A,
10 minutes.

231
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:14,537
Bell, Hartford jail's got six boxes of
paper suits they're willing to part with.

232
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:18,415
Cost me 300 pairs of tube socks
I actually don't have,

233
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,626
but that's a future me problem.

234
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,754
Have Doggett drive
you and Maxwell after lunch.

235
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,463
Roger that.

236
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,178
Looks like it's spreading.

237
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,556
The only thing spreading is rumors.

238
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,516
It was an isolated event that's been...

239
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,895
isolated.

240
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:45,358
I forgot something in the office.

241
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,619
Uh-uh.

242
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:58,080
Walk. That's right.

243
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:01,625
Just walk away, Renee.

244
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,753
[exhales]

245
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:06,504
-What-- [chuckles]
-[sniffs]

246
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,091
You smell like Arthur Avenue.

247
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:12,302
Whatever, okay?
GloNo's makin' me bedbug-proof.

248
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,930
-GloNo?
-Gloria and Norma.

249
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:16,056
Oh, hell no.

250
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,309
Hey, look, whatever you wanna call 'em,
they for real, all right?

251
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,686
Especially Norma.

252
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,231
She got that whole
magic mute thing going on.

253
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:27,818
Look, and this makes sense, okay?
Bedbugs drink our blood.

254
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,988
-They're bugs, not Dracula.
-[sucks teeth]

255
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,991
And now that you been
necklace shopping in Burritoville,

256
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,743
you gettin' 'em for sure.

257
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:37,285
-Man, why they still makin' our food...
-Whatever.

258
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:40,080
...when they're the infested ones?

259
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,164
Oh, shit.

260
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,666
-[Taystee] Ew!
-Why you...

261
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,043
No, it's protein.

262
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,213
Crunch. It's all good.

263
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,134
Hey, you're scratching.

264
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,596
It ain't real, man.
It's... a ghost itch.

265
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,430
-[Crazy Eyes] Mmm.
-Power of persuasion.

266
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,642
Power of you ain't
take a shower in three days,

267
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,351
that might be why you're scratching.

268
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,895
What you care?

269
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:07,232
Poor personal hygiene
can be a sign of depression.

270
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,401
Man, I ain't depressed.

271
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,778
-Oh.
-[Taystee chuckles]

272
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:13,656
The line's been long in the showers
since it started getting hot,

273
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:17,826
but I been washing my pits,
tits and naughty bits in the sink.

274
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,119
Well, thank you for that.

275
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,955
Look, you don't wanna be forced
to take a shower like Asia Girl,

276
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,417
don't get so ripe you go rotten.
All I'm saying.

277
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,046
Okay, maybe you got a point...
but it ain't bugs.

278
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,505
-[sniffs]
-Man, come on, man.

279
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,842
Uh-uh!

280
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:36,344
Forrest Gump... seat's taken.

281
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:38,764
Yeah... blackies only.

282
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:42,017
But I got just as much of a right
to this seat as you do.

283
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,728
I mean, this place is full today...

284
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,897
-and you're discriminating me.
-Yes.

285
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,025
Rosa Parks could walk through that door,
but she got bedbugs...

286
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:53,528
bitch, her ass going to
the back of the bus same as you.

287
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,739
Who's gonna stop me, though...

288
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:57,991
now that your big-haired mammy's in hell,

289
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:01,203
takin' Satan's three-pronged penis
up her butt?

290
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:02,370
[screaming]

291
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:03,872
[Taystee] No!
[Bell] Warren!

292
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:06,667
-[Janae] Man, chill out.
-Do I need to write you a shot?

293
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,335
No, no, no, no, no.
She's good.

294
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,754
She just had a little too much spicy.
That's all.

295
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:12,923
Give me the potato... now.

296
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,591
Give me the potato.

297
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,552
I got you. You good.

298
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,346
-Yes.
-Sit down.

299
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,306
We good, Suzanne. We good.

300
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,558
[Crazy Eyes] We good.
[Taystee] We good, Officer Bell.

301
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,727
We--

302
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,272
-I will potato her at a future time.
-[whispering] I know.

303
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:33,276
Get your lunch to go, Doggett.
We got van duty.

304
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,153
[Crazy Eyes chuckles]

305
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:37,280
Bitch, bye.

306
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,367
You not hungry?

307
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,786
I'm not standing
in that parade of tits and ass.

308
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,373
You secretly love this.

309
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,375
Some things are better left mysteries.

310
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,377
Do you wanna borrow my paper bottoms?

311
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,670
Because I could rip them off
and just give them to you.

312
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,757
Come on.

313
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,466
Give mama a smile!

314
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,678
[chuckles] Do you remember
what Kubra used to say?

315
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,764
Uh-uh.

316
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,807
"A smile is like tight underwear.

317
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:06,309
-It lifts your cheeks."
-"It lifts your cheeks."

318
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,521
[chuckles]
He's gonna kill me, you know.

319
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,982
-Alex...
-[inhales]

320
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:17,195
I really thought
they would put him away...

321
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,906
and I'd be out...

322
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,788
Fuck, I'm fucking suffocating.
[groans]

323
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,999
Alex, you will survive
because it's what you do.

324
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,835
Yeah... like a cockroach.

325
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,212
Maybe that's your spirit animal.

326
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:36,214
[laughs] I know that you're trying
to make me feel better,

327
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,300
but really think about
what you just said to me.

328
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,968
You know, they really get a bad rap.

329
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,720
They were the first animals
to ever mate in space.

330
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,266
They live in tight colonies
because they just love being touched

331
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:50,437
and they can carry cigarettes.
They're bad bitches.

332
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:54,566
I can't be here right now.

333
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,862
[Nicky] I mean, seriously,
what the fuck is going on?

334
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:02,115
Man, it's like
six early releases this month.

335
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,200
Yeah,

336
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:07,329
bullshit sentences for minor drug crimes
just aren't enforced like they used to be.

337
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,664
Speaking of minor drug crimes...

338
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,209
Our smack scheme is no minor offense.

339
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,337
Really? You couldn't come up with
a code word or something for that?

340
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,629
Fine.

341
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,298
Getting caught with that many Jujubes

342
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,675
will get our candy asses
kicked down to max for a decade.

343
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:23,636
No, we have come too close
for you to puss out on me now.

344
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,306
I will smother you in your sleep.

345
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,725
Red concreted our shipping route.

346
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,477
All the coke kitties are getting out,

347
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,147
and maybe, like, the universe
is just trying to send us a message.

348
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,690
Bitch, please.

349
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,901
All those girls had no time
left on their sentences.

350
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,319
That just ain't you or me, huh?

351
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,403
[man on PA] Escort to infirmary.

352
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,697
-[scoffs]
-Escort to infirmary.

353
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,367
We need the right Oompa Loompa
to smuggle our sweets out of here.

354
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,871
You know what?
Now you're just abusing the metaphor.

355
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,456
This is the last of it...

356
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,542
and if you ask me, this oatmeal
should be for breakfast, not voodoo.

357
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:55,919
It's not abracadabra.

358
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,588
It's nature's anti-itch cream.
It's medicine.

359
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,091
So why you making it
and not the infirmary?

360
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,634
Good fucking question. Dame.

361
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,224
[softly] Fuck.

362
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:16,314
Inmate, there've been
complaints about moldy rice.

363
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,900
I need you to show me
where you store it.

364
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,869
The fuck is this? An intervention?

365
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,288
What were you doing
talking to Mendez's mother?

366
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,581
We're mutually-concerned grandparents.

367
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,208
She's not the grandmother.

368
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,709
-She might be.
-What is that supposed to mean?

369
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,836
That's for me and my daughter
to talk about.

370
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,505
-He's part of this.
-Yeah, I am.

371
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:41,631
Yeah?

372
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:45,010
Okay, fine.

373
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,805
-She wants to adopt the baby.
-What?

374
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:49,932
Shh!

375
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,809
-Your job right now is to listen.
-[Bennett] To what?

376
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,978
The only thing worse than
Mendez raising that baby

377
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:56,813
-is his mother doing it.
-Mmm-hmm.

378
00:19:56,897 --> 00:20:00,567
That's what I said...
but it turns out she got two other kids.

379
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,694
One's a tooth doctor,
the other's an artist,

380
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:03,904
and they turned out real good.

381
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:07,365
-I'm not giving up my baby to nobody.
-That's also what I said...

382
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,534
but then she made
some real good points.

383
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:10,953
-No, nothing she--
-Shh!

384
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,120
[Bennett sighs]

385
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:17,834
Daya... you got 37 months
left on your sentence.

386
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,962
He can't do nothing
or he'll go to jail, too.

387
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:24,174
Abuela is too old
and Cesar's guaranteed to fuck up.

388
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,803
-You remember your year in foster care?
-[sighs]

389
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:30,931
You want that for the baby?

390
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:33,850
-That's not going to happen.
-Shh! Let her finish.

391
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:37,479
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

392
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:38,855
Aren't you?

393
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:42,484
I'm not saying yes.
It just kind of makes sense.

394
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,069
[Bennett] Except for the part
where the woman

395
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:48,198
who raised a drug-dealing rapist
named Pornstache adopts our child.

396
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,366
[sighs]

397
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,576
Have you ever even held a baby?

398
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,827
Changed a diaper?

399
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:57,457
You wanna make that kid
live in a shithole with five other people?

400
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,501
He can have his own bedroom.

401
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:05,465
Did you ever spend the night
in a room by yourself?

402
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,176
That baby could have a real life...

403
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,220
with money...

404
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,306
and clean towels and shit.

405
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,977
Look, Daya and I are happy, okay?

406
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,354
You don't need towels for that.

407
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,401
Right?

408
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:27,695
[pop music playing]

409
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:29,947
[soldiers cheering]

410
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,730
God damn it, Farzad!

411
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:05,608
Look, it's only funny
because the dudes are dancing.

412
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,153
Not her. Understand?

413
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:09,529
No.

414
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,240
Jesus.

415
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:15,285
Can somebody please
get me a better Muslim over here?

416
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,705
Let's try this again in five, ladies.

417
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,300
Don't sweat it, man.

418
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,260
This is just how
Americans like to waste time.

419
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,722
Bad work?

420
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:37,682
You were bad at being stupid.

421
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,184
That is a good thing.

422
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:43,062
You did good.
You did good.

423
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,319
What's wrong with them?

424
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:51,904
Them, uh...

425
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,659
You all, uh... boy-kiss-boy.

426
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,162
Fuck! This motherfucker...

427
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,207
Yeah, I see that.

428
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,210
Ugh, it's like ironic divine retribution.

429
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,629
We're stuck in our own spin cycle.

430
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:11,383
This paper suit keeps sticking
to my sweaty parts.

431
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:15,011
Once, when my mother forgot
to buy me a Halloween costume,

432
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,054
she taped a bunch of old newspapers to me

433
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:19,056
and said I should tell people
I was a newsstand.

434
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,143
[gasps] You know what we need?

435
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:24,020
Bean leaves.

436
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,814
I got bedbugs at a sit-in
for a Portland homeless shelter.

437
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:28,191
The conditions were appalling.

438
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,985
So we used bean leaves
to trap the bedbugs and get rid of them.

439
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,405
I didn't know beans grew on leaves.

440
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:35,990
Oh, yeah, take it off.

441
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:39,994
Ooh! Excuse me, Mr. Luschek.

442
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:43,290
We would like to make
a formal petition for some bean leaves.

443
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,500
[Angie] And maybe some extra washers.

444
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,169
People or machines, either one.

445
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:49,254
-But really, bean leaves.
-[slams door]

446
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:53,300
If you say "bean leaves" one more time,
I'm going to punch you in the fuck hole.

447
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:54,592
One of the fuck holes.

448
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,346
How 'bout some fans instead?

449
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,931
At least two of them work.

450
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,059
All yours.

451
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,769
Aye, aye, Captain.

452
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:07,522
Yeah, I wouldn't want to
see you strain your ass,

453
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,232
you know, sitting on that table.

454
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,068
I could probably think of a witty comeback
if it wasn't so hot in here...

455
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,736
or I cared.

456
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,824
Hey, I hope you're not down here
for any of that girl faggot shit.

457
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,410
Well, when you
talk dirty to me like that...

458
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,079
Yeah, I know you've been
sniffing around Angie's tree.

459
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,163
And you should know

460
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:27,124
the only soggy box
that interests me is mine,

461
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:32,255
and all that goes in it
are dicks and tampons...

462
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,383
and sometimes other things,
but only guys can put those in.

463
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,593
Noted.

464
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,221
Although, when you
call it your soggy box,

465
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:41,598
you know, it makes it
really hard to resist.

466
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:45,518
Hey, how come all the guards
get to wear real clothes?

467
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:46,644
We're exempt.

468
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,313
Do the bedbugs know that?

469
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:50,147
You wash our uniforms every day.

470
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,441
[chuckling]

471
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:54,611
Shit!

472
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,706
Whoa! Whoa! Luschek!

473
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,083
It's like undressing in front of my dog.

474
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:13,045
I need you to wash these right now.

475
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,632
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

476
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,892

This is, like,
the Titanic of bad ideas.

485
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,673
Like, we're steerin'
out the way of bedbugs

486
00:25:56,756 --> 00:26:00,176
and crashin' into an iceberg
of chemical burns and shit.

487
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,596
[scoffs] Please. My grammy
used to douche with disinfectant.

488
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:06,849
-The trick is to imagine the bugs...
-Lybol?

489
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,100
...being bugged by you.

490
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,228
You can't give away your power.

491
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,398
Like you almost did at lunch?

492
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:17,444
Look, you can't be getting' all crazy
every time that somebody talks about Vee.

493
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,696
But did you hear that slattern?

494
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,615
Look, that business about a tri-penis,
unacceptable.

495
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:27,912
That warrants...
a severe response.

496
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,082
Man, you fuck up an ofay with a spork,
you angry enough.

497
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:34,251
No, Vee would have defended me
if vice were versa.

498
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:37,672
Okay, even if that was true,
which it definitely is not,

499
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:42,301
you're one shot away from being
a puddle of black drool in the psych.

500
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,554
-You need to check yourself.
-[Alex coughing]

501
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,972
-Back off.
-Did you mean...

502
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:48,350
-[coughing]
-...to spray that on your skin?

503
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,559
Yes.

504
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:53,855
Because in general, when a bottle
reads "caution" and "warning,"

505
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,899
it might not be the best idea.

506
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,693
Man, see?

507
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,403
I knew this was a bad idea,

508
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:04,198
you telling me to clean
with your grandma's douche.

509
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,951
Someone's grandma
douches with disinfectant?

510
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:10,037
Man, this was the pill
before there was a pill.

511
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,623
It's cheaper than condoms

512
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:14,376
and make your coochie crack
smell like lemon fresh.

513
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:16,544
I'm for real. Look that shit up.

514
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:21,090
It couldn't have worked too well
because, you know, well, you're here.

515
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,384
Man, uh...

516
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,844
When did our bathroom
become gentrified?

517
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:28,390
Since the Spanish became
patient zero for bedbugs.

518
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:29,682
[Crazy Eyes] Mmm.

519
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:31,726
This isn't social hour, ladies.

520
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:34,437
Unless you're working, out.
Everybody out.

521
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,357
I gave you an order, inmate.

522
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,777
I...

523
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,155
I need permission to use the toilet?

524
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,825
-May I relieve myself, teacher?
-Excuse me?

525
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:49,118
-Alex--
-That's a shot.

526
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,703
[Alex] What?

527
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:53,205
There are girls
spraying themselves with disinfectant

528
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,458
because this prison is swarming with bugs,

529
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,794
but pissing is a violation?

530
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:00,463
Great. I'm glad you have
your priorities straight.

531
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:03,049
-Where are the fucking fumigators?
-Lower your voice, inmate.

532
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:06,177
Are they too worried to kill the bedbugs
because they'll kill the cockroaches, too?

533
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,679
-Are you calling me a cockroach?
-It's okay.

534
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:09,972
They get a bad rap.

535
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,182
Alex.

536
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:12,600
You're going to seg, inmate.

537
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:14,393
Alex! No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

538
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:15,478
You know that this isn't her.

539
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:17,564
She's just back here
after having been out.

540
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:21,358
-You want a shot, too, Chapman?
-Will it keep her out of SHU?

541
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,445
Please. Come on.

542
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,864
Hey, haven't you ever had a bad day?

543
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:31,911
Like, a... really... really bad day?

544
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:39,376
Disobeying a staff member,
insolence to a staff member.

545
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,421
That's two shots, Vause.

546
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:50,472
-[sobbing softly]
-Alex.

547
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:53,725
How am I back here, Piper?

548
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,815
How could I let myself get back here?

549
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:08,072
Alex, it's not your fault.

550
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,325
And they call me crazy.

551
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,168
[inhales]

552
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:43,357
[softly] Oh, my God!

553
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,902
We will probably never be rich...

554
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:49,238
and we'll most likely
live in a place that's not that big,

555
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,366
but we'll work hard
and we'll love each other and...

556
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,579
we'll find so much happiness that
we won't even know what to do with it.

557
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:58,831
We'll share it with our kid.

558
00:29:58,915 --> 00:30:00,875
Our kids.

559
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,168
[breathes deeply]

560
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,881
Will you marry me?

561
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:08,758
[chuckles]

562
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:13,012
The ring is temporary.

563
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:18,017
-Uh... my leg. [chuckles]
-Okay.

564
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,362
I love you so much.

565
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,448
We still gotta be careful...

566
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,200
for now.

567
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:44,544
Hey, you know, I think you need to be
in an enclosed space for that to work.

568
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:45,670
[sighs]

569
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,422
I'm blasting the heater
to kill any bedbugs inside.

570
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:51,217
Hey, Luschek,
let me ask you a question.

571
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,220
You like candy, right?

572
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,764
Body by Butterfinger.

573
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,808
I'm speaking allegorically here.

574
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,351
You wanna talk about Al Gore?

575
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:02,812
Oh, Jesus.

576
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:06,816
Okay. [chuckles]
Hey, listen, all right? Focus.

577
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,821
Let's say I happen to have
a Costco-sized box of candy, right?

578
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:15,950
And I... I fuckin' love candy,
but I can't eat it anymore

579
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:19,161
because, you know, it ruined my life,
it gave me cavities,

580
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,664
I am in Candy Eaters Anonymous now, eh?

581
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,126
So I gotta get rid of it, yeah?

582
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,670
Like, out-of-the-prison rid of it.

583
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:35,177
I've got a shit-ton of heroin
I need you to sell.

584
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:40,642
-Are you out of your mind, inmate?
-[chuckling] Hey.

585
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:42,268
You're asking me to sell narcotics?

586
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:44,646
I'm a Federal Corrections Officer.

587
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:47,106
All right, let's go.

588
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:49,316
-We're gonna go to Caputo's office...
-No!

589
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,986
...you're gonna tell him
exactly what you told me,

590
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,821
every word,
even that weird Al Gore thing.

591
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,157
Okay, look, Luschek,
you must've misunderstood me, all right?

592
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,491
[Nicky panting]

593
00:31:57,574 --> 00:31:59,160
I'm fucking with you.

594
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:01,704
Of course I'll sell it.

595
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:04,791
Oh, my God. Jesus.

596
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:07,501
Man, come on.
You know I got a bad heart.

597
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,461
You can't do that shit to me, man.

598
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:11,964
I want, uh... 80%.

599
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:13,340
Of the drugs or the money?

600
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,222
You're not supposed to be back here.

601
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,433
Yeah, I know, but I got this.

602
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:23,726
-You slept with it?
-Yeah.

603
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,019
-Said the Lord's Prayer?
-Mmm-hmm.

604
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:27,521
Okay, good. Evil eye is off of you.

605
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:29,440
Don't you gotta break it or some shit?

606
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:31,776
I'll break it in the morning
when I cook it.

607
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:32,860
What?

608
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:35,655
But you can't feed somebody my problems!
What... what if I eat it back?

609
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:36,739
You as likely to eat

610
00:32:36,823 --> 00:32:39,033
somebody's hormone imbalance,
cheating husband or diarrhea.

611
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,284
-Listen...
-[Poussey sighs]

612
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:42,036
...if it makes you nervous,
skip breakfast.

613
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,915
That ain't right, yo.
I'm trying here.

614
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,500
Well, I had to use
all the oatmeal on people's itches

615
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,211
which means that
more people are eating eggs

616
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:52,964
which means that your egg...
gets cooked.

617
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:55,717
[sighs]

618
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,897
[softly] Thanks.

619
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:17,697
I'm literally garbage. [chuckles]

620
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:22,118
I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

621
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,036
Oh, chin up, kibun.

622
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,372
You'll think of the right lie.

623
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:29,500
What was that about?

624
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,170
I told her that her restaurant
was a booming success.

625
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:34,255
And?

626
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:36,548
And it has been shuttered for months.

627
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:37,842
Mmm.

628
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:38,926
That's fucked up.

629
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,720
I was trying to be nice.

630
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:43,305
She was so happy when I lied.

631
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:45,224
Delusion can be very comforting.

632
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,726
Right?

633
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:50,271
The best part of my time here

634
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:54,650
was when I thought somebody else
had named me as a coconspirator.

635
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:57,528
It was like...

636
00:33:57,611 --> 00:34:01,698
the universe had
just brought us back together.

637
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:04,744
And then you realized
that I was the asshole who named you.

638
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:06,703
No.

639
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:10,332
I mean, yes, you did
and that sucked...

640
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,583
but...

641
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:18,215
for a while,
ignorance was... bliss.

642
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:27,266
Getting all of our shit out on the table,

643
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:31,437
being totally, brutally honest about
all the fucked-up things we've done,

644
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,106
and then deciding
to still like each other,

645
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,483
that is an amazing thing.

646
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:41,238
Resiliency of the human spirit
and all of that.

647
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,201
So much better than ignorance.

648
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:49,038
Seriously.

649
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:52,917
What?

650
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,212
What is it, Piper?

651
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,842
I, um...

652
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:03,552
had a friend...

653
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,055
call...

654
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,473
Davy Crockett

655
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:11,102
and tell him that you had
violated your parole.

656
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,357
You called...

657
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:21,070
my probation officer?

658
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,947
You kept saying that you were in danger.

659
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,490
-Bullshit.
-And I was just trying to protect you.

660
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:26,075
That is bullshit and you know it.

661
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,784
Just more bullshit!

662
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:31,705
I'm so, so, so, so sorry...

663
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:37,503
but now, see, all of our shit...
is just right out on the table

664
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:38,921
and we can decide
to like each other...

665
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:41,507
You're a fucking psycho!

666
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,218
...and you can stop blaming yourself
for being in here.

667
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:46,470
And start blaming you?

668
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:48,680
Because that's what
I'm supposed to do now, right?

669
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:52,518
So you can keep control
over whatever this is.

670
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:55,812
Control? Alex, you were
having a nervous breakdown.

671
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:57,564
Which wasn't hot for you, was it?

672
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:02,444
Depressives are bummer fuck-buddies.

673
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,571
Can't have that.

674
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:12,413
God, you're such a manipulative cunt!

675
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,630
You're gonna have to burn 'em.

676
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:26,468
We're not burning any books.
This is not Nuremberg.

677
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:30,597
And I'm not that kind of exterminator,
but facts is facts.

678
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:32,892
Am I allowed to interact with them?

679
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:35,227
They are people. Yeah.

680
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:37,229
[Dan] Can I see a couple of those?

681
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:42,026
Yeah, that's Rats of NIMH.
It's, like, my top five.

682
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,486
I cried like a baby when Jenner died.
You can't burn that.

683
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,239
Man, this broke-ass prison
will never replace 'em.

684
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,241
-You can't do this.
-Calm down.

685
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:51,785
We're not replacing any books
'cause we're not losing any.

686
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:53,829
Isn't that right, Dan?

687
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:56,457
-Bedbug.
-[Poussey] What?

688
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,960
Man, that ain't no bedbug.

689
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:00,627
That's a muffin crumb.

690
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:02,629
Well, how you gonna
tell the expert what that is?

691
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,966
Ain't like I'm not an expert at muffins.

692
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:06,800
The thing about these bastards
is once they're in,

693
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:09,636
the only way to get 'em out
is to wipe out their nooks and crannies.

694
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,055
[Poussey] You can't just
spray some stuff in here?

695
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:12,639
Steam the books or something?

696
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:14,766
I'm telling you, it ain't a bedbug.

697
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,269
What you think, Mr. Caputo?

698
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,776
You're 100% sure?

699
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,987
75%.

700
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,030
How sure are you
that that's a muffin crumb?

701
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:30,032
-Like, 90%.
-Oh?

702
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,450
Well, that wins out.

703
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:35,037
You wanna be sure?

704
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,872
Have at it.

705
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,540
[scoffs]

706
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,043
-Jefferson...
-T...

707
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,796
You didn't! Jesus.

708
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,717
I'm down to, like, 50-50.

709
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,678
[whispers] Shit.

710
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:55,557
Who are you?

711
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:59,853
Uh, sorry, I'm looking for Cesar.

712
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:02,939
-Cesar!
-[Cesar] What?

713
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,316
Some white boy here.

714
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,529
Baby daddy!

715
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:11,782
Que pasó?
Daya and Aleida okay?

716
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,910
Yeah. Yeah, no, great. I, um...

717
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:18,289
You said to stop by sometime,
so here I am. [chuckles]

718
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:22,626
Also, I brought this gift for Lucy.

719
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:26,630
And, uh...
I proposed to Daya, actually.

720
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:28,132
No fucking way!

721
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:29,841
Get in here!

722
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,803
Homeboy stepping up to the plate!

723
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:34,721
[speaking Spanish]

724
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:36,765
Margarita, listen to this.

725
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,726
How'd you do it?
Did you get her a ring?

726
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,314
Uh, I made it, actually,
out of... gum wrappers.

727
00:38:43,397 --> 00:38:44,648
Gum was how we met, so...

728
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:46,567
Babe. Babe!

729
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,569
What's up?

730
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,861
Dinner!

731
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,076
Dude, you need to get her a real ring.

732
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,536
Yeah, no, definitely. I just, um...

733
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:58,995
I mean, she can't
have it in prison, though,

734
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,665
'cause she'll get,
you know, shanked for it.

735
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:04,543
My boss will ask me
where she got it, or...

736
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,879
But... [clears throat]
I think the gum ring is fine for now.

737
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,051
Hey, who's...
[whispering] who's that?

738
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:15,887
I'm a daddy again!

739
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:20,434
And I know you ain't
gonna say shit to Aleida, right?

740
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:25,106
Or do I have to bribe you with, like,
movies and candies like I do with them?

741
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,315
[chuckles]

742
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:28,567
-[Eva grunts]
-How many times--

743
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,026
Look! Look what you did.

744
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:31,445
You broke this shit!

745
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,200
Hi. You're Lucy, right?

746
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:37,784
I'm Lucy.

747
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,122
Oh, sorry.

748
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:53,509
[sighs]

749
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,011
[in a funny voice] Happy birthday!
[chuckles]

750
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,721
[in normal voice]
Dayanara asked me to bring you this.

751
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,265
Is it a Barbie?

752
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:03,059
Well, I guess you'll have to
open it and find out.

753
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:06,647
No, it's not a Barbie,
but it's cool.

754
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,441
Dinner, bitches.

755
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:10,609
That was fast.

756
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:13,487
Yeah, leftovers from Storky's.

757
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,197
Hey, I should probably get going.

758
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:18,074
I just wanted to drop off the thing
and tell you the good news.

759
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:21,662
Nice try, homeboy.
You're staying for dinner.

760
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,255
Oh, Mitch, good to see you.

761
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,715
[Mitch] Wish it were under
better circumstances.

762
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:36,135
Yeah, well, could be worse.

763
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:37,969
Fig could still be here.

764
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,846
I really liked her.

765
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:46,603
[clears throat] The early releases
should have saved you enough money

766
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:50,524
to handle the infestation situation
without any additional funding.

767
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,735
I've made several
cost-cutting measures myself,

768
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,487
and that includes the new mattresses

769
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,698
which I noticed
weren't factored into your budget.

770
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:59,115
Because they weren't approved.

771
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,076
They were approved.
They have to be.

772
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,911
We're burning 'em right now, Mitch.

773
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,996
Burning, yes, fine.

774
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,999
But we're not going to
replace hundreds of mattresses

775
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,336
only to get rid of them
again in two months.

776
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:14,923
Why would we get rid of
the mattresses in two months?

777
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:19,928
No one told you.

778
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,641
Holy shit.

779
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:29,355
Holy shit!

780
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,317
[sighs]

781
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,027
That's the reason
for the early releases.

782
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:37,821
I'm sorry.

783
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:39,656
I don't know how
you weren't informed.

784
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,785
The warden must've forgot
to ring me in between rounds of golf.

785
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:47,998
None of this reflects badly on you.

786
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:52,461
Your name is actually
being mentioned quite favorably.

787
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,422
There's a good chance
you'll get a transfer.

788
00:41:58,133 --> 00:41:59,426
And everybody else?

789
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,102
How long do we have?

790
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:12,356
The prisoners should
all be relocated by the 20th.

791
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:16,777
They're officially
closing the prison the 30th.

792
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:29,164
Eat your French fries, puto.

793
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:31,292
I'm not hungry for vegetables.

794
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,418
-Hey!
-[Margarita] Oh!

795
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:33,919
Pero listen to you.

796
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:36,755
Don't you talk to him that way.
He pays your rent.

797
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,676
That's right.
So you gotta listen to what I say

798
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:45,306
because otherwise,
there'll be behavioral consequences.

799
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,933
Man, when you put 'em in the microwave,
they get disgusting!

800
00:42:48,016 --> 00:42:49,142
I'm not eating 'em.

801
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,942
-[gun cocks]
-Whoa! Hey, now! Hey! Whoa.

802
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:59,320
Margarita brought you French fries.

803
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:02,489
You better get fuckin' hungry real quick.

804
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:11,122
Emiliano, do me a favor.

805
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,750
Get the fuck out of my face.

806
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:21,257
I know I look strict, right?

807
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:23,344
But secretly, deep down inside,

808
00:43:23,427 --> 00:43:26,430
they're just happy that
there's actually an adult in charge.

809
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:29,265
-Sit down, sit down. Eat, eat.
-[exhales]

810
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,980
[man on radio]
Impact target 30 seconds from flash.

811
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:38,859
Repeat. Impact target
is 30 seconds from flash.

812
00:43:38,942 --> 00:43:41,695
Not a bad first combat tour, huh, Bennett?

813
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:44,030
Yeah, cleaning porta-johns
and dancing like a rent boy

814
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:45,866
while Skynet does all the fun stuff.

815
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:47,158
Aw, come on now.

816
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:48,785
You know the biggest bombs
in the whole war

817
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:49,911
get dropped in the porta-johns.

818
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,831
Ha-ha. Yeah, maybe I'll get a medal
for most excellent shit-soldier.

819
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:55,376
-[Kane chuckles]
-Lock it up.

820
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,419
Eat your motherfucking ice cream...

821
00:43:57,503 --> 00:44:00,296
because we're about to deliver some
serious freedom through their skulls.

822
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,382
[man on radio]
You have target confirmed.

823
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:03,342
Go to fire.

824
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,511
[indistinct]

825
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:09,222
-Three, two, one. Kaboom.
-Oh, shit!

826
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:10,599
[all exclaiming]

827
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:11,683
Fuck, yeah, bro!

828
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,478
Bomb! Have bomb! Bomb! Them!

829
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:15,812
[Bennett] No, no!
It's not him!

830
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,068
-[man shouting in local language]
-[Page] Grenade!

831
00:44:22,152 --> 00:44:23,153
Bennett, kick it out!

832
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:28,450
[Page] Fuck! Clear out!

833
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:30,744
[panting]

834
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:32,203
[dog farts and whimpers]

835
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:34,373
[knock at door]

836
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:36,082
Yeah, come in.

837
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,215
I need to add my lawyer
to my visitation list.

838
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,301
You having problems with your case?

839
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:47,969
No.

840
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:51,139
And please take my husband off my list.

841
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:53,934
Why don't you have a seat, Red?

842
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:57,103
I won't be staying, but thank you.

843
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:59,606
Please... sit.

844
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:02,484
[woman on PA]
The mail cart is going around.

845
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:05,612
All letters are subject to inspection.

846
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:08,198
You want to tell me
what's going on?

847
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:09,908
I married a pillow.

848
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,580
Soft, lumpy, and always
lying behind my back.

849
00:45:14,663 --> 00:45:18,333
Words like "always" are absolutes...

850
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:23,296
and using them is a way
to reinforce what we wanna believe.

851
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,051
When speaking emotionally...

852
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,513
absolutes can be dangerous.

853
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,682
Good advice. Thank you.

854
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:37,268
Please add my lawyer
and remove my husband.

855
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,148
You know, Red...
marriage is a two-way street.

856
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:47,488
And you can't swim without getting wet.
See? I can say clichés, too. Ha!

857
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:52,826
You owe it to your younger self to explore

858
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:56,412
those things that made you wanna
marry this man in the first place.

859
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:58,164
You may find that they're still there.

860
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:03,378
I owe my younger self 23 years
of wild sex with multiple partners,

861
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,547
but I'll settle for my name back.

862
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:08,884
You made a lifelong commitment.

863
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,385
That's sacred.

864
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:14,305
You don't know my story, Healy,
and you don't know what he's done.

865
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,390
[speaking Russian] Cocksucker.

866
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,059
Hey! Language!

867
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,269
I know what that word means,

868
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:22,689
and it's not okay to refer to your husband
or any other man that way.

869
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:28,361
You know, you huff in here...
like some put-upon martyr...

870
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:32,824
like a smile would break your face,
trivializing a man's emotions.

871
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:34,910
What is that? Some kind of
a Russian thing or something?

872
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:38,914
-What the hell does that--
-Hey! Language! Again!

873
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:43,168
That's the last time that
I'm gonna warn you, Mrs. Reznikov.

874
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,129
You forget where you are...

875
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:50,216
just like you forget that
your husband has a stake in this, too.

876
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,843
Just because he made some mistakes

877
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:54,596
doesn't mean that you can run off
and go sleep in your mother's room

878
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,140
at the first sign
of white caps on the ocean.

879
00:46:57,223 --> 00:46:58,474
[inhales]

880
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,775
[exhales]

881
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,970
-You know, this is a bad fuckin' plan.
-It's a great fuckin' plan.

882
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:36,680
Drugs in the tool belt,
tool belt to Luschek,

883
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:38,932
Luschek to the streets, money.
Don't overthink it.

884
00:47:39,015 --> 00:47:41,309
You know, I missed the part
where you contribute.

885
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,479
I am the fairy godmother
who watches over you

886
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:47,273
to make sure that the plan
doesn't go up your cute little nose.

887
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:50,819
Great. Finally I get a mother
who gives a shit about me

888
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:54,280
and... it's bibbity-bobbity Big Boo.
[chuckles]

889
00:47:54,364 --> 00:47:55,365
[chuckles]

890
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,954
-Uh, Boo?
-Huh?

891
00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:02,080
We've got a problem.

892
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,504
Someone stole our candy.

893
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,381
Oh!

894
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:12,465
Fuck!

895
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:29,565
All right, that's the last of
the E-Dorm mattresses, Mr. Caputo.

896
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:32,694
No books.
We're gonna try to salvage those.

897
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:33,904
Are you kidding me?

898
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,615
-Doesn't matter.
-What's that?

899
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:42,412
Doesn't matter.

900
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:49,210
So, I'm confused.

901
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,559
They're from that bush
in the yard by the greenhouse.

902
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:05,643
They're not bean leaves,

903
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:09,480
but they have, like, pods on them,
so I thought maybe they--

904
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:10,899
Are you sleeping?

905
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,192
[snoring]

906
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:36,632
You know...
you can't actually feel the bites.

907
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:41,596
Bedbug saliva contains a substance
that acts as a mild anesthetic.

908
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:44,182
It's in your head.

909
00:49:44,265 --> 00:49:46,642
I should sleep
without a mattress more often.

910
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:48,311
It's good for my back.

911
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:52,065
If you feel like
that's the right thing to do...

912
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:55,026
then you should absolutely do it.

913
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:01,908
Still trying to preserve my kibun?

914
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,538
I told Alex the truth
about something today...

915
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:12,168
and she told me...
that I was a manipulative...

916
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,926
She told me I was manipulative.

917
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,222
I lie...

918
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,683
I get in trouble.

919
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:30,186
I truth...

920
00:50:32,147 --> 00:50:33,774
I get in trouble.

921
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,611
I can't do anything right.

922
00:50:38,694 --> 00:50:41,990
What are you asking for?
Advice?

923
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,533
Here's some.

924
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:45,743
Stop buying into your own horseshit.

925
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,665
You tell me I'm scratching
is my imagination?

926
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,835
Look around.
The prison is crawling.

927
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:56,880
You can tell everyone
they can't feel it all night long,

928
00:50:56,963 --> 00:50:59,883
but in the morning,
we've all been a bug buffet.

929
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,928
Just... stop trying to
mold the real world

930
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:06,431
into the one inside
your pointy blonde head.

931
00:51:13,188 --> 00:51:15,690
Maybe I am manipulative.

932
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:19,110
From what I've seen...
to get what you want...

933
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:23,031
while telling everyone
how clean you are...

934
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:24,699
you play dirty.

935
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,828
You just described my mother.

936
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,917
She's a kibun ninja...

937
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,587
or whatever
the Korean version of "ninja" is...

938
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,965
and then the WASP version of that.

939
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:42,300
Awaken your inner Russian.

940
00:51:42,383 --> 00:51:43,844
No more bullshit.

941
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:46,387
Na zdorovie.

942
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:49,349
The world is better
in black and white...

943
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,351
[grunts]

944
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:54,104
and red.

945
00:51:57,232 --> 00:51:59,317
[Cesar] That's my favorite Daya story.

946
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,401
What is it?

947
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:03,404
What, you bang her
and you don't know her quinceañera story?

948
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,449
She tells that story to everybody.

949
00:52:06,532 --> 00:52:10,786
Aleida got wasted and she tripped
and fell on the birthday cake

950
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:12,914
and the candles lit her dress on fire...

951
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:15,791
but you gotta hear
the way Daya tells it.

952
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,964
I ain't gonna lie, man.
This shit... ain't easy.

953
00:52:22,757 --> 00:52:25,260
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
go it alone for a while.

954
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:29,264
Nah, nah, nah.
You get yourself a little side of bacon...

955
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:30,891
like Margarita.

956
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:32,475
That's what women are made for.

957
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,895
[baby whining]

958
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:37,647
That used to be Daya's crib...

959
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,566
and all the other little scrubs, too.

960
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,694
It's nothing fancy, but, uh...

961
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:45,696
it's got a lot of good luck.

962
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,740
Buena suerte.

963
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:54,080
I want you to have it, man.

964
00:52:54,164 --> 00:52:55,581
What about her?

965
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:57,500
We'll get her something else.

966
00:52:59,002 --> 00:53:00,420
It's for Aleida's family.

967
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:02,713
Salud!

968
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,637
[sniffs]

969
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:11,889
Margarita!

970
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:13,724
[Margarita] Yeah?

971
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:15,060
[Cesar speaking Spanish]

972
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:23,484
[sighs] Six months old,
but she shits like a human.

973
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,239
[Bell over PA] Good morning, ladies.

974
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:31,242
Additional linen uniforms
are now available.

975
00:53:31,326 --> 00:53:36,456
If you are a small or an extra small,
first come, first serve.

976
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:09,864
-You bitch!
-[gasps]

977
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:12,617
Fuck you, Alex!

978
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,951
Fuck you!

979
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:17,747
[grunts]

980
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:25,880
[grunts]

981
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,732
[moaning]

982
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,466
[moaning]

983
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,889
[breathes deeply]

984
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,162
[sighs]
