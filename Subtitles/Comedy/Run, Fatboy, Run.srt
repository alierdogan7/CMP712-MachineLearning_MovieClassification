00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:44,845
#Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky #

2
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:47,923
# Nice work if you can get it #

3
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,885
# And you can get it
if you try #

4
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:57,479
# Strollin' with that one girl,
sighin' sigh after sigh #

5
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,286
# Nice work if you can get it #

6
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:04,042
# And you can get it
if you try #

7
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:10,043
# Just imagine someone
waitin' at the cottage door #

8
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,038
# Where two hearts become one #

9
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,324
- # Who could ask
for anything more? #
- Mmm!

10
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:16,556
That looks good enough to eat.

11
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,205
Oh, thank you.

12
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,084
I wasn't talking about the cake.

13
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,727
Oh, Gordon. You're my cousin.

14
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,604
Never stopped
the Royal Family.

15
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,802
You're a very sick man.

16
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,162
Mm. Hi.

17
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:29,726
- Hi.
- You're yummy.

18
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:33,844
Oh, Mum, would you take Grandma
over to the church, please?

19
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,485
Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

20
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:36,886
So, do you wanna go and
tell Dennis that we're ready?

21
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,559
Sure thing.

22
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:39,602
How's he doing?

23
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:41,325
Oh, great. Thrilled.

24
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,757
I'm telling you, he's thrilled.

25
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,523
Dennis, it's Gordon.
Are you ready?

26
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:01,004
Wow! You look great!

27
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,641
So, are you ready?

28
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:05,796
Um...

29
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,800
- Just...
- OK.

30
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,117
I'm gonna give you a minute
to, uh...

31
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,242
give you a minute.

32
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,955
No, no. I don't want to.

33
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:22,958
Done want to, ah...

34
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,202
Dennis!

35
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,755
It's time.
Dennis, we have to go.

36
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,676
Dennis!

37
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:34,762
Dennis!

38
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,606
# Where to promise
to love one... #

39
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,042
Dennis, we're gonna have a baby.

40
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,882
Dennis.

41
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,562
Dennis?

42
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:55,279
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

43
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,120
Aw, shit.

44
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,561
Dennis!

45
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,526
Dennis!

46
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,076
# I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
if you're gettin' me wrong #

47
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,727
# But you're half a world away
with only one sock on #

48
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:24,605
# Now you're gettin' too much,
I don't want to play along #

49
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,360
# 'Cause all I really wanted
was a radio song #

50
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:28,960
# What is there to say #

51
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,036
# What is there to say?

52
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,355
# In a world so grey? #

53
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:32,436
# In a world so grey #

54
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:36,884
# Why, oh, why, oh, why
are we singing it anyway? #

55
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,082
- Come on!
- # 'Cause you think I had #

56
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,839
- # A wind-up heart #
- Stop!

57
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,487
- # Then you must
have had plastic head #
- Come back!

58
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,558
- # Did you think
I had to play the part? #
- Give me a break!

59
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:48,400
# When you copied everyhing
I said? #

60
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,955
- # When the tide of love is out
and the rust begins to show #
- Whoo!

61
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,275
# You're cryin'
in your sleep #

62
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,356
# Scared of your shadow #

63
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:54,596
- # If you thought
this was forever #
- Ooh!

64
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:56,643
- Oh!
- # Dear,
I'm keeping you in mind #

65
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:57,762
Gotcha. Where is it?

66
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:58,802
Where's what?

67
00:03:58,887 --> 00:03:59,842
You know what I'm talkin' about!

68
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,042
Ooh! Hey! Hey!

69
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,082
Ooh!

70
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,122
All right!

71
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,162
What do you
think this is, huh?

72
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:05,441
I've never seen those
before in my life.

73
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,358
Yeah, and you're
a fit, running type.

74
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,436
You bastard.

75
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,482
Don't.

76
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,556
Little shit!

77
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:11,762
There's nothing to see here,
people.

78
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:12,882
Ow!

79
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,882
Where's the bra?

80
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,002
What bra?

81
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:25,956
Whoo!

82
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,878
Come on, fat boy, run!

83
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,116
I'm not fat!

84
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,799
I'm just-- I'm unfit.

85
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,202
Go on, then.

86
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,602
Ow!

87
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:12,755
Yes?

88
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,724
Could you let me in, please,
Mr G?

89
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,402
Who the hell are you?

90
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,443
You-- Why are we--

91
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,563
It's Dennis Doyle
from downstairs.

92
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,478
Dennis Doyle from downstairs
is dead...

93
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,636
killed by his landlord.

94
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:26,921
- Do you know why?
- No.

95
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:29,965
Failure to pay the rent
in a timely fashion.

96
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,116
Dennis!

97
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,686
Hey, Maya.
Listen, can you tell your dad...

98
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,722
I'm in a bit of a hurry?

99
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,718
- Have you got any money?
- Maya, go inside!

100
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,526
And put something on.

101
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,355
Hello. Hello.

102
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,199
Yes?

103
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,322
Do you know what happened
to that landlord...

104
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:47,398
after he killed Dennis Doyle
from downstairs?

105
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,523
- No.
- They gave him a medal...

106
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,360
and a nice foot massage.

107
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,838
Hey, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

108
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,157
Mr Ghoshdashtidar, wait--

109
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,043
Well, how is the old rascal?

110
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,119
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

111
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,322
You know Bilbo.

112
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,806
He's got
the whole place in an uproar.

113
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,479
Mm. Ah, well,
that should please him.

114
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:24,402
Jake, your dad's gonna be here
in a minute.

115
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,602
You ready?

116
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,166
Ready!

117
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,522
All right,
then keep your secrets.

118
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,245
Hey.

119
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,045
- # You give me tone #
- Hey.

120
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,118
# I'll like that #

121
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:38,879
Hey, how is it goin'?

122
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,798
- Oh, yeah.
- # All the chrome #

123
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,843
# Well, I'll like that #

124
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,236
Dennis. Yeah, Dennis.

125
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,442
# Do you run away? #

126
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,916
You like, uh, to have some sort
of drink with me?

127
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,326
Oh, what the hell. Let's--

128
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,682
Ow, shit!

129
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,961
Oh!

130
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,366
- Hah!
- Aah!

131
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,039
No. Oh, you got me!

132
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:01,196
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,481
- We're playing
hobbits and orcs.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,716
Guess who's an orc?

135
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,726
Honey, would you mind, uh...

136
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,798
This kind of smarts. Can you?

137
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,922
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

138
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,156
I'm not finished
with you, Whit!

139
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:12,646
Yeah, one sec.

140
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,001
Uh, I thought his dad
was picking him up.

141
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,078
- What happened?
- Oh, what happened?

142
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,236
Dennis happened.

143
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,238
Mmm. Well, on the bright side...

144
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,602
- Hmm?
- you look astonishingly
beautiful today.

145
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:22,722
- Whit!
- Really.

146
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:29,842
Where have you been?

147
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,280
Hey.

148
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,402
- I was--
- Daddy!

149
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,159
Hey, snot-face!

150
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,521
Oh, please, don't call him that.

151
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:36,960
Why?
He is a snot-face, isn't he?

152
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,765
You are a snot-face,
aren't you? Huh?

153
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:39,996
Oh.

154
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,042
Aw!

155
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,640
Jake, that's disgusting.

156
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,080
Jake, that's disgusting.
Go on.

157
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,766
- Toilet first.
- Mom!

158
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,156
Go on. Grab your jacket.

159
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,963
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago, Dennis.

160
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah, there was a bit
of a mix-up with the--

161
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,125
with the tickets, so...

162
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,322
Hey, you look really nice.

163
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,476
Did I get you that necklace?

164
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,637
No. It was a...

165
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,922
just a present
from someone...else.

166
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,123
- Who?
- Uh, me, actually.

167
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:06,162
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:07,202
Huh?

169
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,845
It belonged to my grandmother.

170
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:09,962
Yeah.

171
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:11,762
Huh?

172
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,281
Dennis, this is
my good friend, Whit.

173
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:18,359
Whit, this is my--
Jake's dad, Dennis.

174
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,721
How you doin'?

175
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,006
Good, yeah.
You have soft hands.

176
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,236
Do you moisturize?

177
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,202
I do, actually.

178
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,002
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

179
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,918
It's nice to finally put a face
to the name.

180
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:30,962
I'd have probably thought
you'd have...

181
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,480
you would have seen
one of our photos.

182
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,482
Oh, there aren't any.

183
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:36,162
- Hmm.
- Ready?

184
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,124
Yes. Let's go.

185
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,401
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:42,320
Dennis, you do have
the tickets, right?

187
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,046
Libby, credit me
with some intelligence.

188
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,516
Tickets!

189
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,598
Does anybody have any tickets?

190
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:54,961
Mate, my daughter's
not very well.

191
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:56,275
I've got a couple of
spare tickets if you want 'em.

192
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,800
Yes. Thank you so much.
How much?

193
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:58,922
Oh, whatever.

194
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,406
Uh, this is
all the money I have.

195
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:02,802
Yeah?

196
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,115
My son is gonna love me.

197
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,084
You want your son to love you?
Don't break the law.

198
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,998
Hey, that's entrapment!

199
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,645
Oh, God!

200
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,365
And that's brutality!

201
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,163
Libby, it's--
It was only a caution.

202
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,319
No. Uh, Libby, I'll--

203
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,442
- Bye, Dad.
- Libby.

204
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:34,526
So, do you work with Libby
at the bakery?

205
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:36,882
No.

206
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:38,875
We met at the bakery, though.

207
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,482
What?

209
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,842
No, I just was
a nervous wreck that day.

210
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,121
It took me
four chocolate eclairs...

211
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,846
and a macaroon just to get up
the courage to talk to her.

212
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,966
Uh, no, I work in
the financial district actually.

213
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,122
I'm a hedge fund manager
for Waterman Hughes.

214
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,435
Oh.

215
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,722
I do high-level security
analysis and operation...

216
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:02,126
for an upscale retail outlet.

217
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,560
Really?

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,365
Libby said
you were a security guard...

219
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,596
at a women's clothing store.

220
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,279
Yeah, that's what I said.

221
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,766
Right.

222
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,917
Uh, well, l--
I should probably get a cab.

223
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,599
I got a big run in the morning.

224
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,120
A big what?

225
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,960
A run-- I'm training for
the Nike River Run next month.

226
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:20,002
The what-y what what?

227
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,281
The Nike River Run.

228
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,961
It's a-- It's a marathon race
along the, uh, Thames River.

229
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,326
Why would you do that?

230
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,159
Uh, well, it's
a charity thing, you know?

231
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:29,202
Plus, I love to run.

232
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,881
I actually ran the London
Marathon a little while ago.

233
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:32,922
Oh, that's a coincidence.

234
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,962
Oh, yeah? How's that?

235
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,446
I watched it on the television.

236
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:36,562
- Ah.
- Well, the last hour.

237
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,239
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

238
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:40,675
Right.

239
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,997
Um, well, look, you know...

240
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,078
I know these things can be
pretty awkward, you know?

241
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,646
I mean, you know,
you're Jake's dad...

242
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,958
and, uh, well,
I just want you to know...

243
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:55,644
that I like Libby and Jake
very, very much...

244
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:59,640
and, um, well, I just appreciate
your being so grown up...

245
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,876
about this, you know?

246
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,476
Hey! Yo!

247
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,761
You wanna take this one?

248
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,962
- No, you have it.
- You sure?

249
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,241
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

250
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:07,726
All right.
Very nice to meet you.

251
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:09,320
- Yeah.
- I'm sure I'll see you around.

252
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,159
Yup. Hope so.

253
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,966
Hello, good sir.
West lndia Quay, please.

254
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,322
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,840
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

256
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,602
Dennis!

257
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,642
Dennis!

258
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,682
Dennis?

259
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,482
- Close your eyes.
- Huh?

260
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,000
- Close your eyes.
- Oh.

261
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,003
OK. Open them.
Happy Valentine's.

262
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,485
That's great.

263
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:36,962
Dennis!

264
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,636
Dennis!

265
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,362
Hi.

266
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,522
Hey, Vincent.

267
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,280
- Dennis.
- How's business?

268
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,356
Whatcha mean, "business"?

269
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,516
Sorry.

270
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:48,962
- Got it.
- Shh.

271
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,036
Hush now, man.

272
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,355
All right.

273
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:56,596
Three thousand.

274
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,041
This is all I've got.

275
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,638
Just throw whatever you have
in the pot.

276
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,683
OK.

277
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,882
Flush, king high.

278
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:12,956
Ace high.

279
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,160
What happened?

280
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,082
Bad luck, mate.

281
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,441
Oh.

282
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,079
Oh, hey, I got you
those tickets.

283
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,520
They were for yesterday.

284
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:31,562
What?
So now you don't want 'em?

285
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,046
Why would I want them?

286
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,962
Put them on eBay.

287
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,196
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

288
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,561
for something
that happened yesterday?

289
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,160
- Time travellers.
- Where were you?

290
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,363
My whole night
was just screwed, man...

291
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,359
and I looked like a prick in
front of Libby's new boyfriend.

292
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:47,165
Oh, she didn't tell me
she has a new boyfriend.

293
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,362
What's he like?

294
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,965
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

295
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,959
He's like Peter Perfect
out of Wacky Races...

296
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:55,275
and he runs marathons.

297
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,086
- Why?
- Exactly.

298
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,959
Well, look, my only
serious relationship ended...

299
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,322
in a broken collarbone
and a dead meerkat...

300
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,284
so I may not be the best person
in the world to give advice...

301
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,801
but you have been trying
to get through to Libby...

302
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,605
for five years now...

303
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,201
so maybe you should let her go.

304
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,845
Yeah,
but what is her problem?

305
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,486
Dennis, you left her
at the altar...

306
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,716
when she was pregnant.

307
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,126
But that was ages ago.

308
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:27,040
Well, women remember that stuff.

309
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,520
Look, if there's anything else
I can do to help...

310
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,279
just let me know.

311
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,358
Well, actually, I am
a little bit behind in my rent.

312
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:34,926
I was wondering if you had
a couple of hundred quid...

313
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,440
I could maybe borrow.

314
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,202
Oh, I love you. I really do.

315
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:49,084
I needed that actually.

316
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,283
That's great. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

317
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,362
How about this one?

318
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,362
I bet you can't do it.

319
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,279
- I can do a big one.
- Go on.

320
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,242
Look, look, look, look, look.

321
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,441
That was a good one.

322
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,562
Yeah.

323
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,281
Listen.

324
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,517
I'm really sorry about
gettin' you arrested yesterday.

325
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:21,562
That's all right.

326
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,875
Most universities
don't even look...

327
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,286
at things
like that these days.

328
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,521
Hey, another one.

329
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,245
As far as I'm concerned,
what else do you have?

330
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,885
- Oh, she was great.
- Yeah, well, she is--

331
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:31,241
Ooh!

332
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,395
- Shh.
- Sorry.

333
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,442
Um, but, yeah, so I think--

334
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,040
Do you want to hear a secret?

335
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,082
Absolutely.

336
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,885
There's a girl in my class
called Emily.

337
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,685
Well, I'm sure
that's not a secret.

338
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,246
The teachers probably know
about her.

339
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,521
She looks like a tree frog.

340
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:44,562
She what?

341
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,126
She looks like a tree frog.

342
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:48,038
That's not
a very nice thing to say.

343
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,401
I like tree frogs.

344
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:50,556
Oh, yeah?

345
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,682
More than hobbits?

346
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,201
I see.

347
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,437
I really feel
we can make a life together.

348
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:58,755
"You really think we could--"

349
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,678
Wait, that sounds like something
Whit would say.

350
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,041
He did say it.

351
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,163
- What? To Mom?
- Yes.

352
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:05,396
What a shithead.

353
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:06,442
Dad!

354
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,562
Sorry.

355
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,320
Listen, I'm really glad
you were such a big boy...

356
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,726
about not gettin'
into the whole...

357
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:13,956
Lord of the Rings thing,
you know?

358
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,002
That's OK.

359
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:16,486
Whit's got us front row seats
for tomorrow...

360
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,636
so it's even better.

361
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,160
What a shithead.

362
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,282
Dad!

363
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,682
Well.

364
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,602
# Ah, yeah #

365
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,602
# Oh, yeah #

366
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,440
# I'm up
on the eleventh floor #

367
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,961
# And I'm watchin'
the cruisers below #

368
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,926
# He's down on the street #

369
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,646
# And he's tryin' hard
to pull sister Flo #

370
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,924
# Oh, my heart's
in the basement #

371
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,601
# My weekend's
at an all-time low #

372
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,359
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

373
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,836
# So I can't see her
letting him go #

374
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,199
# You betcha #

375
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,606
# Oh, yeah #

376
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:05,722
# Uh-huh #

377
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,076
Deliveries are downstairs.

378
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,839
- No, I'm--
- Waterman Hughes.

379
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:19,800
- Yes?
- Bonjour.

380
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,596
Whit!

381
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,602
Thanks for your help.

382
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:32,205
So, what brings you
down here, man?

383
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,357
A little, uh, high-level
security analysis...

384
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,675
in retail operation?

385
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:36,836
Huh?

386
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,758
What can I do for you?
I'm just on my way to the gym.

387
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,122
- I got a spin class.
- Huh?

388
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,323
Spinning?
You know, spinning, bicycles?

389
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,362
Oh, OK.

390
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,438
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a pint.

391
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,245
A pint? Oh, a pint.

392
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,124
Uh, wow.

393
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,925
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

394
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,406
but, uh, I really gotta hit
this class.

395
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm in training, you know?

396
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,235
You wanna come along?

397
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:57,919
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

398
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,963
I-- I'd love to, but I don't
have any gear, so--

399
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,116
Well, I'll lend you some.

400
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:03,202
Great.

401
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,118
Three, two, one!

402
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,686
We're climbing!
Rhythm is up!

403
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:10,646
Push! Push! Push! Push!

404
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,160
Keep it up!

405
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:13,919
No cheating! Let's go!

406
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,326
How you doin' there?
You all right?

407
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,362
What'd you say?

408
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,438
Out of the saddle!
We're climbing!

409
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,119
OK,
let's make it really hard!

410
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,639
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about, man?

411
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,555
Ow!

412
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,957
Jake said you had some tickets
to the, uh...

413
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,560
to the hobbit musical.

414
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,365
Yeah, a friend of mine's
an investor in the show.

415
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:38,358
He totally hooked me up.
Can you believe that?

416
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:41,086
Hmm...um...

417
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,158
I was just thinking, um...

418
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,202
you know,
you don't really wanna sit...

419
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:47,279
through a whole sort of
three-hour kind of show, do you?

420
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,439
- So...
- Well, the thing is...

421
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,202
Oh.

422
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,282
Jake's really kind of got
his heart set on this, you know?

423
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,402
Yeah.

424
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,566
- Powder?
- I'm fine.

425
00:19:58,647 --> 00:19:59,796
You sure? Refreshing.

426
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,479
I would imagine it is.

427
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,525
I was just-- I'm thinkin' maybe,
you know, if you like...

428
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,167
then I could maybe take Jake
and Libby for you, you know...

429
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,283
if--if you want.

430
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,245
Look, I know you must be
kind of angry at yourself...

431
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,158
for messing up with the tickets
the other night...

432
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,646
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

433
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,479
I really would, but, um...

434
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:19,882
Well, the thing is...

435
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,435
I hope to be more and more
a part of Jake's life, you know?

436
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,883
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind
of looking forward to this show.

437
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,322
Give Jake and l, a chance to get
to know each other better.

438
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,716
I mean, uh, you can see
my point, can't you?

439
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,756
Yes, I can.

440
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,320
So, can I ask you a question?

441
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:37,476
Sure.

442
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,683
You had her once,
why did you ever let her go?

443
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,082
To be honest, Whit--

444
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just
be careful on the stairs here.

445
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:44,480
Your legs
might be a little rubbery.

446
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,362
I'm fine.

447
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,205
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,481
I'm fine. I'm--

449
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,558
Yeah, the first step
is often the, uh...

450
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,682
the difficult one.

451
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,085
This is Libby.
Leave me a message.

452
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,203
Hey, Lib, it's me.
Can you give me a ring?

453
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,042
Fuck!

454
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:19,962
Who the hell are you?

455
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,605
Just open the bloody door.

456
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:22,836
OK.

457
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,683
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

458
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,598
- Forty-eight.
- Yes.

459
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:11,722
Hello.

460
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,240
Dennis, I'm really busy.

461
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:14,362
Can we talk?

462
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,483
No, just buy something or go.

463
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:20,116
OK. I, can I have one of your
signature cupcakes, please?

464
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:22,680
Actually,
can I have this big one?

465
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:23,722
- Dennis.
- That one's fine...

466
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,525
and, uh, I like that one, too.

467
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,599
- Anything else?
- Um, yeah.

468
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:30,166
What do you see in Whit?

469
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:32,807
- Uh, forty-nine.
- Yes, I'm forty-nine.

470
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,639
- What can I get for you?
- No, I'm not done yet.

471
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:35,842
Yes, you are.

472
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,043
Sorry, I think you've used up
your allotted time.

473
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,721
You don't-- You don't have
allotted time, OK?

474
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,365
Now you're using up
my allotted time.

475
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,039
You don't get
allotted time, OK?

476
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,321
It's not like a game show,
you know?

477
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,796
You got, like, fifteen seconds
to win a bun.

478
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,559
Goodbye, Dennis.

479
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:50,602
Yes?

480
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,598
Yes. Hello, yes.

481
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,963
Um, do you have any of those
little gingerbread rabbits?

482
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:57,321
Oh, no.
We just have those at Easter.

483
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,476
I'm so sorry.

484
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,602
Oh.

485
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:01,915
Hmm...

486
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:09,119
Do you have anything else
shaped like an animal?

487
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,162
- Excuse me.
- What?

488
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,158
I haven't paid for my order.

489
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:13,716
I'm sorry.

490
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:14,762
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

491
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,246
Excuse me.

492
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,281
- Ow!
- Sorry.

493
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,206
Seriously,
what do you see in him?

494
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,005
OK, he's well-off, all right?

495
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:25,600
He's kind of-- He's quite
good-looking, you know?

496
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:26,642
But I mean, so what?

497
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,206
Is that what you think
this is about?

498
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,198
I just want
some gorgeous sugar daddy.

499
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:31,481
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

500
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:32,761
Well,
that's not why I'm with him.

501
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:33,962
Well, why are you with him?

502
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,116
You know,
give me one good reason.

503
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,084
One? I could give you fifty.

504
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,317
- I'm fifty!
- Hang on a minute!

505
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:42,638
He's mature, responsible,
considerate...

506
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:43,955
he's great with Jake.

507
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,924
- That's only four.
- Hello?

508
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,475
You know what?
He's a good man, Dennis.

509
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,035
You know, he runs marathons
for charity, for Pete's sake.

510
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,560
Oh, big deal!

511
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,399
So you could run a marathon?

512
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,603
Could I have
a chocolate brownie, please?

513
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,006
- Hang on!
- Oh!

514
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,759
Look, Libby, I can change.

515
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:02,236
Yeah? Well, great.
Let's get married.

516
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:03,726
- Really?
- No!

517
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,718
We tried that once, remember?

518
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:08,116
You left me at the altar,
pregnant.

519
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,606
You cock!

520
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,800
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

521
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,764
I have changed. I can prove it.

522
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,200
How?

523
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,919
I'll tell you.
I will run the marathon.

524
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,040
What?

525
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,082
The one that Whit's doin'...

526
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,998
I'll run that,
and I'll finish it.

527
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:27,122
Come on,
you've never finished...

528
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:29,243
anything in your entire life,
Dennis.

529
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,318
Oh, now, you-- That's not--

530
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:32,965
- You know--
- Look, You can't
even finish a sentence.

531
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:34,002
Don't--don't--

532
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,679
You're just bein',
you know, what's the word?

533
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,722
Cock?

534
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,843
I would settle for something
shaped like a fish.

535
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:39,882
Well, go to the fishmonger!

536
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,685
I'm a vegetarian.

537
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,803
OK. OK.

538
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,366
Dennis, just please leave.

539
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:47,642
OK. OK, I'll go.

540
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,080
But I'm gonna
prove this to you, Libby.

541
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:52,318
I can be mature, considerate,
and responsible.

542
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,316
- Oh!
- Dennis?

543
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:56,522
Yes, Libby?

544
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,360
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

545
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,926
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:03,840
Hey, if Dennis thinks
he can run the race...

547
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:04,916
he can run the race.

548
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,326
- Thank you.
- There's no way

549
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:07,920
you can run a marathon.

550
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,475
- Why not?
- 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

551
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,478
Hey, I'll have you know
I go to spin classes.

552
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,125
You went to one.

553
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:15,879
Yeah, and now
you walk like John Wayne.

554
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:18,486
Hey, this is important to me.

555
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:20,915
I mean it!

556
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:24,920
Look, I'm sick of
being a nearly man, all right?

557
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:25,962
I'm sick of being scared.

558
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:27,321
I'm sick of the regret
I feel every day...

559
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,557
'cause I didn't have the guts
to marry the woman I love!

560
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:33,118
All that ends
tomorrow at 6 A.M.

561
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:11,878
# Ow! #

562
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:33,402
Not bad.

563
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,642
Hi.

564
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,762
Feel better?

565
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:55,246
Much.

566
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,363
Oh, how was spin class?

567
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,521
Uh, it was...
It was an amazing workout.

568
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:03,966
Is that right?

569
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,480
Yeah. And I also thought
it would be...

570
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,364
a good chance for me
to get to know Whit...

571
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,039
a little bit better, so...

572
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,163
Well, maybe we should all go out
for dinner then.

573
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:12,362
- You think?
- Yeah.

574
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,085
And then we could go dancing.

575
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,998
- You're jokin'.
- No, not at all.

576
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:18,442
And then, afterwards,
we could come back here...

577
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,721
and have a threesome.

578
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:22,595
Oh. You are joking.

579
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:23,881
Of course, I am.

580
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,082
Look, Dennis, I don't know
what's going on...

581
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,441
in that head of yours,
but whatever it is...

582
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,085
- I don't like it.
- I've-- There's nothing--

583
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,839
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

584
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:30,916
- You ready for school?
- Yeah.

585
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,998
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

586
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:36,275
Can I walk with you guys?

587
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,402
OK.

588
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:39,880
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

589
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:42,842
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

590
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:44,716
All right, you ready?

591
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:45,842
Yeah.

592
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:56,197
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round
at Libby's pretty early, eh?

593
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,800
Whit stayed over last night.

594
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,081
- Oh?
- Yes.

595
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,282
They were jumping on the bed.

596
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:02,562
Wow.

597
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:07,599
Hey, Jakey, guess what?
Uh, I spoke to my friend...

598
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,643
and he does have an extra ticket
for the show tonight.

599
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:12,195
What do you say
we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

600
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,686
Yeah!

601
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,598
- Yay.
- What, he told you about Emily?

602
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:16,722
Oh, yeah.

603
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:18,922
Oh, and, uh...

604
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,840
Libby tells me that you
decided to run the marathon?

605
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:22,916
Yeah.

606
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,157
That's great, man. Seriously.

607
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,441
Really, that's awesome.

608
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:27,596
Thank you.

609
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:28,642
How did you manage to get in?

610
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:29,682
What do you mean?

611
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,246
Well, you can't
just show up and run.

612
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,282
Well, why not?

613
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,641
You have to apply in advance.

614
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,602
Well, how far in advance?

615
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,086
Uh, three months.

616
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,122
And when is it again?

617
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,560
Three weeks.

618
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:40,602
Right.

619
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:41,915
They'll make exceptions
sometimes...

620
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:44,237
if you're running for a charity,
but, uh, you know...

621
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:46,966
each charity is only allowed
a certain amount of runners.

622
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:48,446
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

623
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,642
I'll get in.

624
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,001
All right.

625
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:53,123
You ever, uh,
run a marathon before?

626
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:54,401
No. Why?

627
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:56,556
It's pretty gruelling.

628
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,922
Well, yeah, that's why
they call it a marathon.

629
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,358
Yeah, actually, technically,
it's called a marathon...

630
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:04,802
because of the events
of 490 B.C.

631
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,320
There was a Greek soldier...

632
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:07,362
- named Phei--
- Say, can I just...

633
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,960
- stop you there?
- Yeah.

634
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,798
I've got have nothing to say.
I just wanted to stop you there.

635
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,480
All right, all right.

636
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,757
Hello. Is that
the Cats Protection League?

637
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:23,602
Hello. I was just--

638
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:24,915
I'm-- I'm running a marathon
next month...

639
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,804
and I was wondering if I could
possibly run on your behalf?

640
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,006
Great. Yeah, yeah.

641
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,203
OK. I see.

642
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,006
How big is the costume?

643
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,084
OK. I'll call you back.

644
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:41,200
Ooh.

645
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:42,322
Hi.

646
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,555
- Dennis.
- Oh, yes?

647
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:46,444
Would you mind not doing that
in front of the customers?

648
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:48,563
Sorry. I went for a run
this morning in my trunks...

649
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:50,239
and I think
I've got a bit of a rash...

650
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:51,965
you know,
down there in the, uh...

651
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:53,685
- I understand.
- scrotal zone.

652
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,723
- I understand, Dennis.
- OK.

653
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,367
Please, keep your hands
out of the scrotal zone...

654
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,562
whilst you're at work.

655
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:00,716
Will do.

656
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,362
Shh.

657
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:40,642
Dennis!

658
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,122
Sorry. I was, um...

659
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:46,802
I was in the zone.

660
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:52,924
So, um, I'd actually
be dressed as a brain.

661
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,157
Um, can I call you back?

662
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,357
# Just 'cause you think it #

663
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,642
# It don't make it so #

664
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:11,287
# Drive you to drink #

665
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,801
# Won't let you go #

666
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:17,960
# Plenty of girls
and boys in love #

667
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:19,002
Come on!

668
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,918
# Plenty of girls #

669
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,284
# And boys in love #

670
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:29,558
Would you like a cup of tea,
Dennis?

671
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:36,003
So that's it.

672
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,361
Running this marathon
could be my last chance...

673
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,039
to show Libby that I can change.

674
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,562
Mmm.

675
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,756
You know what I would do
if I were you?

676
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:48,802
What?

677
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:51,196
I would get some cream
for that rash.

678
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:54,918
Let me ask you something,
Dennis.

679
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:58,841
Why did you leave your lady at
the altar when she was pregnant?

680
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,201
I don't know.
Just wasn't ready.

681
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:06,798
The toothpaste was already
out of the tube, my friend.

682
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,682
Being ready
had nothing to do with it.

683
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,326
I was scared.

684
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:13,442
Mmm.

685
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,000
So, you are a coward.

686
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,759
I thought we were just
gonna have a cup of tea.

687
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,683
You did not think
you were good enough.

688
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,120
Am I right?

689
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:28,243
You thought of your lady,
and you were terrified...

690
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:29,806
you could not give her
what she needed...

691
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,206
what she deserved.

692
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,679
I thought the same things...

693
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:37,725
on the day I married
Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

694
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,442
May she rest.

695
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,520
Did you?

696
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,359
Yes. But guess what?

697
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:48,405
It turned out
I was good enough.

698
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:50,159
I made myself good enough.

699
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:53,479
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

700
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:58,125
But she loved you once, and you
must have earned that somehow.

701
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,686
Yeah.

702
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,880
Did you have a good marriage,
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

703
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,241
Ah.

704
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,801
I remember the feeling
of being complete...

705
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:17,884
of spending every day
with my best friend...

706
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,320
but most of all...

707
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,083
I remember all the fucking.

708
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,040
Mmm...

709
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,360
Mmm...

710
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,763
Oh, three degrees starboard,
skipper.

711
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:41,326
Hey, I'm the captain.

712
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,160
Mutiny! Mutiny!

713
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,320
Whoa!

714
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,921
Ahoy there, me lad.

715
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,205
- Oh!
- Hey, Jakey.

716
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,242
Sorry, we're late, love.

717
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:55,840
Soon as Whit found out
we we're meeting here...

718
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,326
he had to go get his vessel.

719
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,366
Jakey, here.
Flip that switch.

720
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,517
No, not that one. That one.

721
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,005
Whoa! Can I steer it?

722
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,884
No.
But you can watch me steer it.

723
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,882
Mutiny.

724
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,000
Hey. You wanna?

725
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,764
- Was he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

726
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,157
We had a really nice time
until Captain Bligh turned up.

727
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:22,238
Whit just likes to take things
very seriously.

728
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,795
Prepare to be boarded,
or feel the hot wrath...

729
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,401
of Her Majesty's
royal fusillade!

730
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:30,235
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

731
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,926
Why won't you
let me steer it?

732
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:34,725
Uh, because it's mine.

733
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,126
So, you're still gonna run
in this marathon?

734
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,276
Yes, absolutely.

735
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,846
It's gonna be great.

736
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:40,724
You're gonna see
a whole new Dennis.

737
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:42,081
Right, well,
I've been thinking about it...

738
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,362
and the thing is, I don't care.

739
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:45,641
What do you mean?

740
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,763
Dennis, what do you think
you're going to achieve?

741
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,963
Do you honestly think
that running 26 miles...

742
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,526
is just gonna wipe
the slate clean?

743
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,722
Well, you might change your mind
when you see me...

744
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:53,842
in jogging shorts.

745
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:00,087
Look, Whit's having
a birthday party...

746
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,122
for me in a couple of weeks...

747
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:03,846
and it would mean a lot to Jake
if you came.

748
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:04,962
To Jake?

749
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:07,762
Hey!

750
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:10,722
Hey!

751
00:35:12,047 --> 00:35:13,366
Hey!

752
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,402
Hey, OK.

753
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,476
Whose boat is this?

754
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:17,956
Whose boat...is this?!

755
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:20,925
Excuse me!
Is-- Is this your boat?!

756
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,164
- No way!
- He's toast.

757
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,282
He won't last.

758
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:32,156
Would you like some pizza,
Dennis?

759
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,124
Oh. Yes, I would actually.
Thank you very much.

760
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:35,162
- Ow!
- Come here.

761
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:37,363
What are you doing that--
Stop it.

762
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,322
Are you still gonna do this?

763
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:40,522
Are you still gonna
run the marathon?

764
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:41,642
I want to, yes.

765
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:42,762
Thank God.

766
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,762
Why?

767
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:48,042
Because I just bet them
every penny I have.

768
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:49,640
What? You bet on me?

769
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:51,681
Dennis, you're my best friend.

770
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,519
I'm not gonna bet against you.

771
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,520
Well, thank you.

772
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:56,960
Not with these odds.

773
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:58,676
Well, what if I don't finish?

774
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,485
Vincent'll kill you.

775
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:01,682
Oh, you'll finish.

776
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,086
How can you be so sure?

777
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:11,318
Get up, get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

778
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,484
So, you're gonna be my coach.

779
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,920
That's right.

780
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:17,962
Why are you here?

781
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,277
I'm the assistant coach.

782
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,356
Why do you get
to be assistant coach?

783
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,005
Because I have this spatula.

784
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:24,122
Ow!

785
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,682
Go on. Get running.

786
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,917
Wait. Isn't there some sort
of special technique?

787
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:31,605
Yeah, you put one leg
in front of the other...

788
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,678
over and over again really fast.

789
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:35,996
Why are you here again?

790
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:37,566
- Ow!
- Motivation.

791
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:39,239
# I said, yeah #

792
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,646
# I said, yeah #

793
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,195
- # What they said #
- # What they said #

794
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,686
- # Oh, I said, yeah #
- Lift your knees higher!

795
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:45,722
- You're not gonna get...
- # Yeah, yeah #

796
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:47,399
- anywhere like that!
- # It's what they said #

797
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,284
- You've gotta slide more.
- # What they said #

798
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:51,843
- # Do you believe I would
take something with me #
- Come on, Dennis!

799
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:53,804
- You want to feel my spatula?!
- # And give it #

800
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:55,240
- No, I do not!
- # To the police man? #

801
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:57,921
- Then run! Run like the wind!
- # I wouldn't do that #

802
00:36:58,527 --> 00:36:59,596
- # And if I do that #
- This is harder...

803
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,405
- # I would say, "Sir" #
- for me, you know?

804
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:02,886
# "Come on
and put the charge on me" #

805
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,446
Ow!

806
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,199
# I wouldn't do that #

807
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:09,438
- # No, I wouldn't do that #
- Come on, Dennis! Come on!

808
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,087
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good!
- # I'm not a fool
to hurt myself #

809
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,646
- Come on, Dennis.
Keep up the pace.
- # I was innocent #

810
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:15,843
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- # Of what they done to me #

811
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:17,804
# They was wrong #

812
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:18,842
I think I got a blister.

813
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:19,916
- # They were wrong #
- OK.

814
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,235
Yeah, gently.

815
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,362
All right.

816
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:27,080
OK! Oh! All right.

817
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,839
-ls it bad?
-No, it's not that bad.

818
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,440
No. No. It's not.

819
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:33,757
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

820
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,680
Look at that thing.

821
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,246
It's like a womb.

822
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:40,956
Don't.

823
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:42,002
Hey, maybe there's a little man
in there...

824
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,884
who looks just like you,
but he's really good at running.

825
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,400
What are you talking about?!

826
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:46,636
It's just a thought.

827
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:47,876
You're gonna have to pop it.

828
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,240
No. No way.

829
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:52,806
Never pop
another man's pustule.

830
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,400
Well, I'll do it then.
Give me the needle.

831
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:55,761
That's the closest I could get.

832
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:58,522
It's fine. I sterilized it.

833
00:37:58,607 --> 00:37:59,642
In what?

834
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,806
It's sterilized.

835
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:05,765
OK, OK. Here we go.

836
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,956
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

837
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,646
Stick it in.

838
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:14,876
- Pop it!
- I can't!

839
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,400
- Why not?
- It's scary!

840
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:17,715
Give it to me.

841
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:18,762
Just do it slow!

842
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:19,882
- Do it-- Do it gently, OK?
- Yeah.

843
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,446
- Trust me.
- After three, OK?

844
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:22,642
- OK.
- One.

845
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,122
It's in it!

846
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:30,359
Get it out!

847
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:31,926
Bloody take it out!

848
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:33,360
- Hold still! Hold still!
- Get it!

849
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:42,162
I'm so sorry.

850
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,320
That's never happened before.

851
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,760
Oh! Oh!

852
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,042
I'm Catholic.

853
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,040
That was the second
most disgusting fluid...

854
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,355
I've ever had in my eye.

855
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,916
Who's that?

856
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:57,996
That's Mr G.

857
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,759
Get something nice on,
something respectable.

858
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:00,882
Where we goin'?

859
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,603
Every year,
literally hundreds of people...

860
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:25,997
are affected by acute
neurocortical emphasitis...

861
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,884
or Hapsburg Syndrome.

862
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:28,922
I see.

863
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,316
And how does the condition
manifest itself?

864
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,156
The syndrome
is characterized...

865
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,965
by a loss
of lower body function...

866
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,361
sporadic and often violent
outbursts of profanity.

867
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:47,438
And often chronic flatulence.

868
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,485
It's our aim to raise awareness
of the condition...

869
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,886
and, hopefully,
some funds to give...

870
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:56,559
some much-needed support...

871
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,603
to people such
as Mr Ghoshdashtidar here.

872
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,915
Mmm...

873
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:05,880
- Well, we think
that Mr Goshdashti--
- Ghosh!

874
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,844
- Ghoshtashtidar--
- Ghosh! Ghosh!

875
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:11,397
Ghoshtashtidar's condition
is very, uh, serious...

876
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:15,002
and warrants support,
and we'd be delighted...

877
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:19,638
for Mr Doyle to run
on behalf of acute neuro--

878
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:20,921
Acute neurocortical emphasitis.

879
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:22,440
- Or, uh...
- Hapsburg Syn--

880
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,961
Syndrome awareness. Yes.

881
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:27,362
OK.

882
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,080
We'll just need the charity's
registration number.

883
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,802
The what?

884
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,161
The registration number.

885
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:43,606
Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

886
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:45,325
Mmm.

887
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:46,556
- Look out!
- Oh!

888
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:47,875
Ohh!

889
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,480
Aw, hit by a wheelchair.

890
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,242
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

891
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:53,282
- It stings.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

892
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,322
- It stings.
- No, no, no, no!

893
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:55,726
Dennis, don't touch him.

894
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:56,762
- Can you stand?
- Oh, no!

895
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,997
- Are you OK?
- No. My leg's broken.

896
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:00,156
We are so sorry.

897
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,441
You-- Call an ambulance!

898
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,202
Oh, this can't be happening.

899
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,084
I was supposed to be running
the marathon in three weeks.

900
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,236
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:08,726
There were so many people
dependin' on me.

902
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,116
Charity people?

903
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,765
- Hmm?
- Yeah. God!

904
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,803
What charity people?

905
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,115
What do you think?

906
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:18,122
Nice.

907
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,402
Nicotine patch?

908
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:25,442
Applied.

909
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,677
- You been to the toilet?
- One and two.

910
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,596
You ready?

911
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:32,082
Ready.

912
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,402
One.

913
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:57,882
Ow.

914
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:58,922
- Two.
- Get up there.

915
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:01,043
# This is a jailbreak #

916
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:03,163
# This is a Thursday afternoon #

917
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,397
# But I didn't mean it #

918
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,842
- # I didn't mean it #
- Ow!

919
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:09,963
# I'd never get that far #

920
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,163
# My baby,
short breath wouldn't do #

921
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:14,203
# But you took it serious #

922
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,084
- # Took it so serious #
- Raise.

923
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,600
- No!
- No!

924
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,363
One, two...

925
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:32,119
One more! One more!

926
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:38,758
# Well, you accused me
of wearing movies in my eyes #

927
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,883
# But I still love you #

928
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:43,162
# Of course, I love you #

929
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:45,078
# And so I countered #

930
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,601
# You do the same, my Annie I #

931
00:42:47,687 --> 00:42:50,042
# You closed them so fast #

932
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:54,598
# And you closed them so tight #

933
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,165
- Hi, Dennis.
- Wha--

934
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,886
I saw your friend Gordon
this morning.

935
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:37,685
I will replace
anything he stole.

936
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,519
He told me
about his little bet.

937
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:40,562
Oh, yeah.

938
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:42,365
- Yeah. Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

939
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:44,278
So I made a crazy little bet
of my own.

940
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,119
Ooh. Who with?

941
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,560
With you, silly.

942
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:49,239
- We haven't made a bet.
- We're about to.

943
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,926
Here it is.

944
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:52,962
You finish the race...

945
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,322
I'll forgive
all the back rent you owe.

946
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:57,159
- And if I don't?
- If you don't finish...

947
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:58,566
you pack your bags
and you leave.

948
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:01,525
You go, and I finally get
some tidy tenants...

949
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:03,165
who pay their rent on time.

950
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:05,363
- Deal?
- No deal.

951
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:09,324
Hey, what are you--
Hey, give me that.

952
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:10,442
- Deal?
- Deal.

953
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:15,724
- Maya, if you think making--
- Maya?

954
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:17,206
Hey. Hello, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

955
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,720
How are you?

956
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,923
I've got something for you.

957
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:22,918
Ooh. It's not the spatula,
is it?

958
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:24,326
No.

959
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:30,922
Wow.

960
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,364
To help you be a good man.

961
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:37,922
I don't--

962
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:44,002
Thank you.

963
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:45,802
Wow.

964
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:53,003
Peter Perfect, a perfect palace.

965
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:55,123
Try saying that
when you're smashed.

966
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:58,040
- I will.
- # Lately #

967
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:02,245
# I been high-steppin' #

968
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,236
# I've got a lover #

969
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:09,478
- # Who just gets it for real #
- Hey. Hey, Dennis.

970
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,205
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

971
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,356
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

972
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,244
Wow, Libby.

973
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:16,726
You look, um...wow.

974
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:17,762
Thank you.

975
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:19,360
I know, right?
Never mind all this.

976
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:21,324
I'll take the view
I have right here.

977
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:22,556
Oh.

978
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:27,163
I'm Gordon, Libby's cousin.
Hello.

979
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:28,965
Gordon. Of course.
I've heard a lot about you.

980
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:30,446
Very nice to meet you.

981
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

982
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:33,845
Oh. I thought you said
he was an asshole.

983
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,722
- Dennis!
- Gordon.

984
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,320
- What?
- It's OK, Lib.

985
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:39,846
Libby, I got you
a birthday present.

986
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:41,201
Oh.

987
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:42,606
It's a CD.

988
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:44,279
I hope you don't have it,
'cause I don't have a receipt...

989
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,244
and I didn't exactly
get it in a shop.

990
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,999
Well, thank you, I think.

991
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:50,126
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

992
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:55,878
I'll show you, and, uh,
you can entertain Dennis.

993
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:56,922
OK.

994
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,316
That is if he doesn't mind
hangin' out with an asshole.

995
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:02,524
He was joking. I never
said you were an asshole.

996
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:04,563
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

997
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:07,642
Whit seems nice.

998
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:08,716
Yeah, he is.

999
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,275
Good-looking, friendly,
well-off, steady job...

1000
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,322
good with Jake...

1001
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,920
just like you got him
out of a catalogue.

1002
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,122
And what's your point?

1003
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,562
I ordered a pair of shoes
once from a catalogue.

1004
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,638
Gorgeous soft leather
ltalian loafers.

1005
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:20,876
They looked amazing,
but then they arrived...

1006
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,003
and I put them on,
and they hurt like fuck.

1007
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:24,315
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

1008
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,566
Wow.

1009
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:28,558
Hey, do you think it would
be weird if I took a bath?

1010
00:46:31,647 --> 00:46:33,365
Yeah, that would be weird.

1011
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:35,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

1012
00:46:36,047 --> 00:46:37,480
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1013
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,795
Cheers.

1014
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:39,922
Cheers.

1015
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,520
What do you think?

1016
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:45,598
I think I see a guy
peeing on your car.

1017
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:46,722
- What?
- Got you.

1018
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,798
Oh, very good.

1019
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:51,798
Actually, you see that?

1020
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:52,842
What?

1021
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,565
There. I'm talking
about St. Paul's Cathedral.

1022
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:55,921
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

1023
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:57,565
Currently my favourite spot
in London.

1024
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:58,762
You know why?

1025
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:00,883
Uh, is it because that's
where you first realized...

1026
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,116
how amazing you are?

1027
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,400
It's the finish line
for the marathon.

1028
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,516
Only two more days,
and I get to cross it.

1029
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,562
Can't wait.

1030
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,126
Me, too.

1031
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:12,243
Greatest feeling in the world,
finishing a distance race.

1032
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:14,477
I think you're really
gonna get a kick out of it.

1033
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:15,761
You don't think
I'm gonna finish, do you?

1034
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:16,836
No, I don't.

1035
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:17,882
Why not?

1036
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,685
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

1037
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,041
Actually requires
a couple of things...

1038
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:23,925
that, uh, forgive me,
but you don't seem to possess.

1039
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,235
I happen to have
a very nice pair...

1040
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:26,885
of running shoes now,
thank you very much.

1041
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:31,040
I'm talking about discipline
and perseverance.

1042
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:33,243
And all cute
little comments aside...

1043
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:35,241
there comes a point
in every race--

1044
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,045
it could be the fifth mile,
it could be the 25th--

1045
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:38,560
but, eventually,
you're gonna hit...

1046
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,444
what runners like to call
"the wall."

1047
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,801
And when you do...

1048
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:44,481
you won't be able to breathe
or think or even move.

1049
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:46,603
All you're gonna wanna do
is give up.

1050
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,120
And I have
a very strong feeling...

1051
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:50,323
that that's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1052
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:51,962
See, that's the difference...

1053
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:54,322
between getting a girl
like Libby...

1054
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:55,806
and keeping a girl like Libby.

1055
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:02,442
You good?
You need anything else?

1056
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:04,518
- No, I'm good.
- OK.

1057
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:15,560
# Love is sweet, they say #

1058
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,197
# Promises of tomorrow #

1059
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:30,005
# But the tighter you grip,
the faster you slip #

1060
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:33,682
# This much I know #

1061
00:48:35,087 --> 00:48:38,045
# Lately, I want everyhing #

1062
00:48:38,127 --> 00:48:40,800
# Every star tied to a string #

1063
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:43,720
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

1064
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:46,640
# The sweetest smile
I've ever seen #

1065
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:50,117
# A different song
in every room... #

1066
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:52,323
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
- That's OK.

1067
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,159
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
- Oh, man. It's just--

1068
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:55,760
It's just soda water, honestly.

1069
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:57,041
Should I not rub
your boob, then?

1070
00:48:58,047 --> 00:48:59,526
- Yeah.
- OK. Sorry.

1071
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:00,642
I can do the other one,
you know?

1072
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,683
'Cause I'm here, I might as well
just even it out.

1073
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:03,802
Sorry.

1074
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:07,920
So, you havin' a...
havin' a good time?

1075
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:11,116
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

1076
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:15,682
You've lost weight.

1077
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:16,995
Yeah, just a little bit.

1078
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,042
Yeah.

1079
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:19,526
You know, get on.

1080
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:22,565
Where's Jake?
I thought he was gonna be here.

1081
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:23,875
Uh, no.

1082
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,446
Whit thought that we'd have
a better time...

1083
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,358
if we got a sitter.

1084
00:49:27,447 --> 00:49:29,722
Oh. What did you think?

1085
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:35,526
I should get back.

1086
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:38,360
Libby, um,
I never actually thanked you.

1087
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:40,962
For what?

1088
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:44,483
Well, for just sort of
lettin' me back into your life.

1089
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,159
Jake's life.

1090
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:47,566
Yeah, well, you know.

1091
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:50,076
I mean, l-I wouldn't have
been surprised...

1092
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:51,964
if you just cut me off
completely, you know?

1093
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:53,366
Ugh, now you tell me.

1094
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:56,126
Well, no, I mean--

1095
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:57,401
No, he needs his dad.

1096
00:49:58,687 --> 00:49:59,722
Yeah.

1097
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:05,361
You were right, you know,
about me enterin' the marathon.

1098
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:07,517
It-- You know,
it was because I was...

1099
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,438
sort of trying to win you back
kind of thing.

1100
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:11,882
And I'd always kinda hoped
that maybe, we'd, you know...

1101
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,082
get back together and that...

1102
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:15,761
but, you know,
when I saw you with Whit--

1103
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:17,926
- Dennis.
- I know-- I know-- I know--

1104
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:20,965
I know it's the height
of hypocrisy, and I know--

1105
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:22,446
I know doin' this
isn't gonna change anything...

1106
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:24,836
or--or make anything better,
but, um...

1107
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:29,198
I'd just--
I'd settle for your respect.

1108
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:32,796
You know,
I'd settle for you smiling...

1109
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:35,242
when you thought about the time
that we had together...

1110
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,363
and not thinkin'
it was a waste of time.

1111
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:40,516
You know, I mean, I know...

1112
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:43,724
I didn't do you any favours
on that day, OK?

1113
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,526
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

1114
00:50:46,607 --> 00:50:49,485
But it was
only because I thought...

1115
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:52,161
spoiling your day was better
than ruining your life.

1116
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,885
Does that make any sense?

1117
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:00,841
You're such an idiot.

1118
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:07,361
Hey, I got you something.

1119
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:09,039
Oh, what is it?

1120
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:11,163
It's something
I think you don't have.

1121
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:12,885
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

1122
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:16,637
No, it's--
Well, it's only, you know...

1123
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:17,796
- Open it later on.
- OK.

1124
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,445
Happy birthday.

1125
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:20,880
- Thank you.
- No.

1126
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,282
Oh.

1127
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:45,763
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

1128
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,556
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

1129
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:51,717
Everyone, hi.

1130
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:52,762
Thank you for coming.

1131
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:54,326
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

1132
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:56,716
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

1133
00:51:56,807 --> 00:52:00,402
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

1134
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:04,563
Happy birthday.

1135
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:08,037
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

1136
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,281
In fact,
in a couple of days...

1137
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,756
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

1138
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:18,804
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

1139
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,401
of the same things
as success in love--

1140
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:23,876
passion, determination...

1141
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,606
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

1142
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:31,600
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

1143
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:32,961
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

1144
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:36,562
is that both love and running
require heart...

1145
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:38,683
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

1146
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:40,598
than any other person
I've ever known.

1147
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:43,247
So happy birthday, sweetie.

1148
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,401
Thank you all.

1149
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:52,999
Oh, trainers!

1150
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:56,401
I'm sorry. Can l, uh,
just see this for a second?

1151
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,047
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

1152
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:02,119
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

1153
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:05,996
I was wondering
if you would consider...

1154
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,361
becoming my partner?

1155
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:14,482
Oh, my.

1156
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,645
Libby, will you marry me?

1157
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,759
No, no, no, no.

1158
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,315
OK. Yes.

1159
00:53:35,407 --> 00:53:36,920
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1160
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,881
So beautiful.

1161
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:55,286
Just beautiful.

1162
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:57,082
Thank you.

1163
00:53:58,447 --> 00:53:59,562
Thank you, everybody.

1164
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:03,122
Crazy.

1165
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:05,162
What'd I miss?

1166
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:09,642
So...

1167
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,842
You bloody...poison.

1168
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:18,518
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

1169
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:21,201
you big American prick.

1170
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,357
# Our love has changed #

1171
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,920
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

1172
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,120
# And the only way to say it #

1173
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,759
# Is say it #

1174
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:41,726
# It's better #

1175
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:46,764
# I can't concede #

1176
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:53,161
# This way I feel #

1177
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,081
# For all the time
we spend together #

1178
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:04,638
# Forever just gets better #

1179
00:55:07,247 --> 00:55:10,284
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

1180
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:16,164
# You make things better #

1181
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:22,282
# And no matter
what the day is #

1182
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:27,918
# With you here, it's better #

1183
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,437
# I'll stand by you #

1184
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:39,841
# If you stand by me #

1185
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:45,203
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

1186
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,403
# 'Cause I believe it #

1187
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,803
# It's better #

1188
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:57,203
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

1189
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:03,077
# You make things better #

1190
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:14,675
Dennis!

1191
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,919
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

1192
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:23,205
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

1193
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:27,519
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

1194
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:33,675
You know, just--
If he heard it from you...

1195
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,327
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

1196
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:38,125
I take it the diet's off.

1197
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:42,404
Dennis, are you even listening?

1198
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:43,476
Dennis!

1199
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,080
What? You want--
You want me to tell Jake...

1200
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,317
what a--what a--
what a perfect guy Whit is...

1201
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:48,681
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

1202
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:50,246
in his new perfect life?

1203
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:52,602
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

1204
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:55,076
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

1205
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,237
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

1206
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:59,124
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

1207
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,243
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

1208
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:03,443
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

1209
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:05,438
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

1210
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,006
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

1211
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:09,043
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

1212
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:10,799
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

1213
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,639
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

1214
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:15,961
I'm not gonna run.

1215
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:17,002
What?!

1216
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:18,520
I said I'm not running.

1217
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:24,966
What do you mean,
you're not running?

1218
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:27,117
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

1219
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,366
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

1220
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:30,402
What did you think?

1221
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:31,886
She-- She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

1222
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,002
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

1223
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,600
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

1224
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,166
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

1225
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:38,238
I don't care any more!

1226
00:57:38,927 --> 00:57:40,485
- What about me?
- What about you?

1227
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:42,285
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

1228
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,925
That is not my problem!

1229
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,122
Quit it!

1230
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:47,356
I'm not the quitter.

1231
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,320
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

1232
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:56,681
- Let go!
- Ow!

1233
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:08,002
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

1234
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:11,477
Oh, enough!
Just-- Just stop for a minute!

1235
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,964
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1236
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:26,641
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

1237
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,002
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

1238
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:31,438
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

1239
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:33,119
# Unless, unless #

1240
00:58:33,207 --> 00:58:34,401
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

1241
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:35,442
# In my bones #
- No!

1242
00:58:35,527 --> 00:58:36,721
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

1243
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:37,956
# Of staying in control #

1244
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,198
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

1245
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:43,801
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

1246
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,400
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

1247
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:46,806
# I'm sorry I digressed #

1248
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:49,526
# lmpressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

1249
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:51,484
# Oh-oh #

1250
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:54,081
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

1251
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:57,204
# Oh-oh #

1252
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:59,960
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

1253
00:59:00,047 --> 00:59:01,560
That's what you always do!

1254
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,926
Run away!

1255
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:07,484
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1256
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:13,160
Hey, what the--

1257
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,605
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

1258
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:16,642
Gordon called.

1259
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,683
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

1260
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,166
- Yeah, but--
- But, what?

1261
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:21,521
Are you running or not?

1262
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:22,562
- No, but--
- So there you go.

1263
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:23,796
- Wait--
- Sorry, Dennis.

1264
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,445
A bet's a bet. You're out.

1265
00:59:26,087 --> 00:59:28,476
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

1266
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:29,886
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

1267
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:32,356
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

1268
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,598
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

1269
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:37,643
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

1270
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:39,160
- Look--
- Always running away...

1271
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,680
never running
in the right direction.

1272
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:41,722
Yeah, but, oh--

1273
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:44,321
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

1274
00:59:44,407 --> 00:59:46,841
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

1275
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:48,679
- Yes, but--
- "But, but, but!"

1276
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:51,759
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

1277
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:54,520
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

1278
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:58,043
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

1279
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:00,638
It's all your fault!

1280
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:15,595
- Hi.
- Hi.

1281
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:18,759
You-- You havin' a yard sale?

1282
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,603
No. Where's Libby?

1283
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:23,120
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

1284
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:26,643
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

1285
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,400
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

1286
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,042
Best man won.

1287
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,885
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

1288
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:40,002
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

1289
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:41,042
No, why? I--

1290
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:42,355
Well, is he here, Whit?

1291
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:43,596
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

1292
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:44,642
- Libby?
- Jake!

1293
01:00:44,727 --> 01:00:45,796
Libby, what is--

1294
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:47,240
- What did you say to him?!
- l-- What are you--

1295
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:48,476
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

1296
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:49,716
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

1297
01:00:49,807 --> 01:00:50,842
He just ran out.

1298
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,077
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

1299
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,520
Jake ran away!

1300
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:00,122
Jake!

1301
01:01:01,607 --> 01:01:02,642
Jake!

1302
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,042
Gordon!

1303
01:01:06,647 --> 01:01:07,682
Gordon!

1304
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:10,525
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

1305
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,438
- What?
- He's run away!

1306
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:13,482
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

1307
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:15,319
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

1308
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,556
Where would he go?

1309
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,400
Hiya, snot-face.

1310
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:18,441
Yeah, he's fine.

1311
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:21,642
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

1312
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:22,921
OK.

1313
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,475
Is she mad at me?

1314
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:28,285
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

1315
01:02:32,087 --> 01:02:33,645
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

1316
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,525
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

1317
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:37,722
Why not?

1318
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:39,957
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

1319
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,605
and he's got a ponytail...

1320
01:02:41,687 --> 01:02:43,678
and she likes him now.

1321
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:45,598
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

1322
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:47,245
Uh-huh.

1323
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:50,561
Jake 'n Bake...

1324
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:51,875
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

1325
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:54,162
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

1326
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:56,477
Things much worse than this.

1327
01:02:56,567 --> 01:02:58,762
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

1328
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:00,678
Why not?

1329
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:02,997
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

1330
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,076
You know,
when you start running...

1331
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,122
the problem's still there.

1332
01:03:05,207 --> 01:03:07,721
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

1333
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:10,719
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

1334
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:12,684
Is that what you do, Dad?

1335
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:17,481
Dad?

1336
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,122
Dennis!

1337
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:23,401
Dennis!

1338
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:24,522
Gordon!

1339
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:28,282
Gordon!

1340
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:31,959
- Found him?
- Yes.

1341
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:33,799
Good. You can't stay here.

1342
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:35,522
Gordon!

1343
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:36,562
What?!

1344
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,399
I'm running.

1345
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,166
Well, come on up then.

1346
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:45,363
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

1347
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,846
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

1348
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:47,996
See, the trick is...

1349
01:03:48,087 --> 01:03:50,362
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

1350
01:03:50,447 --> 01:03:51,402
I read it in Cosmo.

1351
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:52,476
How are the legs? Not too tight?

1352
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,000
No. No, they're fine.

1353
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:55,202
Have you got everyhing
you need?

1354
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,596
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

1355
01:03:57,687 --> 01:03:59,439
- Yes.
- Oh.

1356
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:08,446
I'm not really in the mood.

1357
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,006
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

1358
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:12,476
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

1359
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:13,886
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

1360
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:15,195
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

1361
01:04:15,287 --> 01:04:16,242
is nipple chafing.

1362
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:17,521
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

1363
01:04:17,607 --> 01:04:18,801
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

1364
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,764
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

1365
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,405
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

1366
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:26,562
Anything else?

1367
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:27,716
Have you got a pillow?

1368
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,957
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

1369
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:36,358
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

1370
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:39,405
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

1371
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:41,079
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

1372
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,998
I never need to be anywhere.

1373
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:48,686
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

1374
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:51,725
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

1375
01:04:51,807 --> 01:04:53,001
OK.

1376
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:56,242
Night.

1377
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:57,362
Love you.

1378
01:05:04,007 --> 01:05:04,962
A very good morning to you.

1379
01:05:05,047 --> 01:05:06,844
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

1380
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:08,838
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

1381
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:11,122
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

1382
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,845
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

1383
01:05:12,927 --> 01:05:14,326
We certainly have.

1384
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,557
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

1385
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:18,683
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

1386
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:20,598
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

1387
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:23,201
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

1388
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:24,515
And as we can see,
race officials...

1389
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:26,484
are already busy
at the starting line...

1390
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,035
with the start
less than an hour away.

1391
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:36,799
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1392
01:05:36,887 --> 01:05:38,206
Taxi!

1393
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:41,040
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

1394
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:42,082
Wait!

1395
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:43,122
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

1396
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:44,401
# I'm gonna be the one #

1397
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,159
# To make you understand #

1398
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:47,475
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

1399
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:49,842
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

1400
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:53,326
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

1401
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,806
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

1402
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,684
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

1403
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:58,644
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

1404
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,879
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

1405
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:04,435
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

1406
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,995
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

1407
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:09,442
Watch it!

1408
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:11,919
- ldiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1409
01:06:13,687 --> 01:06:14,642
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

1410
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,160
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

1411
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:17,999
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

1412
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:19,156
are the men from Kenya.

1413
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:22,603
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

1414
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,440
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

1415
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:30,282
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

1416
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:31,720
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

1417
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,241
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

1418
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:35,396
Have you got any money?

1419
01:06:35,487 --> 01:06:37,205
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

1420
01:06:37,287 --> 01:06:39,118
That is a shame.

1421
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,322
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1422
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:44,318
Look, look. This is a 19...

1423
01:06:44,407 --> 01:06:47,717
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

1424
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:48,762
That's not too shabby.

1425
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:49,802
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him--

1426
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,002
Hey, it's an investment.

1427
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:53,521
Gordon, thank you.

1428
01:06:53,607 --> 01:06:54,722
I'll see you later then.

1429
01:06:57,007 --> 01:06:58,360
# Keep on runnin' #

1430
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,675
Hey, good luck!

1431
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,519
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

1432
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:03,677
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

1433
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,041
They had a balanced breakfast...

1434
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:08,358
precise physical
and mental preparation.

1435
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:11,519
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

1436
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:13,518
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

1437
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:14,926
or a complete idiot.

1438
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:17,316
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

1439
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:24,080
Over here. To me, to me.

1440
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,556
That's it. Be careful.

1441
01:07:26,647 --> 01:07:27,716
That's an antique.

1442
01:07:28,487 --> 01:07:30,478
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

1443
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:31,716
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

1444
01:07:31,807 --> 01:07:33,081
What do we love
about these days...

1445
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,317
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

1446
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:36,999
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

1447
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,239
from the elite over there
to the--how should we put it--

1448
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:42,806
not so elite.

1449
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,161
That's Dennis!

1450
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:48,879
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

1451
01:07:50,407 --> 01:07:51,556
Double or nothing?

1452
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:52,602
Yeah, right.

1453
01:07:52,687 --> 01:07:56,202
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

1454
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,518
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

1455
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,562
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

1456
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:04,602
Yeah.

1457
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:06,200
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

1458
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:08,847
You, too. How are your nipples?

1459
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:11,322
Great.

1460
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:22,162
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

1461
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:23,441
to go now,
and the officials are--

1462
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:25,483
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

1463
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:28,400
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

1464
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:30,079
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

1465
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:32,397
- it's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

1466
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,523
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

1467
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:47,881
Why am I always the tortoise?

1468
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:48,922
A bet's a bet.

1469
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:49,962
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1470
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,400
- Pardon me.
- All right.

1471
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:54,760
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

1472
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:56,200
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

1473
01:08:56,887 --> 01:08:58,081
I mean, uh...

1474
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,317
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

1475
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:01,396
now, do you?

1476
01:09:01,487 --> 01:09:03,364
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

1477
01:09:03,447 --> 01:09:04,482
No, Dennis.

1478
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,722
This is now.

1479
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:14,762
All right.

1480
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:20,446
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

1481
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:22,040
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

1482
01:09:22,127 --> 01:09:23,924
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

1483
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:25,360
And they're off, Chris.

1484
01:09:25,447 --> 01:09:27,039
Yet another great marathon...

1485
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:28,845
getting under way
here in London.

1486
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:33,278
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

1487
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:35,562
of crowded London streets...

1488
01:09:35,647 --> 01:09:37,319
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

1489
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,362
Thanks.

1490
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:40,005
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

1491
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:41,042
Oh, I'm glad.

1492
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:42,116
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

1493
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:43,879
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

1494
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:45,400
- What?
- Have a good race.

1495
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:57,922
Isn't it enough?

1496
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:58,962
What?

1497
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:01,436
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

1498
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:02,801
I just think it's high time
you realize...

1499
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:04,400
that it's over, sir.

1500
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:05,886
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

1501
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:08,162
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

1502
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,680
You better
slow down there, chief.

1503
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:10,995
You got a long way to go.

1504
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:14,443
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

1505
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,642
Yes, I like it.

1506
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:17,558
Run, fat boy, run!

1507
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:23,400
I can lose weight...

1508
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,318
but you'll always be
an asshole.

1509
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,282
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

1510
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,561
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

1511
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:31,036
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

1512
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,355
What a beautiful view of the...

1513
01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:40,525
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

1514
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:43,201
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

1515
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:46,276
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

1516
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,959
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

1517
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,082
coming up from the back.

1518
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,162
Mom!

1519
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:55,805
It looks like these two boys...

1520
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:57,718
are running a race
of their own here today.

1521
01:10:57,807 --> 01:10:58,956
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

1522
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,116
among the serious runners.

1523
01:11:00,207 --> 01:11:01,799
Not something
you'd really expect...

1524
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,206
at this stage in the race.

1525
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:04,436
Oh. Sorry, sir.

1526
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,162
There's a man down.

1527
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:09,002
Sorry.

1528
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,727
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

1529
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:14,559
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1530
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:16,922
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

1531
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:18,442
But he looks good, doesn't he?

1532
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,676
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1533
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:21,883
...setting a new world record.

1534
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:27,682
What are you trying to prove?

1535
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:29,280
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

1536
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:30,516
I'm not doing this for Libby.

1537
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:31,596
Yeah, right.

1538
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,676
You're ridiculous, dude.

1539
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:35,076
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

1540
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:45,042
Oh!

1541
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:51,842
Daddy!

1542
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:53,724
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

1543
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:00,521
It does look very serious.

1544
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:01,642
We're getting
some more information--

1545
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:20,598
Stay down! Stay down!

1546
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,366
Where do you think you're going?

1547
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:39,041
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

1548
01:12:39,127 --> 01:12:41,118
Because I am
the assistant coach.

1549
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:43,802
Yes!

1550
01:12:43,887 --> 01:12:46,162
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

1551
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:50,322
And that looks really painful.

1552
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,726
Looks like
this runner's race day...

1553
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:53,718
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

1554
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,081
Yeah, absolutely tragic--

1555
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:56,646
Mom, do something!

1556
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:58,160
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

1557
01:12:58,247 --> 01:12:59,566
to the leaders
in the female race.

1558
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:09,602
Shit.

1559
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,005
Huh?

1560
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:41,207
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

1561
01:13:41,287 --> 01:13:43,642
when I say, "Give me my money."

1562
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:45,445
Five grand, please.

1563
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:49,758
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

1564
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:50,882
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

1565
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:53,839
Uh...I don't have it.

1566
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:57,435
Would you excuse us a moment?

1567
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,483
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

1568
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:05,886
Are you family?

1569
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:07,480
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

1570
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:09,000
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

1571
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:11,716
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

1572
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,320
registered by that name.

1573
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,967
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

1574
01:14:16,047 --> 01:14:17,366
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

1575
01:14:17,447 --> 01:14:19,324
Well, he's just arrived.

1576
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:20,965
- Libby?
- Whit?

1577
01:14:21,047 --> 01:14:22,241
How'd you know I was here?

1578
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,646
What are you doing here?

1579
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,797
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

1580
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:28,321
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

1581
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:29,920
Guys, can we-- Can we just--

1582
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,237
Fellas, can we--
Look, I'm a patient, please.

1583
01:14:32,327 --> 01:14:33,840
Just one-- Find me!

1584
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,406
Easy, easy! Ow!

1585
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:37,364
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

1586
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:38,402
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

1587
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:40,478
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

1588
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:44,599
No, wait. Look...Vincent.

1589
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:46,200
Wait-- Wait-- What?

1590
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:47,481
Wait. Wait a tick.

1591
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:54,797
Not so bloody fast, mate.

1592
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:56,115
Who the hell are you?

1593
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:57,765
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

1594
01:14:57,847 --> 01:14:59,519
Your friend is a man of honour.

1595
01:14:59,607 --> 01:15:00,562
What, Vincent?

1596
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:04,322
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

1597
01:15:04,407 --> 01:15:05,362
I don't understand.

1598
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:08,245
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

1599
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:09,680
One second.

1600
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:11,120
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

1601
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,401
I could sue him
for everyhing he has...

1602
01:15:12,487 --> 01:15:14,398
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

1603
01:15:14,487 --> 01:15:17,559
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

1604
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:19,239
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

1605
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:20,885
Well, you weren't there, OK?

1606
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:22,923
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

1607
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,157
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

1608
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:28,000
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

1609
01:15:28,087 --> 01:15:31,204
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

1610
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:33,118
No, but you can watch me
control it.

1611
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:37,040
Libby? Where are you?

1612
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:38,355
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

1613
01:15:38,447 --> 01:15:39,402
No, he's not here.

1614
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:40,476
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

1615
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:41,920
I mean, he's not here.

1616
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:44,000
Well,
where the hell is he then?

1617
01:16:13,087 --> 01:16:15,647
All right.
It's still-- It's on.

1618
01:16:15,727 --> 01:16:16,842
The race is still on.

1619
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:20,247
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

1620
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,442
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

1621
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:23,358
- right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

1622
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:25,199
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

1623
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:27,676
- Vincent?
- showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

1624
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:30,998
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

1625
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,998
and he's also causing
some major traffic--

1626
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:35,955
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

1627
01:16:36,047 --> 01:16:38,083
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

1628
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:40,122
What!

1629
01:16:41,527 --> 01:16:43,358
Wait! What are you doing?!

1630
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:45,961
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

1631
01:16:47,807 --> 01:16:48,762
All right!

1632
01:16:48,847 --> 01:16:49,962
Hello, there...

1633
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,844
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

1634
01:16:51,927 --> 01:16:53,155
Who the hell are you?

1635
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:55,880
You beauty, come on!

1636
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:58,839
And as the sun
sets over London...

1637
01:16:58,927 --> 01:17:00,485
we're still looking
into the identity...

1638
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:03,240
of that mysterious runner.

1639
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,716
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

1640
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:07,525
The only concrete thing
we do know...

1641
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:11,043
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

1642
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:14,718
Good news, Mr Bloom.

1643
01:17:14,807 --> 01:17:17,002
No rupture, no ligament damage.

1644
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:18,645
Oh, that's great.

1645
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:19,716
Jake, please?

1646
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:22,480
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

1647
01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:24,356
Are you sure, doctor?

1648
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:25,926
Jake, please.

1649
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,077
It's, uh, like, uh...

1650
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:29,122
What is it you runners say?

1651
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:30,640
You hit the wall.

1652
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,085
No, no, that--
That's not possi--

1653
01:17:35,887 --> 01:17:37,115
God damn it, will you stop...

1654
01:17:37,207 --> 01:17:39,198
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

1655
01:17:40,727 --> 01:17:41,796
God.

1656
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:50,242
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

1657
01:17:50,327 --> 01:17:52,045
Top story, the Nike River Run.

1658
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,924
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

1659
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:56,362
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

1660
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,005
about our mystery runner.

1661
01:17:58,087 --> 01:17:59,725
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

1662
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:00,842
has just caught up with him.

1663
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:01,882
Excuse me. Sorry.

1664
01:18:01,967 --> 01:18:03,116
Will you slow down, please?

1665
01:18:08,927 --> 01:18:10,565
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

1666
01:18:10,647 --> 01:18:12,399
Stop! Stop!

1667
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,715
Everyone out. Get out.

1668
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:15,962
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

1669
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:17,162
Hey!

1670
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:18,396
Just go away!

1671
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:20,396
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

1672
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,715
Knock him over.

1673
01:18:21,807 --> 01:18:23,559
No, invalid. Off-side.

1674
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,119
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

1675
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,879
I want my money now!

1676
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:29,480
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

1677
01:18:29,567 --> 01:18:30,556
You are a winner!

1678
01:18:30,647 --> 01:18:31,682
I want my money now!

1679
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:34,122
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

1680
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:35,162
Clear off!

1681
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:37,442
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

1682
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:40,678
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

1683
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:42,405
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

1684
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:45,559
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

1685
01:18:45,647 --> 01:18:48,719
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

1686
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,240
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

1687
01:18:50,327 --> 01:18:51,646
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

1688
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,001
What an inspiration.

1689
01:18:53,087 --> 01:18:55,681
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

1690
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:57,598
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

1691
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,723
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

1692
01:18:59,807 --> 01:19:01,479
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. I--

1693
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,159
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

1694
01:19:03,247 --> 01:19:04,919
- by the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

1695
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,486
- Honey, can we just--
- but particularly by

1696
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:07,522
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

1697
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:08,562
would you mind just giving us...

1698
01:19:08,647 --> 01:19:10,080
a little peace with the TV,
please?

1699
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:11,522
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

1700
01:19:11,607 --> 01:19:12,562
The whole of London...

1701
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,842
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

1702
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,645
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

1703
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,846
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

1704
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:23,882
Oh.

1705
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,685
I'm the assistant coach.

1706
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:27,325
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

1707
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:30,479
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh--

1708
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:31,522
- Ghosh...
- Gah--

1709
01:19:31,607 --> 01:19:33,199
OK, just call me John.

1710
01:19:34,447 --> 01:19:37,245
It was me who discovered
his potential.

1711
01:19:41,647 --> 01:19:42,966
I can't breathe.

1712
01:19:43,727 --> 01:19:44,921
My head's gonna explode.

1713
01:19:45,007 --> 01:19:46,565
He's not gonna make it.

1714
01:19:46,647 --> 01:19:48,205
I-- I have to stop.

1715
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:49,606
- I have to stop this.
- No.

1716
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:50,756
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

1717
01:19:50,847 --> 01:19:51,996
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

1718
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,486
What? How much further?

1719
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:56,798
It-- It's a little, tiny--
Nine miles.

1720
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:01,485
OK. OK.

1721
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:17,561
Oh, no.

1722
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:19,682
What?

1723
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,241
He's hit it.

1724
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:42,645
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

1725
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:44,322
Jakey.

1726
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,398
-...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

1727
01:20:46,487 --> 01:20:47,920
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

1728
01:20:48,007 --> 01:20:50,601
it looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

1729
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:52,598
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

1730
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:54,484
on basically one leg...

1731
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:58,003
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

1732
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:00,078
Unbelievable!

1733
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:31,280
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

1734
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:35,557
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

1735
01:21:35,647 --> 01:21:36,921
I'm not the quitter!

1736
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:38,963
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1737
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,117
Go on, run away!
Run away!

1738
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:42,720
That's what you always do!

1739
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:46,802
Dennis!

1740
01:21:49,087 --> 01:21:50,122
Dennis!

1741
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:54,840
Dennis?

1742
01:22:02,647 --> 01:22:04,046
Oh, I don't believe this.

1743
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,446
Yeah, boy, yes!

1744
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:07,006
He's still going!

1745
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:10,124
Go on, you beautiful man!

1746
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:12,084
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

1747
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:14,727
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

1748
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:16,126
in the drama of it all.

1749
01:22:17,127 --> 01:22:20,039
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

1750
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:21,162
And here it is.

1751
01:22:21,247 --> 01:22:22,600
It appears
that the runner there...

1752
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:25,838
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

1753
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:29,476
In fact, if we look at it again
here...yes!

1754
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:31,637
He deliberately trips him!

1755
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:33,240
Bastard!

1756
01:22:33,327 --> 01:22:34,555
Apologies again, uh...

1757
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:36,524
That didn't--
That's not what happened.

1758
01:22:36,607 --> 01:22:38,040
That is--
That-- That didn't happen.

1759
01:22:38,127 --> 01:22:39,685
I can't believe this.

1760
01:22:39,767 --> 01:22:40,722
I don't believe it, either.

1761
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:41,762
I don't understand that.

1762
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:42,802
What is that?

1763
01:22:42,887 --> 01:22:44,240
Honey. Honey...

1764
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:48,286
That angle makes it look, but--
He tripped me.

1765
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:51,124
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

1766
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:53,801
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

1767
01:22:55,727 --> 01:22:56,955
Go, Dennis!

1768
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:01,761
I can't believe this.

1769
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:03,041
Come on, honey.

1770
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:04,446
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

1771
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:06,315
What are you--
Are you kidding me?

1772
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:07,522
Honey.

1773
01:23:09,007 --> 01:23:10,156
All right, look,
I'm just-- I'm not--

1774
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:11,680
I'm not myself, OK?

1775
01:23:12,807 --> 01:23:14,445
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

1776
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:15,960
Work has not been...

1777
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:18,564
It's, uh...

1778
01:23:18,647 --> 01:23:19,602
It's just this city, you know?

1779
01:23:19,687 --> 01:23:21,598
It's just--
It's really hard here for me.

1780
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:23,200
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

1781
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:25,243
and it's like the food and the--
and the--and the ca--

1782
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:26,646
I just don't-- I don't
know what happened to me.

1783
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:28,365
I don't know what--
It's just this place.

1784
01:23:28,447 --> 01:23:29,516
It's this place, you know?

1785
01:23:29,607 --> 01:23:32,440
And if we-- I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

1786
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:34,040
- Move?
- To Chicago.

1787
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:35,321
What?

1788
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:36,556
Too soon?

1789
01:23:36,647 --> 01:23:37,602
Oh!

1790
01:23:37,687 --> 01:23:39,166
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh--

1791
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,441
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

1792
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:43,318
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

1793
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:44,601
You can't be serious.

1794
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,485
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

1795
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:50,561
Nobody's perfect.

1796
01:23:51,687 --> 01:23:52,642
Libby.

1797
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,319
Libby! L--

1798
01:23:54,407 --> 01:23:55,396
What a shithead.

1799
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:56,522
Jake.

1800
01:23:57,807 --> 01:23:59,365
Hey. I know you feel bad.

1801
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:00,436
I know you're
in incredible pain...

1802
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:02,836
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

1803
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:04,722
Come on.

1804
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:21,915
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1805
01:24:22,007 --> 01:24:25,079
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1806
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:29,240
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1807
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:31,921
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

1808
01:24:32,007 --> 01:24:33,645
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

1809
01:24:33,727 --> 01:24:36,082
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

1810
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,919
for myself and my cameraman.

1811
01:24:38,007 --> 01:24:40,760
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

1812
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:41,802
but for Dennis Doyle...

1813
01:24:41,887 --> 01:24:44,355
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

1814
01:24:58,647 --> 01:24:59,682
Come on, Dennis!

1815
01:25:00,647 --> 01:25:01,682
Good work, Dennis!

1816
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,246
Hey! Move along!

1817
01:25:07,327 --> 01:25:08,282
That's it. You're there.

1818
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:10,005
You're sixty feet.

1819
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:11,361
Fifty-- Fifty-eight feet.

1820
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:13,516
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

1821
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:14,562
and you're there. Come on.

1822
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:17,639
That's my man! My man!

1823
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:27,076
Come on, come on!

1824
01:25:35,647 --> 01:25:36,682
Dennis, come on.

1825
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:40,837
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

1826
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,042
Don't get up.

1827
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:45,122
Dennis!

1828
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:47,116
Dennis, come on, get up.

1829
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,686
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

1830
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,319
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

1831
01:25:51,407 --> 01:25:52,442
Get up.

1832
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:06,962
Hello, Dennis?

1833
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:13,044
- Dennis!
- Dad!

1834
01:26:18,327 --> 01:26:20,557
Dennis!

1835
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:21,682
Dad!

1836
01:26:38,127 --> 01:26:39,799
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

1837
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:44,997
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

1838
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:49,842
Yeah!

1839
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:55,282
Dad!

1840
01:26:55,927 --> 01:26:58,395
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

1841
01:26:58,487 --> 01:27:00,239
Don't go to Chicago.

1842
01:27:00,327 --> 01:27:01,840
Dad, you won!

1843
01:27:06,127 --> 01:27:07,401
He's done it!

1844
01:27:07,487 --> 01:27:09,125
He's actually done it!

1845
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:10,276
This morning...

1846
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:13,723
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

1847
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:16,275
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

1848
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:18,085
Oh, yay.

1849
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,361
And look at that!

1850
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:20,562
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

1851
01:27:20,647 --> 01:27:22,478
collapses into the arms of--

1852
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:24,922
I think it's backwards here--
the woman he loves!

1853
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:27,396
And, look! He's got a son!

1854
01:27:27,487 --> 01:27:29,443
I didn't know he had a son!

1855
01:27:29,527 --> 01:27:31,040
Did you know he had a son?

1856
01:27:41,847 --> 01:27:43,565
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

1857
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:58,046
- Hi.
- Hi.

1858
01:27:58,127 --> 01:27:59,765
Jake, your dad's here!

1859
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:01,326
How's it goin'?

1860
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:02,635
- Pretty good.
- Good.

1861
01:28:02,727 --> 01:28:04,001
- You?
- Yeah.

1862
01:28:04,087 --> 01:28:05,486
Yeah, not bad.

1863
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:06,636
You still running?

1864
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:08,604
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

1865
01:28:12,207 --> 01:28:13,765
Yeah. So...

1866
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:18,955
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

1867
01:28:21,327 --> 01:28:23,682
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

1868
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:27,402
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

1869
01:28:27,487 --> 01:28:28,681
I'll, um...

1870
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:29,961
I'll sp-- I'll ca--
I'll speak to you later.

1871
01:28:30,047 --> 01:28:31,560
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

1872
01:28:31,647 --> 01:28:32,716
Bye, Mom.

1873
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:33,762
Bye. I'll see you later.

1874
01:28:33,847 --> 01:28:34,962
Bye.

1875
01:28:44,927 --> 01:28:46,804
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

1876
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:48,718
and have some dinner
with me next week?

1877
01:28:53,607 --> 01:28:54,562
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

1878
01:28:54,647 --> 01:28:55,796
Yeah.

1879
01:28:55,887 --> 01:28:57,161
Uh...huh?

1880
01:28:57,247 --> 01:28:58,726
I mean, wow.

1881
01:28:58,807 --> 01:28:59,876
It'd be nice.

1882
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,764
Yeah. Well, it would be.

1883
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:07,605
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

1884
01:29:07,687 --> 01:29:08,676
OK.

1885
01:29:08,767 --> 01:29:10,200
Don't know why I did that.
It's just--

1886
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:13,001
OK. Ready?

1887
01:29:13,087 --> 01:29:14,122
Yeah.

1888
01:29:16,487 --> 01:29:18,239
Hello!

1889
01:29:18,327 --> 01:29:19,806
Hello, Dennis!

1890
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:22,561
Mr G.

1891
01:29:23,087 --> 01:29:24,964
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

1892
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:26,605
I was just doing my spin class.

1893
01:29:26,687 --> 01:29:27,642
It's great fun, isn't it?

1894
01:29:27,727 --> 01:29:30,082
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

1895
01:29:36,087 --> 01:29:37,725
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

1896
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:38,956
Come on! Jake!

1897
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:40,605
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

1898
01:29:40,687 --> 01:29:42,996
He has the ball! He's clear!

1899
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:44,406
Dad! Pass it!

1900
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:46,722
Dad is clear!

1901
01:29:46,807 --> 01:29:48,479
Give it!

1902
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:50,319
I'll give you one, too.

1903
01:29:50,407 --> 01:29:52,398
OK, let's go. Good game.

1904
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,079
Jake to Mr G.

1905
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:56,286
Yeah, thank you very much.

1906
01:29:56,367 --> 01:29:57,436
Take over, Mr G.

1907
01:29:58,647 --> 01:29:59,796
There you go, Mr G.

1908
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:03,366
All right, I'm gonna--
Completely illegal move there.

1909
01:30:03,447 --> 01:30:05,199
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

1910
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:06,606
Runs with him all the way.

1911
01:30:06,687 --> 01:30:08,166
Dad, that's illegal!

1912
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:13,842
But that's not all.

1913
01:30:14,527 --> 01:30:16,438
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

1914
01:30:16,527 --> 01:30:18,438
Iet alone run,
but he keeps going...

1915
01:30:18,527 --> 01:30:21,246
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

1916
01:30:21,327 --> 01:30:22,316
And you know how he did that?

1917
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:23,556
You know what he said
was the one thing...

1918
01:30:23,647 --> 01:30:24,682
