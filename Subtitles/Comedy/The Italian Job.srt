- Yeah, listen. There.

If it's the Bank of England, it's out.

Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy of the country.

184
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:44,886
Exactly, Freddie.
Now, tell Bridger this is a foreign job

of payments.

186

that Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

218
00:21:56,006 --> 00:22:00,010
- Well, I've apologised, Bridger.
- And so you should have.

219
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,972
You are not doing your job properly.
Her Majesty's prison is there

but to prevent people from getting in.

00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:04,805
Yes, well,
not to put a too fine point to it,

331
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,141
he was discovered in the lounge.

332
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:14,356
- Doing what, Miss Peach?
- Where?

333
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:18,819
- In the lounge.
- Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

334
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:20,654
What?

335
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:21,863
Oh!

336
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:24,825
Something quite obscene with Annette.

337
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:34,835
- A net?
- Annette. She was terrified, of course.

338
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,420
- Naturally.
- Yes, well. Would you like some tea?

339
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,383
Tea. Would you like some?

340
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,427
- You're very kind. Yes, please.
- Good.

341
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,513
Excuse me a minute.

342
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,183
Annette?

343
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:55,937
Annette, would you like to serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

344
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:02,402
Oh, I shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

345
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:10,326
This is Annette.

346
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,124
Professor Peach,
do you see what I'm getting at?

347
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:20,295
Hmm. Your brawn, my brain.
I'm not stupid, you know.

348
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:25,592
It's cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

349
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:28,887
- Flagpole?
- The flagpole in the yard.

350
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:33,725
I mean, I know
if there was a convex mirror up there,

351
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,604
27 degrees vertical,
42 degrees horizontal,

352
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:40,523
I could see
straight into Matron's bedroom.

353
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,735
Of course, somebody else
would have to be up the pole to fix it.

354
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,570
I couldn't do it meself.

355
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,656
It's cooperation, you see?
She's a big woman, you know?

356
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:52,243
Here, wait till you see them Italian birds.

357
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,246
- Are they big? I like them big.
- They're enormous.

358
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,208
- Really?
- Very, very, very big.

359
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,377
Would we wear stockings
over our heads?

360
00:31:01,586 --> 00:31:04,547
- No need for you to.
- I'd like that.

361
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,884
I could steal one of Matron's, couldn't I?

362
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,386
We'll have you out of here in no time.

363
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,764
Of course, I wouldn't want
to get Matron into trouble.

364
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,558
Not that way, anyway. She's big. Big.

365
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:18,727
Look out the window, Professor.

366
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,729
- Do what?
- Look out the window at my car.

367
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,439
- Come on.
- Car?

368
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,108
- What car?
- Down there.

369
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,987
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING)

370
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,874
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

371
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:46,547
We are about to do a job in Italy,

372
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,298
and I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

373
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,925
And I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

374
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,929
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

375
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:57,933
Now, you all know Bill.
He's just done three years in Parkhurst.

376
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:01,270
He's as honest as the day is long,
and you can trust him.

377
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:05,399
Second, the getaway.
This will be done in three Mini Coopers.

378
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:10,529
And they will be driven by Chris,
Tony and Dominic.

379
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:11,947
Hello, chaps.

380
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:13,282
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:15,284
All right, all right, all right, all right.

382
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,161
These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

383
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,955
faster than anyone else on four wheels.

384
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,166
Remember that.

385
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,127
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

386
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,422
The coach will be driven
by William here,

387
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,634
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

388
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,388
Now we come to the professor here.

389
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:42,477
The professor is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

390
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:47,148
So I don't want anyone putting him down
because he's a man of reading.

391
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:52,945
I know he's got some very funny habits,
but make him feel at home.

392
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,782
He's very important to the operation.

393
00:32:55,907 --> 00:33:01,204
Finally, and very quickly, I would like
to introduce you to all the lads

394
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,247
who are going to do the job with me.

395
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:10,254
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco, Yellow,

396
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:14,258
Camp Freddie you all know.

397
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:20,765
Roger, Dave and Lorna
will be in reserve with three fast cars

398
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,725
in case anything goes wrong.

399
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,935
Right?

400
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,021
Now, it's a very difficult job

401
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:32,526
and the only way to get through it is,
we all work together as a team.

402
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:36,363
And that means you do everything I say.

403
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:42,119
Here's Charlie.

404
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,080
Charlie.

405
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:52,379
Putting the jib on.

406
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,339
Well,
don't just stand there doing nothing.

407
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:56,174
- Get on with something.
- I am, Charlie. I'm seeing...

408
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,051
Well, get on with it, then.

409
00:33:58,552 --> 00:33:59,553
Rozzer?

410
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:01,096
Rozzer's having trouble
with his differential there.

411
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,640
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Hurry up.

412
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,978
Dippers for the Continent.
Just changing the...

413
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:09,104
- The other way round.
- Right.

414
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:10,939
- Are they quartz-iodide?
- Yeah, that's right, governor.

415
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:12,399
All right.

416
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,819
We couldn't afford the gold yet,
so we're using lead, Charlie.

417
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:17,737
Will it take the weight?

418
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,865
- Take the weight.
- Yeah, all right, Charlie.

419
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,826
- Will it take the weight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Charlie.

420
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,786
Mind your face, Charles.

421
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:28,248
- How you doing? All right?
- Okay, but I don't like the colour.

422
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:31,917
It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Carry on.

423
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,087
CHARLIE: Lorna!

424
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,637
Does he really need all this equipment?

425
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,139
He says he does.

426
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:00,780
No.

427
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:04,033
You're meant to use your brakes, Chris.

428
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,410
Terribly sorry, Charles.

429
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:10,581
- How many cars have we got left, Bill?
- A couple, Charlie.

430
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,958
Send the next one up.
Let's hope he gets it right.

431
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,252
(BILL WHISTLING)

432
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:35,563
What do you mean they're written off?

433
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:39,609
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
I promise there'll be no more.

434
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:45,490
Five, four, three,

435
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:49,369
two, one, go.

436
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:04,175
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

437
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,327
How's your new house, Fred?

438
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:34,456
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

439
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,333
My pleasure.

440
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:04,402
<i>Beckerman's done his homework
very well.</i>

441
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,989
<i>The getaway is possible, but not easy.</i>

442
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:11,743
<i>For a start, the attack has to be made
in this square</i>

443
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:17,081
<i>and it must be completed
inside of three minutes.</i>

444
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,584
<i>Apart from knocking over
a few old dears with their carrycots,</i>

445
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:20,710
<i>I think we can manage it.</i>

446
00:37:21,294 --> 00:37:24,339
Now, you all understand
what you've got to do.

447
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,508
Okay? Now, Bill.

448
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:30,886
Uh...

449
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:34,932
Oh, yeah, the transporters
will move in here and here,

450
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:39,353
- and they'll block off the main drag.
- Right. Roger.

451
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,898
Arthur and Lorna park
the three fast cars here

452
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:45,484
in case anything goes wrong and
we gotta make a quick getaway, right?

453
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,152
Correct. Now, it's 12:10.

454
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,780
The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

455
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:54,033
and will be forced slowly
towards the centre.

456
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:58,746
<i>It's the old over-and-under routine.</i>

457
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:02,374
<i>First we go over the traffic
and through the museums</i>

458
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:08,213
<i>and then under again
and up into this church.</i>

459
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,716
<i>The difficulty is here.</i>

460
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:16,972
<i>If the police can get a car
onto that bridge</i>

461
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:21,601
<i>before we've got across it,
we're done for,</i>

462
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:25,355
<i>but it's a gamble we've got to take.</i>

463
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:46,126
Now, the bullion wagon is here.
Right? Dominic.

464
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:48,920
We get into the Minis behind the piazza.

465
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:50,380
Right. Arthur.

466
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:53,675
We drive the Land Rover
into the square.

467
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,180
- Piazza, Arthur. Piazza.
- Sorry, Charlie. Piazza.

468
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:03,101
- Now, the Land Rover is in the piazza.
- And we come in right behind target.

469
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:04,936
That's it. Wallop.

470
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,106
<i>But since the bridge
will be blocked by traffic,</i>

471
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:12,235
<i>the only possible way out
is across the weir,</i>

472
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,780
<i>which runs along
by the side of the bridge.</i>

473
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:19,951
<i>I've only one comment to make
about that, Mr Bridger.</i>

474
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,121
<i>Good luck.</i>

475
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:49,147
Keats,
I think we'd better arrange a funeral.

476
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:15,674
- All ready to go, Croker?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

477
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:18,009
The plans have been worked out
to the last detail?

478
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:19,845
Yes, Mr Bridger.

479
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,806
- Everything taken care of?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

480
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:25,934
Well, Croker,
you've overlooked one thing.

481
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:29,062
The Mafia. They'll be waiting for you.

482
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:36,695
BRIDGER: In every shot of Camp
Freddie's film there's a Mafia man.

483
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,031
If they were on to Beckerman,
they'll be on to us.

484
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,325
CHARLIE: You're not
thinking of calling it off?

485
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:44,870
BRIDGER: As long as you know
what you're taking on, Croker.

486
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:49,623
- Yes, the Mafia.
- Yes, the Mafia.

487
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:56,881
Croker, you are about to take
a half a ton of gold,

488
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,591
in broad daylight,
from under their noses.

489
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:01,968
They won't take kindly to that.
That's why they killed Beckerman.

490
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:07,599
- It's a question of prestige, is it?
- Yes, Croker, it's a question of prestige.

491
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:10,018
If you go through with this,
you've got to win.

492
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:13,313
If you muck it up,
don't ever think of coming back here,

493
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,273
except in your coffin.

494
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,156
MINISTER: We're ready
