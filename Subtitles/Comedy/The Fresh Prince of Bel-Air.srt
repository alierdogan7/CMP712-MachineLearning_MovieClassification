and he wants me
to put my ass out for him

gonna forget his friends...

813
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,824
that helped him when
he was in trouble, and he
ain't gonna forget who didn't.

814
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:33,331

<i>I would've told Corky,</i>
<i>''Yeah, it's cool, ''but</i>--

For now, he gonna pay up front,
'til all this blow over.

<i>He be callin'you soon,</i>
