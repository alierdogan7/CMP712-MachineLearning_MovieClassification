00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:03,015
Hi, I'm Andre Nowzick.

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:04,820
I'm a successful
plastic surgeon.

3
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:07,756
But I'm also a
single human person.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,303
Experience Andre.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,868
(grunts)

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,737
I sweat like a man.

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,230
And I smell like... Ow!

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,293
(deep voice): I work
the street like a man.

9
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:24,028
I order my steak
rare like a man.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,999
(chimp screeches)

11
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:30,717
Taco?! What are you doing?

12
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:32,978
TACO: Say, "I operate
on women like a man."

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,047
I'm in surgery.

14
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,020
Are those boobs? Gross!

15
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:37,223
Are you eating in here?

16
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,325
I'm just snacking. Chip?

17
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,331
No. Get out of here!

18
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,458
Experience Andre.

20
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,085
RUXIN: Anyway, after this
Sukkot fiasco, does not look

21
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:55,767
like baby Jeffrey will be
attending a Jewish preschool.

22
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,796
But I think I found
a better solution.

23
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,683
I'm going to hire
some live-in help.

24
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,351
KEVIN: Wait.

25
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,821
You're not talking about...
Indeed, I am.

26
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:05,891
I am getting an au pair.

27
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,359
PETE: Oh, no.

28
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,460
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:09,628
Son of a bitch.

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,498
I've always wanted an au pair.

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,333
I want a kid so I can
have an au pair.

32
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:15,535
Even the words au pair, they just, like...
Au pair!

33
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:17,236
Son of a...
don't make that face.

34
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:18,637
Au pair!

35
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,905
(grunts) Pair!

36
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:23,476
Ooh, hey, ooh!

37
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,714
Hello, champion of the dating video.
Whoo!

38
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,682
All due to this guy right here, Mr.
Taco.

39
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:31,550
I gotta ask.

40
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:34,252
Have you just been getting a
bunch of numbers from dudes?

41
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,787
Guys, online dating is a
perfectly acceptable way for

42
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,392
those society has shunned to get together
and ideally colonize another planet.

43
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,329
No, no, I'm not judging on the concept,
just mortified by the execution.

44
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,433
Yeah, what's up with the images
of the animals having sex?

45
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:50,335
Is that...
Those were subliminal messages.

46
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:52,804
Taco, they can't be subliminal
if they're on for 20 seconds.

47
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:53,638
That's just obvious.

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,608
No, obvious would be human beings having
sex, and Andre made me take those

49
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,375
images out.

50
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:01,545
My video went viral, and the women
have been coming in in droves.

51
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:02,312
Really?

52
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:06,483
Look what the cat dragged in...
if the cat was into dragging in chicks.

53
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:09,353
If we're looking at photos, I got
some photos of, au pair applicants.

54
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:09,787
All right.

55
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,888
Let's do a little...
Let's do a little photo-off here.

56
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,756
Let's see what we got.

57
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,623
See what we got.

58
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,491
All right, well, let's
get rid of any man.

59
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:16,492
That is not the point.

60
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:17,226
Let me see.

61
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,463
We need someone who can cook, must be
good with kids, must know how to read.

62
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,533
Actually, I have the same requirements,
but, uh, I don't care that much about

63
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:23,867
the reading.

64
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,035
Okay, this is the one.

65
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,437
Ashley R. This is my girl.

66
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,838
This is... Oh, my God.
She's adorable.

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,908
I'm going to go on the record and say
that I think this is a bad idea.

68
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,477
You're inviting trouble
into your house.

69
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,911
Temptation.

70
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,613
I'm not gonna try
to sleep with her.

71
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:35,547
Have you seen my wife?

72
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,381
She's crazy hot.

73
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:37,049
Yeah, super hot.

74
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,053
Yeah, I need Jeffrey to get used to
hanging out with super hot women.

75
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:43,723
I don't want my kid going to the park and
getting his dong cleaned by some uggo

76
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:44,758
with a 'stache.

77
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,826
She's in high school.

78
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,395
Your au pair needs an au pair.

79
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:48,829
Oh, double au pair.

80
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:50,431
Double au pair!

81
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,933
Ooh, ooh!

82
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:53,067
What are we doing?

83
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,070
I don't know how this
thing's gonna play out.

84
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,272
She's gonna be in the house
24/7, always around.

85
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,307
JENNY: Ruxin is
going to hate that.

86
00:02:59,309 --> 00:02:59,741
I know.

87
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:00,909
I feel bad for the girl.

88
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,777
She cute?

89
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,412
What? No.

90
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:04,813
Wow. She must be really hot.

91
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:06,315
Why, why would you say that?

92
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,684
Because you said, "What? No."

93
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:09,251
What?

94
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,020
You say that every time you lie.

95
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:13,723
What? No. No, I don't.

96
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:17,628
Please. The night you proposed, I said,
"What's the bulge in your pocket?"

97
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,764
And you said, "What?
I've got testicular cancer."

98
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,332
I was trying to be romantic.

99
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,533
Super romantic.

100
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,503
Um, I need a little help from
you with my lineup, whether I

101
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,871
should play Ochocinco...
No, I can't, babe.

102
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:28,404
Why?

103
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:29,572
I have to get back to work.

104
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,041
Sorry.
But really quick though..

105
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:32,608
Yes?

106
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,910
My laptop is moving super slow.

107
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:37,046
Have you been looking
at porn on my computer?

108
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,348
What? No. Ooh.

109
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,851
Right. Thank you.

110
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,786
You know what? Ask me again.

111
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,456
Give me, give me the question
one more time. Come on.

112
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,925
Kevin, have you been looking
at porn on my computer?

113
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:52,379
What? Oh, wow, wow.

114
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,401
See?

115
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,354
ALL: Hi!

116
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:58,018
What are you doing here?

117
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,861
Oh, I was just checking out
houses in the neighborhood.

118
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,532
There's nothing around
here you can afford.

119
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,566
I thought we had plans.

120
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,134
I never make plans
with you, Andre.

121
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,336
Just lending you that bike
pump you were asking for.

122
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,639
Oh, the one with my name on it
that's in my garage normally?

123
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm just here to check
out the au pair.

124
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,941
I appreciate your
transparency, Taco.

125
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:13,710
I also need to use your urinal.

126
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,745
We don't have a urinal, just
a shower that you pee in.

127
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:16,145
What?

128
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:19,381
Look, you guys can all hang out here
and watch the games, but that is it.

129
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,916
Do not blow this for me, okay?

130
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:21,750
Okay.

131
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:22,917
Fine.

132
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,688
ASHLEY: Come on, do you want to
play the fishing game with me?

133
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,856
Cool. Got this one?

134
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,157
You don't want to play?

135
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,492
Sorry. Am I distracting you?

136
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:31,660
ALL: No, no.

137
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:32,828
I don't mean to.

138
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,163
Football's just
like white noise.

139
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,999
You want to watch, like,
MTV or something?

140
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,866
Oh, that'd be cool.

141
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:38,467
Mommy?

142
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:39,468
<i>16 and Pregnant</i> marathon.

143
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,770
Oh, my gosh, I love
<i>16 and Pregnant!</i>

144
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,005
<i>My friend was on
that last week.</i>

145
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:43,973
<i>It was really cool.</i>

146
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,176
<i>This guac is delicious,
by the way.</i>

147
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,710
<i>Oh, my gosh, thank you.</i>

148
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,179
<i>Thank you.
I never made it before.</i>

149
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,781
<i>And so I just threw in, like,
some asparagus, and I hope</i>

150
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:52,616
<i>you don't mind.</i>

151
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:53,384
<i>That's unique.</i>

152
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:53,917
<i>It's delicious.</i>

153
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,552
<i>(baby fussing)</i>

154
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:56,487
<i>I think he's, I think
he's actually happy.</i>

155
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:57,621
<i>Yeah, don't, don't shake him.</i>

156
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:59,123
<i>(laughs)</i>

157
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,124
<i>SOFIA: Okay, let's go.</i>

158
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:00,658
<i>Sleepy time.</i>

159
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,625
<i>Yes, It's time to go.</i>

160
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,661
<i>Why don't you take him? Yeah.</i>

161
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:04,428
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

162
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,728
<i>No!</i>

163
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,596
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

164
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>We were having fun!</i>

165
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,933
<i>You can put him down, Sofia.</i>

166
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,670
<i>Gotta say, guys, good
vibes on the au pair.</i>

167
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:13,638
<i>Got an A-plus in the
au pair department.</i>

168
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,139
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>

169
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>And she's pretty.</i>

170
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,141
<i>Pretty?</i>

171
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,444
<i>I think the word you're
looking for is "plain."</i>

172
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,613
<i>You know, because she has those
big, fat meat earlobes.</i>

173
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:21,580
<i>Yeah, yeah, the meat lobes.</i>

174
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,148
<i>Yeah, meat lobes.</i>

175
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,915
<i>Really pointy elbows.</i>

176
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,217
<i>Bet you if you checked her out,
you'd find out she's got</i>

177
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,552
<i>a big old retrograde
uterus in there.</i>

178
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,420
<i>You know, my sister has
a retrograde uterus.</i>

179
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:31,656
<i>I didn't mean...
That's why you can't get a girl.</i>

180
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:33,891
<i>And then you wonder why
you're dating online.</i>

181
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,793
<i>That's a choice, Sofia.</i>

182
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,861
<i>Really? Retrograde uterus?</i>

183
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,029
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

184
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,397
<i>Just something between
earlobes and uterus.</i>

185
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:41,931
<i>You took it all!</i>

186
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,001
<i>You leave me out there
like an island.</i>

187
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:46,536
<i>The only thing I could say was
uterus after elbows over here.</i>

188
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,739
<i>Look, I know what you guys
are trying to pull here.</i>

189
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,674
<i>I think you're laying on
the charm a little thick.</i>

190
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>No!</i>

191
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:51,909
<i>I thought it was subtle.</i>

192
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,012
<i>We're trying to, you know,
help you out a little bit.</i>

193
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:54,846
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

194
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:55,981
<i>Let me make this very clear.</i>

195
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,717
<i>Ashley's here to touch baby
Jeffrey's dinger, none of yours.</i>

196
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,885
<i>I'm looking at you, Taco.</i>

197
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,921
<i>I already have two au pairs
touching my dinger.</i>

198
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,556
<i>I don't need a third.</i>

199
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:04,423
<i>You know what?</i>

200
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:07,393
<i>As a favor to you, Ruxin, I
am going to power down--</i>

201
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:08,127
<i>boof-- the charm machine.</i>

202
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,395
<i>Was that the charm machine
that you just shut down?</i>

203
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:10,729
<i>Yeah.</i>

204
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,564
<i>Why does it have a crank on it?</i>

205
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,499
<i>'Cause, uh, you know,
it's old school.</i>

206
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,533
<i>Is it steam powered?</i>

207
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:16,334
<i>It's hydraulics.</i>

208
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:18,135
<i>By the way, guys, don't
touch the guacamole.</i>

209
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:18,969
<i>Is it gross?</i>

210
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,004
<i>It's nasty.</i>

211
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,004
<i>Oh, it looks disgusting.</i>

212
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,406
<i>Oh, shut up. Shut up.</i>

213
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:23,140
<i>Here we go.</i>

214
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:24,575
<i>San Diego's about to score.</i>

215
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:27,144
<i>My boy, Matthews, give
me those points.</i>

216
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,547
<i>Uh, your boy, Matthews is
sitting on the bench.</i>

217
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,883
<i>Norv Turner just took
him out of the game.</i>

218
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,151
<i>My boy Tolbert coming out.</i>

219
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,152
<i>There we go!</i>

220
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:35,954
<i>And just fall into the goal.</i>

221
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:36,655
<i>Yes!</i>

222
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,156
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

223
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:39,825
<i>That's his third
touchdown of the day.</i>

224
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,826
<i>Three yards? Are you kidding?</i>

225
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:43,429
<i>The guy is vulturing
all my points.</i>

226
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,164
<i>Vulturing's the way to go, man.</i>

227
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,399
<i>Minimum effort,
maximum results.</i>

228
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,566
<i>(squeals like a vulture)</i>

229
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,834
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

230
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,036
<i>Ryan Matthews is
getting the job done.</i>

231
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,172
<i>And that guy gets
all the glory.</i>

232
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>Not fair.</i>

233
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,908
<i>Oh, you want to talk about fair, Mr.
Eight-way trade?</i>

234
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,775
<i>Oh, don't bring this up.</i>

235
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:57,776
<i>Payback's a bitch, huh?</i>

236
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:00,112
<i>You know what's fair is Jenny not
being on your team anymore.</i>

237
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,980
<i>Where... why all of a sudden
you're coming at me?</i>

238
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:02,914
<i>'Cause you suck.</i>

239
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,650
<i>She is not on my team...
You're not even...</i>

240
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:09,120
<i>(everyone talking at same time)</i>

241
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,723
<i>Watch this, watch this! Oh!</i>

242
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,825
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

243
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:14,993
<i>And congratulations. Hey.</i>

244
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:17,729
<i>Even if you don't win this week,
you're a great guy, and</i>

245
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,498
<i>you're going to have a
great week next week.</i>

246
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,400
<i>Friendship is the most
important thing that's ever</i>

247
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:21,934
<i>happened to me.</i>

248
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:23,869
<i>I love hats with words on them.</i>

249
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,703
<i>Aw, thanks, pal.</i>

250
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,739
<i>I just wanted to make
sure you guys were okay.</i>

251
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:27,740
<i>You... you don't need anything.</i>

252
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:28,741
<i>You know what?</i>

253
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:30,810
<i>More guacamole or...
The guacamole has been incredible.</i>

254
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:31,611
<i>We would love some more.</i>

255
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:33,580
<i>It did not make my
stomach sick at all.</i>

256
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,849
<i>That's a first for me, so great.
I'm...I'm learning.</i>

257
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:36,750
<i>Okay. I'll be right back.</i>

258
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:37,918
<i>All right.</i>

259
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,619
<i>Great. Bye.</i>

260
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,954
<i>Bye, Ash.</i>

261
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,155
<i>What was that?</i>

262
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:42,990
<i>Andre, I thought you were
turning off the charm machine.</i>

263
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,158
<i>I know.</i>

264
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,760
<i>It went on accidentally.</i>

265
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:47,962
<i>Okay. Great. Guys?</i>

266
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:48,862
<i>You're good?</i>

267
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:49,430
<i>Yeah.</i>

268
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:50,164
<i>Just go grab a drink.</i>

269
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:50,798
<i>Do you need money?</i>

270
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,432
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

271
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,166
<i>No. We don't need...
No, we don't need money.</i>

272
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,734
<i>All right, just don't go crazy.</i>

273
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:55,434
<i>Have fun.</i>

274
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:56,001
<i>Not long.</i>

275
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:56,702
<i>I have money.</i>

276
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:58,370
<i>Okay.
Want to go to the strip club?</i>

277
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,972
<i>No. I'm not going...
It is nice to catch up, brother.</i>

278
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:02,541
<i>This is not catching up, Taco.</i>

279
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,877
<i>Catching up is when two parties
have actually done something.</i>

280
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,777
<i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

281
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:06,545
<i>You don't do much.</i>

282
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,480
<i>You guys still doing
missionary Wednesdays?</i>

283
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,749
<i>Oh, I can't believe
I told you that.</i>

284
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,519
<i>Whoa. Look at the twins.</i>

285
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,355
<i>They're not twins, Taco.</i>

286
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,323
<i>Do they even look like sisters?</i>

287
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,391
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

288
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,592
<i>Excuse me?</i>

289
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:19,860
<i>Whoa.</i>

290
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,129
<i>Taco, that's Matthew Berry.</i>

291
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,963
<i>Mr. Sunshine?</i>

292
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,766
<i>Matthew Berry, you dummy.</i>

293
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,134
<i>Matthew Berry, 
the Talented Mr. Roto.</i>

294
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:28,636
<i>Matt Damon's here?</i>

295
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:32,974
<i>Taco, Matthew Berry, the ESPN
Fantasy Football expert.</i>

296
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,476
<i>I send you his podcast every week.
Don't you listen to it?</i>

297
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,744
<i>I don't listen to you.</i>

298
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,646
<i>I need to win this year.</i>

299
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,448
<i>That guy right there, he's
going to help me win.</i>

300
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,617
<i>Matthew Berry is the prettiest
girl in this bar, and</i>

301
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,752
<i>I'm going to go hit on him.</i>

302
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:46,553
<i>Hello?</i>

303
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:47,721
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

304
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,155
<i>You've been married for a while.</i>

305
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,490
<i>You don't know how to do this.</i>

306
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,891
<i>Dude, you stay here,
play it cool.</i>

307
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:52,658
<i>Okay.</i>

308
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,060
<i>When he goes to the bathroom,
follow him in there,</i>

309
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>I'll offer him some weed.</i>

310
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,497
<i>What are you... Gah, oh... What...
now... Can I get a beer?</i>

311
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,566
<i>Compliments of the
gentleman over there.</i>

312
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:02,300
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

313
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,901
<i>Hello, you.</i>

314
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,436
<i>(laughing) Thank you.</i>

315
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:05,937
<i>I'm Matthew.</i>

316
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:06,938
<i>Hey, Matthew, big fan.</i>

317
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,938
<i>I'm, uh, Kevin.</i>

318
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
<i>Nice to meet you, Kevin.</i>

319
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:09,841
<i>Appreciate this.</i>

320
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,108
<i>Yeah. Oh, no problem at all.</i>

321
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,976
<i>My pleasure.</i>

322
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,178
<i>I'm sure you get a lot of people

<i>Every once in a while...
That's not me. That's not my</i>

327
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,186
<i>If I was that guy, I'd be, like,
"Oh, is LaGarrett Blount</i>

328
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,454
<i>a flash in the pan?</i>

329
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:24,755
<i>Or is he...
or, you know, the real deal?"</i>

330
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:25,756
<i>Actually, I don't think so.</i>

331
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,125
<i>I... I have a good
Blount stat for ya.</i>

332
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,826

00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,328
<i>I know you get it all
the time, you know.</i>

334
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,829
<i>No worries.</i>

335
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

336
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:32,531
<i>I didn't mean to cut you off.</i>

337
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,667
<i>You said something about LaGarrett Blount.
I... I... I</i>

338
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:35,768
<i>interrupted you.</i>

339
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,137
<i>What do I do if my defense
is playing my quarterback?</i>

340
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,607
<i>I mean, how do I handle
a situation like that?</i>

341
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,843
<i>Is Kevin Kalb a top-ten quarterback in...
in... Well, actually...</i>

342
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,577
<i>Because I'm thinking about...
Gentlemen. Hi.</i>

343
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:45,712
<i>No touching. Creeps him out.</i>

344
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:46,479
<i>Great.</i>

345
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:46,980
<i>Hi.</i>

346
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:47,880
<i>Taco, Matthew Berry.</i>

347
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:49,148
<i>Taco, I'm Matthew.</i>

348
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,150
<i>So you get paid to give
fantasy football advice?</i>

349
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:51,817
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

350
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:52,551
<i>I do, actually.</i>

351
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,152
<i>I'm very lucky.</i>

352
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:53,785
<i>You know what?</i>

353
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:54,619
<i>I should do that, too.</i>

354
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:55,587
<i>No you shouldn't.</i>

355
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:56,655
<i>I won my league in 2006.</i>

356
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,922
<i>Nice. Congrats.</i>

357
00:09:57,924 --> 00:09:59,557
<i>When was your last title?</i>

358
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,794
<i>I, uh, what... what... Uh, it was...
it was the year...</i>

359
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:04,928
<i>No, no, he never won.</i>

360
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,364
<i>I don't know why you
didn't remember that.</i>

361
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>I'm sorry. I come close
so many years in a row.</i>

362
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,835
<i>No, no. He never even made it to the finals.
I don't know.</i>

363
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:13,472
<i>All right. Why don't you...
You okay?</i>

364
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:14,506
<i>That's, uh, that's tough.</i>

365
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,908
<i>You have no idea what I
go through, Matthew.</i>

366
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,709
<i>They make fun of me.</i>

367
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,645
<i>They say hurtful things about
me and my manhood and...</i>

368
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,914
<i>Oh, yeah, and the worst
stuff behind his back.</i>

369
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,050
<i>All right. I... I... I...
I think I get it.</i>

370
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,184
<i>Listen, I'm here to help.</i>

371
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:27,386
<i>This is what I do for a living.</i>

372
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:29,188
<i>So over the season, just
give me a call or an email.</i>

373
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,956
<i>Just shoot it real quick, and, uh...
</i>

374
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,823
<i>No, no, no. He's fine.</i>

375
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:32,691
<i>You put your hand down.</i>

376
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,425
<i>Ow.</i>

377
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:35,027
<i>Uh, listen, I didn't
want to insult you.</i>

378
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:35,728
<i>Yeah, no.</i>

379
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,896
<i>Uh, yeah, I'll just...
I'll hang onto this, see if...</i>

380
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,665
<i>I don't know if I'll even
ever really need it.</i>

381
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,533
<i>All right. But, uh, Kevin...
Hey.</i>

382
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,200
<i>...thanks for the beer.</i>

383
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,435
<i>All right.</i>

384
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:44,069
<i>Taco, nice meeting you.</i>

385
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:44,903
<i>Yeah.</i>

386
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:45,603

387
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:46,471

<i>What the tits?</i>

492
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,534
Ruxin, big news.

493
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:46,521
I have a date with
Matthew Berry.

494
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:49,056
We were trading emails back and
forth, and we're going to

495
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,158
get together for some drinks.

496
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,492
Can you believe this?

497
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:52,827
Why are you here?

498
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,097
'Cause I don't really want to tell
Jenny about my date with Matthew.

499
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:56,831
So lie to her.

500
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,700
No way. She...
She'll read me like a book.

501
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,600
She knows.

502
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:00,401
So?

503
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:03,471
So I need you to teach
me how to be a liar.

504
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,973
You don't need to whisper.

505
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,107
We're at a law firm.

506
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,775
Lying is encouraged here.

507
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,610
Look, I am not
your guy for this.

508
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,578
You need a low-level
maintenance liar like Pete.

509
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,713
No, I have never
been married before.

510
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:16,482
Yeah, I definitely
own my own home.

511
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:17,916
No. This isn't a cold sore.

512
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm the guy who you come to when you're
ready to perjure yourself to protect an

513
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,488
Australian mining consortium.

514
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,458
Ruxin, you are the best
worst person I know.

515
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,125
Thank you.

516
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:32,330
I am very flattered and insulted by that.
So... All right.

517
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,333
I have to run some
errands this afternoon.

518
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:35,534
Don't hit my desk, okay?

519
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,870
This came over on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

520
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:40,506
<i>Really? Oh, you're good.</i>

521
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:41,674
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

522
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,677
<i>Did I get this chocolate stain on there?
Absolutely not.</i>

523
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,146
<i>I don't even eat chocolate.</i>

524
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,981
<i>So you're going to fix
it for me for free?</i>

525
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:52,452
<i>Maybe starch the collar, too.</i>

526
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,687
<i>I don't know why I haven't
been losing any weight.</i>

527
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,090
<i>I've been exercising,
staying away from the bar.</i>

528
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,792
<i>I haven't eaten chocolate
in, like, a month.</i>

529
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:02,094
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We can't replace this for you.</i>

530
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,596
<i>These are little bite marks.</i>

531
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,831
<i>I mean, maybe your son was
chewing on the phone.</i>

532
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,699
<i>I don't have a son.</i>

533
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,402
<i>If you must know, I
work at an orphanage.</i>

534
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,671
<i>This child's parents vanished two
years ago in a parasailing</i>

535
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:13,104
<i>accident.</i>

536
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,708
<i>I can bring him in here, and
you can tell him about the</i>

537
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,511
<i>crushing loneliness that he's going
to feel not having a parent.</i>

538
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:24,518
<i>Uh, no. I... I can...
I'll get you another one right away.</i>

539
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,453
<i>God, that was exhausting.</i>

540
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,855
<i>You never told the truth once.</i>

541
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,323
<i>I don't how you do it.</i>

542
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,658
<i>When you're faced with your own
deception, you need to buy</i>

543
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,692
<i>yourself some time.</i>

544
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:34,494
<i>Were you just looking
at that waitress?</i>

545
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,361
<i>What?</i>

546
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:36,529
<i>What? Uh... You look away.</i>

547
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,663
<i>What? No.</i>

548
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:38,931
<i>You immediately seem guilty.</i>

549
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,667
<i>You need to look that person dead
in the eyes and repeat the</i>

550
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:42,468
<i>question.</i>

551
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,137
<i>Did I just look at that waitress?
Absolutely not.</i>

552
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,538
<i>Then you flip it on them.</i>

553
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,641
<i>But what does that say about you?
What's going on with you today?</i>

554
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,877
<i>It hasn't been the easiest day,
I mean, Ellie's got a...</i>

555
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,511
<i>Oh, you just did it.</i>

556
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,879
<i>You... you flipped it around.</i>

557
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:58,817
<i>I didn't...
Think of tonight as a dress</i>

558
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,386
<i>rehearsal for the perfect date.</i>

559
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,089
<i>Yeah, yeah.
But what is this date for exactly?</i>

560
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:06,893
<i>To impress her, so she'll eventually,
you know, have sex with me.</i>

561
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,862
<i>Why don't you just have sex
with her when you meet her?</i>

562
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,863
<i>You can't just have sex with
a girl when you meet her.</i>

563
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,331
<i>It's like a three-step process.</i>

564
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,700
<i>I'm picking them up.
I'm taking them out to a nice dinner.</i>

565
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,402
<i>We're going to go see some
hot jazz or, you know...</i>

566
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,171
<i>Oh, yeah. Then you have sex with
her there so you don't have</i>

567
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,173
<i>to go back to her place
and have sex...</i>

568
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:23,109
<i>No. I'm not going to have sex
with her at the jazz place.</i>

569
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:25,545
<i>Why? The jazz place
doesn't have a bathroom?</i>

570
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:26,713
<i>No. It has a bathroom.</i>

571
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,881
<i>Uh, look, just engage...
I can't tell where my</i>

572
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,849
<i>conversation skills are if you're
not engaging with me, all</i>

573
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:31,316
<i>right?</i>

574
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:32,317
<i>I... I understand that.</i>

575
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,119
<i>But why aren't you
inside of me right now?</i>

576
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:36,588
<i>I'm not going to be inside...
Whoa. Hi.</i>

577
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,723
<i>I don't mean to interrupt.</i>

578
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:38,990
<i>But are you guys ready to order?</i>

579
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,725
<i>Actually, that is a
great question.</i>

580
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:42,861
<i>That's the number one question
I have tonight, which</i>

581
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:44,362
<i>is wine. Is that too stuffy?</i>

582
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:45,629
<i>I have a whole wine list.</i>

583
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,396
<i>Okay.</i>

584
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,666
<i>Why don't you just order
what Pete ordered?</i>

585
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:49,533
<i>He's doing fine.</i>

586
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:53,504
<i>Pete... He vultured my date.</i>

587
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,272
<i>He vultured my date.</i>

588
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:56,474
<i>Go get it, Pete.</i>

589
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:57,675
<i>Who's Pete?</i>

590
00:16:57,677 --> 00:17:00,578
<i>He's a friend of ours who's going
to have sex with Andre's date.</i>

591
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,313
<i>What do you think
about skydiving?</i>

592
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,415
<i>Hi. Vanessa E. Remember me?</i>

593
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,583
<i>No.</i>

594
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:07,385
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

595
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:10,622
<i>Well, interestingly enough,
Vanessa and I have a shared</i>

596
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:11,590
<i>interest in rock climbing.</i>

597
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:12,590
<i>Yeah.</i>

598
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:13,558
<i>But you need to be careful.</i>

599
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,292
<i>You almost fell.</i>

600
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,527
<i>Well, you saved me.</i>

601
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,728
<i>Rock climbing.</i>

602
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,897
<i>Wow, what a great
first date idea.</i>

603
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>Where'd you get that, you vulture?
You come in right when</i>

604
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,968
<i>I'm about to score on the one-yard
line, you vulture my date.</i>

605
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,371
<i>You're the Mike
Tolbert of my life.</i>

606
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,505
<i>I will call you, Vanessa E.</i>

607
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,807
<i>Well... Yeah, not tonight.</i>

608
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,611
<i>Going to be a little late, so...
</i>

609
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:33,979
<i>Taco, we're going!</i>

610
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,679
<i>No, no.</i>

611
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,882
<i>I'm going to stick around and
date Nikki in the bathroom.</i>

612
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:41,586
<i>Why, yes, Matthew Berry, I can
meet you whenever you like.</i>

613
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:42,353
<i>(screams)</i>

614
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,589
<i>Hey.</i>

615
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,356
<i>Hey.</i>

616
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:45,957
<i>Hi.</i>

617
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,526
<i>You pulled in, like,
ten minutes ago.</i>

618
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,126
<i>What are you doing?</i>

619
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:49,695
<i>Have you been on the
phone this whole time?</i>

620
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:55,500
<i>Wha... Um... Have I been on
the phone the whole time?</i>

621
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:56,601
<i>Absolutely.</i>

622
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,069
<i>With my work.</i>

623
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:01,472
<i>It's just an important case, but,
you know, enough about me.</i>

624
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:02,073
<i>Hmm.</i>

625
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,641
<i>How was your day at work today?</i>

626
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:04,709
<i>You know what?</i>

627
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,344
<i>It was kind of miserable.</i>

628
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:06,911
<i>Oh.</i>

629
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,013
<i>I have these new clients, and they
just have no idea what they</i>

630
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:09,647
<i>want.</i>

631
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,318
<i>So we saw, like, 20 houses, and
they were all awful, you know.</i>

632
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,103
<i>Thank you, Rux... Ruxin.</i>

633
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,459
Hello?

634
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,150
Dr.
Andre Nowzik for two, please.

635
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,630
And, uh, McArthur, table
for two, I believe.

636
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:25,498
What the hell?

637
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,065
Hello.

638
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,667
How did you know
about this place?

639
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:28,402
Pete told me.

640
00:18:28,404 --> 00:18:28,935
Pete.

641
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:30,270
He's been bogarting everything.

642
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,472
Look, that date in there, I
want it to go really well.

643
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:33,573
So do not interfere.

644
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:35,775
Andre, I'm not going to
interfere as long as you don't

645
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,310
bogart my date with
Matthew Berry.

646
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:37,810
Fine.

647
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:41,714
Fine.

648
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:42,548
(sighs)

649
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,716
Matthew Berry.

650
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,350
With Melanie B.

651
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,286
He's vulturing my date.

652
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,020
Not again.

653
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,354
Andre, please be cool.

654
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,223
For the first-- Oh, my God.

655
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,825
Seriously, before I got married,
like, dating was such a nightmare.

656
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:56,362
Listen, I know a number of single guys...
What the hell?!

657
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,431
Matthew Berry, you're
vulturing my date.

658
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,033
I'm not vulturing
your date, dude.

659
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,336
Oh, I know what vulturing looks
like, and you're vulturing.

660
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,036
Excuse me for a second.

661
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:03,670
Sure.

662
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,773
Listen, normally, I do fantasy
advice, but let me give

663
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:06,874
you some life advice here.

664
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:08,743
How many dates have you
been on with this woman?

665
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:09,610
Like, I don't know.

666
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:10,511
Two, two and a half.

667
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:13,781
Okay, when she's asking me to set
her up with guys before your

668
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,549
third date, that's a bad sign.

669
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,452
She's just being, you know,
cautiously optimistic.

670
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:19,920
We have different
definitions of that word.

671
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,522
Are you pulling
me from the game?

672
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,923
Are you pulling
me from the game?

673
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:23,624
No, no, listen.

674
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,324
You got your shot.

675
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:25,726
You got first down,
you got second down.

676
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:27,494
You really think you're getting
it done on third down?

677
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:28,328
I'll get it done.

678
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,329
I could punch it in, right?

679
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,330
See, you're creeping her out.

680
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:30,897
This is the problem.

681
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:31,865
I'm not creeping her out.

682
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:32,799
I'm just-- I'm trying.

683
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,766
Come on, give me the ball.

684
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:34,867
Listen, it's okay, it's okay.

685
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,668
I'm on Twitter.

686
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,604
Listen, a lot of guys move the
chains, and then someone

687
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:39,072
else comes in and
scores a touchdown.

688
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,706
That's okay.

689
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,507
We need chain movers.

690
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:42,677
This woman has been set
up for another guy.

691
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,578
That's awesome by you.

692
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,379
I'm the guy!

693
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,080
Let me be the guy.

694
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:45,914
Come on, let me score.

695
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,782
Okay, now you're creeping
everyone else out in the bar.

696
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,451
I'm not creeping
everybody else out.

697
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:50,785
Everyone knows that I can score.

698
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,488
You don't seem...
Oh, really? I don't?

699
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,355
I'll convert right now.

700
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,423
I'll convert right now on you.

701
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,390
You want me to convert on you?

702
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,891
Listen, there's no reason
to talk like that.

703
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:57,893
Oh, really? Here.

704
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,095
Let's let's not
talk, let's fight.

705
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,097
(groaning)

706
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:02,798
Ow!

707
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,632
All right, listen.

708
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,934
Work on the dating, then
work on the punching.

709
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,302
You will be dating a Chicago
Bear by the end of the week.

710
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:08,803
Excuse me.

711
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:09,503
Bye, Matt.

712
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,605
No, no, Matthew, come back!

713
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:11,539
Come back!

714
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,676
Maybe we can go away
for the weekend!

715
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:18,612
Oh, hey.

716
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:19,447
What are you doing up?

717
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,348
What the hell you
doing in my house?

718
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,483
Just making a little tea.

719
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,117
For me?

720
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,386
No.

721
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,888
(groans)

722
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,590
Did you vulture my au pair?

723
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:31,859
Did I vulture your au pair?

724
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,662
Absolutely not.

725
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,897
I vultured baby
Jeffrey's au pair.

726
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,966
Good night.

727
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:43,137
Eye contact?

728
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,672
And a half chub?

729
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,430
Ugh.

730
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:57,189
