362
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,319
It's an honor, Mr. Disney.

363
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,919
Oh, "Walt." Now,
you gotta call me Walt.

364
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,959
Mr. Disney was my old man,
isn't that right, Don?

365
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,119
Absolutely, Walt.

366
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,599
Come here. Come here.

367
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,961
Tommie.

368
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,639
Say hello to the one and
only Pamela Travers.

369
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,002
It's so nice to meet you.

370
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,321
WALT: (STAMMERS)
You know, I can't believe it.

371
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,799
P.L. Travers,
right here in my office.

372
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,401
After all these years,
almost 20 of them?

373
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,839
Mmm. Yes.

374
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,769
Twenty long years.

375
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,359
I wish you could have
seen me then, Pam.

376
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,319
Lean as a whippet, I was.

377
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,839
A racehorse.

378
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,359
Well, anyway. (CHUCKLES)

379
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,879
Now, here you are, and look at you.

380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
I could just eat you up.

381
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,322
Uh... That wouldn't be appropriate.

382
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,879
You know what... When Diane, here,

383
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,519
was about, uh, seven years old...

384
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,839
Oh, can I get you something
to drink? A coffee, or...

385
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,959
A pot of tea would be most welcome.

386
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,839
Anyway, she was about
seven years old

387
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,479
when I was walking past her room

388
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,999
and she was on her bed reading
to her sister, Sharon,

389
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,039
and those girls, they were just
giggling their little socks off.

390
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,319
- Tommie?
- TOMMIE: Yes?

391
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,599
A hot tea for Pamela and me.

392
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,959
Right away, Walt.

393
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,571
Ah, you're a doll.

394
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,399
She is. She's a doll.

395
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,004
Anyways, I asked them, I said,
"Girls, what's so funny?"

396
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,879
And Diane said to me,

397
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,289
"Why, Daddy, Mary Poppins."
(LAUGHING)

398
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,570
I didn't even know
what a Mary Poppins was.

399
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,879
But then she gave me
one of your books,

400
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,399
and, oh, by gosh, my imagination
caught on fire.

401
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,199
Absolutely on fire.

402
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,559
And those embers have burned
ever since, as you know.

403
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,999
I do. Yes.

404
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,159
Twenty years.

405
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,719
So you keep saying.

406
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,046
Pam,

407
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,199
a man cannot break a promise
he's made to his kids.

408
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,121
No matter how long it takes
for him to make it come true.

409
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
Now, you've kept me
dangling all this time.

410
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,484
But now, I gotcha.

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,679
"Gotcha," indeed.

412
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,599
Mr. Disney, if you have "dangled,"

413
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,279
it is at the end of a rope you
have fashioned for yourself.

414
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,239
I was perfectly clear
when you approached me 20 years ago

415
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,599
that she wasn't for sale.
And I was clear again

416
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,679
when you approached me
the following year

417
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,119
and clear again when you
approached me every annum

418
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,799
for the subsequent 18 years,

419
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,279
and quite honestly,
I feel corralled.

420
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,119
Oh, now, Pam, the last thing I want
to do is make you feel as though...

421
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,279
Would you mind? My name
is "Mrs. Travers." I do...

422
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,799
See, I promised them, Pam.
Now, that's a fact.

423
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,959
You got kids?

424
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,439
No. Well, not precisely.

425
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,439
I have never, and absolutely never,

426
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,959
gone back on a promise I made
to either one of my daughters.

427
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,639
Now, that's what being "Daddy"
is all about, right?

428
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,679
Is it?

429
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,319
See, our motion picture is not
just gonna make my kids happy.

430
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,959
It's gonna make
all kids happy. Adults, too.

431
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,119
Because my guys are
gonna do things with it

432
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,799
that are revolutionary, Pam.
Revolutionary!

433
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,639
Your Mary Poppins is gonna
literally fly off the pages

434
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,079
of your books.

435
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,239
Oh. Thank you, Tommie.

436
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,999
This magical woman who has
only lived inside your head,

437
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,239
well, you are gonna be able
to meet her, speak to her.

438
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,487
You're gonna hear her sing.

439
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,119
Now, the singing, I'm very
glad you've come to that.

440
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,322
Oh! (STAMMERS)
Milk in first, please.

441
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,165
Then the tea.

442
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,364
And a spoonful of sugar.

443
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,729
You don't intend for this
film to be a musical?

444
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,005
I absolutely do.

445
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,119
No.

446
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,845
- No?
- No.

447
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,164
Mr. Disney,
Mary Poppins does not sing.

448
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,319
Yes, she does.

449
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,119
- When?
- In your books.

450
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,527
No, those aren't songs.
They're recitations.

451
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,119
She's not a giddy woman.
She's doesn't jig about.

452
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,199
I mean, singing is frivolous.

453
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,839
It's wholly unnecessary in a
governess, an educatress.

454
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,879
No, it would simply ruin it.

455
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,731
I won't have her turned into
one of your silly cartoons.

456
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,879
Now, Pam...

the very last thing,

461

is tarnish a story
I have cherished.

462
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,679
Now, the pages of your books
are worn to tissue.

463
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,399
They are dog-eared and falling out,

464
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
because I have pored over them,
gripped and tormented.

465
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,962
Because I love her, Pam.

466
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,601
I love Mary Poppins.

467
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,444
And you, you have got
to share her with me.

468
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,970
And nothing happens
without your say-so.

"Exterior."

01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,204
I can't stop reading it,
you know.

1594
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,770
I'm very slow, mind you, so...

1595
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,249
Would you like me to sign it?

1596
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,679
Would you?

1597
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,245
I'd be honored.

01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,279

1602

I've just this instant realized

1604
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,246
I don't know your name.

1605
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,161
Ralph.

1606
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,207
Pamela.

1607
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,119
You're the only American
I've ever liked, Ralph.

1608
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,448
Oh... Well, may I ask why?

1609
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,039
No.

1610
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,244
Now, take this.

1611
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,720
"Albert Einstein,
Van Gogh, Roosevelt.

1612
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,639
(MISPRONOUNCES) "Frida Kahlo."

1613
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,171
- "Kahlo."
- Kahlo.

1614
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,319
What is this?

1615
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,090
They all had difficulties.

1616
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Jane can do anything
that anyone else can do.

1617
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,524
Do you understand?

1618
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,121
Oh.

1619
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,648
I almost forgot, turn it around.

1620
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,361
"Walt Disney."

1621
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,599
Hyperactive behavior
and deficiencies in concentration.

1622
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,007
It explains everything.

1623
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,888
Thank you, Mrs.

1624
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,999
DOLLY: She acted like an angry
person a lot of the time.

1625

TOMMIE: Mmm-hmm.

1626
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,319
So, she's come and gone, huh?

1627
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,159
Yeah, her flight
left 10 minutes ago.

1628
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,319

Wait. "Goff"?

1631
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,639
Who is... Who is Helen Goff?

1632
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,559
That's her. That's her real name.

1633
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,519
She acts so hoity-toity British,

1634
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,563
and she's really an Aussie.

1635
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,402
Then who is Travers?

1636
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,571
I've been talking to
the wrong person?

1637
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,926
He's gone.

1638
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,687
No, no, no. You mustn't.

1639
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,851
Let her go, Margaret.

1640
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,082
I dropped the pears.

1641
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1642
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,039
Helen, dear girl...

1643
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,210
You promised you
would fix everything.

1644
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,850
Hello, house.

Oh, dear God!

1650
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,239
It was one heck of a
job getting a seat

1651
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,011
on the very next flight,
let me tell you.

1652
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,799
Mrs. Travers,

1653
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,561
(CHUCKLES) I could sure use a nice
pot of English tea about now.

1654
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,205
Here we are.

1655
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,165
Allow me.

1656
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,519
Milk in first, remember?

1657
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,722
Yeah, I remember.

1658
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,839
And a spoonful of sugar?

1659
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,485
NO, I think I'll have whisky.

1660
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,521
Oh.

1661
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,480
Ooh.

1662
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,611
That's okay.

1663
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,320
(CHUCKLING)
Well, when in Rome...

1664
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,961
Thank you.

1665
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,839
You've come to change my mind,
haven't you?

1666
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,279
To beat me into submission.

1667
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,679
No. No.

1668
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,169
I've come because you misjudged me.

1669
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,361
(SCOFFS)

1670
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,359
How do I misjudge you?

1671
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,839
You look at me

1672
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,159
and you see some kind
of Hollywood King Midas.

1673
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,039
You think I've built an empire,
and I want your Mary Poppins

1674
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,919
as just another brick
in my kingdom.

1675
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,963
And don't you?

1676
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,839
Now, if that was all it was,

1677
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,119
would I have suckered up
to a cranky, stubborn dame

1678
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,399
like you for 20 years?

1679
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,841
No, I would have
saved myself an ulcer.

1680
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,130
No... You, uh...

1681
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,479
You expected me to disappoint you,

1682
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,205
and so you made sure I did.

1683
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,723
Well, I think life disappoints you,
Mrs. Travers.

1684
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,519
I think it's done that a lot, and I
think Mary Poppins is the only person

1685
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,165
in your life who hasn't.

1686
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,319
Mary Poppins isn't real.

1687
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,959
That's not true. No, no, no.

1688
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,959
She's as real as can
be to my daughters.

1689

And to thousands
of other kids. Adults, too.

1690
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,843
She's been there as a nighttime
comfort to a heck of a lot of people.

1691
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,519
Well, where is she
when I need her, hmm?

1692
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,039
I open the door to Mary Poppins,

1693
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,450
and who should be standing there,
but Walt Disney?

(SIGHS)

1695
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,849
Mrs. Travers, I'm sorry.

1696
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,159
I'd hoped this would have been
a magical experience,

1697
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,719
for you and for all of us,
but I've let you down.

1698
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,999
And, in doing so,

1699
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,211
I've broken a 20-year-old
promise I made to my daughters.

1700
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,519
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out why

1701
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,883
this has been so
hard for you and I.

1702
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,009
And, well... (SIGHS)

1703
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,447
You see,
I have my own Mr. Banks.

1704
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,039
Mine had a mustache.

1705
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,404
So, it is not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

1706
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,799
(CHUCKLES) No, no.

1707
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,279
But it is true that
you created yourself

1708
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,130
in someone else's, yes?

1709
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,679
Have you ever been
to Kansas City, Mrs. Travers?

1710
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,405
Do you know Missouri at all?

1711
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,639
I can't say I do.

1712
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,879
Well, it's mighty cold
there in the winters.

1713
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,519
Bitter cold.

1714
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,559
And my dad, Elias Disney,

1715
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,759
he owned a newspaper
delivery route there.

1716
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,119
A thousand papers, twice daily.

1717
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,607
A morning and an evening edition.

1718
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,959
And Dad was a tough businessman.

1719
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,639
He was a "save a penny
any way you can" type of fella.

1720
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,759
So he wouldn't employ
delivery boys.

1721
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,090
No, no, no. He used me
and my big brother Roy.

1722
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,119
I was, uh...
I was eight back then.

1723
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,765
Just eight years old.

1724
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,002
And, like I said,
winters are harsh.

1725
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,759
And old Elias, well,
he didn't believe in new shoes,

1726
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,439
until the old ones
were worn through.

1727
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,959
Honestly, Mrs. Travers,

1728
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,559
the snowdrifts, sometimes they
were up over my head.

1729
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,570
And we'd push through that
snow like it was molasses.

1730
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,719
The cold and wet seeping through

1731
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,127
our clothes and our shoes.

1732
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,159
Skin peeling from our faces.

1733
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,879
Sometimes I'd find myself
sunk down in that snow,

1734
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,079
just waking up,

1735
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,567
because I must have passed out
or something, I don't know.

1736
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,439
And then it was time for school,

1737
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,079
and I was too cold or wet

1738
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,039
to figure out equations and things.

1739
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,999
And then it was right back
out in the snow again

1740
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,804
to get home just before dark.

1741
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,479
Mother would feed us dinner.

1742
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,599
And then it was time
to go right back out

1743
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,531
and do it again for
the evening edition.

1744
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,599
"You had best be quick there, Walt."
"You'd better get those newspapers up

1745
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,119
"on that porch
and under that storm door.

1746
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,039
"Poppa's gonna lose
his temper again

1747
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,403
"and show you the buckle
end of his belt, boy."

1748
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,999
I don't... I don't tell you this
to make you sad,

1749
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,279
Mrs. Travers.

1750
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,879
I don't. I love my life.
I think it's a miracle.

1751
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,959
And I loved my dad. He was a...
He was a wonderful man.

1752
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,559
But rare is the day

1753
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,239
when I don't think about
that eight-year-old boy

1754
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,599
delivering newspapers in the snow,

1755
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,691
and old Elias Disney
with that strap in his fist.

1756
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,845
And I am just so tired.

1757
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,531
Mrs. Travers,

1758
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,609
I'm tired of remembering
it that way.

1759
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,559
Aren't you tired, too,
Mrs. Travers?

1760
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,439
Now we all have our sad tales,

1761
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,439
but don't you want
to finish the story?

1762
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,919
Let it all go and have a life

1763
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,169
that isn't dictated by the past?

1764
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,879
It's not the children
she comes to save.

1765
