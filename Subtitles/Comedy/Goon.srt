of the Halifax Highlanders.

I've told him about you
and I think you can help him out.

It all starts with this player
he's got there, Xavier Laflamme.

with a puck

and he could put
that cocksucker away too.

205

This is not some league where the

Ronnie Hortense is looking
for a spark to ignite his team,

335
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,158
and that spark is in the person of
Doug Glatt,

336
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,785

when people are around?

- It's true.
- I read that in "Cat Fancy".

That ought to be gone.

- I think you're being pretty gay.

00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,317
- It's not gay.
- Not if you're brothers.

364
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,487
If you're brothers it's gay
with a dash or something else.

365
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,823
My brother's gay
and he doesn't even do that.

00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,278
- Nail him, Doug.
- Landing blows to the head,

663
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,613
to the body, everywhere.

664
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,450
- Oh, my fuck!
- Oh, God.

665
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,997
Easy, okay, easy!

666
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,374
- Good fight, man.
- Good fight.

667
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,167
He's a nice guy.

668
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,671
(CROWD) Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

669
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,548
Do you hear that?

670
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,889
Just a minute four left.
The score's tied.

671
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,852
Everything on the line as Halifax look
to extend their wins to four.

672
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,439
Now a three on one develops
as Kim moves in.

673
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,482
- Kim lets the shot go...
- Ow!

674

- He scores!

675
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,946
It was Doug Glatt in the conservatory
with his ass.

676
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,868
And the young gun from Orangetown
they call The Thug has done it.

677
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,786
Whoo! Shit!

678
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,458
The Highlanders might just make a run
for the playoffs after all.

679
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,127
You make me happy, man,
with your ass!

680
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,463
- My ass.
- With your ass!

681
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:06,684
Well done, boys. Tonight, good food,
good women, good rest.

682
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,686
Not necessarily in that order.

683
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:13,024
Glatt, Laflamme, get changed,
in my office.

684
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,568
Good job, boys.
See you tomorrow morning.

685
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,154
Way to go, Dougie!
This boy popped the cherry tonight.

686
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,531
Popped my cherry.
What does that mean?

687
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,827
- Boys.
- Coach.

688
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,165
One of you has really been
impressing me with your play lately

689
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,084
and one of you hasn't.

690
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,753
Want to venture a guess
as to who's who?

691
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,801
Well, Laflamme, I'm ripping that A
off your jersey.

692
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,262
You don't deserve it,
unless A stands for asshole.

693
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,224
Glatt, you're promoted.
Assistant captain.

694
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,434
Good on you.
Keep up the good work.

695
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,355
- There's the puck. I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Coach.

696
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,983
Xavier, you can take this the right way
or the wrong way.

697
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,778
Ladies' choice.

698
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,988
Xavier!

699
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,033
- Go get him.
- Hey, bud, wait up!

700
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,327
Oh, my God! You scored!

701
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:11,708
With your fucking ass, you scored?
You son of a bitch. Look at you!

702
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,503
You'll love this. I know how you like
Middle Eastern food.

703
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,006
And Uncle Stevie, he's a good friend.
He's very robust.

704
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,218
Holy fucking shitass, Dougie,
you fucking scored?

705
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,513
You just fisted that motherfucker
right in the ass.

706
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,057
Fuck, I'm so sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.

707
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,893
- There he is! There's the guy.
- Hey!

708
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,730
Dougie, my friend, good to see you as
always, eh?

709
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,859
That's my top customer right there.
Five times a week I see you, right?

710
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:42,655
I watched this guy fight three guys,
knock out all their teeth.

711
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,325
Three guys! Four teeth! One game.
It was unbelievable.

712
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,496
I'm so excited! Fuck it!

don't get excited.

715
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,382
- Hey!
- Okay, the sauce.

716
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,925
Water down the sauce.

717
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,595
So could we get anything
for this on eBay?

718
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:11,058
I don't think so. No, I wanted to give it to
Mom and Dad, if they wanted it.

719
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,270
Seeing it's just...

720
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,315
Here.

721
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:23,279
Douglas, it's good to see that you're
having fun with this, you know, hobby.

722
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,740
It's not a hobby, it's my job.

723
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,826
I'm a hockey player.

724
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,454
Have you thought
about the head injuries

725
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,540
that come with such a violent sport,
the concussions?

726
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,335
- How long do you think you can do it?
- Mom...

727
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,172
It's an infantile way for a man to spend
his adult years.

728
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,634
- No, it isn't.
- You can do anything.

729
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,886
- No, I couldn't.
- You could teach.

730
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,430
I can't, okay?

731
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,433
I can't because I'm stupid. I'm stupid.

732
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,770
- Doug, you're not that stupid.
- I am.

733
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,816
I'm stupid. You're gay.
I'm stupid, he's gay.

734
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,484
- Stupid, gay.
- We get it.

735
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,569
- Stupid, gay.
- Okay.

736
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,780
You have one stupid son
and a gay son.

737
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,740
- Oh, God.
- For once in my life,

738
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,617
I'm a part of something.

739
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:14,163
I get to wear a uniform that doesn't have
"Security" on it.

740

and it's got our name on it.

I can be smart enough to be a doctor.

I can fight. I'm strong.

743

I could protect people.

744
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,559
That's who I am, it's what I do,
and you should be proud of me.

745
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,354
We should be proud of you?
They call you Thug, for Christ's sake.

746
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,776
It might as well say "Security"
on the back of your sweater. Excuse me.

- Doug, I am proud of you.
- Thanks, buddy.

00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,716
- Laflamme moves into position.
- Back!

827
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,094
He gets it back again.

828
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,850
Man on! Man on!

829
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,315
- Hey! What the fuck?
- Glatt was looking the other way.

831
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,742
- Get him off!
- That's it!

832
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,536
- That's it!
- Get him off.

833
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,789
That's it.

834
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:22,883

This is getting scary, folks.

(RONNIE) He's got a concussion.
He may not be back at all.

838
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:45,656
And for what you did to Simard,
you've been suspended for one game.

839
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,658
Glatt, this team counts on you.

840
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,953
Whatever it is that is making you
fucking ovulate,

841
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,623
you better figure it out
and get your fucking shit together.

842
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,210
And for those of you who think
you've got no practice tomorrow,

I'm sorry. I'm such a moron.

- Yeah. You fucked him up.

- No, er...

My boyfriend got home a few days ago.

Yeah, Doug. I know.

867
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,970
Look, I'm a bad girlfriend, Doug.

868
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,682
I mean, all we did was make out.

- That doesn't bother you?

The truth is, I just...
I have a really huge crush on you.

Hello, sir.

875
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,032
My name is Doug Glatt.

876
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,288
Ross Rhea. Nice to meet you, kid.

877
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,790
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Sit down.

878
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,335
Thanks.

879
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,420
So you're the new me, eh?

880
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,673
Huh! I don't know about that.

881
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,219
- I don't think so.
- Everyone else seems to.

882
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,181
It's good. Good for you, kid.

883
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,724
Thank you.

884
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:44,061
So why are you wandering around
St. John's at 3 a.m.?

885
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:50,901
- Aren't you playing us tonight?
- Not me. I got suspended a game.

886
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,739
Too bad.
I ain't much for waiting around.

887
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,537
You're a tough bastard out there.
You can fucking bang.

888
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,539
Thank you. Thanks so much.

889
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,668
- I'm going to impart some wisdom.
- I could really use some of that.

You understand what I'm saying?

892
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,885
Erm... I don't know. No.

893
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:22,808
Kid, you got this thing, the stuff, the shit,
the fucking grit. You got it, like me.

894
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,894
But like me, that's all you fucking got.

895
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:30,357
And like me, you're no good to anyone
doing anything else.

896
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:36,905
Don't go trying to be a hockey player.
You'll get your heart ripped out.

897
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,202
- But I am a hockey player, sir.
- You're a fucking goon.

898
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:47,207
- That plays hockey. Like you.
- I don't play much hockey.

899
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,668
You're a hockey player, sir.

900
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,379
You know they just want you to bleed,
right?

901
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,968
I'm here to do whatever they need me
to do. If they need me to bleed,

902
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,970
then I'll bleed for my team.

903
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,017
Yeah.

904
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,770
I suppose you heard I'm going to retire
at the end of this season?

905
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,064
I've been at this since I was 17

906
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:16,278
but I'm not going to go out like
some nancy-boy fuck. You understand?

907
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,196
Yeah, I understand.

908
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:23,076
You have my respect,
whatever that means to you - you got it.

909
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,455
But know this shit hard.

911
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,876

I think it's only fitting
that I'm winding it up here.

924
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:52,082
That being said,
I still got some fight in me left.

It's a rough physical game tonight.

Both teams battling
for the eighth and final playoff spot.

930
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,692
- Come on!
- Stevenson is levelled by Rhea.

931
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,737
- Where's the call?
- And the Shamrocks score!

932
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,281
St. John's has taken an early lead.

933
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:30,287
Rhea absolutely running over the poor
Highlanders. It's energy on the ice.

934
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,290
(RONNIE) Cheap shot, Rhea. No need.

935
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,753
(OGILVEY) Take it.

936
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,130
- I got to fight you.
- Come on, Gord.

937
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,675
- You know how this ends.
- No shit.

938
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,137
- Come here. Come on.
- Oh! Are you sure?
