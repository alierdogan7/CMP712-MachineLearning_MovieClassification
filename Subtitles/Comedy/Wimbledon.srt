01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:26,931
- [Evert ] i don't believe it.
That was a terrible call for Colt.
- No!

- What the hell?
- What?

1280
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,503
- [ Crowd Jeering ]
- Look at the chalk fly.
The ball was definitely in.

1281

- It was on the line.
- It was on the line!

1282

The ball was good.

Oh, come on. The ball was good.
Chalk flew up.

1285
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:48,749
The whole stadium saw it.
I don't know ifyou've noticed,
but it's quite an important point.

1286
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:52,020
That's too close for me to overrule.
Please resume play.

1287

absolutely not. I'm not playing.
This is complete bollocks.

Warning, Mr. Colt.

Okay, here we go.

to win the championship.

1293

The question is, can he do it?

quiet please.

1297

it wasn't fast either.

[ Mother's Voice ] i believe you
to be a truly great tennis player.

1300
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:46,812
- [ Man's Voice ] ultimately disappointing.
- [ McEnroe 's Voice ]
Total collapse ofa player's--

Stop it. You have to stop it.

i've never seen anything
like this in my life.
