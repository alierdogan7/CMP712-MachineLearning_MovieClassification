(Train whistles)

2
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:36,142
(German accent)
Security has been tightened throughout the country.

3
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:39,021
All borders have been placed on full alert.

4
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:42,682
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

5
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:48,025
In addition, we have received assurances
from our undercover agents in the West...

6
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:52,284
...that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

7
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,162
All military leaves have been cancelled...

8
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,747
...and we have doubled the guard...

9
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:58,700
...around Dr Flammond.

10
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,701
Finally, all systems are in readiness...

11
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:05,672
...for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

12
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,793
- Just as you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

13
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,132
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here...

14
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,724
...on their manoeuvres...

15
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,843
and completely vulnerable.

16
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:23,726
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

17
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:28,235
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, <i>Herr General.</i>

18
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:32,491
And you should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request...

19
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:36,911
...the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

20
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:42,163
Well done, <i>Herr Major.</i>
Then everything has gone according to the plan?

21
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:46,161
Well, not exactly, <i>mein General.</i>

22
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:50,793
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

23
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:53,548
But, they are sending
another performer in his place.

24
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:58,637
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

25
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:02,766
His name is... Nick Rivers.

26
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,352
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

27
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:08,816
As long as the attention of the world 
is fixed on our cultural festival...

28
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,067
...no one will know what is about to happen.

29
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,909
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

30
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:23,166
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

48
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:19,467
# And never coming back

49
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,599
# I've got a gun rack in my Chevy

50
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:25,478
# For when the surf and the flak get heavy

51
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,846

What did he say?

92
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,122
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

93
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,798
Better have our passports ready.

94
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:09,263
Now remember Nick... this is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

95
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:14,219
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

96
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,024
And above all, remember, 
we gotta play by their rules.

97
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,984
Martin, I've been practising.
How's this?

(Speaks German)

99
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:27,441

- Is your daughter 18?

Your papers, please.

101
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,420
Mr Nick Rivers.

102
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:46,084
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

103
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:02,891
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

105
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,282
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble, Mr. Rivers.

106
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:17,406
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

107
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:22,085
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

108
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,924
Good day.

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,386
What the hell did you say to him?

111
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,312
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

112
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,314
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

113
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,570
Normally he wouldn't say...

114
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,654
Your attitude is being noted, Mr Rivers.

115
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:08,333
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for a lot of trouble.

Tonight, we begin our Festival
at the Concert Hall...

134

...where the distinguished Madam Bergerone
and her ballet company...

135
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,483
...will perform "The Nutcracker Suite".

Do you know any good white
basketball players?

139
00:11:56,551 --> 00:12:00,714
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

140
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,551
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

141
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,256
They knew I was on that train.

142
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:11,305
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

143
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,272
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

144
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:21,156
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

145
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:28,112
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

146
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,491
Time is running out.

147
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,624
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

148
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,251
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

149
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,595
That's very good.

150
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,424
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

151
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,680
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

152
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,483
What are my instructions?

153
00:12:54,608 --> 00:13:00,278
Here, here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

154
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,406
Go tonight to the ballet.
Here. Use this ticket.

155
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,287
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

156
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,743
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's...

157
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,369
...on the corner of Der Führer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

158
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,341
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

159
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,168
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog pooh.

160
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,878
What phoney dog pooh?

161
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,930
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

162
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,226
And now we conclude our ceremony...

163
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,438
...with the singing of our
East German National Anthem.

164
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,777
(Singing in German)

165
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,899
HAIL, HAIL, EAST GERMANY

166
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,901
LAND OF VINE AND GRAPE

167
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,284
LAND WHERE YOU'LL REGRET

168
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,868
AND TRY TO ESCAPE

169
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,079
NO MATTER IF YOU TUNNEL UNDER

170
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,622
OR TAKE A RUNNING JUMP
AT THE WALL

171
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,917
THE GUARDS WILL KILL YOU

172
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,508
IF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE
DOESN'T FIRST

173
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,353
Driver, why are we stopped here?
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

174
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,283
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

175
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,867
Ah, yes. Mr Rivers.

176
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:21,285
I have it right here, but I'm afraid we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

177
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,754
If you like, we will be very happy
to provide you with one.

178
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,839
That'll be fine.

179
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,628
Jürgen.

180
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,261
This way, sir.

181
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,726
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

182
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:43,184
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

183
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,185
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

184
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,480
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

185
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,106
But of course, <i>mein General.</i>

186
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:57,485
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

187
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,416
I will take care of it.

188
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,877
Thank you.

189
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,513
(Martin's voice) 'Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

190
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,176
'I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.'

191
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

192
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,138
(Coughs)

193
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,765
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry about it  Martin.

194
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,069
Why don't you go to your room and get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

195
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,400
No, thanks. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

196
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,025
Oh, yeah. I got them right here.

197
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:41,867
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,207
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

199
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,740
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

200
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:21,080
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

201
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,198
Have you heard from Cedric?

202
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,951
Yes, yes. He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

203
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,171
This letter has to be in New York
by Tuesday.

204
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,085
Now, go! Quickly!

205
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,471
(Whistle goes off)

206
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,270
(Agitated voices speaking outside)

207
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:13,334
Excuse me. I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

208
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,597
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

209
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,686
(Seal breaks and wine fizzes)

210
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:48,035
Jürgen, escort this lady out.

211
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,586
Excuse me, but this lady is with me.

212
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:58,214
Mr Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

213
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:02,472
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

214
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:06,548
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

215
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:14,938
- Thank you. That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

216
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:17,820
I was looking for someone to dance with.

217
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:21,113
- You're an American.
- That's right.

218
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,361
- My uncle was born in America.
- Oh really?

219
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,365
But he was one of the lucky ones.

220
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:32,539
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

221
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,587
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

222
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:40,091
He would tell me about
all the large houses and expensive cars.

223
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:44,631
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll music.

224
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,600
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

225
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,217
"M* A*S*H" was OK
and the old "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

226
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:54,601
It just seems like the young people
of America take freedom for granted.

227
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,809
Wait a minute. I don't think you're being fair.

228
00:19:56,944 --> 00:20:00,359
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

229
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:05,032
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want...

230
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,285
...but still, you don't know
what it's like to have to fight for it.

231
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:33,053
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

232
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,679
I am grateful for what you did back there.

233
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,520
Well, I think you'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell...

234
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:41,569
...Disneyland on both coasts.
It's happening.

235
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:45,606
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

236
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:49,325
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

237
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,035
What do you recommend?

238
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,961
I recommend the pork bellies...

239
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,758
...marinated in diced pig entrails...

240
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:04,635
...or the roast swine knuckles...

241
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:09,257
...poached with flaming hog balls.

242
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,926
Anything's fine.

243
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,983
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

244
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,861
Hilary. That's an unusual name.

245
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:28,492
It's a German name. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

246
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:34,407
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

247
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,375
Nick, what does that mean?

248
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,705
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

249
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:49,420
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

250
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:52,260
Some things are much better left unsaid.

251
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:54,808
Like what?

252
00:21:54,935 --> 00:22:01,602
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse...

253
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:08,021
...then a little while later you reach for your lipstick, 
your hand gooshes into it, and it goes all over...

254
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,778
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

255
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,786
Thank you very much.

256
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,033
Ladies and gentlemen.

257
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:25,673
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent...

258
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,093
...is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

259
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,091
He truly has the gift of song.

260
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,299
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

261
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:38,351
Is there something wrong?

262
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,767
I was afraid something like this might happen.

263
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:45,809
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer...

264
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:49,313
...and owns a complete set of his works.

265
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,817
He is a very shy and gentle man...

266
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:57,031
...but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

267
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:59,370
Shall we ask him?

268
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:07,917
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

269
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,979
Thank you, sir.

270
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,564
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

271
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:30,106
Oh, my God.

272
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,397
(# "Tutti Frutti")

273
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:34,857

280
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:00,007
# She knows how to love me
Yes, indeed

281
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,266

what you do to me

282

# She almost drives me crazy

(Guitar feedback)

299
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:48,656
Your hog balls, sir.

300
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,970
Cedric!

301
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:23,066
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

302
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,866
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

303
00:26:26,997 --> 00:26:30,081
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

304
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,782
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

305
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,161
But what are we going to do?

306
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:36,495
I was...

307
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:41,295
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight...

308
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:44,132
...to meet a man called "The Torch".

309
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,924
Thank you.

310
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:49,722
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

311
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:53,637
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

312
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,608
I must! He'll be tortured.

313
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:59,771
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

314
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:02,146
Where is the ticket?

315
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:04,654
In the glove compartment.

316
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,528
Can you reach it from the inside?

317
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,905
(Horn toots)

318
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,412
How about the other hand?

319
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:19,001
No, that's not it. Let me try.

320
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,672
Here it is.

321
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,011
(# TCHAIKOVSKY:
"The Nutcracker Suite")

322
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,581
(lndistinct)

323
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,667
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

324
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,175
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

325
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:31,675
(Whistle being blown)

326
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,218
In here.

327
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:48,102
Here. We can get out this way.

328
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:52,105
- Wait. First you can explain a few things.
- I'm not sure I can.

329
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:55,243
(Mice squeaking)

330
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,573
I only know I have put you in great danger.

331
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,748
Please. Trust me. You must come with me.

332
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:06,412
Look. I don't know what kind of trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

333
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:09,418
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

334
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:12,172
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

335
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:17,389
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

336
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:48,417
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

337
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:54,336
Nick, I've tried everything.

338
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,756
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

339
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,054
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

340
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:05,306
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

341
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,984
Gee, that's a shame, Martin.

342
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:12,399
Have you tried one of these?

343
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:19,535
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

344
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,543
Now listen, Martin. I'm getting little worried about this place.
I mean, I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

345
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:30,002
All I know is, after you left the cafe last night, 
I met a girl.

346
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,538
Then later at the ballet she was sitting all alone.

347
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:35,426
And then all of sudden I see this guy got a gun at her head.

348
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:39,764
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and he might have if I hadn't stepped in.

349
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,267
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this whole mess out.

350
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:48,558
Look, I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

351
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:51,395
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

352
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:56,105
Now, you just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

353
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,624
(Latin being spoken)

354
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,616
Amen.

355
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,661
We wish to impress upon you, Mr Rivers...

356
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,463
...that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

357
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,887
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

358
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,514
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

359
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:12,266
Might I remind you, Mr Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

360
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,527
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

361
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,562
(Phone rings)

362
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:23,487
It is the hospital, <i>mein General.</i>

363
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:27,532
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

364
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:33,749
Yes. I see. Well, let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

365
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:36,211
He is dead.

366
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:45,262
I'm afraid, you leave me no alternative,
but to introduce you to two of my associates.

367
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:50,430
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

368
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:56,059
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

369
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:59,312
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness...

370
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:01,568
...however long they may work on him.

371
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:03,571
You don't scare me.

372
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:06,700
My manager is on his way right now
to the American Consulate.

373
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,864
Do not be so sure, Mr Rivers.

374
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:12,073
Evidently, your friend did not realise...

375
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,873
...that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

376
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:20,416
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

377
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:22,625
Our surgeons did what they could...

378
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,588
...but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

379
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:33,345
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

380
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,988
Make sure they leave no marks.

381
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:53,369
(Speaks German)

382
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:15,058
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

383
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:18,437
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

384
00:35:18,565 --> 00:35:21,139
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

385
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:27,279
No, no, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

386
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:30,492
I can't believe I'm back in school.

387
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:35,497
Thank God.

388
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:39,701
(Door opens and man enters room)

389
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,998
Well?

390
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,333
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

391
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,756
They've tried everything.

392
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:50,638
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

393
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:54,464
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

394
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,222
We'll break him tomorrow.

395
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,142
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

396
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:22,886
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

397
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:28,894
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you, my son.

398
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:32,527
You see, a year ago, I was close to perfecting...

399
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:36,025
...the first magnetic desalinisation process.

400
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,110
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt...

401
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:43,747
...from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

402
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:48,039
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

403
00:37:50,174 --> 00:37:52,843
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

404
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,798
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

405
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,181
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

406
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:02,978
and brought me to this dungeon.

407
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,728
That sucks!

408
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:07,607
For the first time in my life,

409
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:12,110
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

410
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:16,152
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

411
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:19,699
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

412
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:22,699
But they are holding my daughter.

413
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:27,160
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

414
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:30,663
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

415
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:33,751
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

416
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:36,291
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

417
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,586
Is this the Polaris mine?

418
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:43,598
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

419
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:47,096
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine.

420
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,726
So powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

421
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,525
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

422
00:39:02,662 --> 00:39:06,612
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

423
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,000
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

424
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,971
Right away.

425
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,932
- Von Horst!
<i>- Ja, mein General.</i>

426
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:26,976
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

427
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:29,808
Mr Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

428
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:32,644
He is to be executed this very minute.

429
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:36,987
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
<i>- Ja, mein General.</i>

430
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,066
(Phone rings)

431
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,404
(Drill sergeant barks orders)

432
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:01,841
(# "How Silly Can You Get")

433
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:07,681
# How silly can you get?
Yeah, yeah

434
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,847
# How silly can you get?
Ooh, yeah

435
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,266
# I never meant to stray,
But when she looked at me that way

436
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,436
# The night was young
And gay Paris made me forget

437
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,153
# I went to Paris in France
I found a little romance

438
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:24,318
# She was walking down the boulevard

439
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:27,909
# I know I should've been good
I never thought that I would

440
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,372
# Be double crossing
Baby, cross my heart

441
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,667
# Ah, little rockin'

442
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:39,007
# And a little wine stopped me thinking
about a little valentine

443
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:44,174
# What's a lonely boy to do?
She looked so fine

444
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:47,140
# How silly can you get?
Yeah, yeah

445
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:51,595
# How silly can you get?
Ooh, yeah

446
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,520
# Oh yeah, I never meant to stray

447
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:55,272
# But when she looked at me that way

448
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:58,733
# The night was young
And gay Paris made me forget

449
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:00,569
# How silly can you get?

450
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:05,109
# Yeah, yeah
How silly can you get?

451
00:41:05,242 --> 00:41:12,075
# No more foolin' around, you bet
How silly can you get?

452
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:18,796
# I can't believe it's true

453
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:25,171
# That I just met a girl like you

454
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:32,684
# Each night I'm all alone

455
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:35,053
# My heart's an empty home

456
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:38,189
# To see you standing there

457
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,890
# Would be my only prayer

458
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:43,601
# You set my heart on fire

459
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,609
# It's burning with desire

460
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:49,067
# Your touch, your lips, your soul

461
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:51,491
# You make me lose control

462
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,370
# Baby, please,
Baby, please, baby, please

463
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,501
# Spend this night with me

464
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:04,833
# I can't believe it's true

465
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:09,677
# I met a girl like you

466
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:16,435
# In heaven we would be

467
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:23,061
# If you'd spend this night with me
If you would spend this night with me

468
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:27,821
# Darlin', I'm here to say
I pray there'll come a day

469
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:30,570
# When by my side you'll stay

470
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:36,407
# And you, you will always be
a love that's true to me

471
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:41,417
# You set my heart on fire
It's burning with desire

472
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:47,133
# Your touch, your lips, your soul
You make me lose control

473
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:54,390
# Baby, please, Baby, please
Spend this night with me

474
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:01,395
# Baby please
Don't you understand I need you

475
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:03,894
# I can't live without you

476
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:07,442
# I'm gonna say something
I never said before

477
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:12,068
# I even love you
Ah, there's no use

478
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:16,697
# I'm begging you darlin'
I can't face another day without you

479
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,325
# Oh honey, lamb

480
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:24,911
# I'm afraid, don't you understand?
I'm losing, losing my very mind

481
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,791
# I got to have you with me

482
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:29,676
# I'm in such complete anguish without you

483
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:36,808
# Baby, I'm standing
at the great abyss of love

484
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:40,018
# And I'm teetering
Oh, darlin'

485
00:43:40,146 --> 00:43:42,719
# I promise I'll even be nice to your mama

486
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:45,348
# Baby, please

487
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:50,395
# Spend this night with me

488
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,197
# Ooh, ah #

489
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:16,011
Those bikes!

490
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:18,925
(Whinnying and neighing)

491
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,846
(Horse hooves clatter away)

492
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,279
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

493
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,116
They're in the Eastern sector.

494
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,577
I want the whole area sealed off!

495
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,560
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

496
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:09,351
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

497
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:14,063
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

498
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:18,693
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

499
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:21,947
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

500
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,121
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

501
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:30,087
at the University of Blaupunkt.

502
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:35,634
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

503
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,046
I've been trying to find him ever since.

504
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:42,801
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

505
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:45,639
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

506
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,059
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

507
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,680
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

508
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:53,937
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

509
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,569
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

510
00:46:14,215 --> 00:46:17,631
(Trickling)

511
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,155
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

512
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:48,409
(Bell rings)

513
00:46:56,173 --> 00:46:58,581
(Clears throat)

514
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:03,553
May I help you?

515
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:06,840
My father is Dr. Paul Flammond

516
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:10,890
I'm sorry.
I don't know a Dr. Flammond.

517
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:15,934
He told me you may have a book
of Swedish poems by Von Brieson.

518
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:20,775
So you are Hillary Flammond!

519
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:28,366
What can I do for you?

520
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,412
We must speak with "The Torch".

521
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:33,700
That will be very difficult.

522
00:47:41,843 --> 00:47:44,595
But I will try to arrange it.

523
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:47,881
Can we leave tonight?

524
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:54,682
It is too dangerous to travel at night.

525
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,480
You will be taken in the morning
to a potato farm.

526
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:03,020
Where can we stay tonight?

527
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:04,864
There is a loft upstairs.

528
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:07,529
You can use that fire pole.

529
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:27,251
(Hillary) That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

530
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,465
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

531
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,636
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

532
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:37,146
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

533
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:39,847
Can you believe they print this trash?

534
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,858
Don't worry about it.

535
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:46,316
You were going to tell
me something about your childhood.

536
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:48,525
When I was a young girl,

537
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,151
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

538
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:53,327
But there was a terrible storm

539
00:48:53,456 --> 00:48:55,781
and the boat sank.

540
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:58,408
I managed to swim to a deserted island

541
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,870
with a young boy, named Nigel.

542
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,579
Together we had to learn to survive.

543
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:09,090
'Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

544
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:12,092
'which Nigel would catch every day.

545
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:15,309
'Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

546
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:20,098
'from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

547
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:24,017
'We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

548
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:26,609
'with dried seaweed and snot.

549
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:29,942
'This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

550
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:32,946
'But sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

551
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,866
'which would periodically
ravage the island.

552
00:49:35,998 --> 00:49:38,750
'The years passed and as we grew up,

553
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:43,419
'we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

554
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,038
'There was no one around to explain this.

555
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,962
'We had to learn by ourselves.

556
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:21,204
'Then one day he went fishing.

557
00:50:21,335 --> 00:50:24,834
'That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

558
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:27,964
'I spent months by myself on that island,'

559
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:31,591
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

560
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,342
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

561
00:50:34,473 --> 00:50:36,549
You can't imagine what it's like

562
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:38,759
to be separated from your family

563
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:40,970
at such a young age.

564
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,896
I think I can.

565
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:51,188
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

566
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:55,901
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

567
00:50:56,036 --> 00:50:58,990
They tried to page her,

568
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,744
but the PA system was on the fritz.

569
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:05,835
I never saw my momma again.

570
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,714
Some people
from the cosmetics department

571
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,129
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

572
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:13,335
Days stretched into weeks.

573
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,628
One February they got jammed up

574
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:18,433
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

575
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:22,342
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

576
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,978
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

577
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:29,192
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

578
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,937
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

579
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:37,236
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

580
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,907
It went something like this.

581
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,087
# Are you lonesome tonight?

582
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:58,382
# Is your kitchen a sight?

583
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:04,932
# Is your wardrobe all run down and bare?

584
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:10,901
# Is your lipstick all smeared?

585
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:15,072
# Are your stockings not sheer?

586
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:21,865
# Do they make your legs
show all your hair?

587
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:27,708
# Do the tears on your pillow

588
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:31,418
# Roll down as you turn?

589
00:52:31,547 --> 00:52:35,711
# Do they short out the blanket?

590
00:52:35,843 --> 00:52:39,461
# And make the sheets burn?

591
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:43,547
# Is your heart filled with pain?

592
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:47,100
# Will you come back again?

593
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:52,935
# Shop at Macy's and love me tonight #

594
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:55,736
Oh, Nick.

595
00:52:56,864 --> 00:52:59,402
(Wood crunches)

596
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:18,173
(Voice singing in German)

597
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:38,277
Whoa! Whoa!

598
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:40,445
Whoa!

599
00:53:40,574 --> 00:53:42,863
All right, this is it.

600
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:45,199
I must leave you here.

601
00:53:46,497 --> 00:53:48,822
Go now, quickly.

602
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:51,495
(Raspy coughing)

603
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:54,877
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

604
00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:57,128
He's just a little hoarse.

605
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:59,333
Giddy-up, Mario.

606
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:04,972
# It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog... #

607
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:14,273
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

608
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:18,728
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

609
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:21,982
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

610
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:27,821
Come this way.

611
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,442
- (French accent) What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

612
00:54:58,568 --> 00:55:01,485
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

613
00:55:01,613 --> 00:55:07,283
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

614
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,115
We shall see.

615
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:26,046
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

616
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:36,594
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

617
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,566
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

618
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:44,437
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

619
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:47,857
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

620
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:51,740
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

621
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:54,872
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

622
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:59,162
Forgive us, Mr Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

623
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:05,084
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

624
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:08,966
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

625
00:56:09,096 --> 00:56:10,840
Very well.

626
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,892
This is Chevalier, Montage, Détente,

627
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:22,518
Avant Garde, and Déjà Vu.

628
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:26,065
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

629
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,863
I don't think so.

630
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:35,121
Over there...

631
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:40,205
Croissant, Soufflé, Escargot,

632
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:42,791
and Chocolate Mousse.

633
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:45,543
(Chocolate Mousse grunts)

634
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:52,254
Now, Mr Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

635
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:55,556
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

636
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:59,385
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

637
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:01,762
<i>Sacrebleu.</i>

638
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,356
We'll have to move out tonight.

639
00:57:05,485 --> 00:57:07,561
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

640
00:57:07,696 --> 00:57:09,938
Prepare the gear for the jump.

641
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:11,865
<i>Cordon bleu. Zut!</i>

642
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:14,946
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

643
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:18,494
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

644
00:57:18,623 --> 00:57:21,743
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

645
00:57:21,877 --> 00:57:25,246
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

646
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,831
who, 15 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

647
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:32,253
It all sounds like some bad movie.

648
00:57:39,144 --> 00:57:44,482
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

649
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:48,854
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

650
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:52,272
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

651
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:57,911
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

652
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:22,765
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

653
00:58:22,895 --> 00:58:26,229
Life is filled with its little miseries.

654
00:58:26,357 --> 00:58:30,402
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

655
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:33,399
in a mature and adult fashion.

656
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,834
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

657
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:51,497
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

658
00:58:56,095 --> 00:59:00,140
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

659
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,757
He seems a good chap, really.

660
00:59:02,893 --> 00:59:05,384
How wonderful you've returned to me,

661
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:09,056
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

662
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:12,892
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

663
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:17,607
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

664
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,197
And by all rights I should be.

665
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:22,901
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

666
00:59:23,038 --> 00:59:26,242
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

667
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,162
I tried to get them to save you too.

668
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:32,082
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

669
00:59:32,256 --> 00:59:37,381
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

670
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:40,678
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

671
00:59:40,806 --> 00:59:46,595
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

672
00:59:52,484 --> 00:59:54,393
Latrine!

673
00:59:57,948 --> 01:00:01,364
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

674
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:03,367
We never had a chance.

675
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:05,369
It was a slaughter.

676
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:08,581
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

677
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:12,042
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

678
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,546
(Gunshots)

679
01:00:13,672 --> 01:00:17,207
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

680
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:28,517
(Clicking of tap-heeled dancers)

681
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:32,481
Take this.

682
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:39,584
Grenade.

683
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:55,095
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

684
01:01:55,231 --> 01:01:57,307
We'll have to make a break for it.

685
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,979
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

686
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:01,225
Wait!

687
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:20,213
Nice shooting.

688
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:21,502
My man!

689
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,694
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

690
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:53,077
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1:00 am.

691
01:02:53,205 --> 01:02:55,114
What about the American?

692
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:58,036
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

693
01:02:58,168 --> 01:03:01,086
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

694
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:05,127
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

695
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:12,925
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

696
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:15,845
how do you say, indispensable?

697
01:03:15,978 --> 01:03:17,804
Indispensable.

698
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:21,307
That's what I thought.

699
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:25,391
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

700
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:27,984
I got a truck to meet.

701
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:34,823
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

702
01:03:34,955 --> 01:03:39,118
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

703
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,327
I know how you feel about me.

704
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:44,581
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

705
01:03:44,714 --> 01:03:48,214
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

706
01:03:48,343 --> 01:03:51,463
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

707
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:53,719
That's exactly what I mean.

708
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:58,925
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

709
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:01,434
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

710
01:04:03,817 --> 01:04:05,525
Latrine.

711
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:10,686
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

712
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:13,825
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

713
01:04:13,952 --> 01:04:15,825
Not the bird, you fool!

714
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:19,951
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

715
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:22,621
Look, a message.

716
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:28,422
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

717
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:33,176
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

718
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:44,263
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

719
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:47,899
No, I'm not.

720
01:04:48,027 --> 01:04:51,194
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

721
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,193
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

722
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:57,776
I'm Mel Tormé.

723
01:04:59,038 --> 01:05:00,912
Oh.

724
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,458
That was close.

725
01:05:04,585 --> 01:05:08,453
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

726
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:12,539
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

727
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:16,840
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

728
01:05:16,973 --> 01:05:20,555
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

729
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:22,891
He came to us with no credentials.

730
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,184
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

731
01:05:27,316 --> 01:05:29,854
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

732
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:32,737
Nigel, what are you saying?

733
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:37,441
How do we know
he's not Mel Tormé?

734
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:52,914
Look, he's at the jukebox.

735
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,304
(# "Straighten Out The Rug")

736
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,971
# Well, get out on that floor
And hit that rug tonight

737
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:13,434
# Well, get out on that floor
And hit that rug tonight

738
01:06:14,196 --> 01:06:17,647
# We're gonna shake that rug
Till the early, early light

739
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:21,943
# I said, "Romp and stomp and slide
like the devil on a thread"

740
01:06:22,704 --> 01:06:26,322
# Yeah I said, "Romp and stomp and slide
like a devil on a thread"

741
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:30,492
# Well, stand back, baby
I believe I'm gonna fray my edge

742
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:34,794
# You gotta straighten the rug
Yeah, straighten the rug

743
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,293
# You gotta give it a push

744
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,301
# Yeah, give it a shove

745
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,181
# Well, well, rug cutting
Honey, now baby

746
01:06:42,307 --> 01:06:44,134
# Won't you give it a tug?

747
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:09,035
# You better watch that mean old rug
don't bite you back

748
01:07:10,335 --> 01:07:14,000
# You better watch that mean old rug
don't bite you back

749
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,879
# Well, I'm telling it ain't
no back door mat

750
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:20,381
# You got to straighten the rug

751
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:22,220
# Yeah, straighten it out

752
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,845
# You gotta give it a shove

753
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,133
# Yeah, scream and shout

754
01:07:27,268 --> 01:07:31,313
# Well, rug cutting, honey
You know what I'm talking about

755
01:07:31,439 --> 01:07:35,603
# Well, rug cutting, honey
Come on and straighten it out

756
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:38,649
# And there's nobody

757
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,531
# I'd rather straighten it with

758
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:44,612
# Than you #

759
01:07:57,048 --> 01:07:58,756
This is not Mel Tormé.

760
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:29,620
Oh, Nick.

761
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,535
Yes?

762
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:37,333
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

763
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:42,041
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

764
01:08:42,176 --> 01:08:44,928
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

765
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,177
You must know that when we were
together last night,

766
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:49,975
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

767
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,508
And now that you know?

768
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:57,432
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

769
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:02,857
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

770
01:09:02,988 --> 01:09:07,365
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

771
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:11,111
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

772
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,499
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

773
01:09:18,629 --> 01:09:21,748
(Orchestra plays romantic music)

774
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:32,929
(Cicada chirps)

775
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:41,609
(Chirping continues)

776
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:49,482
(Chirping sinks)

777
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:07,173
I've spotted the herd.

778
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,840
They're the key to the whole plan.

779
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:12,806
Now, we're here.

780
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:16,726
Every morning at 7:15

781
01:10:16,853 --> 01:10:20,222
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

782
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:23,108
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

783
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:27,066
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

784
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:32,191
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

785
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,818
Then we'll break away from the other cows

786
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,196
and enter the generator building here.

787
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:41,994
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

788
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:46,292
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

789
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:48,915
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

790
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:52,467
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

791
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:55,717
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

792
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:58,602
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

793
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:14,950
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

794
01:11:15,077 --> 01:11:17,153
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

795
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:20,953
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

796
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:24,333
All right, be an asshole.

797
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,134
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

798
01:11:40,394 --> 01:11:43,395
(lmitates cow mooing)

799
01:11:43,522 --> 01:11:46,192
All right, let's go. Double time.

800
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:59,531
(Du Quois) We only have five minutes to
get to the circuit box and throw the switch.

801
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:02,617
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

802
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:06,284
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

803
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,255
- I can only see one.
- Ow!

804
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:11,872
There girl, move along.

805
01:12:19,558 --> 01:12:22,096
(Nigel) Stay behind the guards.

806
01:12:22,227 --> 01:12:25,845
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

807
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:28,021
OK, now!

808
01:12:29,943 --> 01:12:31,603
I think we did it.

809
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:39,820
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

810
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:42,705
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

811
01:12:43,749 --> 01:12:45,575
(Du Quois) <i>Mon Dieu!</i>

812
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,995
(Gasps with pleasure)

813
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:54,085
Nigel, you OK?

814
01:12:54,217 --> 01:12:56,009
Oh, yeah.

815
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:58,010
Let's go.

816
01:12:58,138 --> 01:13:02,883
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

817
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:06,268
I just wanted to take a... Uh! ...rest.

818
01:13:11,693 --> 01:13:14,362
(Leaves rustle and crackle)

819
01:13:17,824 --> 01:13:20,659
(Leaves remain silent)

820
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:28,324
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

821
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,164
Three more minutes.

822
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:33,538
Then we can cut the wire.

823
01:13:58,156 --> 01:14:00,314
There it is.

824
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:50,702
Lovely.

825
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:08,555
You're all right now. I'm here.

826
01:15:09,435 --> 01:15:11,392
It's all right.

827
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:19,270
Hey.

828
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:29,868
(Gasps)

829
01:15:29,997 --> 01:15:33,366
(Choking and gasping continues)

830
01:15:38,589 --> 01:15:39,668
Here, here.

831
01:15:47,097 --> 01:15:49,137
<i>Vive la France!</i>

832
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:06,235
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

833
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:08,857
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

834
01:16:08,994 --> 01:16:13,157
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

835
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:16,041
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

836
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:17,496
(Cocks gun)

837
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:21,043
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

838
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:26,130
So, it is you who is the traitor!

839
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:45,778
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

840
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:48,859
Now, get over there and...
Arrrgh!

841
01:16:54,289 --> 01:16:57,574
- Dr Flammond.
- Nick!

842
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,282
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

843
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,911
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

844
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:05,752
Thank God, but how ironic.

845
01:17:05,883 --> 01:17:10,047
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

846
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:18,471
Nice work.

847
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,665
Nigel.

848
01:17:43,796 --> 01:17:45,835
Very clever, my darling.

849
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,634
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

850
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:52,294
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

851
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:56,297
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

852
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:59,637
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

853
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,937
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

854
01:18:03,065 --> 01:18:05,105
Comrades?

855
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:09,104
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

856
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:12,654
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

857
01:18:12,783 --> 01:18:16,863
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

858
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:19,154
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

859
01:18:19,289 --> 01:18:23,121
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.

860
01:18:27,172 --> 01:18:29,414
(Phone rings)

861
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,051
(Man shouts in German)

862
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,977
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

863
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:52,188
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

864
01:18:59,955 --> 01:19:02,031
What happened?

865
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:06,873
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

866
01:19:07,003 --> 01:19:09,755
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

867
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:14,091
And what does he want us to do now?

868
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:17,006
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

869
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,083
Latrine!

870
01:19:49,212 --> 01:19:53,210
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

871
01:19:53,341 --> 01:19:56,295
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

872
01:19:56,427 --> 01:20:00,046
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

873
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:02,304
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

874
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:06,098
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 18:00.

875
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:09,645
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

876
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:12,016
especially at this time of year.

877
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:14,938
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

878
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:16,648
Good luck.

879
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:29,833
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

880
01:22:48,973 --> 01:22:52,342
(# Theme music to "Bonanza")

881
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,397
Goodbye.

882
01:23:31,057 --> 01:23:33,974
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

883
01:23:34,101 --> 01:23:36,177
I will not leave without my daughter.

884
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:39,229
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn...

885
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:42,891
...and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

886
01:23:43,027 --> 01:23:45,185
Wait. There they are!

887
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:53,029
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

888
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:56,163
My Darling.
How I feared I would never see you again.

889
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,662
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

890
01:23:58,793 --> 01:24:02,458
Please. There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

891
01:24:02,588 --> 01:24:05,708
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

892
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:10,550
No, father. I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower...

893
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:12,755
...under the iron fist of oppression,

894
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,966
as long as a child cries out in the night...

895
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,430
...or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

896
01:24:19,563 --> 01:24:20,892
No, Hillary.

897
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,977
It is much too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

898
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:27,194
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

899
01:24:27,321 --> 01:24:29,990
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

900
01:24:30,115 --> 01:24:34,279
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

901
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:38,623
And as long as we do,
we know that we are not alone in our fight.

902
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:42,367
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

903
01:24:42,503 --> 01:24:45,788
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

904
01:24:45,923 --> 01:24:51,759
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

905
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:53,796
Hilary. I want you to be with me.

906
01:24:53,931 --> 01:24:57,880
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

907
01:24:58,018 --> 01:25:02,181
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say so. Say it now.

908
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:07,474
Want!
Want... more than anything!

909
01:25:07,611 --> 01:25:10,647
Take me. Take me with you!

910
01:25:23,835 --> 01:25:28,212
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

911
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,207
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

912
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:37,545
Goodbye, Déjà Vu.
I will always remember you.

913
01:25:37,682 --> 01:25:41,597
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.

914

Ridin' waves to blast the pigeons

I pray there'll come a day

968
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:10,342
when by my side you'll stay.

969
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:16,185
And you, you will always be
a love that's true to me.
