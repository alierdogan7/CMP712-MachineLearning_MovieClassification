1
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:11,998
<i>A long time ago, a powerful demon fox</i>
<i>appeared with nine tails.</i>

2
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:13,930
<i>With its powerful tails,</i>

3
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,135
<i>it could smash mountains</i>
<i>and create tidal waves.</i>

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,511
<i>A band of Ninjas rose to</i>
<i>defend their village from attack.</i>

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,543
We have to wait until
the Fourth Hokage gets here!

6
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,117
We can't let it get any closer
to our village!

7
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:38,591
<i>One great Ninja was able to</i>
<i>imprison the monster,</i>

8
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:40,923
<i>but died in the process.</i>

9
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:47,203
<i>This Ninja was known as...</i>
<i>the Fourth Hokage.</i>

10
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:05,548
Naruto!

11
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:07,658
Why did you do such a thing?!

12
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,085
You're really gonna get it this time!

13
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,133
I don't care!

14
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,461
You know your problem?

15
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,836
You can't do the things I do!

16
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:23,939
<i>Only I can do this!

17
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:26,339
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!

18
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:27,906
There's a problem, sir!

19
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:28,709
Lord Hokage!

20
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:30,776
What is it?

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,411
Did that Naruto do something again?

22
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,682
Yes. He climbed onto
the Mountainside <i>Images....</i>

23
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:39,884
And he vandalized and
graffitied all over them!

24
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:50,897
Wait!

25
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,132
Ha <i>ha....</i>

26
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,237
Why should I?

27
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,170
Hey, Naruto!

28
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:08,081
How did you suddenly get here,
Iruka Sensei?

29
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,087
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?

30
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:15,221
Now listen, Naruto.

31
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:19,824
You failed the last graduation test
and the one before that.

32
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,728
This is no time
to be goofing off, you fool!

33
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:27,963
We will have a re-test on
the Transformation Jutsu!

34
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,676
Even those who already passed
will take it!

35
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:31,835
Whaaaat?!

36
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,413
Sakura Haruno. Here I <i>go....</i>

37
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:35,136
Transform!

38
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:40,947
<i>OK!

39
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,754
I did it!

40
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,855
Cha!

41
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,218
Did you see that, Sasuke?

42
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:49,920
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

43
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:50,752
Yes.

44
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,495
O-OK.

45
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,932
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,237
This is a real pain.

47
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:07,840
And it's all your fault.

48
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,312
Like I care!!

49
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:13,042
<i>OK...</i>

50
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,551
<i>Good luck, Naruto...</i>

51
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:18,917
Transform!

52
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,129
How was it?

53
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:32,535
I call it the "Sexy Jutsu"!

54
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,766
You fool!
Stop making idiotic spells!

55
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:52,650
<i>Darn....</i>

56
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:54,389
<i>Darn....</i>

57
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:58,154
I won't let you go home
unless you clean that all up.

58
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,097
I don't <i>care....</i>

59
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,666
There's nobody home anyway.

60
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,306
Naruto...

61
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,470
What is it this time?

62
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,743
What I meant <i>was....</i>

63
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:20,976
If you clean up all that mess,
I'll buy you ramen tonight.

64
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:24,213
Huh?!

65
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:29,018
Yes!
I-I will finish it in no time!

66
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,461
<i>Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

67
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:44,671
Naruto.

68
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,904
Why did you vandalize those faces?

69
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:52,280
Don't you know who
the Hokage leaders are?

70
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,218
Of course, I do!

71
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,051
I know they earned the title
Lord Hokage

72
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,731
because they were the best Ninja
of their time, right?

73
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,827
Especially the Fourth Hokage
was a hero

74
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:14,873
who saved the village from
the nine-tail demon fox.

75
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,801
Then why did you do that?

76
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,375
Because I'll become a Hokage myself.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,873
And I'll be the greatest Hokage
of all time!

78
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:30,013
So that everyone will finally
learn to accept me!

79
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,283
By the way, Sensei,
I have a favor to ask.

80
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,289
You want another bowl?

81
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,761
<i>Mmmm....No....</i>

82
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:41,425
Can I borrow that Leaf headband
for a while?

83
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,093
This?

84
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:44,658
No no!

85
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:49,837
This is worn only by those who
have graduated from Ninja Academy.

86
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,009
Tomorrow, you <i>will....</i>

87
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,777
You're so mean!

88
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,012
So that's why you took off
your <i>goggles....</i>

89
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,380
Humph...
<i>One more bowl please!

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,454
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.

91
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,019
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.

92
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,160
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,862
<i>Oh no...</i>

94
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:16,064
<i>Of all the! That is my weakest Jutsu!</i>

95
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>But still...</i>
<i>I will do it no matter what!</i>

96
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,145
Clone Jutsu!

97
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:40,690
Disqualified!

98
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,018
Iruka Sensei.

99
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:48,923
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.

100
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,566
And he managed to come up
with something.

101
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,039
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?

102
00:06:55,675 --> 00:07:00,806
Mizuki Sensei...
All the others created three or more clones.

103
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,046
Naruto created just one.

104
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,982
And it's practically useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.

105
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,292
I'm a Ninja now!

106
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,562
You did well. That's my son.

107
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,695
Congratulations for your graduation.

108
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,532
I'll cook something good tonight!

109
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,500
Look at that one.

110
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:33,039
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.

111
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,507
Serves him right.

112
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,273
Imagine what would happen
if he became a Ninja.

113
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,879
Isn't that the boy
who is <i>actually....</i>

114
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,477
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that.

115
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:55,263
Iruka.
We need to talk later.

116
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:56,658
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,609
Iruka Sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.

118
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,639
Then why only me?

119
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:15,882
He wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.

120
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,413
You both don't have parents.

121
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,059
But I really wanted to graduate.

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,266
Heh... I guess I have no <i>choice....</i>

123
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,639
I'll let you in on a big secret.

124
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,338
<i>Secret?</i>

125
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:41,304
Iruka.

126
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,372
What is it, Lord Hokage?

127
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:48,714
I know how you feel. <i>But....</i>

128
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:53,585
Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents....like you.

129
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:01,797
Let me go!

130
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,426
My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!

131
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,636
Wake up, Iruka Sensei!

132
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,339
What's the matter?

133
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,009
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!

134
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,709
I heard that <i>Naruto....</i>
stole the Scroll of Sealing.

135
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,416
The Scroll of Sealing?!

136
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:26,684
Let's <i>see....</i>

137
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,589
The first Jutsu <i>is....</i>
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?

138
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,557
What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?

139
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,759
Lord Hokage!
We can't forgive him!

140
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:39,896
This is not just a prank!

141
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:43,840
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!

142
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:45,776
Depending on its <i>use....</i>

143
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:49,912
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!

144
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,311
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!

145
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,312
Yes, sir!

146
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,430
<i>Where did you go... Naruto?</i>

147
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:19,669
<i>I will tell everyone in the village</i>
<i>about this and eliminate Naruto...</i>

148
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:23,246
<i>Then the Scroll of Sealing</i>
<i>will be mine!</i>

149
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,365
Hey you, Naruto!

150
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,936
You found me...

151
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,905
And I've only learned one Jutsu.

152
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,204
<i>He's been practicing the Jutsu...</i>

153
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,476
<i>until he's become</i>
<i>this exhausted and dirty?</i>

154
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,813
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!

155
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,987
You're gonna let me graduate
if I can do it!

156
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:06,749
Isn't it true that I can graduate if
I can do one of the Jutsu written here?

157
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,987
Who told you that?

158
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:14,958
Mizuki Sensei. He told me
about this scroll, and this <i>place....</i>

159
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,268
Mizuki did?!

160
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm impressed you found this place.

161
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:30,104
I see <i>now....how</i> it is.

162
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,584
Naruto, give me that scroll.

163
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:40,251
Wait, <i>wait....</i>
What's going on here?

164
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:45,253
Naruto! Never give him that scroll!

165
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:50,231
It is a dangerous object that contains
forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.

166
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,035
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!

167
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:55,469
W-Wha...?

168
00:11:56,075 --> 00:12:00,944
Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of
you holding that scroll!

169
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:01,904
Huh?

170
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,683
What are you saying, Mizuki!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!

171
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,220
I will tell you the truth.

172
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:12,549
Idiot! Don't do that!

173
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:17,328
After an incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.

174
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:20,226
A rule?

175
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,333
That is, Naruto, a rule everybody
but you knows.

176
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,466
Except me?!
What is it?

177
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,371
Stop it, Mizuki!

178
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,971
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!

179
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:38,349
Huh?

180
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:43,080
You are actually the Demon,
Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

181
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:46,147
who killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!

182
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:47,492
Stop it!

183
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:52,122
Everyone has been
deceiving you ever since.

184
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,358
Didn't you find it strange?

185
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:58,069
Why everyone hated you so much?

186
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:03,105
No! No! No! No! No!

187
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,068
<i>Naruto....</i>

188
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,606
Nobody accepts you.
That's why Iruka hates you so much!

189
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:16,979
<i>Iruka... Naruto grew up</i>
<i>without the love of parents.</i>

190
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:21,720
<i>Everyone avoids him like</i>
<i>the plague after what happened.</i>

191
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:27,424
<i>That's why he keeps misbehaving.</i>

192
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,333
<i>It's the only way for him to get</i>
<i>any attention or acknowledgement.</i>

193
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,866
<i>He pretends to be tough,</i>
<i>but inside he is really hurting.</i>

194
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,068
Die, Naruto!

195
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,146
Naruto!
Get down!

196
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,490
<i>Why....?</i>

197
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,059
Because you and I are the same.

198
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:05,966
After my parents died,

199
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:10,833
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.

200
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,207
I wasn't a good student in school.

201
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,980
I was the class <i>clown....</i>
because I wanted people to notice me.

202
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:26,589
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.

203
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:31,187
It was so hard.

204
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,623
Isn't that right, Naruto?

205
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:41,570
You felt so lonely....right?
And you suffered inside, right?

206
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,637
I'm sorry, <i>Naruto.....</i>

207
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:50,811
If I had been more responsible,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.

208
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:55,686
Don't make me laugh!

209
00:14:55,988 --> 00:15:00,254
Iruka has always hated you,
ever since you killed his parents!

210
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:04,789
He's just saying all that
to get the Scroll of Sealing back!

211
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,129
Naruto!

212
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,833
Narutoooooo!

213
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:18,376
He is not the type of kid
who will change his mind.

214
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,676
He will take revenge against
our village using that scroll!

215
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,983
Didn't you see his eyes?
Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.

216
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,287
No....
Naruto....isn't....like that at all!

217
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:42,827
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.

218
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,192
I'll take care of you later!

219
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,332
I-I won't let you....

220
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,338
Well, well.

221
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,870
Mizuki has a big mouth!

222
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,281
Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.

223
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:02,050
He might unleash
the power locked up inside him.

224
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:07,057
The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.

225
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,325
There's a slight chance
he might actually release

226
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:14,662
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside him!

227
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:16,962
If that <i>happens....</i>

228
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:20,435
<i>I've found him!</i>

229
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:23,338
Naruto!

230
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,472
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!

231
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:29,646
Give me that scroll, quick!
Mizuki is after the scroll!

232
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,989
It can't <i>be....</i>

233
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,238
Why is it, Naruto?

234
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,131
<i>How....</i>

235
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,737
did you know I wasn't <i>Iruka....?</i>

236
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,685
Because I'm Iruka.

237
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:10,548
I see.

238
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,423
What's in it for you to protect
the one who killed your family?

239
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:20,195
I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot
like you get that scroll!

240
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,826
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.

241
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,102
Same?

242
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,302
Anyone can do whatever
he wants once he has the scroll.

243
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,478
There is no way that that <i>monster....</i>

244
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:37,072
that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!

245
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,176
You're <i>right....</i>

246
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,484
<i>I guess it was true all along!</i>

247
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:51,296
<i>See, Iruka Sensei never really</i>
<i>cared for me at all!</i>

248
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,424
...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.

249
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,263
But Naruto is different!

250
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:02,472
I know that he is an exceptional student.

251
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:04,835
He works very hard,

252
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:09,114
and he's single-minded
and clumsy at the same time.

253
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:15,212
No one accepts him, but he knows
the meaning of human suffering.

254
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,856
He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.

255
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:20,551
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Vlllage Hidden in the Leaves!

256
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,524
You are so gullible.
Iruka!

257
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:32,193
I was gonna take you down later,
but I have changed my mind.

258
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,038
Die!

259
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,236
<i>I guess this is the end for me...</i>

260
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:45,713
<i>Naruto?!</i>

261
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,418
You surprised me there, freak.

262
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,127
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

263
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:01,231
Shut up! I can take care of a kid
like you with a single blow!

264
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,133
Why don't you try then?
I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!

265
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:10,168
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

266
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,070
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

267
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,016
<i>Naruto! You've...</i>

268
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,729
<i>Those aren't just images but actual clones!</i>
<i>That's an advanced Ninjutsu!</i>

269
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:33,627
What's <i>this....?</i>

270
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,590
What's the matter?
C'mon!

271
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:40,331
Weren't you gonna get me
with one blow? Here!

272
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:43,074
In that <i>case....</i>
I'll come to you.

273
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,818
I kinda got carried away.
Iruka Sensei, are you okay?

274
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:05,525
Yeah.

275
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,689
<i>He's really something.</i>

276
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,928
<i>Maybe it is true.</i>

277
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,028
<i>Maybe he will surpass all</i>
<i>the Hokage leaders...</i>

278
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:20,410
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

279
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:25,842
Has anyone found Naruto yet?

280
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:26,877
No.

281
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:30,048
Darn, this is going to be <i>bad....</i>

282
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,251
There's no need to worry anymore.

283
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,584
Lord Hokage!

284
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,222
He'll be back soon.

285
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,757
Sensei, how much longer?

286
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,430
<i>OK, you may open your eyes now.

287
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,779
<i>Congratulations....on</i> your graduation.

288
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,524
In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!

289
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,135
Iruka Sensei!

290
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,730
That hurts!

291
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,897
<i>Naruto...</i>

292
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:24,704
<i>I was going to lecture to you...</i>

293
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:28,303
<i>that the road gets more difficult</i>
<i>now that you're a Ninja.</i>

294
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:33,080
<i>But I guess I'll just wait to tell you</i>
<i>that until we get to the ramen stand...</i>

295
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:13,348
W-What do you want, you little shrimp?
Quit following me!

296
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,249
You're smaller than me and

297
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,447
you're saying that you're gonna
become the Fifth Hokage?

298
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,650
I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's
grandson or not.

299
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:23,285
It's not that easy to be a Hokage!

300
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:27,864
If you want it that bad,
you're gonna have to beat me first!

301
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,934
Next episode:
"My Name Is Konohamaru!"

302
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:33,596
Watch my outstanding performance!
