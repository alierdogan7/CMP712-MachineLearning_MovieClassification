Well, no. Not exactly.

I defended the first guy they arrested.

he was found innocent and set free,

00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,513
They're gonna nuke
this guy Norton this weekend.

498
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,890
Looks like it.

499
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,686
You got one huge responsibility,
taking on this murder case.

500
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,146
You screw up,
and those boys get fried.

501
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,232
I know.

502
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,275
So you think you know
what you're doin'?

503
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,695
Yeah, I think I know what I'm doin'.

504
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,824
'Cause you didn't look like you knew
what you were doin' today
in that courtroom.

505
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,035
Why is that?
Well, it's a lot of procedure.
That's all.

506
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,330
I mean, I'll learn it as I go.
Learn as you go?

507
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,417
Yeah. Yeah.
Didn't they teach that
in law school?

508
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:10,047
No. That's not what they teach you.
They teach you contracts,
precedents, interpretations.

509
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,551
Then the firm that hires you,
they teach you procedures.

510
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,303
Or you could go to court
and watch.

511
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,098
So why didn't you
go to court and watch?

512
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,769
Because between your father's garage
and working nights,
when was I supposed to go?

513
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:27,440
I thought maybe this summer
I would take off a couple of months.

514
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,150
But it ain't no big deal.

515
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,195
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

516
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:39,201
I don't know how you can be so sure
when you don't know what it is
you're supposed to know.

517
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,414
It's a procedure. Like rebuilding
a carburetor has a procedure.

518
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,626
You know when you rebuild a carburetor,
the first thing you do is you take
the carburetor off the manifold?

519
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,629
Supposing you skipped
the first step?

520
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,175
And, while you're replacing one of
the jets, you accidentally drop the jet.

521
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:58,262
It goes down the carburetor,
rolls along the manifold
and goes into the head. You're fucked.

522
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,974
You just learned the hard way
that you gotta remove
the carburetor first. Right?

523
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,019
So that's all
that happened to me today.
I learned the hard way.

524
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,313
Actually, it was
a good learning experience for me.

525
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,610
All right. Is there any way
I could help out
in this procedure situation?

526
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,321
Yeah. Keep bailing me out.

527
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,823
There is one problem.
We can't afford
to keep bailing you out.

528
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,825
I already cashed in
half the traveler's checks.

529
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,953
I didn't want to cash them in,
but I didn't want
to bounce a check,

530
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:27,500
so I tried hustling the money,
but I got stiffed, so I had to cash in
the traveler's checks.

531
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:31,045
What do you mean you got stiffed?
Did you say you got stiffed?

532
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,817
' 'Cause I'll always come back to you '

533

535
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,974
Hey. Vincent La Guardia Gambini.

- His name's J.T.
- [Vinny] J.T.

537
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:35,150
I believe you and Lisa played
a game of pool for $200 which she won.
I'm here to collect.

538
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,239
- How about if I just kick your ass?
- Oh, a counteroffer.

539
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:44,910
That's what we lawyers...
I'm a lawyer-
We lawyers call that a counteroffer.

540
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,997
Let me see. This is
a tough decision
you give me here.

541
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,667
Get my ass kicked
or collect $200. Hmm.

542
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,296
What do you think?
I could use a good ass kicking.
I'll be very honest with you.

543
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,049
Hmm.

544
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,719
Nah, I think
I'll just go with the 200.

You like to renegotiate
as you go along, huh?

548
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,982
Okay, then here's my counteroffer.

549
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:20,487
Do I have to kill you?
What if I was just to kick
the ever-lovin' shit out of ya?

550
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,450
- In your dreams.
- Oh, no, no, no. In reality.

551
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,203
If I was to kick the shit out of you,
do I get the money?

552
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,710
If you kick the shit
out of me?

553
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Then you get the money.

555
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,886
- What happened? Rear-ended?
- No. I fell.

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,388
Oh. Okay.

00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,974
Let's see if we agree
on the terms.

558
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,227
The choice now is
I get my ass kicked,

559
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:57,066
or option B,
I kick your ass
and collect the 200.

560
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,781
I'm going with option B:
kicking your ass
and collecting $200.

00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,867

We gonna fight now?

562
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,953
Yeah. First, let me see the money.

00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,748
- I have the money.
- All right. Let me see it.
Show it to me.

564
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,044
- I can get it.
- You can get it?

565
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,297
All right. Get it,
and then we'll fight.

566
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,014

or somebody else's?

569
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,191
It's a simple procedure.
You heard what the judge said.

570
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,194
All he had to do
was say "guilty" or "not guilty."
We could have done that.

- So? What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

Shit, Stan.
I don't want to fire him.
I mean, he's family, you know.

the way her health is right now-

575
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,005
I appreciate that,
but should you die for that?

576
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,090
Wouldn't your mother
be more upset if you die?

00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,886
The thing is, given the chance,
I think he could do a good job.

- No. You're wrong.
- Come on, fellas.

Well, did you use the faucet?
Yeah.

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,392
- Then why didn't you turn it off?
- I did turn it off.

591
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,978
Well, if you turned it off,
why am I listening to it?

592
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:03,192
Did it ever occur to you it could be
turned off and drip at the same time?

593
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,402
No, because if you turned it off,
it wouldn't drip.

594
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,198
Maybe it's broken.
Is that what you're saying?
It's broken?

595

Yeah, that's it. It's broken.

596
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,370
You sure?

597
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,207
I'm positive.

598
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,960
Maybe you didn't
twist it hard enough.

599
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:26,381
- I twisted it just right.
- How could you be so sure?

600
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,223
If you will look in the manual,
you will see that this
particular model faucet...

601
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,893


requires a range
of 10 to 16 foot-pounds
of torque.

602
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,979
I routinely twist to
maximum allowable torquage.

603
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,483
How could you be sure you used
16 foot-pounds of torque?

604
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,445
Because I used
a Craftsman model 10-19,

605
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,783
laboratory edition,
signature series torque wrench.

606
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,830
The kind used by Caltech high-energy
physicists and NASA engineers.

607
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:02,334
Well, in that case,
how could you be sure that's accurate?

608
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,923
[Lips Smack] Because a split second
before the torque wrench
was applied to the faucet handle,

609
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,801
it had been calibrated
by top members...

of Weights and Measures...

and jump into a green car
with a white convertible top...

00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,657
and drive off like the dickens.

Yes, sir, they are.

out for me, please, ma'am?

and he said, "I shot the clerk."

and again he said, "I shot the clerk."

that you dress appropriately?

ask them any questions?

He'll show you how
they got the right shape.

743
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,369
He'll show them to you
in a very special way...

744
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:24,581
so that they appear to have
everything a brick should have.

745
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,417
But there's one thing
he's not gonna show you.

746
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,627
When you look at the bricks
at the right angle,

747

as this playing card.

your lawyer will, right?

763
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,015
There's more to cross-examination
than knowing what to say.

764
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,476
It's knowing what not to say.

765
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,270
Look, let's say he asks
all the possible questions, right?

766
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,358
And the witness has all the answers.
He ends up proving the prosecution's case.

he made something disappear,
Vinny jumped on him.

772
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,257
I mean, he nailed him.
It was, "It's in his pocket."

773
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,760
Or, "He's palming it."
Or, "There's a mirror
under the table."

00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:04,055

Wait a second.
It’s joined in the middle.

775
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,975
There's a spring around it.
It pops it open when
it's inside the tube."

it was Alakazam's
worst nightmare.

00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,273
Then he says to me,
"You know what?
You'd be a good litigator."

819
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,651
I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.
I don't know what a litigator is.

820
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,070
[Both Laughing]

821
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,198
I never thought of becoming a lawyer.

822
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,408
But this Judge Malloy
was from Brooklyn too.

823
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:56,621
I mean, he did it,
so all of a sudden it seemed possible.

824
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,664
So I went to law school.

825
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,751
Then, from time to time,
he would come by,

826
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,838
see how I was doin',
if I needed anything.

827
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,091
He was a nice man.

828
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,177
I mean, to go out of his way
like that for me, you know?

829
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,474
He wanted his son
to follow in his footsteps,
but he became a musician or something.

830
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,728
I remember when I graduated,
he was so proud of me.

831
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:25,274
That's quite a story.
[Laughs]
Yeah.

832
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,653
So, we got some case
ahead of us here, huh?
Oh, yeah.

833
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,155
How do you feel about it?
Oh.

834
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,700
Well, I'd... I'd like to have
the murder weapon.

835
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,203
But other than that,
I feel pretty good.

836
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,832
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

837
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,752
- Hmm.
- Hey, what are you doing this afternoon?

838
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,506
- You're going hunting?
- That's right.

839
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,260
Why are you goin' huntin'?
Shouldn't you be out preparin' for court?

840
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,679
I was thinkin' last night.

841
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,931
If only I knew
what he knows, you know?

842
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,351
If he let me look at his files-
Oh, boy.

843
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,897
Well, I don't get it.
What has gettin' to Trotter's files
have anything to do with hunting?

844
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:09,944
Well, you know,
two guys out in the woods,
guns, on the hunt.

845
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,406
It's a bonding thing, you know?
Show him I'm one of the boys.

846
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,742
He's not gonna let me look at his
files, but maybe he'll relax enough...

847
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,080
to drop his guard so that I can finesse
a little information out of him.

848
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,168
What am I gonna wear?
What are you gonna hunt?

849
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:29,088
I don't know. He's got, uh...
He's got a lot
of stuffed heads in his office.

850
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,299
Heads?

851
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,926
What kind of heads?
I don't know.

852
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:38,014
- He's got a boar, a bear, a couple of deer.
- Whoa. You're gonna shoot a deer?

853
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:44,103
I don't know. I suppose.
I mean, I'm a man's man.
I could go deer huntin'.

854
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:49,442
A sweet, innocent, harmless,
leaf-eatin', doe-eyed, little deer.

855
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,696
Hey, Lisa, I'm not gonna go
out there just to wimp out,
you know?

856
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,116
I mean, the guy will lose respect for me.
Would you rather have that?

857
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,751
What about these pants I got on?
You think they're okay?

858
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,296
Oh!
[Door Opens]

859
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,592
Imagine you're a deer.

860
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,595
You're prancin' along.
You get thirsty.

861
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,639
You spot a little brook.

862
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:24,101
You put your little deer lips
down to the cool, clear water.

863
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,104
Bam! A fuckin' bullet rips off
part of your head!

864
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,524
Your brains are laying
on the ground
in little bloody pieces.

865
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,277
Now I ask you, would you give
a fuck what kind of pants...

866
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:36,197
the son of a bitch
who shot you was wearing?

867
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,212
I'd sure like to get
a look at your files.
[Chuckles]

868
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,881
You would?
Sure.

869
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,510
You got a Xerox machine
over there?
Uh, no.

870
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,722
Oh, that's okay.
I'll have my secretary do it.

871
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,976
Shirley, can you xerox
all the files...

872
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,272
on the Gambini/Rothenstein case
for Mr. Gambini?

873
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,732
Yeah.
Thank you, sweetheart.

874
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,036
What's all that?
Trotter's files, all of 'em.

875
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,456
You stole his files?
I didn't steal his files.

876
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,749
Listen to this.

877
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:32,336
I'm just waiting to finesse him.
I'm startin' to finesse him.
I got him goin'.

878
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:36,090
He offers to have his secretary
copy everything for me.

879
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,302
That's very impressive finessing.

880
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,220
That's not all.

881
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,098
He's lettin' us use
his hunting cabin
as soon as he gets back.

882
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,977
It's in the woods. It's quiet.
He sleeps like a baby
when he's there.

883
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,812
Terrific.
You're a hell of a bonder.

884
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:55,359
What's this?
You, uh, readin' this book?

885
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,738
Yeah.
Do me a favor, okay?
Don't read this book.

886
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,657
Okay?
Thank you very much.

887
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,743
[Lisa]
All right.

888
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,330
Don't you wanna know why
Trotter gave you his files?

889
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,832
I told you why already.

890
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:14,879
He has to, by law. You're entitled.
It's called "disclosure," you dickhead.

891
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,922
He has to show you everything.

892
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,966
Otherwise, it could be a mistrial.

893
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:23,429
He has to give you a list
of all his witnesses.
You can talk to all his witnesses.

894
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,848
He's not allowed any surprises.

895
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,102
They didn't teach you that
in law school either?

896
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,445
Now let me ask you this.

897
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,490
How many different
levels of thickness
have you gone through?

898
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,951
What'd you have for breakfast?
Well-

899
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,413
What's that brown stuff?

900
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,457
[Clicks]
Huh?

901
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,836

[Dinging]

905
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,819
Yesterday, you told me
that freight train hardly ever
comes through here...

906
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,071
at 5:00 a.m. in the morning.
I know.

907
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,532
She's supposed to come through
at 10 after 4:00.

908
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:33,040
Can you participate in an endeavor
in which the ultimate decision
might be death by electrocution?

909
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,876
Ma'am?

910
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:40,214
I think it should be
left up to the victims' families
rather than the courts.

911
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:44,552
Uh-huh.
Uh, the defendants in this case...

912
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,430
are charged with robbing
a convenience store,

913
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,851
and then, in a most cowardly fashion,
shootin' the clerk in the back.

914
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:57,314
Now, if sufficient evidence is offered
to prove these facts,
you think you could...

915
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,732
Fry 'em.

916
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:01,902
She'll do.

917
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,497
Hmm.

918
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,086
[Knocking]
[Door Opens]

919
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,338
Mr. Gambini.

920
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:24,049
Come in, come in.

921
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:37,438
I just got a fax
from the New York State Office
of Judicial Records...

922
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,610
that they have no records...

923
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:47,865
of any Vincent Gambini
ever trying any case
in the entire state of New York.

924
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,577
Uh, you're not gonna find
any, uh- any records...

925
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,580
of Vincent La Guardia Gambini
practicing in any courts.

926
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,665
I just told you that.
You don't understand.

927
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,544
See, 20 years ago,
I became a actor.

928
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:05,132
And there was this very prominent
stage actor in New York.
His name was Vincent Gambini.

929
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,176
Maybe you heard of him.
No.

930
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,178
Never heard of him?
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

931
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,015
I had to change my name,
which I did, legally.

932
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:17,144
- So now I practice law under
my legally changed stage name.
- What name is that?

933
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,105
Jerry Gal-

934
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,859
Jerry Gallo.

935
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,238
[Piece Clatters]

936
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,116
You can still call me Gambini.

938
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,455
Sorry.

939
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:41,085
And what name
did you tell him?
Jerry Gallo.

940
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,587
Jerry Gallo?
The big attorney?

941
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:46,840
Yeah.
Think that was
a smart move?

942
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:49,510
Yeah, well, the man is
a seriously accomplished lawyer.

943
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,137
He checks up on this guy,
his name will show up
all over the place.

944
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,974
His name was in the papers
all last week.
Yeah, I saw that.

945
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,017
But you didn't actually
read the articles.

946
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,562
No.
That's too bad.

947
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,523
Why is that?
'Cause he's dead.

948
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,460
What's the matter with you?

949
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,546
I don't know.

950
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,219
- You're acting like
you're nervous or somethin'.
- Well, yeah, I am.

951
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,471
What are you nervous about?
I'm the one under the gun here.

952
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,683
Trial starts tomorrow.
You wanna know
what I'm nervous about?

953
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,604
I'll tell you what I'm nervous about.
I am in the dark here
with all this legal crap.

954
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:46,775
I have no idea what's going on.
All's I know is you're
screwin' up, and I can't help.

955
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,819
You lent me your little camera,
didn't you?

956
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,780
Oh, Vinny, I'm watchin' you
go down in flames,

957
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,700
and you're bringing me with you,
and I can't do anything about it.

958
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,871
And?
Well, I hate to bring it up,

959
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,707
because you got enough pressure
on you already, but...

960
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,251
we agreed to get married
as soon as you won your first case.

961
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:07,004
Meanwhile, 10 years later,
my niece,

962
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,340
the daughter of my sister,
is gettin' married.

963
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,301
My biological clock is tickin' like this,

964
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:16,013
and the way this case is goin',
I ain't never gettin' married!

965
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,557
Lisa, I don't need this.

966
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,519
I swear to God,
I do not need this right now, okay?

967
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:26,649
I got a judge that’s just achin'
to throw me in jail,

968
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,861
an idiot who wants to fight me
for $200, slaughtered pigs,

969
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,656
giant, loud whistles.

970
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,783
I ain't slept in five days.

971
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,494
I got no money,
a dress-code problem,

972
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,455
and a little murder case which,
in the balance,

973
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,666
holds the lives of two innocent kids,

974
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:49,421
not to mention your...
biological clock,
my career'

975
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,049
your life, our marriage,
and let me see...

976
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,801
What else could we pile on?

01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:59,223
Is there any more shit we could pile on
to the top of the outcome of this case?

Is it possible?

979

are you mocking me

No, I'm not mocking you, Judge.

Then explain that... outfit.

1026
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:05,737
I bought a suit. You've seen it.
Now it's covered in mud.

01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,115
This town doesn't have
a one-hour cleaners,

1028
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,158
so I had to buy a new suit.

1029

Except that the only store
you could buy a new suit in
has got the flu.

The whole store got the flu.

1031
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,752

in a secondhand store.

the evidence in this case
is gonna show...

1046
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,557
that at 9:30 in the morning

both defendants,
Stanley Rothenstein
and William Gambini,

with a white top.

1050
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,614
The evidence is gonna show
that they were seen entering...

1051
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:34,743
the Sac-O-Suds convenience store
in Wahzoo City.

1052
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:39,331

that minutes after
they entered the Sac-O-Suds,

1053
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:43,085
a gunshot was heard
by three eyewitnesses.

the testimony
of the three eyewitnesses...

running out of the Sac-O-Suds...

a moment after
the shots were heard,

that the defendants,

of the sworn testimony.

of murder in the first degree
for William Gambini...

1072
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:50,318
and a verdict of accessory
to murder in the first degree...

1073
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,571
for Stanley Rothenstein...

1074

is bullshit. Thank you.

1082
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:43,914
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's entire
opening statement is argument.

1083
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,375
Objection sustained.
The entire opening statement,

1084
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,630
with the exception of “Thank you,"
will be stricken from the record.

1085
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:57,052

And you, Mr. Gambini-

1087

I get a little nervous sometimes.
I'm gettin' better.
A little nervous?

1116
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,227
I heard a gunshot,
so I looked out the window,

1117
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,606
and I seen them two boys run out,

1118
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,942
get into their car
and drive off like maniacs,

going up on the curb.

Is this the car?
Yes, sir.

Now, when you
viewed my clients,

1127
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,891
how-how-how far away were you?

1128
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:53,395
About 50 feet.
Oh, now, do you think
that's close enough...

1129
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:57,649
to make an accurate, uh, i-

1130
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,443


i-i-i-i-i-i-i...

1131
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,070

01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,530
Yes.

1133
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,702
Mr. Tipton, I see
you wear eyeglasses.

1134
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:14,874
Sometimes.
Would you care to show those eyeglasses
to the jury, please? Thank you.

1135
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,840
Thank you. Now, Mr. Tipton,
were you wearing them that day?

1136
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,008
No.
[Laughs]
You see,

1137
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:28,513
you were 50 feet away,
you made a positive
eyewitness identification,

1138
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,767
and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and yet,

1139
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:36,813
you were not wearing
your necessary
prescription eyeglasses?

Yes.

Mr. Tipton,

1150
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:34,537
when you viewed the defendants
walking from their car...

1151
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:37,790
into the Sac-O-Suds,
what angle was
your point of view?

1152
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:42,170
They was kinda walkin' toward me
when they entered the store.

1153
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,506
And when they left,
what angle was your point of view?

1154
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,175
They was kinda
walkin' away from me.

1155
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:53,139
So would you say you got
a better shot of them going in
and not so much comin' out?

- You could say that.
- I did say that. Would you say that?

1157
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:02,106
- Yeah.
- Is it possible the two "youts"-

rob him and then leave?

1172
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,082
No. They didn't have enough time.

1173
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,042
Well, how much time
was they in the store?

1174
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,753
Five minutes.
Five minutes? Are you sure?

1175
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,797
Did you look at your watch?
No.

1176
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:13,136
Oh, I'm sorry.
You testified earlier that
the boys went into the store...

1177
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,388
and you had just begun
to make breakfast.

1178
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,349
You were just ready to eat,
and you heard a gunshot.
That's right. I'm sorry.

it takes you five minutes
to make breakfast.

That's right.
So you knew that.

what you had?
Eggs and grits.

I like grits too.

You like 'em regular,
creamy or al dente?

Just regular, I guess.

I don't know.
I'm a fast cook, I guess.

I'm sorry. I was all the way over here.
I couldn't hear you.

Did you say you're a fast cook?
That's it?

boiling water soaks into a grit...

the witness' reports reviewed...

1305
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:35,638
by a defense expert
who might then be in a position...

1306
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:38,891
to contradict the veracity
of his conclusions.

Yes, sir?

1308

That is a lucid, intelligent,
well-thought-out objection.

Thank you,
Your Honor.
Overruled.

1310
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,872
Now, Mr. Wilbur,

1311
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,291
these are photos of tires...

1312
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,961
belonging to the defendants' car.

1313
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,421
And these are photos of the tire marks...

1314
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:13,342
left by the assailants' car
as it fled the convenience store.

1315
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,678
Now, are you familiar with these?
Yes, I am.

1316
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,514
Uh-huh. Could you, uh,
elaborate please, sir?

1317
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,518
We compared the tire marks
outside the convenience store...

1318
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,813
with the rear tires
of the defendants' car.

1319
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:29,316
They're the same model and size tire.

1320
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:33,320
Michelin model XGV,
size 75-R, 14-inch wheel.

1321
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:38,617
They're the same size
and model tire.
Anything else, sir?

1322
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,871
Yes, indeed.
The car leaving
the convenience store...

1323
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,415
spun its rear tires dramatically...

1324
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,834
and left a residue of rubber
on the asphalt.

1325
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:50,004
Now I took a sample of that rubber
and analyzed it.

1326
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,090
I also took a sample of the rubber
from the rear tires...

1327
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,010
of the defendants' Buick
and analyzed that too.

1328
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,680
What kind of equipment
did you use to find this out?

1329
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:03,559
I used a Hewlett-Packard 5710-A
dual-column gas chromatograph...

1330
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,728
with flame analyzation detectors.

1333
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:16,780
Now, Mr. Wilbur,
what was the result
of your analysis?

1334
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:21,744
The chemical composition
between the two samples
was found to be identical.

1335
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:24,622
Identical!

1336

Yes, I did.

01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:39,718
Granted.
Mr. Trotter, you may proceed.

1466
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:44,264
Mm-hmm. Uh, Miss Vito,

1467
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,808
what's your current profession?

1468
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,810
I'm an out-of-work hairdresser.

1469
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:52,647
Out-of-work hairdresser.
Now, in what way does that qualify you...

1470
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:55,942
as an expert in automobiles?
It doesn't.

1471
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,903
Well, in what way are you qualified?

1472
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:03,325
Well, my father was a mechanic.
His father was a mechanic.

1473
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:05,535
My mother's father was a mechanic.

1474
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,913
My three brothers are mechanics.

1475
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:10,457
Four uncles on my father's side
are mechanics.

1476
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:13,084
Miss Vito,
your family's obviously qualified,

1477
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:16,755
but, uh, have you ever
worked as a mechanic?

1478
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:20,759
Yeah, in my father's garage, yeah.
As a mechanic?

1479
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:26,056
What'd you do in your father's garage?

1480
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,978
Tune-ups, oil changes,
brake relining, engine rebuilds,

1481
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,481
rebuilt some trannies,
rear ends...
Okay.

1482
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:37,567
Okay. But does being
an ex-mechanic necessarily...

1483
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:40,028
qualify you as being
expert on tire marks?

1484
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,405
No. Thank you.

1485
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:46,117
- Good-bye.
- Sit down and stay there
until you're told to leave.

1486
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:54,417
Your Honor, Ms. Vito's expertise
is in general automotive knowledge.

1487
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:58,171
It is in this area
that her testimony will be applicable.

1488
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:01,633
Now if Mr. Trotter wishes
to voir dire the witness...

1489
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:04,761
as to the extent of her expertise
in this area,

1490
01:43:04,846 --> 01:43:10,058
I'm sure he's gonna be
more than satisfied.

1491
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,810
Okay.

1492
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:15,939
All right. All right.

1493
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:19,109
Now, uh, Miss Vito,

1494
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:24,698
being an expert on general
automotive knowledge,

1495
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,367
can you tell me...

1496
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:33,164
what would the correct ignition timing be
on a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet...

1497
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:38,545
with a 327 cubic inch engine
and a four-barrel carburetor?

1498
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,549
That's a bullshit question.
Does that mean that
you can't answer it?

1499
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:45,051
It's a bullshit question.
It's impossible to answer.

1500
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:49,222
Impossible because
you don't know the answer!
Nobody could answer that question.

1501
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:53,351
Your Honor, I move to disqualify
Miss Vito as a expert witness.

1502
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,562
Can you answer the question?

1503
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,023
No. It is a trick question.

1504
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,483
Why is it a trick question?

1505
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,027
Watch this.

1506
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:04,613
'Cause Chevy didn't make
a 327 in '55.

1507
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:06,865
The 327 didn't come out till '62.

1508
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,243
And it wasn't offered in the Bel Air
with the four-barrel carb till '64.

1509
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:13,079
However, in 1964,

1510
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:17,000
the correct ignition timing would be
four degrees before top dead center.

1511
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:20,962
[Trotter]
Well,

1512
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:26,551
um, she's acceptable, Your Honor.

1513
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,057
Your Honor,
this is a picture...

1514
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:36,144
taken by my fiancée
outside the Sac-O-Suds.

1515
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,229
We agree on this?

1516
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:41,232
Yeah.
Thank you.

1517
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:46,488
I'd like to submit this picture
of the tire tracks as evidence.

1518
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:48,073
Mr. Trotter?

1519
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,786
No objection, Your Honor.

1520
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,169
Ms. Vito,
did you take this picture?

1521
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:04,673
You know I did.
And what is this picture of?

1522
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,092
You know what it's of.
Ms. Vito,

1523
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:10,136
it has been argued by me,

1524
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,682
the defense,
that two sets of guys met up...

1525
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,101
at the Sac-O-Suds
at the same time...

1526
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:19,604
driving identical
metallic mint-green...

1527
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:23,441
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles.

1528
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:27,445
Now, can you tell us,
by what you see in this picture,

1529
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,615
if the defense's case
holds water?

1530
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:42,127
Ms. Vito, please answer the question.

1531
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:46,172
Does the defense's case
hold water?

1532
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,302
No.

1533
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,597
The defense is wrong.

1534
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:56,933
[Spectators Murmuring]

1535
01:45:57,977 --> 01:45:59,978
Are you sure?

1536
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:02,647
I'm positive.

1537
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:05,150
How could you be so sure?

1538
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,945
Because there is no way
that these tire marks were made...

1539
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:11,406
by a '64 Buick Skylark.

1540
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:15,118
These marks were made
by a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1541
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,120
Objection, Your Honor.
Can we clarify to the court...

1542
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,122
whether the witness is stating
opinion or fact?

1543
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,751
- This is your opinion?
- It's a fact.

1544
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:26,963
I find it hard to believe
that this kind of information...

1545
01:46:27,048 --> 01:46:30,592
could be ascertained
simply by looking at a picture.

1546
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:33,511
Would you like me to explain?

1547
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:36,973
- I would love to hear this!
- So would I.

1548
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:42,145
The car that made these two
equal-length tire marks had positraction.

1549
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,272
You can't make those marks
without positraction,

1550
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:49,194
which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

1551
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:51,529
And why not?
What is positraction?

1552
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:55,158
It's a limited slip differential
which distributes power equally...

1553
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:57,160
to both the right and left tires.

1554
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,747
The '64 Skylark
had a regular differential,

1555
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,500
which anyone
who's been stuck in the mud
in Alabama knows,

1556
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:06,878
you step on the gas,
one tire spins,
the other tire does nothin'.

1557
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,379
That's right.

1558
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,800
Is that it?
No, there's more.

1559
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:14,511
You see when the left tire mark
goes up on the curb...

1560
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:16,930
and the right tire mark
stays flat and even?

1561
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:20,225
Well, the '64 Skylark
had a solid rear axle.

1562
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,936
So when the left tire
would go up on the curb,

1563
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,814
the right tire would tilt out
and ride along its edge.

1564
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:29,359
But that didn't happen here.
The tire mark stayed flat and even.

1565
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,070
This car had
an independent rear suspension.

1566
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:37,283
Now, in the '60s, there were only
two other cars made in America...

1567
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,328
that had positraction
and independent rear suspension...

1568
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,413
and enough power
to make these marks.

1569
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:47,502
One was the Corvette,
which could never be confused
with the Buick Skylark.

1570
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:52,257
The other had
the same body length,
height, width, weight,

1571
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:56,010
wheelbase and wheel track
as the '64 Skylark, and that was...

1572
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,763
the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

1573
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:03,852
And because both cars
were made by G.M.,

1574
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,187
were both cars available...

1575
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,065
in metallic mint-green paint?

1576
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:12,527
- They were.
- Thank you, Ms. Vito.

1577
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:16,406
No more questions.
Thank you very, very much.

would you say that everything
Ms. Vito said on the stand...

1597
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:43,952
was a hundred percent accurate?

any way in the world...

1600
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:53,211

were driving made those tire tracks?

1601

and then afterwards you have
to go up to somebody...
