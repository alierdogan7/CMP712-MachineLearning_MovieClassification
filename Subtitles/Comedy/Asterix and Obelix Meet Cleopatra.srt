1
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,070
An old Egyptian poem
goes as follows:

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,796
"Nile, Nile, Nile,
Impetuous and turbulent river.

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,510
You're like our queen,
The source of life."

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,989
Asterix and Obelix
"MISSION CLEOPATRA"

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,992
Our story begins
in a distant past, in Alexandria,

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,714
Or at Alexandria, both are possible,

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,959
In Egypt, at the palace
of the Queen of Queens:

8
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,277
The legendary and elegant Cleopatra.

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,469
Enough!

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,797
I'm saying Egypt's culture
isn't all that great.

11
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,192
There were good times of course.

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,039
I'm just saying the current people are decadent

13
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,315
And that Egypt is merely a Roman province

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,034
A "Province"?
- Yes.

15
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,399
Until further notice, oh Caesar,

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,194
It's not the Romans
who built the Great Pyramids.

17
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,154
Those pointy things?
- And the Sphinx?

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,114
And the Tower of Pharos?
What do you think of that?

19
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,789
That's old news.
- Yesterday...

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,039
Or today, my people are superior!
- In fact, your people are Greek.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,437
And I know better, true Egyptians.

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,868
Enough!

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,477
I can prove to you, oh Caesar,

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,592
That my people are still brilliant.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,439
Yes? How?
Painting portraits?

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,112
No, by building a palace.

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,198
I already have a palace in Rome.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,678
You'll get one in Alexandria too.
So when you visit the "Province",

29
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,396
You'll have somewhere to sleep.
But it will be bigger

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,956
And more luxurious
than all other palaces.

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,435
Bigger than "Caesar's Palace"?
I'd like to see that.

32
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,914
You will see.

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,076
Rome wasn't built in one day.
When will it be finished?

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,915
Three centuries from now?

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,235
Three months.

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,072
Three months?
- Three months?

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,509
Three...
- ...months?

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,474
Within three months,
you'll have your palace.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,114
It'll never be finished in time.

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,792
But fine,
I accept the challenge.

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,475
If you make it,
I'll publicly admit

42
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,798
That your people are still brilliant.
But I have my doubts.

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,556
See you in three months.

44
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,195
He really gets the most of me.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,237
Oh no!
Why is the floor already finished?

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,433
First the water pipes.
Now we have to break up the floor.

47
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,918
Malococsis,
I'm not an architect. I'm a tiler.

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,759
What's that door doing there?
- No idea.

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,555
Ask Edifis, the architect.
- Architects...

50
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,911
Along with cart wrights
they're the most incompetent.

51
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,599
Malococsis!

52
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,838
Edifis.
- I'm happy to see you.

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,672
How are you?
- Terrible!

54
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,712
W...w... What's the problem?

55
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,071
The door in the ceiling.
- That?

56
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,831
I anticipate. Should you want a 
second floor, no problem.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,317
And the tiles. Beautiful, huh?
Feudartifis, come see.

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,758
Are they beautiful or what?
- Beautiful.

59
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,632
Malococsis, trust me.

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,956
I'm not a cart wright.
- You're worse.

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,115
You're running two months behind.
Watch it, I have connections.

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,232
People in high places who could
cause you a great deal of problems.

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,277
Preferably from Alexandria.

64
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,273
Architect Edifis?

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,754
No, that's...
What's it about?

66
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,548
I had to laugh because of the Alexandria joke

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,197
Because people in high places
make me think about monkeys in a tree.

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,470
You don't have to get angry.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,353
My little one, wake up. Breakfast.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,998
Kinepolis

71
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,389
What's this?

72
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,636
Lovendpis

73
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,516
Serge

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,270
Artifis
Clean the water. It stinks!

75
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,873
I don't smell anything

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,033
I was just doing what I always do

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,920
That's your problem

78
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,673
You always do like you always do

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,836
Yes, I always do

80
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,110
The floor is weird. I don't feel it.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,793
Where is it?

82
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,475
Good day.

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,755
Edifis, is Egypt
the most powerful empire in the world?

84
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,390
Yes. No one in the world has more power.

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,030
Of course I don't know everyone.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,511
The Romans and Caesar
have their doubts.

87
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,355
I'm going to show him what we can do.
- Ok.

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,309
I'm building him the most magnificent palace.
- Ok.

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,154
And you, Edifis, will be the architect.

90
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,959
Ok.

91
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,555
I'll be the architect? Meaning...?

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,994
I'll have to...

93
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,791
All my other architects are busy

94
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,509
No, I'm not busy

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,478
He's not busy

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,354
Edifis, you're the only one available.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,229
I have no time. I have to
finish my work for Malococsis.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,437
Only the tiles, but anyway...

99
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,196
My Queen, as your architect
I offer you my services.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,956
When the crocodiles
have fresh water, I could...

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,958
No, you're good,
but too conservative.

102
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,354
Conservative? What does that mean?

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,558
I want something new,
something refreshing.

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,759
But...
Help Edifis. Find some land.

105
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,672
Land?

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,514
As you wish.

107
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,628
Go, Edifis.
You've got three months.

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
Three months? What's the margin?

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,032
Because in three months,
that's merely enough for the plans

110
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,676
And with the foundations,
that's three times four, nine...

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,479
Three months, that's...

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,836
I don't think that's enough.

113
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,517
Edifis!
You've got three months. Exactly!

114
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,749
If you succeed,
I'll cover you with gold.

115
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,591
If you fail,
I'll feed you to the crocodiles.

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,352
Where's the sweet little lamb?

117
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,751
They ate the little lamb?

118
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,559
I should build that palace.

119
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,035
Then I - neither Cleopatra, the rain,

120
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,958
the hail, nor the locusts -

121
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,995
would be Egypt's worst nightmare.

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,675
...17, 18, 19, 20, 21...

123
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,834
...474, 475, 476, 477...
- Boss!

124
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,678
Boss! I rushed myself.

125
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,348
I was thinking about some sort of machine

126
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,513
That would enable us
to reach the top of the pyramid.

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,190
Otis, can't this wait?

128
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,711
What are you counting, boss?
- I'm measuring.

129
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,955
Cleopatra wants a palace for Caesar

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,549
Here. On this stroke of land.

131
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,196
From there... to there.

132
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,273
That would be a big palace

133
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,357
It has to be modern and daring

134
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,558
That's great.
You can stop now.

135
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,432
Leave it to the experts.

136
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,870
No time.
We've got 3 months!

137
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,991
Fine. And how much extra time?

138
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,272
None. We've got 3 months,
not a day more.

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,594
Impossible!
- That's obvious.

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,950
However, urgent jobs
can be interesting.

141
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,037
It's not urgent. It's suicide!

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,676
If I fail, I'll be fed
to the crocodiles. And I saw them.

143
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,996
The crocodiles were fast!

144
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,794
Not good.
I can't finish my machine.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,470
Did you hear me? Did you hear me?

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,515
Yes, no, but...
- Sorry, but I can't be eaten!

147
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,239
Three months starting when?

148
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,789
The clock is ticking.
- They've been working on the gardens for years

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,958
And there's nothing.
Completely nothing.

150
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,593
We need magic.

151
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,799
We need to be magicians. Gods.

152
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,710
Exactly!
We need magical powers.

153
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,713
Yes, it's not good news,
but that's it.

154
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,718
When I was little

155
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,399
My dad told me about this druid.
Geta-Getabemix.

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,079
Getasonixme.

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,839
Something ending in -ix?

158
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,158
Helmutlottix?

159
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,755
It starts with Geta-
And ends in -ininekix.

160
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,155
How about Pommederainettepommedapix?

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,992
A druid.

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,153
A Gallic druid with a magic potion.

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,237
It gives people enormous strength.

164
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,513
Using that potion,
I'll finish in no time and stay alive.

165
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,349
Imhotep, I didn't expect it,
but suddenly I'm freed.

166
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,959
Boss

167
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,759
Magic potions don't exist

168
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,755
Only on children's papyrus drawings

169
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,595
Get us some workers.
Let them start the foundations.

170
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,873
There will be a lane with big statues.
Called "Big Statue Lane".

171
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,198
And there gardens with olive and
orange trees, willows, ....

172
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,312
Yes, and there the palace.
Luxurious and magnificent.

173
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,110
With a huge court yard
and lots of dancers.

174
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,116
And there a small geranium.
Yes, that will be beautiful.

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,151
That will be really beautiful.

176
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,749
You have to picture it!
- Yes.

177
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,550
I'm leaving. See you in a month.
- A month?

178
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,758
Max!
The time to find Getabemix and come back.

179
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,638
Go, Cannabis.

180
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,472
Go, Cannabis!

181
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,638
Let's go!

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,514
You're not moving, Cannabis.

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,319
Move it!
Go, Cannabis!

184
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,839
Where does that Mix live?

185
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,749
Up north.
He lives up north!

186
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,589
Go, go Cannabis.

187
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,958
The year is 50 B.C.

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,551
Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans.
Well, not entirely...

189
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,880
One small village of invincible Gauls
still holds out against the invaders.

190
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,551
And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries
who garrison the fortified camps of

191
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,072
Totorum, Aquarium,
Laudanum and Compendium...

192
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,510
En garde, Gaul!
Defend yourself!

193
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,191
One moment please.

194
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,956
What was that?
- Are you new here?

195
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,793
Yes, we've just been transferred.

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,477
I understand.
This potion is a magic potion.

197
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,839
Made by our druid.
And it makes us stronger.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,399
Look.

199
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,868
Getamanix! Getamenixme!

200
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,716
What kind of country is this?

201
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,394
Incredible, it's minus 8000 degrees here.

202
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,349
I don't have to drink it.
I fell in when I was a little boy.

203
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,757
It gives me extraordinary power.

204
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,473
Look.

205
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,077
Nice, huh?

206
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,236
Good day.
Where's the Gallic village?

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,790
If you follow them,
you'll get there.

208
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,590
I'm not going with you, okay?
I'm staying here.

209
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,631
I'm going to think a little.

210
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,629
Those Romans are good.
They fly better than the others.

211
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,310
It's because of their new helmets.
They're more aerodynamic.

212
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,598
Listen!

213
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,354
Landing could be better.

214
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,760
Excuse me?
Are you Asterixme?

215
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,918
Rix... Asterix.
And this is Obelix.

216
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,395
And the dog is Dogmatix.

217
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,191
Do you know Getabamenix? A druid.

218
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,076
Getafix, excuse me for disturbing,
but you have a visitor.

219
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,958
Sir?
- It's me!

220
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,876
He obviously doesn't know you.

221
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,834
I, I, I'm Edifis.
I'm Tumeris' son, your old friend.

222
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,432
What a pleasant surprise!

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,156
You must be frozen!

224
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,391
I'm very happy to see you...

225
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,550
He's from Alexandria.
Come warm yourself.

226
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,156
That's the magic potion?
- No, chestnut soup.

227
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,669
No.

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,072
I can't sell you any potion.

229
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,235
Not all of it. One cauldron.

230
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,636
No.

231
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,588
He won't budge, it's the principle.

232
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,069
A small cauldron.

233
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,588
No.

234
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,351
A flask.
- No.

235
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,156
A small flask.
- Nah.

236
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,439
A cup. A small cup.
A small cup, that's all.

237
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,792
It's a secret among druids
and not for sale.

238
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,351
A little cup is not much.

239
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,553
I'm sorry, Edifis.

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,718
Okay then

241
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,476
You were my only hope

242
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,238
The small chance of survival

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,838
But I understand

244
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,034
You have other things to worry about

245
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,715
Caesar, the Romans.
Who I'm not fond of.

246
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,158
Maybe I'm going to die.

247
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,078
But it was nice knowing you.

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,275
Gentlemen

249
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,156
Midifix

250
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,914
What's wrong?

251
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,509
Edifis, wait! I've been planning
to consult some manuscripts

252
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,956
In Alexandria's library.
I can't promise anything

253
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,350
But I'll join you.

254
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,752
Thanks! Thanks a lot, Getamanix!

255
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,640
My ship is waiting.
There's enough room for everyone!

256
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,520
There's no time to lose!
- Let's go, Dogmatix.

257
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,678
You're not going to take him, are you?
- Why not?

258
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,032
He's too small for such a big trip.
And Egypt is the land of cats.

259
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,391
Pack your bags and don't
talk about it any longer.

260
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,949
"Don't talk about it..."

261
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,315
Accompanied by the arctic wind,
on board of the Napadelis,

262
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,559
A long journey to Egypt begins.
The land of Ra, the Sun God.

263
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,116
Cleopatra's kingdom
would soon welcome

264
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,515
Asterix, Obelix, and Getafix

265
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,035
And... Dogmatix?

266
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,154
What?

267
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,115
I bark. I'm not allowed 
to talk any more, so I bark.

268
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,398
Fine, take him out before he suffocates.

269
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,990
The bag is empty.
- "Is empty..."

270
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,710
Oh! Such a smart dog! My baby!

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,354
How nice!
He wanted to be with me.

272
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,755
He got in there himself.
- We were just saying...

273
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,150
Three months is a little short.

274
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,152
Artifis is a real hyena.

275
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,358
Do you know hyenas?
Just the same.

276
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,999
He wants me dead and he has many talents.

277
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,834
Like what?
- No. He's rich.

278
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,032
He's got many golden talents.
The Egyptian coin.

279
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,834
In Gaul not the ones with most
talents are the richest.

280
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,709
Do we have to fear anything else?
- No, nothing.

281
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,871
Red Beard! Red Beard!

282
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,959
Men, last time we weren't
very lucky meeting those Gauls

283
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,760
With their magic potion,
and that big dog.

284
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,269
Completely outnumbered,
we had no other option than to...

285
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,396
Run away.

286
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,271
No, not really.

287
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,074
We had to abandon ship
as soon as possible.

288
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,675
Swimming in that ice-cold water.
- No, it was nice.

289
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,877
It was ice cold.
- Fine.

290
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,276
To prevent further trouble,
we'll avoid the Gauls.

291
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,233
But for any others, no pity!

292
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,318
Ship at starboard!

293
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,475
Ready to board, daddy.
Raise the oars.

294
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,313
Calm down, my girl.

295
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,437
Besides, you're not making any sense.

296
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,951
That's what I thought.

297
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,635
How many ships, Boy?

298
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,912
Just one, Captain, a small one.

299
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,433
Egyptian, Captain.

300
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,196
Egyptian.
- Egyptian. Sounds good.

301
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,598
This will get us back on track.
- "Ipso facto et manu militari".

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,716
Triple pod.

303
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,073
Man your posts!
Bosco, Gambler, Mullet, hoist the sails!

304
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,312
Rackham, Worley, Husk, blow the horns!

305
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,473
Get ready to board!

306
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,592
I'm the King of the World!

307
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,159
Pirates!

308
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,995
Help, pirates!

309
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,839
Look, pirates!
Quick, we have to get out of here!

310
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,395
The pirates.

311
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,709
It's us!

312
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,912
The G... The Ga... The Gau...

313
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,309
The Gauls!

314
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,549
This can't be happening!

315
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,393
Is there an axe here?
Watch out. Pardon me.

316
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,959
Calm down there.
- What are they doing?

317
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,558
Cheater!
- It's not fair.

318
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,715
Good. Sink it yourselves!

319
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,478
They know who we are.

320
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,798
They're old friends.
We've met them many times at sea before.

321
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,677
You see,
"Abyssus abyssum invocat."

322
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,793
Enough of those
Latin proverbs.

323
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,635
What's that at the horizon?

324
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,193
The lights of Alexandria.

325
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,868
Let the butterflies of my youth strand.

326
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,318
I don't know why I just said that.

327
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,870
I'm hungry.
- We'll be there in the morning.

328
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,749
That's the Tower of Pharos,
a beacon for ships.

329
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,516
A beacon for ships...
Egyptians are mad.

330
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,475
It's one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The biggest construction ever made by man.

331
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,438
I'm hungrier than a barracuda.

332
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,473
Bar-ra-cu-da...

333
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,038
You wanted to see me, Edifis?

334
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,399
My Queen, the palace is getting along
nicely but there is not enough time.

335
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,110
That's why I asked some Gallic friends,
a druid and 2 warriors

336
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,271
To help me with my task.

337
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,114
I'm here to ask your approval

338
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,436
For their help

339
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,275
If it's ok with you

340
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,192
I wasn't sure

341
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,958
You can ask anyone for help.

342
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,590
Finish the palace in time.
That's all I ask.

343
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,390
Caesar mocks me every day.
I can't afford to lose this bet.

344
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,551
He's completely full of himself!

345
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,949
Completely.

346
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,429
Completely.

347
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,118
Listen...

348
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,998
Make sure you finish in time
and everyone shall receive gold.

349
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,958
I would like that.

350
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,714
Else, the crocodiles.
- I wouldn't like that.

351
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,079
Now go.

352
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,434
He's cute with that mustache.

353
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,193
A little old.

354
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,676
No, the other one.
- No, too fat.

355
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,949
Are you doing this on purpose?

356
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,191
She's probably got an evil personality,
but a lovely nose.

357
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,354
She'll feed me to the crocodiles.
- Very lovely.

358
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,391
Lovely nose,

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,160
and with a little braid on the side.

360
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,673
I'm going to be crocodile food,
and he's dreaming about her nose!

361
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,235
Do crocodiles taste nice?

362
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,514
Could you show a little
more interest in me?

363
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,830
A big ant.

364
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,509
What a crowd!

365
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,231
Looks like the bi-annual
cattle market of Lutetia.

366
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,075
All new breeds of cows are presented there.

367
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,918
A great show!

368
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,435
What kind of cows do you have?

369
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,630
Yes, continue.
There's nothing going on.

370
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,559
Yes, still a lot of work to be done.

371
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,193
And only two months left.

372
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,030
About that magic potion,
when I visited you in Gaul,

373
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,596
you told me you would take care of things.
Now I would like to know...

374
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,030
I said I would see if I could help.
- How do you mean?

375
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,437
Where did all that sand come from?
- That was already here.

376
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,790
All those stones were
delivered by the Nile Express.

377
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,076
Hitting those slaves is very violent.

378
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,119
They're not slaves.
They're construction workers.

379
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,880
They do this voluntarily
and they get paid.

380
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,839
And those whiplashes are for fun?
- No...

381
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,112
Yes... I don't know.
We haven't had any complaints so far.

382
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,836
"Istou"?
- Maybe it means, "Continue."

383
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,315
The signal that the soup has arrived.

384
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,557
No. They're relieved.

385
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,599
Tradition calls for 
them to exchange hair.

386
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,674
Now they're bonded by hair.

387
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,116
It's a different culture.

388
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,153
Do you remember that menhir
I threw at Caius Bonus?

389
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,828
I bet it weighed just as much
as that bunch of stones.

390
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,635
You should ask him.
He's best positioned to answer.

391
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,469
It's a different culture.

392
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,637
Another bill.
I hate paperwork.

393
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,250
Otis, my writer.

394
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,438
Writer, that's a comfortable position.

395
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,673
I don't think there are
any good or bad positions.

396
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,118
If I have to summarize my life,
I'd start with my encounters.

397
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,950
The people who stood up for me
when I was all alone

398
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,511
It's strange that coincidence
determines your fate

399
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,269
Because once you've had
a taste of the good life

400
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,275
It's sometimes hard to find
someone to speak to

401
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,835
The mirror that helps you forward

402
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,079
But not in my case.
Because I've succeeded, I thank life

403
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,397
I sing. I dance. I love.

404
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,111
And when people ask me
why I'm so humane

405
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,910
I tell them it's the taste of life

406
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,674
Which today leads me to
this kind of mechanical construction

407
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,350
But tomorrow might lead me to be of
service to the whole community

408
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,711
And... I'll give myself.

409
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,957
What's for dinner this afternoon?
- Lentils.

410
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,277
I'll be back

411
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,831
This is the place where soon
Caesar's Palace will be

412
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,156
To be finished in 58 days

413
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,914
What are you looking for?

414
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,395
I've lost my lentil

415
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,869
Workers

416
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,432
Workers

417
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,076
Friends

418
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,279
Have we gone back to the days of the Pharaohs?

419
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,239
Slaving away and getting whipped?

420
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,109
And for whom?

421
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,110
For... Caesar.

422
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,598
Let him build his palace in Rome

423
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,718
Everyone at his place
and the hippos will be fine

424
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,678
That's true!

424
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:55,678
[Nonsense]

425
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,992
Friends, you are being exploited

426
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,917
You're being exhausted.
And...

427
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,714
...to be honest...

428
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,319
There.

429
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,039
He's right!

430
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,318
And there, two huge statues.

431
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,795
But not too huge.
15 meters high is enough.

432
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,231
And at the edge 
of the Sphinxes, a big kitchen.

433
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,194
Next to the bedrooms?
That's maybe not ideal.

434
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,109
Because of the noise and odour?
- Could become annoying.

435
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,753
Didn't think about that.

436
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,830
Why are those grapes so big?

437
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,589
They're dates, Obelix.
They grow on those trees.

438
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,556
Crunchy on the inside.
- That's the seed.

439
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,398
Not bad.

440
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,032
Lunch break is over. Get to work!

441
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,760
I hardly said anything.
Only that lunch break was over.

442
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,674
We're not satisfied! We're not satisfied!

443
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,597
Please?
- Yes...

444
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,319
We're not satisfied! We're not satisfied!

445
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,192
We refuse to work any longer
under these conditions.

446
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,717
It's unbearable.
- We're not satisfied!

447
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,156
Calm down, calm down.

448
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,118
We're not satisfied!

449
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,715
Who's in charge?

450
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,553
Okay fine.

451
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,990
I'll speak for all of us.

452
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,349
I'm Itineris.
- I'm listening.

453
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,478
You have two new messages.

454
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,432
First of all: we're working more than
18 hours a day or 36 hours in 2 days.

455
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,949
We want it lowered to 35 hours.

456
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,037
That'll never work.
It'll cause problems.

457
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,238
Secondly,
and sorry for interrupting you,

458
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,715
We want a decrease of at least 50%

459
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,876
An increase you mean?
- No.

460
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,350
A decrease of the number of whiplashes.

461
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,398
We get too many whiplashes.

462
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,553
Some people get headaches
from all the noise.

463
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,110
Their head is ready to burst.
- Yes...

464
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,552
And concerning the food...
Some wild boar alongside the lentils would be nice.

465
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,993
The less whiplashes,
the slower you work.

466
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,153
Then the palace doesn't get finished in time,
and I'll be fed to the crocodiles.

467
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,555
Enough, Edifis.
Itineris is right

468
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,440
To not allow that

469
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,796
I'm sure they would be
happy with some wild boar

470
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,109
It's ready

471
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,835
No, you fell in when you were little

472
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,600
Come on, Dogmatix

473
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,911
Give them a demonstration, Asterix

474
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,309
Be careful, it might be a bit too strong

475
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,478
It's a little too strong.
- No, it's very good.

476
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,632
Dogmatix, do a trick

477
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,035
Do a trick

478
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,879
Sit

479
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,910
It's a miracle!

480
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,912
Is there enough for everyone?

481
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,599
I'll make some more

482
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,312
No, Obelix, you...
- ... fell in when I was little

483
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,192
Yes, alright

484
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,479
No!
Obelix, no.

485
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,958
Hohis. That's his name.

486
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,479
Nobis?

487
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,831
No, Hohis. With an H.

488
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,555
Nexusis

489
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,353
Can I help you?

490
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,279
One Imhotep
- Two

491
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,954
I have a job for you

492
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,513
No problem.
Who do you want me to kill?

493
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,353
No, we're not killing anyone

494
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,198
Here you go, two Imhoteps

495
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,993
The construction of the palace has to stop

496
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,756
They're waiting for stones from the south

497
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,674
Make sure they don't arrive

498
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,315
No stones, no construction.

499
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,119
No construction, no palace.

500
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,595
No palace...

501
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,437
... No palace.

502
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,471
Here's some gold to cover your expenses

503
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,998
You give back whatever's left

504
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,791
Nice tunic

505
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,638
I came, I saw, I conquered.
Veni, vidi, vici.

506
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,798
The usual stuff.
And sign with:

507
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,429
"Cesare"

508
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,918
"Cesare" or "Caesar"?

509
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,196
Caesar.
It sounded cool, but...

510
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,628
Engrave 4 plates

511
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,517
Ave Caesar.
Power and prosperity.

512
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
Power and prosperity, Caius C+.
Good news?

513
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,199
I came, I saw, I conquered.
As usual.

514
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,631
Veni, vidi, ...
Okay, vici is a little premature.

515
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,239
What do you mean?

516
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,870
Gaul for example...

517
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,559
What about Gaul?

518
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,753
Gaul is vici.
It's completely occupied.

519
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,077
No it isn't. One small village of
invincible Gauls still holds out...

520
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,157
... against the invaders. Yes, I know.

521
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,630
I've heard it over and over.

522
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,271
And Cleopatra?
They stopped construction?

523
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,278
No, it's going fine.

524
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,639
It's beautiful.
They even... on the inside...

525
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,437
No.
- Excuse me.

526
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,230
Don't touch me.
- They'll finish in time.

527
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,320
Impossible.
- The Gauls don't know the meaning of the word.

528
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,077
Edifis got 3 of them to help him.
One of them is the druid, Teachix.

529
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,235
Getafix?

530
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,915
Yes, I knew it sounded like that.

531
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,432
Also, a little clever one
and a big brute: Aikix and Journalduhix.

532
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,478
Or Malcomix.

533
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,839
Keep an eye on them for now.
I'll decide later what to do.

534
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,272
Si vis pacem, para bellum.
If you want peace, prepare for war.

535
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,431
The little Gaul has the 
name of a hero: Brucewillix.

536
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,993
In the mean time,
the ruthless Nexusis,

537
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,909
Sent by Artifis,
was completing his mission

538
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,919
To cut off the supply of stones

539
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,199
By bribing the foul
convoy supervisor

540
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,639
There the buildings can form
a "C", from Cleopatra

541
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,953
It's Caesar's palace

542
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,151
That's possible too.
- What do you mean?

543
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,069
The stones have arrived

544
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,916
The supervisor says there are
no more stones in the quarries

545
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,758
Funny language.
- He wants to be paid.

546
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,192
He's lying.
- No, he really wants to be paid.

547
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,353
No, about the quarries.
There have to be more stones.

548
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,676
I could make him talk. Can I?

549
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,440
Okay. But don't overdo it.
He needs to be able to talk.

550
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,278
How do you say "talk"?

551
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,149
In the sense of,
"I don't speak Egyptian very well",

552
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,591
It's "Medou ene ere comete."

553
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,588
If it's, "Talk a little slower,"
then it's "Medou ere keteb."

554
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,777
"Medou ere keteb."
- No, "Ketebece."

555
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,834
"Ketebece"
- "Keteb." "Ketebece" when there's 8 of them.

556
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,915
"Ketebece"
- No, not "Ketebece."

557
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,156
No, sorry.
- No one understands you.

558
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,412
"Keteb" - open.
"Keteb" - generous.

559
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,539
Try "Say"...

560
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,634
"Ouchebe"

561
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,799
"Ouchebe"

562
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,191
No? Not "ouchebe"?

563
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,752
No, Obelix, not so furious

564
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,790
He says Artifis paid him
to throw the stones into the Nile

565
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,559
There are enough stones in the quarry

566
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,510
Ai... Ai... He says...
- Yes, ai. I understand that part.

567
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,395
He says "ai" because he's
in pain. I'm in pain.

568
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,398
Not the mustache. Not the mustache.

569
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,470
He's finished

570
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,075
We'll go with him

571
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,432
I'll stay here to keep an eye on things.
Otis will accompany you to...

572
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,431
Yes, to...

573
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,108
Here, amulets.

574
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,235
Lucky charms to protect you

575
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,714
Thanks

576
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,671
Amsterisque
- Rix

577
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,677
Risque
- Yes, Rix...

578
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,950
Risque

579
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,633
The fate of Egypt is in your hands

580
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,513
Isn't that a little exaggerated?

581
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,756
My fate is in your hands?
- That's better

582
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,393
Go, Amsterisque
- Rix

583
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,669
Risque

584
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,280
So our Gallic friends
and Otis went on their way

585
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,597
To the quarries to get the stones

586
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,349
What's wrong with your dromedary?

587
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,437
It's my stomach

588
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,393
While I pack up the boat,
you can visit the Sphinx

589
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,956
There will be many restaurants

590
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,516
You can stuff yourself with
all kinds of things

591
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,551
Steamed fish, meat in sauce

592
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,757
I knew it, nothing to eat

593
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,678
Nice, those little Sphinxes

594
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,033
I could make little menhirs

595
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,593
Sphinx?
- Never mind

596
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,558
Sphinx?
- No, thanks

597
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,272
Stranger, a portrait with the Sphinx as souvenir?

598
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,397
A statue in 30 minutes

599
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,878
Yes why not?
It would look nice at my place

600
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,113
Do you accept Sestertius?
- Sure. Stand in profile please

601
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,793
Shoulders up front

602
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,075
Not too far

603
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,956
We have to be more alert.
Artifis is a snake.

604
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,794
Besides the transport, he could attack 
the construction site

605
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,195
We must organize a guard

606
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,233
What do you think, Obelix?

607
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,596
Now where did he go? Obe?

608
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,472
Obe...Obelix?

609
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,516
Not too short.
- No, no, no...

610
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,352
So you're from Gaul?
- Yes

611
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,037
Been pretty hefty there lately

612
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,759
Obe?

613
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,750
Obelix...
- Ho! Ho! Asterix!

614
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,434
Obelix, I'm sure that's forbidden

615
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,591
Come down at once!

616
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,070
How nice...

617
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,675
Come down. You're being childish

618
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,797
You look so small down there

619
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,793
Don't be stupid. Get off that Sphinx!

620
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,995
I'm going to take a walk on its head

621
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,556
Wise guy!

622
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,991
Broken nose

623
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,313
Great, great.
Remarkable.

624
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,638
Congratulations, Obelix.

625
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,797
You've outdone yourself this time

626
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,752
We could attach it again

627
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,394
Really? That's a great idea

628
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,955
With what? Did you see the size
of that thing?

629
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,720
Yes, it's a rock. A cliff

630
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,629
What am I saying? A peninsula

631
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,833
Stop making everything so complicated
and find a solution

632
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,554
You're so clumsy, Obelix

633
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,599
Luckily no one saw us

634
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,439
He said:
"Let the Greek balm you."

635
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,278
Imhotep?
- Tep

636
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,432
Help me, I only have two arms

637
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,389
Was that lightning?

638
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,508
I told you I saw lightning.
I'm not crazy

639
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,908
Done

640
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,597
No one will find it there

641
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,278
Fine, let's get out of here

642
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,999
Come on, Dogmatix

643
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,674
Not a word about this to Getafix

644
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,632
Nothing happened?
- No

645
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,829
Nothing

646
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,196
Hey! My pyramids!

647
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,109
Seeing the palace is progressing
faster than planned,

648
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,278
we demand, which is perfectly normal,

649
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,836
An extra day off.

650
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,608
Did you understand me?

651
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,039
My name's Edifis

652
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,470
What did I tell you? [Interference]

652
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,470
[Speaking unclearly]

653
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,035
Mobilis, I can't understand you

654
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,032
Move a little

655
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,310
Can you understand me now?
- No. How about now?

656
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,431
And now?
- Try this

657
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,791
Can you understand me now? [Unclear]

658
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,549
I've been having that 
problem a lot lately!

659
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,717
Are you alright, Obe?
- I'm hungry

660
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,430
How could they build such a thing?

661
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,796
Stone upon stone
- Indeed

662
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,319
Gauls!

663
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,035
Feel like visiting the pyramid?

664
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,753
For free.

665
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,548
Not sure if we can learn anything

666
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,669
They say it's extraordinary.
We're not in a hurry!

667
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,694
Dogmatix, stay here.
Guard the Pyramid

668
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,517
If you're good, I'll give you a bone

669
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,710
Don't lose track of me.
You won't get out of this labyrinth alive

670
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,112
Watch it!
The corridors are very narrow

671
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,710
You can't be too fat
- No one is fat

672
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,915
On your right: Anubis

673
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,351
How touching!
- The God of the Dead

674
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,899
Through here...

675
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,353
Come, distinguished guests.
Go in there...

676
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,832
Those hieroglyphs... are beautiful.

677
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,031
After you.
Enter.

678
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,948
Indeed

679
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,799
No! No!

680
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,435
You'll never get out of here!

681
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,277
This tomb will be your tomb!

682
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,874
No way out. We are stuck!

683
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,514
"This tomb will be your tomb!"
Nice one.

684
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,371
I'm too good.
- I knew it. "A free visit."

685
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,039
Anyway, there are enough things to read

686
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,959
Hieroglyphs all look alike
- No

687
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,233
Look, Obelix! The colours... are superb!

688
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,551
That's all really nice, but...

689
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,228
If we don't find a way out soon

690
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,908
We'll have all eternity
to figure them out

691
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,159
That's that

692
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,430
If they get out of here

693
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,394
I swear I'll never shave my head again

694
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,269
First of all, we have to get that door open

695
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,595
But considering the size...

696
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,593
Hold, Obelix...

697
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,436
For the first time, you can have
some magic potion

698
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,830
Really?
- That's what he said, didn't he?

699
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,710
One, two, three drops

700
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,315
That's enough

701
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,032
Well...

702
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,960
That didn't seem to do anything

703
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,035
No, it's Geta

704
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,078
Yes, I'm here

705
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,668
Here?

706
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,515
We're running in circles

707
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,514
The Pharaohs had splendid architects

708
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,952
We're in a serious situation here
- Very serious...

709
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,838
I'm starting to get hungry

710
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,069
What did those hieroglyphs mean?

711
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,910
There's no time to find out.
We have to get out of here

712
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,676
We must set our priorities straight

713
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,156
I'm reporting to mister Asterix
that I'm hungry

714
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,148
I keep myself busy to forget I'm hungry

715
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,439
Sorry, I forgot mister Obelix's
stomach was more important

716
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,677
Wild boars and fights,
that's all he needs

717
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,992
Mister Asterix knows everything better

718
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,914
Yes, maybe.
- I'm reporting to mister Asterix,

719
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,279
who wanted to visit the Pyramids,
that this wouldn't have happened in a menhir

720
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,835
2 Sestertius for that logic!

721
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,593
What's keeping them?

722
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,548
The stones are loaded.
We have to leave...

723
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,870
I was excited. I was just
saying something... My fault.

724
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,558
No, it's my fault.

725
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,320
It also could have happened in a menhir.

726
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,069
In any case, I can't get us out of this place

727
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,037
My friends, I fear...
This is the end of our adventures

728
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,712
Could someone light a torch?

729
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,799
No, I have the amulets,
but that's not going to help.

730
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,036
I'm sorry for Edifis

731
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,073
I'm sorry for Dogmatix

732
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,714
Or not, Dogmatix?
- Dogmatix?

733
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,754
Yes, so?
Don't blame me for bringing him!

734
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,190
His sense of smell led him to us

735
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,914
So he can get us out of here

736
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,509
That's true!
Dogmatix, listen very carefully...

737
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,430
If you get us out of here,
I'll give you a pile full of bones

738
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,392
Yes!
Very good, Dogmatix!

739
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,129
Sorry, we're FORTUNATE
you brought him!

740
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,153
Sometimes I think he
understands EVERYTHING I say!

741
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,835
And they returned to the construction site

742
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,157
Aboard ships loaded with stones

743
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,594
We're going slow...

744
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,039
Very slow.
- Too slow...

745
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,476
At this speed we won't be 
back in time for the wild boar banquet

746
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,193
Lentils aren't that great

747
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,710
The Nile is an unpredictable river

748
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,639
Sometimes impetuous, sometimes quiet

749
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,628
I wonder if you know this
nice Egyptian poem

750
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,310
It goes like this:
"Nile, Nile, Nile..."

751
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,272
What is he doing?

752
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,153
Men...

753
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,511
We're seaworthy again

754
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,239
Hip hip hip...
- Hurrah!

755
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,198
Hip hip hip...
- Hurrah!

756
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,279
Watch out!

757
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,255
By Toutatis!
I know he fell...

758
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,835
in a cauldron of magic potion

759
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,600
But he'll never cease to amaze me!

760
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,310
Hip hip hip... Hurrah!
- Stop it!

761
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,434
And construction was ready to start again

762
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,189
Edifis knew he would be finished in time

763
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,755
Which, in the field of construction,
was rare in those days

764
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,512
One sip a person...
Just one sip a person

765
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,673
Fake potion is being passed out

766
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,471
Same consistency, same colour.
But it's pumpkin soup

767
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,190
The only real potion,
is the one you get from the druid

768
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,994
Around the cauldron...

769
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,192
Thirty minutes from here

770
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,997
I closed the door and yelled:

771
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,033
"This tomb will be your tomb."

772
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,719
Not bad.

773
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,230
I was also thinking:
"Jackals, die like jackals."

774
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,158
But that's jackals twice...

775
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,352
What? Should I say, "Hyenas", instead?

776
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,437
Locked up in the Pyramids?

777
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,988
I don't understand!

778
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,472
They're magicians! You need supernatural
powers to get out of there!

779
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,352
They're tough, those barbarians

780
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,677
I need an idea...

781
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,949
Got one! I have a terrible idea!
Two... Even three!

782
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,119
I've got a whole bunch of ideas!
I'm so good.

783
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,870
I don't like that laughter.
It frightens me

784
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,638
Get to work!

785
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,429
That's not even close to the
luxurious garden we need

786
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,398
Getamanix, you don't have any
potion to speed things up?

787
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,110
Like seeds for example...

788
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,818
That grow into palm trees in no time?

789
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,232
No, potions aren't the solution 
to everything

790
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,551
Some things can't be changed

791
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,919
Nature needs time to turn the seed,

792
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,596
With sun and water, into a bud.

793
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,111
And then...

794
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,233
That bud...
- Please?

795
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,998
Please?

796
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,076
It can't go any faster

797
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,877
Yes, fantastic!

798
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,956
Can someone get me down from this tree?

799
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,752
They started again?

800
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,992
I'm not happy either

801
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,359
I also want Edifis to fail,
for personal reasons

802
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,348
I was thinking I could 
be of some assistance maybe

803
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,758
After we've struck a fair deal

804
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,673
Not here.
In my tent.

805
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,392
I'm listening

806
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,390
Honourable Caesar, if I ensure that
the construction of the palace fails

807
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,388
Appoint me, and I'll delay
the job by 2 months

808
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,388
That way, you'll win the bet
and Cleopatra is humiliated

809
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,315
Alright, if you finish it after 4 months

810
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,953
Three, I can't work any slower

811
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,709
Fine, but not any sooner,
or you'll have to pay a compensation

812
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,637
That's a deal, honourable Caesar

813
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,230
How were you planning
to sabotage the construction?

814
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,517
With this

815
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,918
What shall I wear tonight?

816
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,708
Careful, it's very, very tepid

817
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,912
A gift for the Queen of Queens

818
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,789
"As a token of honour to
the Queen of Queens. The 3 Gauls:

819
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,118
Getafix, Obelix and Asterix."
How sweet.

820
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,631
Can I open it?

821
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,353
Oh, that's tepid

822
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,868
A cake

823
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,758
Tonight's dessert

824
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,833
Modest meal, 40 dancers...

825
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,628
80 musicians and 300 simple dishes

826
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,155
I don't like crowds either

827
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,795
Dinner time!

828
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,998
Ah, wild boar...
- Finally some normal food

829
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,794
Yes.
- With lentils

830
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,879
That's not really allowed.
It's pork more or less

831
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,158
We'll pretend we don't know.
- Nobody moves

832
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,232
We're here to arrest the Gauls

833
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,915
Come on, for three wild boars

834
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,959
I'll beat them up and then we'll eat

835
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:56,637
No, wait. Wait!
You're going to fight the whole garrison?

836
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,992
Why not? That's illegal too?
You can't do anything around here!

837
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,356
Edifis is right.
We're going to see Cleopatra

838
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,358
Yes, nice opportunity to see the palace

839
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,519
I'll stay here to keep an eye on the fire.
It tends to go out.

840
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,473
That's why I want to stay

841
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,956
Everything is tasted beforehand

842
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,236
Your scheme failed, Gauls

843
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,632
My taster was poisoned by your cake

844
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,270
We didn't send any cake.
What cake?

845
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,194
That cake. I don't see fifty others

846
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,954
The wild boars, okay, but for that...

847
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,669
Silence!
You tried to kill me

848
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,072
You will die.
- By Toutatis! We are innocent!

849
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,698
You have some nerve.

850
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,250
Ridiculous!
We work all day, breathe dust

851
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,616
Eat lentils...
- Yes, no...

852
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,878
Yes we do - Lentils.
- Yes, but...

853
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,958
We didn't send you any poisonous cake

854
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,075
A cake like that
we would have eaten ourselves...

855
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,478
Silence!

856
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,993
This is ridiculous.
- If she doesn't want to hear it...

857
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,156
You don't say anything. For now.

858
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,713
Take them away!

859
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,838
And give the crocodiles an appetizer

860
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,192
I'm hungry

861
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,519
I'm hungry.
Hungry!

862
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,918
When I said hello,
she turned her head

863
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,316
We used to laugh,
said cuckoo... And now...

864
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,839
All of a sudden...

865
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,789
She won't look at me any more.
I'm a stranger to her

866
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,877
Cleopatra and you said, "Cuckoo"?

867
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,671
He's not talking about Cleopatra,
but about a courtesan

868
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,031
The one with the nice braid

869
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,153
Wouldn't surprise me 
if he were in love

870
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,879
I'm not in love

871
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,359
I want to tell her
I had nothing to do with it

872
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,478
It's a juridical thing

873
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,677
Juridical, yes

874
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,029
Of course

875
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,993
Stop.
- Cuckoo, I love you

876
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,950
It's great to look so stupid

877
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,639
Subtle

878
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,476
Sometimes you can be really nice,
and sometimes we think you're...

879
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,314
A fat idiot.
- Who's an idiot?

880
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,518
No idea.
- Drink. A sip of antidote

881
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,115
Obelix, not everything. A sip.

882
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,548
Yes, a sip

883
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,394
Now... Obelix, open the door

884
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,479
I didn't drink it all...
Guard, get out of my way.

885
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,150
Yes, and when you come back
you'll bring me a suit...

886
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,311
Egyptians are mad. We ask them to
get out of the way but they don't move

887
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,068
And?
- I'm ready

888
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,594
I'm sick of standing in profile all the time

889
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,678
Can't you sketch my front for a change?
Like this.

890
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,198
Modern art

891
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,555
Excuse me.

892
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,470
Can we?

893
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,398
I'd better leave

894
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,951
Gauls, since you want to see my demise

895
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,197
I will, by Osiris,
show you how a Queen dies

896
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,080
No, by Toutatis, listen to us first!

897
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,277
Where are your courtesans?
- Why?

898
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,916
No reason.
I'm sure the cake wasn't poisoned

899
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,792
I think it's very tasty even

900
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,558
Obelix, cut 3 pieces of cake

901
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,589
We said three pieces

902
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,239
One...

903
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,394
Go on.
- Two.

904
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,553
And three.

905
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,315
Obviously

906
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,599
And?
You can see it's not poisoned

907
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,117
Tell your courtesans.
Especially the one with the braid

908
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,113
Her name is Guimieukis.
- Guimieukis

909
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,589
I had a dream last night

910
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,348
I had won a million Sestertius

911
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,633
I bought shoes.
Too big and ugly too

912
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,230
Unbelievable. And weird, because...

913
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,233
That Egyptian architect and
his proposition...

914
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,073
Ilemauris?
- Artifis

915
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,073
Yes.
- Incompetent. He hasn't achieved anything

916
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,350
Send one of ours to spy and snoop around

917
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,272
Thinking of someone in particular, oh Caesar?

918
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,869
Someone sneaky...

919
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,919
Cartapus.
- Yes?

920
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,030
Caesar, meet Cartapus

921
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,918
Our best spy

922
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,834
Ave Caesar. Power and prosperity

923
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,035
Cartapus is a professional.
The Queen of Camouflage

924
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,474
If I look that way, you can see me

925
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,473
When I look this way, you can't

926
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,391
You can. You can't. You can.

927
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,109
Can't. Can't. Can.
- Incredible

928
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,595
You can't. Can't. Can.

929
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,837
You can. Can't.
You can a little

930
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,633
Amazing?
- Yes

931
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,989
She wasn't even trying hard

932
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,591
They're mocking me

933
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,398
Four months!
- Don't rush me

934
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,871
I've been waiting four months!
- My mother will kill me

935
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,117
I have connections.
- Come on, stay calm

936
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,629
Don't touch me!
Impossible to stay calm!

937
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,593
Malococsis, I'll finish everything tomorrow

938
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,236
I'll even give you a discount. I'd like that

939
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,953
He'd like that

940
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,358
If you're not there tomorrow,
I'd rather not be in your place

941
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,435
And?

942
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,751
The magic potion gives them incredible strength

943
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,839
I drank it,
and now I'm Superman... Superwoman

944
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,478
You don't believe me, oh Caesar?

945
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,716
We shall see

946
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,828
Malivestus!
Slap her.

947
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,720
Caesar will personally deal 
with this matter

948
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,515
The dice have been cast. "Alea jacta est."
Excuse me...

949
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,274
In the name of Caesar!
We know the Gauls are hiding here

950
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,229
I demand that Appendix,
Olympix, and Mannekepix...

951
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,755
No, their names are Asterix...

952
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,877
Their names don't matter!

953
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,830
If they don't surrender immediately,
we'll attack.

954
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,754
We're here to help Cleopatra

955
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,150
By Toutatis, we're not leaving
until the work is finished

956
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,950
Don't be so aggressive...
Maybe we can talk!

957
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,271
We'll kill you all!

958
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,999
I knew it

959
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,398
Jeanclaudeus, prepare the troops.
And show no mercy.

960
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,272
Antivirus

961
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,671
My name is Antivirus

962
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,797
Arm yourself. One, two, three...

963
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,275
...four, six, five...

964
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,313
Come on!

965
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,316
Get in line!

966
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,235
Here, put him in some shade

967
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,510
So, amateurs, coming to
see the professionals at work?

968
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,756
Yes, alright

969
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,871
Yes... If you're not used to it,
it's rather impressive

970
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,275
Getamanix, magic potion for the workers.
- It's their day off

971
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,356
So...

972
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,509
This is the palace, there are the gardens

973
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,479
And there is the temple with the Sphinxes

974
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,035
That's not a good drawing

975
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,356
No, I'm merely sketching

976
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,552
In perspective it's more like...

977
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,115
I would have drawn it more in profile

978
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,436
Yes, you do it all the time

979
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,308
Those Romans are mad

980
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,478
Because of the violence in the next scene,

981
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,309
We prefer to broadcast this documentary

982
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,757
In contrary to common belief,

983
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,077
The lobster feeds
exclusively on shellfish

984
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,150
Which doesn't bother humanity

984
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,850
The End

985
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,311
Careful!

986
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,718
One got through!
Dogmatix, attack!

987
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,077
Leave me alone!
I've been beaten already!

988
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,074
Alright...

989
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,749
Sir, we don't allow speeding here

990
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,155
We're not in Rome

991
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,878
Ave Caius C+.
They withstood the attack

992
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,475
But some managed to get 
very close to the enemy

993
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,194
Bravo, brave soldier

994
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,551
They shouldn't have challenged me

995
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,795
And what's that?

996
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,078
We got right up to them...

997
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,759
But they were nice

998
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,117
They let us go
without beating us too much

999
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,349
What will we do now?
I'm asking, as an amateur.

1000
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,834
Attack again!

1001
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,318
Caius C+, I'm not sure
that's a good idea

1002
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,353
The Gauls are invincible

1003
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,120
I think we better give up

1004
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,632
I'm very disappointed
by your attitude, Centurion Antiquarus

1005
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,877
Antivirus.
My name is Antivirus

1006
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,112
No one humiliates the Roman empire.
If it's attacked...

1007
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,760
The empire counterattacks

1008
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,869
He's mad.
He hurt my throat

1009
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,030
It's too quiet

1010
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,839
I don't like that

1011
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,356
I prefer a little commotion

1012
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,439
Stop!

1013
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,475
War machines.

1014
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,597
Take your positions!

1015
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,592
How low can you go?

1016
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,591
Beautiful landscape

1017
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,311
Not good, not bad either

1018
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,392
Fire! Destroy the palace!

1019
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,718
Ready?
- Ready!

1020
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,709
When I lower my arm...

1021
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,070
You fire.

1022
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,833
Easy

1023
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,877
There... Bingo.

1024
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,110
My palace!

1025
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,995
I wonder why all this violence is necessary?

1026
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,309
No, it's fine

1027
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,829
Come!

1028
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,796
Fine. Excellent!

1029
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,592
With such equipment it's easy

1030
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,550
It's not about the equipment.
- Oh yes it is

1031
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,273
No.
- Yes

1032
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,915
No.
- Yes

1033
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,153
No.

1034
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,955
Yes.

1035
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,757
My palace is turned into a ruin!

1036
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,512
Go on, Romans, fire!
We no longer care

1037
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,912
You missed. You shoot like girls!

1038
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,792
We're still here

1039
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,477
We must inform Cleopatra.
She could force...

1040
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,035
Caesar to stop.

1041
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,270
No. No.

1042
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,875
No.

1043
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,914
No.
- Yes

1044
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,637
Yours sincerely...

1045
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,279
I have an idea.
Dogmatix will bring the message

1046
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,989
Dogmatix will bring the message

1047
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,800
That dog? You want me to die?

1048
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,999
Edifis is right.
I mean... it's a dog

1049
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,639
He got us out of the pyramid

1050
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,070
Go on, Dogmatix

1051
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,280
Take this message to Cleopatra

1052
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,952
He's too young to understand

1053
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,036
I'm hit!

1054
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,879
Never mind, I'm fine.

1055
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,556
Men! We're seaworthy yet again!

1056
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,513
Aboard our trusty old dragon boat

1057
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,714
It's an extraordinary mast,
subtle as a bird. Hoist the sail!

1058
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,319
Yes.

1059
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,393
No.

1060
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,829
Oh no...

1061
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,078
Too far.

1062
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,909
I'm amazed

1063
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,998
It should hold

1064
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,071
A big sip. I'm leaving but I'll be back

1065
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,477
Hurry and be careful

1066
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,317
Hold on, Dogmatix

1067
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,677
Run, Asterisque... Run!

1068
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,236
Alarm!

1069
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,718
I know that one. He's a grumpy man

1070
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,954
Shields!

1071
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,829
Javelins!

1072
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,752
Why isn't he stopping?

1073
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,234
The magic potion!

1074
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,192
Citebus, Trolleybus, get him! Quickly!

1075
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,868
Go on!
- But that's not my name

1076
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,355
Obelix is alone. Go help him

1077
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,032
I'm strong now?

1078
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,158
Edifis

1079
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,356
Prepare your sarcophagus

1080
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,551
Double evasion

1081
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,630
Pryadonis, violence never solved anything

1083
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,915
Stop talking

1084
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,593
Wait, I didn't drink any magic potion

1085
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,828
You lost.
- Are you sure?

1086
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,070
Very sure.
- Ok

1086
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,570
Did you know that my Kung Fu is excellent?
(Mandarin Chinese)

1086
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,070
Why don't you speak in Cantonese? I'm not an idiot!
(Cantonese)

1086
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,070
Come here then!
(Mandarin)

1087
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,960
No, no! I beg you, no!

1088
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,195
I'm Artifis, and I beat Edifis

1089
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,114
The magic potion has worn off

1090
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,993
Cleopatra will never get the message

1091
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,672
Your family is fine?
- Yes, Imhotep.

1092
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,310
And your father?
- Fine, Imhotep. And your sister?

1093
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,714
Everything's okay, Imhotep

1094
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,349
What has become of your nephew?

1095
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,834
He's doing fine, Imhotep

1096
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,515
And how's business?

1097
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,592
Sorry, I'm borrowing this cart for a moment

1098
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,120
Many customers?
- Enough, Imhotep

1099
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,039
How useful

1100
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,750
We can't catch him.
- He's got one with 2 horses

1101
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,552
I can't go any faster

1102
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,515
Why does everyone always shout, "Ja, ja"?

1103
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,831
Catch me if you can!

1104
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,118
How will you get up?

1105
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,312
Like this

1106
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,073
Fighting is ridiculous. Let's work together.

1107
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,039
A lion doesn't cooperate with a cockroach

1108
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,228
What?

1109
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,791
A lion, you know, doesn't cooperate

1110
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,314
with a cockroach

1111
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,915
I understood: "...an...ion..."

1112
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,834
Doesn't calculate

1113
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,957
That means nothing to me
- No.

1114
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,639
Attack!

1115
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,675
When I said lion I meant myself!

1116
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,632
I knew that

1117
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,029
What's going on?

1118
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,911
The lion doesn't cooperate with the cockroach

1119
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,595
Who's the lion now?

1120
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,393
Say it to my face, if you're a man

1121
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,669
Everything okay?

1122
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,270
By Jupiter, a moment ago he was still here

1123
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,439
We're going home. Gone is gone.

1124
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,909
I've had it with Edifis

1125
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,519
Where are we going?
- To Cleopatra

1126
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,517
I'm scared.
- Yes, play it smart

1127
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,799
I know Cleopatra very well.
Watch me.

1128
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,230
I'm afraid I have no choice

1129
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,675
One, two, three, four, five.

1130
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,552
Antelope and lion.

1131
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,512
What does the prediction say?

1132
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,950
A message and a loved one

1133
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,479
Whatever.

1134
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,791
My Queen.
- Malococsis

1135
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,829
Come on in.
- Go, Dogmatix. Give her the message

1136
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,233
That's the message.
- And there's the loved one

1137
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,751
My Queen, as you may know I'm building.

1138
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,519
In fact, it should have been
easily finished four months ago

1139
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,114
What?
- Easily.

1140
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,952
He can't get away with that!

1141
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,431
Thank you, my Queen, that you care so much

1142
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,228
By Isis, he's a sore loser!

1143
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,596
This is typical of Caesar.
But this time...

1144
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,311
He'll have to accept his defeat.
We will finish in time

1145
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,438
No, the construction isn't finished.
That's exactly the problem...

1146
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,858
I'll see to it.
You can go now, Gaul

1147
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,077
Guimieukis, show him the way.
I'll be right there

1148
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,957
Pardon me, old man

1149
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,670
Come, my Dogmatix.
- Come, my Gaul

1150
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,920
I believe you don't understand my problem

1151
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,311
It's that way. Straight ahead

1152
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,715
Be careful.
- Yes.

1153
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,517
Everything will be destroyed

1154
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,515
Everything will be fine, Tranquilum

1155
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,711
That attack was a good idea, wasn't it?

1156
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,798
Yes, not bad

1157
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,118
Asterix is coming back

1158
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,718
When I lower my arm...

1159
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,189
Well?

1160
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,590
Don't know. A reflex?

1161
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,353
How did it go?

1162
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,671
Cleopatra got the message.
- Great!

1163
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,189
The magic potion took
this long to wear off?

1164
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,231
Well, it's like this...

1165
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,918
You had a taste of 
the best magic potion there is

1166
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,089
Good. Come, my dog.
- Cuckoo...

1167
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,518
Obelix, Dogmatix just came back
and he has succeeded

1168
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,592
I was sure he could do it

1169
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,632
There's a little pink...

1170
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,956
Ave Caesar

1171
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,475
Somebody wishes to see Caesar

1172
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,989
Who?
- Someone

1173
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,358
I understand...

1173
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,758
I better leave...

1174
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,713
My Queen, what a pleasant surprise!

1175
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,998
Enough!
I rushed over here

1176
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,590
Without changing,
when I heard about what's going on here

1177
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,349
What happened?

1178
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:35,193
When you accept a bet,
you have to play fair

1179
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,955
The Gauls may help me.
- I never said...

1180
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:41,875
If I may say something...

1181
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,616
Just one...
- This is not conquered territory!

1182
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,557
I demand the Romans
leave the construction alone

1183
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,149
And repair all damages

1184
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,278
But...
- Silence! Immediately!

1185
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,360
So what do we do now?

1186
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,950
What she said.
We leave and repair the damages

1187
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,310
Of course, naturally

1188
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,038
I wouldn't want her to sniff
her nose at me

1189
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,110
No matter how lovely it is

1190
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,874
The Romans are leaving

1191
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,758
That's good news.
- They're leaving already?

1192
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:42,636
Incredible that each of those Romans
leaves his footprint in the sand...

1193
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,516
Excuse me, I couldn't help myself

1194
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,472
That's alright

1195
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:53,432
For the first time,
Romans and Egyptians were working together

1196
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,349
On the construction of the palace.
And just in time...

1197
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,278
When the last grain of sand fell...

1198
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,631
What are you going to do now, Edifis?

1199
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,515
I still have to finish my work for Malococsis

1200
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,029
You don't have to worry about the
crocodiles any longer

1201
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,593
That's why it could take a bit longer

1202
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,837
Not too long. It can't become
a habit in this line of business

1203
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,633
Caesar admitted his defeat

1204
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,349
I bow to the most beautiful Queen of all

1205
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,355
And to the Egyptian people that
after the Rom...

1206
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,999
And I bow to the Egyptians who
are the greatest people of all

1207
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,074
Cleopatra kept her promise to Edifis

1208
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,072
Let him be covered with gold!

1209
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,233
That was the deal.
Cover me with gold

1210
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,279
The Queen gave Getafix

1211
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,388
Valuable manuscripts
from her library in Alexandria

1212
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,631
Your nose...

1213
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,510
Your Majesty is too good, by Belenos

1214
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:53,831
Otis also gave the palace a modern touch

1215
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,189
What's this little chamber for?

1216
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,598
It's Otis' invention

1217
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,916
It's the "No-effort"

1218
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,475
We chose that name when we noticed

1219
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:17,558
That people can go up
and down with no effort

1220
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,518
Speak for yourself

1221
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,191
Oh, it tickles when it stops

1222
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,950
By Jupiter!

1223
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,357
I want to explore every room
of this miracle with you

1224
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,357
The palace is huge, Caesar

1225
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,074
It consists of 162 rooms

1226
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,751
It could take a while

1227
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,828
What do you think Cleopatra
and Sesam are doing?

1228
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,713
Caesar.
- Cae-sar

1229
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,034
Nothing unpleasant

1230
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,349
As an exception to the rule

1231
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,036
The banquet that concludes
all of Asterix's adventures

1232
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,193
Didn't take place in Gaul, but in Egypt

1233
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,399
Those big shrimps are nice

1234
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,716
Homarus.
- Obelix

1235
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,548
And the guy says:
"That's the Pha-ra-o"

1236
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,435
Because his name is O

1237
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,233
His name is O
and comes from Phara

1238
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,149
It's O from Phara

1239
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,118
The guy's name is O

1240
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,039
He says he's from Phara

1241
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,591
From Phara. Like the Pharaoh

1242
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,631
The boss... Our boss

1243
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,559
You have a lovely mustache

1244
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,716
Is it real?
- Yes.

1245
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,990
It's nothing

1246
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,953
You just let it grow

1247
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,072
Like your braids

1248
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,314
Which are nicer than Obelix's

1249
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,717
Thanks.
You know how to please a woman

1250
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,071
That's a local custom

1251
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,152
In Gaul

1252
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,794
[More scenes will follow during the Credits...]

Lisa (hksscom), 2002

1252
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,794
Good evening.
Your name, please

1253
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,439
What for?

1254
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,200
It's a private party.
I've got a list

1255
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,799
I'm Julius Caesar

1256
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,595
Sorry, impossible

1257
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,440
There must be a problem, because...

1258
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,756
Excuse me. Make some room

1259
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,116
A warm evening?
- Are you alone?

1260
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,790
We're with two, four,
six, eight. It's crazy

1261
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,991
Good evening.
- There's a problem...

1262
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,679
I should be on that list

1263
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,476
How do you spell your name?
- C, A, E, S, A, R. Julius.

1264
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,799
Cetaparis, Seinesaindenis,
C+, but I can't find any...

1265
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,468
C+, that's me.
- Are you C+?

1266
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,557
Why didn't you say so?

1267
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,512
Nice harness.
- Thanks

1268
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,757
I'll see you inside.
- Are you ok? Have a good time

1269
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,394
Can you look for Julius?

1270
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,154
J, U, L, l, U, S.
- Sir, I'm not...

1271
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,713
I work here

1272
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,230
I don't know, but I know...
There's one of my amphorae inside

1273
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,959
With a J?
- U, L, I, U, S

1274
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:50,673
Yes, that's right. Julius Caesar.
At the Queen's table

1275
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,473
Good evening

1276
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,115
Is it IN Alexandria or AT Alexandria?

1277
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:50,835
Because in the south of Gaul,
there's a city called Avignon

1278
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,589
There's a beautiful bridge.
And people say, "At Avignon"

1279
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,158
Are you a courtesan?

1280
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,999
Yes, and I used to do other things too

1281
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,111
I can talk without moving my lips

1282
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,356
It's funny, the way...

1283
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,757
I have another one... Here

1284
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:16,995
Every part of your face hides
something beautiful

1285
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,989
A rose out of your ear

1286
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,508
A Sphinx from your nose

1287
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:49,589
The guy says:
"That's the Pharaoh."

1288
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,994
O is his name

1289
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,236
And he's from Phara

1290
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:59,797
That's where he comes from.
Where he was born

1291
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,468
The Pharaoh,
because his name is O

1292
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,788
Help!

1293
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:33,788
The End
