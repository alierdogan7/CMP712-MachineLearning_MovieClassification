1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,978
MAN: I told you before
I didn't want you to read this crap.

2
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,272
I never saw such rotten crap in my life.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,109
Where do you get this shit?
Who sells it to you?

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,612
I'm talking to you, young man.
You wanna answer when I'm talking to you.

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,657
Remember who puts the frigging bread
on the table around here?

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,285
WOMAN: Don't be too hard on him,
all the kids read them.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,245
MAN:
My boy isn't all the kids.

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,289
You wanna know
where this is going, Billy?

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,666
In the garbage.
Right into the frigging garbage.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,960
Now, you got any smart mouth
about that?

11
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,006
BOY: I don't see how it's any worse
than the books in your dresser.

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,592
Those ones under your underwear,
those sex books.

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,303
- Stan, you didn't have to--
- Hit him?

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,348
Not only do I find out he's reading this crap,
he's a goddamn little snoop as well.

15
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,808
No, it wasn't like that!

16
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,229
You said for me to get your cuff links.
It was on Sunday.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,899
The windows are open downstairs,
I better close them.

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,568
No, I'll do it.
I got some garbage I wanna throw away.

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,738
Daddy, please don't throw it away.
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,909
The next time, young man, I find you with
a worthless piece of shit like this again...

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,495
...you won't sit down for a week,
buddy boy.

22
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,497
Remember that.

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,290
Tuck in.

24
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,143
That takes care of that.

25
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,938
WOMAN:
Stan, don't you think you were...

26
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,190
...a little hard on him?

27
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,151
Did you see that crap?
All that horror crap?

28
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,403
Things coming out of crates
and eating people?

29
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,199
Dead people coming back to life?
People turning into weeds, for chrissake?

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,452
- Well, yes, I did, but I--
- Well, you want him reading that stuff?

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,329
- Well, no, but--
- All right, then.

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,915
I took care of it.

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,668
That's why God made fathers, babe.

34
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,629
That's why God made fathers.

35
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,219
I hope you rot in hell.

36
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,319
Do you really think she'll be out,
Aunt Sylvia?

37
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,697
Of course she will, Richard.
You know that.

38
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,200
You can set your watch by her.
Six o'clock on the dot.

39
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,538
Pass those scones, Cass.
You're such a hog.

40
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,376
You married a great hog, Henry.

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,212
But then I suppose you know that,
don't you?

42
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,217
Our Cass has always had
such extremely healthy appetites.

43
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,720
Who's coming out, Cass?

44
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,765
You mean Cass hasn't told you about
dotty old Great-Aunt Bedelia...

45
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,018
...the patriarch of our clan?

46
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,895
Isn't she the one
that was supposed to have...?

47
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,941
- Well....
- Supposed to have murdered her father?

48
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,151
Yes.

49
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,907
SYLVIA:
Bedelia is my aunt...

50
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,952
...which means that she's
Richard and Cass' great-aunt...

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,247
...which also means
that she's older than God.

52
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,251
But her father, Nathan Grantham,
was even older and meaner than that.

53
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,589
All a bunch of dirty vultures...

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:47,054
...just waiting to get your hands
on my money.

55
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,390
He was hysterically jealous of Bedelia
all his life.

56
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,392
Complete Freudian relationship.

57
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,022
Then when he was about 184,
he had a stroke...

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,442
...and lucky Bedelia,
she got to nurse him full time.

59
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,861
Then she met a fella.

60
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,073
Yes, sir, a real September courtship.

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,449
September courtship?

62
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,619
This was October or November
at the very least.

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,580
He was 75. Aunt Bedelia is...?

64
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,248
Never mind, my dears.

65
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,169
The point is, Henry,
Bedelia loved her rather elderly beau...

66
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,421
...and her own father had him murdered.

67
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,968
RICHARD: Yarbro was the guy's name,
and he supposedly died...

68
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,889
...in a "hunting accident."

69
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,308
That's what's on the books, anyway.

70
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,811
For Bedelia, it was the last straw.

71
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,065
She bashed her father's head in
with a marble ashtray.

72
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,151
So rumor has it.

73
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,405
SYLVIA:
Well, however it happened...

74
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,158
...it was good riddance
to some extremely bad rubbish.

75
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,994
And my lovely niece
and my handsome nephew...

76
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,498
...have very good reasons for being pleased
at old Nathan's death.

77
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,253
There was no trouble about the will.
Share and share alike.

78
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,137
And now every Father's Day,
every single Father's Day since his death...

79
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,557
...for seven long years,
she returns to this house...

80
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,350
...the scene of her crime.

81
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,520
- Is that--?
SYLVIA: Oh, yes.

82
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,857
You can almost set your watch by her.

83
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,530
Screech to a halt, as they say.

84
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,575
- Do you think she really did it?
- Oh, yes.

85
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,702
I know she did it.

86
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,707
Bedelia was always very unstable,
even when she was much younger.

87
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:44,296
And after the death of her gentleman friend,
she grew steadily worse.

88
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,132
HANK:
Why Father's Day?

89
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,636
Because that was the day of the tragedy,
and she is overwhelmed with her own guilt.

90
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,559
She will go to her father's grave
and meditate for about an hour.

91
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,227
And then she will come inside...

92
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,940
...and we will all sit down
to a nice baked-ham dinner...

93
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,734
...the three of us--

94
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,529
Oh, I'm so sorry, Henry. The four of us.

95
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:14,451
--who now owe her so very much.

96
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,942
NATHAN [IN VOICE-OVER]:
Where's my cake?

97
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,404
I want my cake.

98
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:01,873
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

99
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,461
Where's my Father's Day cake?

100
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,923
I want my cake...

101
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,468
...you dirty bitch.

102
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,762
I'm going to have it.

103
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,808
Bedelia!

104
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,812
It's Father's Day.

105
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,439
Where's my cake?

106
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,985
You promised me my cake!

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,988
Bedelia, I'm your father...

108
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,615
...and you're supposed to be
taking care of me.

109
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,951
I don't hear you. I said, I don't hear you!

110
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,288
Bedelia, you bitch!

111
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,916
What do you think I've got you here for?

112
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,545
You're just like all the others.

113
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,674
You're nothing but a bunch of vultures.

114
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,890
Bedelia! I want my cake.

115
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,018
Bedelia!

116
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,314
Where's my Father's Day cake?

117
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,027
Happy Father's Day!

118
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,636
Don't be stupid.

119
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,726
Happy Father's Day.

120
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,075
God, I didn't know I had it in me.

121
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,579
I'm your daughter, right?
You bootlegger. Killer, murderer!

122
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,582
Ungrateful bastard.

123
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,215
Shouldn't have killed Peter, you know.

124
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,092
He was a man, right, a real man.

125
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,887
See, everything I wanted,
he wanted for me.

126
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,766
You stupid bastard. You screwed it all up.

127
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,269
You screwed up my mother,
you screwed me up.

128
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,026
You got me so mad, drove me crazy.

129
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,447
"I want my cake, Bedelia. You bitch!"

130
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,158
You called me a bitch.

131
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,536
Sylvia fixed it all.

132
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:49,457
Ashtray back in place, chair overturned.

133
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,962
You took a fall, Daddy, a bad fall.

134
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,715
Nobody could catch us, nobody.

135
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,553
You taught me. You taught Sylvia.
You taught us all.

136
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,362
It's so peaceful here.

137
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,577
No! No!

138
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,626
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

139
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,799
I want my cake.

140
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,516
It's Father's Day, Bedelia.

141
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,771
I want my cake.

142
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,546
SYLVIA:
Cass! Cass, turn that down!

143
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,802
Cass, turn that down
and turn it down right now.

144
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,437
Shall I glaze the ham now, ma'am?

145
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,565
No, Mrs. Danvers, you'll have to wait.

146
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,901
Ms. Grantham has not yet arrived.

147
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,946
And you will remember
that today is a very special day.

148
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,405
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,747
- Ain't life grand, Mrs. D.?
- I do hope she's all right.

150
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,750
Sometimes she loses track of time.

151
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,264
Aunt Bedelia?

152
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,476
Ms. Grantham, are you around?

153
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,575
Jesus.

154
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,509
Where's my cake?

155
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,638
I want it. It's mine.

156
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,458
- Where is he?
- My dear, I really couldn't say.

157
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,170
No doubt he's still out at the grave,
hobnobbing with your Aunt Bedelia...

158
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,672
...getting her side of the story, I expect.

159
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,676
Well, I want him.
And I want my dinner. I'm hungry.

160
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,179
Well, go get him, then.

161
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,474
You go, Richard.

162
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,103
He's your husband. I don't even like him.

163
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,647
SYLVIA:
I'll go and get him.

164
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,359
After all, he's such a sweet boy.

165
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,494
Mrs. Danvers? Mrs. D--

166
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,206
Mrs. Danvers.

167
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,268
Mrs. Dan--

168
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,032
I want my cake.

169
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,388
Where is she?
And where the hell is Hank?

170
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,101
Go see, Richard. Please? Please?

171
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,770
Look, my daring sister...

172
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,731
...he is your hick--

173
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,942
Husband, I mean. You go look for him.

174
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,695
Richard, I'm scared,
and it's dark out there.

175
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,948
Look, I just wanna
get another bottle of wine, okay?

176
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,201
Please, Richard.

177
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,706
All right. Come on.

178
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,459
Come on.

179
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,261

It's Father's Day...

181
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,329

00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,164
Oh, my God!

183
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,834
Happy Father's Day.

184
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,956
Holy old Jesus.

185
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,973
That's a meteor.
I'll be dipped in shit if that ain't a meteor.

186
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,204
Oh, shit!

187
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,049
I wonder how much they'd pay for it
up at the college?

188
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,594
[IN VOICE-OVER] I wonder how much
they'd pay for it up at the college?

189
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:38,314
Well, damn fine one, Mr. Verrill.

190
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:45,196
How does $50 sound?

191
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,450
Not a cent less than 200 bucks.

192
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,245
- Seventy-five?
- Two hundred.

193
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,457
Anita Verrill didn't raise no idiots.

194
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,586
Keep on counting.

195
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,130
Not a cent less than 200.

196
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,051
My meteor, my price.

197
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,390
Pay off that bank loan. That's the ticket.

198
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,061
Got to cool the son of a bitch off. Yeah.

199
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,810
Oh, you done it now, Jordy Verrill.

200
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,690
You lunkhead.

201
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,526
Two hundred dollars?

202
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,695
For a broken meteor?

203
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,157
Mr. Verrill, you must be joking.

204
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,869
I wouldn't give you 2 cents.

205
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,538
JORDY:
Jordy Verrill, you lunkhead.

206
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:23,752
Verrill luck's always in,
and you spell that kind of luck B-A-D.

207
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,882
Still, I got to try.

208
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,239
Meteor shit.

209
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,675
Maybe I can glue it together
in the morning.

MAN [ON TV]:
The World Wrestling Federation champion...

...defending his title
at Madison Square Garden.

212
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,114
That's Sika, the Samoan Number 1,
in control.

213
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,117
Oh, a kick nails him. Oh, baby.

214
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,580
Everything went but the kitchen sink.
Look out.

215
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,461
That huge 300-pounder
drop kicked right on out.

216
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,592
Hit to the midsection now,
Backlund reverses it.

217
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,637
Once again, it's gone to the buckle.

218
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:03,060
Backlund working on the left arm
of Samoan Number 1.

219
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,279
Hit to the midsection.
Backlund has him up.

...got to come off.

Uh-oh.

This is going to be extremely painful...

227
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,608
...Mr. Verrill.

...you lunkhead, you been....

We're gonna try--
No, Backlund behind him.

231
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,549
Throws him up.

232
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,469
Pushes back.

I thought I'd find you up.

234
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,875
Oh, stop that. Now, don't cry,
this isn't gonna do a bit for you.

235
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,129
WOMAN 2: Oh, I'm crying because
Aunt Mattie and Aleck make me so mad.

236
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,798
WOMAN 1 :
Aleck and Aunt Mattie? Fiddlesticks.

237
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,844
Golly, don't it itch.

238
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,806
Well, that's Verrill luck, all right.

239
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,018
Always in, always bad.

240
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,938
WOMAN 1: But there's a difference
between dreaming and doing.

241
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,065
The dreamers just sit around and moon...

242
00:28:55,233 --> 00:29:00,237
...about how wonderful it would be
if only things were different.

243
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,449
The years roll on, and they grow old.

244
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,661
By and by, they forget everything,
even about their dreams.

245
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,539
WOMAN 2: I don't want to be like that.
I want to be somebody.

246
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,209
WOMAN 1: Oh, everyone laughed at us,
as they did at all the other pioneers.

247
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,337
They said this country
would never be anything but a wilderness.

248
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,675
We didn't believe that.
We were going to make a new country.

249
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:26,972
Besides, we wanted to see
our dreams come true.

250
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,016
WOMAN 2:
Granny, it must have been wonderful.

WOMAN 1 :
It was wonderful.

252
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:35,189
But don't you think for one single minute
that it was easy, Esther Blodgett.

253
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,108
We burned in summer
and we froze in winter...

254
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,195
...but we kept right on going,
and we didn't complain...

255
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,198
...because we were doing
what we wanted to do.

256
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,200
Can you understand that?

257
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,160
No.

258
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,957
No, no, no.

259
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,543
No. No.

...one giant step, the faith decision.

00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,919
- Needed that.
- You then said, "My troubles are over."

266
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,963
Not true.

You ain't gonna get into that tub,
are you?

00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,580
It's the water that it wants, Jordy.

00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:42,668
Don't you know that?
You get in that water, Jordy...

284
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,545
...you might as well
sign your death warrant.

285
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,634
I'm a goner already, Daddy, ain't I?

286

...the home of all your feed

00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,452
Grain prices closed mixed
after rising most of the session...

296
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,455
...in reaction
to some of the positive export news.

297
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,124
Analysts said prices were centered
in the new highs...

298
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,627
...in the late-session selling
by commission houses and local traders...

299

from the early advances.

Pork-belly prices and most livestock prices

...well, not much for the outdoor types,
but you farmers are going to love this.

Castle County is going to turn green
so fast in the next month...

314
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,978

All right, all right.

MAN: Wentworth?
- All right, I said.

318
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,243
That may work on TV, mister,
but I can bench-press 300 pounds.

319
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,247
You'd better get your foot out of the door,
or you're gonna lose about half of it.

320
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,456
Don't call me "mister."

321
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,668
You know damn well who I am,
so let's not play any games, huh?

322
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,338
- Come on, get out of here.
- Listen to me, Harry, and listen carefully.

323
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,134
Unless you let me in and talk to me,
something very nasty...

324
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,887
...is going to happen to Rebecca.

325
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:27,100
So nasty that your little mind
can barely conceive of it.

326
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,275
You found out. All right.

327
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,403
Becky and I were gonna sit down
and tell you pretty soon anyway.

328
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,447
You know,
some of these cables are loose.

329
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,242
I'm surprised you didn't notice a change
in the quality of your picture.

330
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,710
You know, you ought to be grateful to us,
you know that?

331
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,087
I mean, if you ever loved her,
you don't now.

332
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,049
There won't be alimony,
none of that community-property shit.

333
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,258
She just wants out.

334
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,095
Well, I don't know whether I ever loved her
or not, Harry. That doesn't matter.

335
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,600
The point is, I keep what is mine.
No exception to that rule ever.

336
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,648
No exceptions, Harry. Never.

337
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,488
What did you mean when you said
something nasty was gonna happen?

338
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,157
You really should take better care
of this equipment.

339
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,618
At least get a maintenance cartridge,
and dust.

340
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,579
Talk to me right now.

341
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,333
Take your hand off me right now.

342
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,503
All right, fine.

343
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,175
Got something I want you to hear.

344
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,847
WOMAN [ON RECORDING]:
Harry, he's got me in....

345
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,476
Please come. Please.

346
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,104
He's got me in....

347
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,523
If you don't come, the....

348
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,193
Please, Harry. Please come.

349
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,196
I had to stop it there,
I couldn't bear to record any more.

350
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,740
What have you done with her?

351
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,286
Talk to me, you son of a bitch,
or I'm gonna kill you.

352
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,664
You kill me and you'll never find out.
Now, don't get naughty, Harry.

353
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,876
If I fall down on this floor
and hit my head on that hard marble...

354
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,045
...why, I could fracture my skull.

355
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,172
- Fine with me.
- And then you'll never know.

356
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,634
And believe me, Mr. True-Love,
you'll want to know.

357
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,887
Because by 11 this morning,
it's gonna be too late.

358
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,521
VICKERS: I love the ocean,
except when the tide is out.

359
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,858
Then it has that kind of rotten smell.

360
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,402
HARRY: I just don't understand
what you're trying to prove.

361
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,574
VICKERS:
I'm not trying to prove a thing.

362
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,745
It may be, on some subjects,
that I'm not entirely sane.

363
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,791
The subject of what is mine, for example,
I am not sane at all.

364
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:20,857
Now, this is Comfort Point,
and I call my beach house Comfort Station.

365
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,486
- Is that camp or kitsch, Harry?
HARRY: It's stupid.

366
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:29,449
VICKERS:
Unkind, Harry, unkind.

367
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,453
Well, I won't hold it against you.

368
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,413
Come on, up this way.

369
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:45,215
Harry, the maiden fair is waiting
for her knight in shining corduroy.

370
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,133
Come on.

371
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,972
Harry, here's something
I think you'll find interesting.

372
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,392
You see that down there?

373
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,019
Is that...?

374
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,646
What?

375
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,108
The burial mound of my lady fair?

376
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,318
Oh, m--

377
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,821
Could be.

378
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,963
You notice how the water creeps in?

379
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,591
Even when the tide's out,
the water creeps in.

380
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,636
I don't know what the hell
you think you're--

381
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,391
Now, look.

382
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,520
This has gone just about far enough.

383
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,981
No, Harry, not nearly far enough.

384
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,483
Now, if you're thinking
of becoming a hero...

385
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,986
...I suggest that you remember
the lady fair.

386
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,617
Jump into that hole.

387
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,878
- No.
- Then you force me to shoot you, Harry.

388
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,882
Sorry.

389
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,062
Good boy, Harry. Good boy.

390
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,572
Now, Harry, I want you to kneel down...

391
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,824
...and start pulling the sand into the hole.

392
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,747
Uh-uh. No way.
Go ahead, shoot me if you want to.

393
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,541
- You're not gonna bury me alive.
- Not a bad idea.

394
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,753
Not exactly what I had in mind, though.

395
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,381
All I wanna do is incapacitate you.
Then you can see Becky.

396
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,263
- I don't believe you.
- I always keep my promises, Harry.

397
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,932
And I do have the gun, don't I?

398
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,563
- Help!
- Yell all you want, Harry.

399
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,858
Comfort Point is very private. I own it all.

400
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,569
Help! Help! Help!

401
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,656
Help!

402
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,700
Nobody's gonna hear you, Harry.

403
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,869
Nobody's gonna hear anything.

404
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,209
Now, do what I told you.

405
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,151
There.

406
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,990
Sort of like being buried
in wet cement, huh?

407
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,284
Can't move your arms.

408
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,578
Don't have any leverage.

409
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,330
Go ahead, Harry, try to move.

410
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,134
You know, I could really...

411
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,263
...cover you all the way up,
couldn't I, Harry?

412
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,892
I could make Harry all gone.

413
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,273
Oh, no. No, no, no. I wouldn't do that.

414
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,234
Here, let me get that.

415
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,070
Get that out of you.
There you are. That's good.

416
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,616
No, I keep my promises.

417
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,207
Oh, Jesus. Get out.

418
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,795
Get out of here. Just-- Richard!

419
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,885
Richard, would you get it out of here?

420
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,803
Well...

421
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,556
...found a friend, Harry?

422
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,396
Hey, come on, Richard. Get it out of here.

423
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,690
He's just getting revenge, Harry...

424
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:17,570
...for all the relatives of his that you ate,
baked and stuffed, at Ma Maison.

425
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,740
Bad fellow, you.
Oh, you bad fellow. Go on.

426
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,742
Get out of there.

427
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,170
Money. Look, I have money.

428
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,800
I'll give you anything.
Just get me out of this hole, all right?

429
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,636
Well, I have something here, Harry.

430
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,970
Take your mind off of it.

431
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:49,519
- Come on, Richard, please--
- It's showtime.

432
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh, my-- Becky?

433
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,193
Isn't that great video? I love this stuff.

434
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,987
Now, just look at the quality
of that picture, Harry.

435
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,699
- Somebody!
HARRY: Becky.

436
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,784
- No.
- Becky!

437
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,494
Can't hear you.

438
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,164
I'm sorry. She lost a coin toss.
I had to bury her further down the beach.

439
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,459
Couldn't even leave her a monitor,
it would have shorted out by now.

440
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:17,255
No, no, no. No, that's a trick.
You son of a bitch!

441
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,091
That's some kind of special-effects trick,
isn't it?

442
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,844
If you'll just take a look
at the VCR back there....

443
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,929
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't turn your head.

444
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,766
Let me assure you, Harry,
the VCR is not on "play," it's on "record."

445
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,143
I'm gonna save this stuff.

446
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,562
The two of you
are part of my home movies.

447
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,605
HARRY:
You're insane.

448
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:39,444
- Won't be long now, huh? Not long at all.
- Oh, my God.

449
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,821
You are insane.

450
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,658
I promised that you'd see Becky again.
I kept my promise. Is that insane?

451
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,370
Oh, you bastard. You bastard.

452
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,748
There's a chance
you can get out of this, Harry.

453
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,501
The tide might even set you free. It depends
on how long you keep your cool...

454
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,629
...how long you hold your breath,
you see, Harry.

455
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,675
The water's so cold, so salty.

456
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,261
You're underneath,
and you're holding your breath...

457
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,972
...waiting for that wave covering you
to go back out...

458
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,100
...so you can snatch a quick breath...

459
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,188
...before the next wave comes in.

460
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,361
Now, you've got a chance, Harry,
if you don't lose your head.

461
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,657
- Now, it looks like she's losing hers.
- Oh, God, no!

462
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,579
Feel how hard your heart is beating,
Harry?

463
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,499
How fast?

464
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,211
Now, that's gonna make it harder
for you to hold your breath, isn't it?

465
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,716
Oh, God.

466
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,844
Oh, the tide.

467
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,472
Coming in.

468
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,517
It's getting late, Harry.

469
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,978
- Guess I'll have to trot along now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

470
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,898
No. You enjoy the show.

471
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,192
At least until the monitor shorts out.

472
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,195
All right, come on, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

473
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,115
Sorry, Harry. I really can't stay.

474
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:14,163
- Come on. Come back here, Richard.
- Oh, God.

475
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,670
Come on, Richard!

476
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,052
Come on, Richard, please!

477
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,681
Oh, God.

478
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,978
Harry.

479
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,541
No, no.

480
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:56,909
Oh, no! No! No!

481
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,916
No, no, no.

482
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,586
God, no, no, no.

483
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,561
Oh, my God.

484
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,578
HARRY:
Richard.

485
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,794
I'm gonna get you. You hear me, Richard?

486
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,590
You hear me, Richard? I'm gonna get you.

487
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,634
You've gotta hold your breath there,
Harry.

488
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,598
Gotta hold your breath.

489
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,528
The current pulled him out.

490
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,551
That's what happened, all right.

491
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,140
The current pulled him out. He's gone.

492
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,728
HARRY [IN VOICE-OVER]:
Richard.

493
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,265
Never mind where I told you to stand,
you stand where I tell you.

494
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,559
Kid's so dumb,
he doesn't know what time it is.

495
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,853
- By the way, what time is it?
MAN 1: I don't know.

496
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,230
MAN 2:
Stand here and keep your eye on the ball.

497
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,621
Now, let me see, where is...?

498
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,459
Boy, if that damn maid has been
moving my stuff again, I swear I'll--

499
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,419
HARRY'S VOICE:
Richard.

500
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,372
Undertow has carried them away.

501
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,790
Saved me the trouble.

502
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,760
Come off it.

503
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,021
No need to get jumpy.

504
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,856
They're all gone.

505
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,484
Blub, blub, blub.

506
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,147
Who's out there?

507
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,325
Wentworth?

508
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,249
That you, Wentworth?

509
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,628
May I remind you, dear boy,
I have the gun?

510
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,883
Wentworth?

511
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,178
I suggest you get out of here...

512
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,471
...or I'll shoot you.

513
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,767
Fair warning.

514
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,812
Wentworth? I'll shoot you dead.

515
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,196
Get out of here, Wentworth.

516
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,964
You can't shoot us dead, Richard.

517
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:53,051
Because we're already dead.

518
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,973
We want to see you, Richard.

519
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,978
- We want to see you, Richard.
- We want to see you, Richard.

520
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,980
BECKY:
We want to see you.

521
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:09,026
HARRY:
We dug a hole for you, Richard.

522
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,861
BECKY:
On the beach.

523
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,906
HARRY:
Below the high-tide line.

524
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,910
Here we come.

525
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,579
It's showtime!

526
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:26,251
- Here we come, Richard.
- Here we come.

527
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,339
Let's go to the beach.

528
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:35,010
- We just want you to come to the beach.
- We just want you to come to the beach.

529
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,804
-Come with us.
- Come with us.

530
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:41,433
- Come down to the beach.
- Come down to the beach.

531
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,918
If you don't panic...

532
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,380
...if you can hold your breath....

533
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:23,016
If you can hold your breath....

534
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:26,603
- If you can hold your breath....
- If you can hold your breath....

535
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,743
I can hold my breath...

536
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,123
...for a long time!

537
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,542
There, look at that.

538
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,710
Fuck-a-diddle.

539
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,600
What the...?

540
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,029
WOMAN:
Oh, Dexter, you are such a child.

541
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,698
You and Henry both.
You're such children.

542
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,369
But at least Henry has me
to take care of him, don't you, dear?

543
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:10,082
Tabby, Richard, I'd like you to meet
Dexter Stanley, our distinguished professor...

544
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,251
- ...in the Zoology Department.
- Oh, how do--?

545
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,254
Tabby and Richard Raymond.
They're new in the Math Department.

546
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,423
How do you do?
What a lovely name you have.

547
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,425
Oh, thank you. Actually, it's Tabitha.

548
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,761
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Professor Stanley.

549
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,513
- Just Dex will do.
- Dex. Thank you.

550
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,600
- This is Henry and Wilma Northrup.
- Oh, just call me Billie. Everyone does.

551
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,019
- Billie.
- You need someone to show you the ropes...

552
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,690
...you just come see me.
I know all the best stores.

553
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,234
- Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

554
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,820
- Pleasure to meet you.
- So are you buying or renting?

555
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,906
- Oh, actually, we're renting at the moment.
- It's just as well.

556
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,118
Buying real estate in a college town
is a frigging pain in the ass.

557
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,327
Take my word for it.

558
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,955
Henry is in the English Department,
and Wilma--

559
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,750
I just take care of Henry.
Believe me, he needs it.

560
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,503
Did you ever meet a man who didn't?

561
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,340
- What's the matter? You're not drinking?
- Well, actually, we just got here.

562
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,634
Oh, well, we can take care of that.

563
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,721
You just come on with me.
Henry, you stay here till I get back.

564
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,557
- Excuse us, please.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

565
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,142
Bye.

566
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,022
Oh, honey, these people are dry.
Now, take care of them.

567
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,816
They don't know what they're doing.

568
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,656
Hi. Good to see you.

569
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,203
If Dex Stanley hadn't had his teeth capped,
he'd have been out on his ass years ago.

570
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,413
Really? Well, my--

571
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,666
So when Parker told me
that I was out of line...

572
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,461
...I told him he ought to get laid.

573
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:41,173
"I mean, Parker," I said,
"if you'd just have your ashes hauled...

574
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,843
...you wouldn't have to spend all this time
playing Emily Vanderbilt."

575
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:49,473
Or Emily Van Buren,
or whoever that etiquette crotch is.

576
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,518
- Excuse me.
- I don't know why they keep inviting her.

577
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:57,355
- Hello, Mrs. Forest, ladies.
- Oh, Professor Stanley.

578
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,410
Well, how about tonight?
Maybe we could do it tonight?

579
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,791
- Okay. That's great.
- All right, I'll call you about it.

580
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,297
I gather you'll be unavailable
for chess tonight.

581
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,178
Henry, you know,
I'm just about reaching a point where I--

582
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,889
Pardon me.
Would one of you be Professor Stanley?

583
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,225
- Yeah, I am.
WOMAN: There's a telephone call for you.

584
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,143
DEXTER:
Oh, yeah, all right. Thank you.

585
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,564
It's probably Charlie Gereson again
with his damn ear mites.

586
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,817
He's gonna get the Nobel Prize
before he's 20.

587
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,402
Especially if he's working
at Amberson Hall in August.

588
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,404
No, no, he's downstairs. It's cooler.

589
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,452
Yeah, sure, I'll come tonight.

590
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,081
- Oh, thanks, Dex.
- Oh, hey, listen, what are friends for?

591
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,751
WILMA:
Just call me Billie. Everyone does.

592
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:09,511
So I thought I ought to call you anyway,
see what you thought, Professor Stanley.

593
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,682
-  Who told you I was here? Charlie Gereson?
-Yeah. I sent him out for a hamburger.

594
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,141
Just about twisted his arm.

595
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,103
That kid don't know if it's night or day
when he gets going.

596
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,980
Yeah, he's very dedicated.

597
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,817
Look, I'd be almost willing to bet
that crate's full of National Geographics...

598
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,902
...or back issues of the Reader's Digest.

599
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,365
Well, the date on it said 1834.

600
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,953
Did they publish the Reader's Digest
way back then, Professor Stanley?

601
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:39,249
- 1834? Really?
- Yeah, it's stenciled right on the side.

602
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,961
June 19, 1834.

603
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,423
And then something about
an arctic expedition.

604
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,677
Maybe there's something more interesting
in your crate than National Geographics.

605
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,648
Because everyone in the department
is looking to put the knife in you.

606
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,694
- I mean, some of these so-called academics--
- Wilma.

607
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,780
--make the shark in Jaws
look like fucking Flipper.

608
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:14,326
- Wilma.
- Your husband's calling you, Billie.

609
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,661
Oh, God, Henry, what's wrong now?

610
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,664
HENRY:
Not a thing, Wilma.

611
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,793
Everything's just fine.

612
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,477
- Hell of a shot.
- Bull's-eye.

613
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,647
WILMA:
Oh, Henry, can't you do anything right?

614
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,274
HENRY: Huh?
- "Huh?"

615
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,610
That's what I figured. "Huh."

616
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,779
That's just what I'd expect from you.

617
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,489
I told you half an hour ago...

618
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:57,118
...to get one of them kids
in the monkey suits to bring the car around.

619
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,037
Oh, I'm sorry.

620
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:03,208
Oh, Henry, you are such a little kid.

621
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,543
I swear to God, you are.

622
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,463
I mean, where would you be
without me to take care of you?

623
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:21,434
DEXTER: I'm still betting your crate's
full of old magazines and just plain junk.

624
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,479
All the same, though....

625
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,524
An arctic expedition.

626
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,442
And that date.

627
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,821
Yeah, kind of gets you, doesn't it?

628
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,991
Yeah, it kind of does.

629
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,910
- I'm sorry.
- Got it.

630
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,662
MIKE:
It's kind of heavy.

631
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,915
I'll just swing this end around.

632
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,713
Yeah. Move it over here.

633
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,132
DEXTER: I'm surprised you didn't
open this thing yourself.

634
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,551
MIKE:
No, I figured that was for you.

635
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,594
DEXTER: How come you didn't tell
Charlie Gereson?

636
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,555
Well, he's just a grad student.

637
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,057
And with Professor Tirrell
being over in England...

638
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,435
...I figure you're the boss.

639
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,694
- Hold this on it, will you?
- Yeah.

640
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,283
What made you look under here, anyway?

641
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,285
I flipped a quarter trying to decide...

642
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,955
...if I should buff the second-floor hallway
first or wash the lab windows.

643
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:28,209
Only when it came down, I missed it,
and it rolled under here.

644
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,964
Oh, there it is.

645
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,092
Probably would have let it go...

646
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,471
...only that was my last quarter
for the Coke machine.

647
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:47,645
It's not very nice in there, is it?
God, I hate tight places.

648
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,944
- Are you okay, doc?
- Yeah.

649
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,089
Help me out with this, will you?
I think we might really have something here.

650
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,217
All right. Okay?

651
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,688
DEXTER:
Put it right on this table here.

652
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:48,373
- What's wrong?
- It felt like something shifted in there.

653
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,708
Did you feel it
when we lifted it on the table?

654
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,378
I did feel something under the stairs.
It felt heavy.

655
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,549
Yeah, but it seemed like
something moved on its own.

656
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:01,344
Well, if there ever really were
any living specimens in there...

657
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:06,057
...I doubt if they're feeling very lively after,
what, 147 years?

658
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,227
Oh, yeah. Sure.

659
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,438
I guess I must be spending too much time
in the sun, huh, doc?

660
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:15,483
- Well, let's get this open, shall we?
- Yeah.

661
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,362
I got a hammer and chisel out in the closet.
Just wait while I go get them.

662
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,407
Yeah. Hit those lights, will you, Mike?

663
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,251
And don't just leave the pots soaking
like you did last time.

664
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,545
Scrub them and put them away.

665
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,339
Just because you
and your intellectual friend...

666
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,010
...are gonna play chess, doesn't mean
you have to leave a mess for me.

667
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,763
Wipe the stove.

668
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,765
Yes, Billie.

669
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:52,729
And kindly have him out of here
before I get back from my classes.

670
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:57,275
But frankly, that tobacco he smokes
makes me wanna ralph.

671
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,782
Yes, Billie. Yes.

672
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,076
"Yes, Billie. Yes, Billie."

673
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:12,707
Oh, Henry.
What would you do without me?

674
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,460
I don't know, Billie.

675
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,798
Well, on that we're even.

676
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,594
Enjoy your chess.

677
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,647
- I bet they're worth something, huh, doc?
- Yeah.

678
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,608
Doc.

679
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,111
No, no. Be my guest, Mike. It's your find.

680
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:45,573
You're right. There's probably
nothing in there but rocks and plants...

681
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,700
...that'll turn to dust if you touch them.

682
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,829
- But I'm pretty hot to see, just the same.
- To tell you the truth, so am I.

683
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,251
Doc, it's loosening up. Could you...?

684
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,253
Yeah, sure.

685
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,320
Christ, I can't see a frigging thing.

686
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,157
Where did I leave my flashlight?
Do you remember, doc?

687
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:13,244
Never mind.
Let's just get this last nail out of there.

688
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,708
MIKE:
Do you hear that?

689
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,131
There's something in there, doc.

690
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,010
There's something shiny.

691
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,803
Christ.

692
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,181
- It looks like a couple of emeralds.
- Don't!

693
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,102
Help me, doc! Help me, doc!

694
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,022
God, it's biting. Help me!

695
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,446
Oh, God.

696
01:12:52,659 --> 01:13:04,962
Mike.

697
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,805
- Oh, Jesus. Charlie. Charlie!
- Professor Stanley, what--?

698
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,224
The janitor. The crate.

699
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,684
It was-- It was....

700
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,520
What happened? Professor, slow down.

701
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,523
Charlie, listen,
we gotta get the campus security.

702
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,985
- We gotta get the--
- Slow down, Professor Stanley, slow down.

703
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,779
I don't know what you're talking about.

704
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:16,534
Charlie, it's the-- You know the janitor?
You know Mike, the janitor?

705
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,996
- Yes, of course I do.
- Well....

706
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,320
It just sucked him in.

707
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:58,201
- That's pretty far out, Professor Stanley.
- It's true, it's true. I swear to God, it's true.

708
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:03,414
- Come on, we gotta get the campus police.
- No, campus security's no good.

709
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,126
If I'm having trouble swallowing this,
what the fuck are they going to think?

710
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:14,467
I don't know what they would think.

711
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:18,471
They'd think you'd been off
on a hell of a toot.

712
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,098
- But, Charlie....
- No, no.

713
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,976
They'd think we'd both been off
on a hell of a toot.

714
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:27,855
Got you seeing Tasmanian devils
instead of pink elephants.

715
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,776
I think I'll go down...

716
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,736
...and see how the land lays.

717
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:37,949
- No, don't! It may be out.
- No, I doubt that.

718
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:42,453
- Charlie, please don't go down there.
- Be right back, Professor Stanley.

719
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,334
He'll see it.

720
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:52,880
He'll see the crate, he'll see the blood,
he'll see Mike, and then he'll believe me.

721
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,553
Charlie.

722
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,472
Charlie?

723
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,275
There, see the blood?
Do you think I'm crazy now?

724
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,658
You think that I killed him?
Look at the blood. Look--

725
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:23,744
It's gone.

726
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,956
- What's gone?
- The....

727
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,502
It got out.

728
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,381
I thought it would be potbound
after all these years, but it got out.

729
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:40,094
It pushed the crate off the table.
From the way this track looks....

730
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:49,020
It pushed the crate back in
under the stairs...

731
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,105
...where it felt safe for so long.

732
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,526
Hey, Charlie.

733
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,368
Charlie, I really think--

734
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:41,489
Charlie, listen, don't go in there.
If you had seen that thing....

735
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,324
Don't worry.

736
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:47,244
Christ.

737
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,253
It looks like it's been through a hay baler.

738
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,089
Now do you believe me?

739
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,259
Charlie, don't go near it.

740
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,720
I don't want the crate...

741
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:07,932
...I want that shoe.

742
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,768
I wanna measure the bite marks.

743
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,939
Maybe we can figure out...

744
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,734
...what we're dealing with here.

745
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,822
No, Charlie!

746
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,006
We gotta--

747
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,176
We gotta stop it. We gotta stop it.

748
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,011
- What?
- Two people are dead already.

749
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,681
We gotta-- Dear Christ, they died.

750
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,684
Hey, Dex. Dex, hold it.

751
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,272
- What happened?
- Two people are dead already.

752
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,025
- And....
- Who's dead?

753
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:45,696
- Where's Wilma?
- She's gone. Dex, what the--?

754
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,281
What the hell happened to you?

755
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,993
Two people are dead,
and I could be blamed.

756
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:55,498
I know that's a terrible consideration
to have at a time like this, Henry....

757
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,170
HENRY:
Good God.

758
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:04,590
Last time I saw someone do that
was in the movies.

759
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,051
It could be my ass, Henry,
and it wasn't me.

760
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,930
It was that thing in the-- in the crate.

761
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:14,099
I don't even know what it was.

762
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,644
What two people? Who is dead?

763
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,484
Mike, the janitor in Amberson Hall...

764
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,028
...and Charlie Gereson.

765
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:29,740
He wanted to measure the bite marks,
Henry.

766
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,034
I guess he got his chance.

767
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,620
- I certainly guess he did.
- Dex, Dex.

768
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,789
Dex, I can't do anything for you...

769
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,250
...unless you stop being
so goddamned elliptical.

770
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:43,212
Now, just slow down.
Tell me the whole story from the beginning.

771
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,714
- Can you do that?
- All right. All right.

772
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,800
I think I can do that now.

773
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,511
Oh, thank God for you, Henry.

774
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,562
I had a hundred crazy ideas
about how to get rid of it coming over here.

775
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,438
I kept thinking about Ryder's Quarry.

776
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,107
- You know that place?
- I know it.

777
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,276
I kept thinking
that would be deep enough...

778
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,112
...if only there was a way
to get that crate over there.

779
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,781
You know, I kept thinking if we....

780
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,910
I don't know anymore.

781
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,290
Am I going crazy, Henry?

782
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,542
No.

783
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:28,465
I have to use the facilities, Dex.

784
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:30,718
I'll be back in a minute.

785
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,055
And then we'll decide
what we need to do.

786
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,560
- Thanks, Henry.
- Well, what are friends for?

787
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,990
- Let's get you another drink, Dex.
- No, no, no, I've had enough.

788
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,160
It's a wonder
I'm not plastered out of my gourd.

789
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,953
Shock, I guess.

790
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:01,415
Just one more for the both of us
while we talk this over.

791
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,669
- We may need it.
- Yeah, okay.

792
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,641
My God.

793
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,299
Henry, goddamn it!

794
01:24:57,467 --> 01:25:01,178
How many times have I told you
to lock the goddamn door?

795
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:13,148
Henry.

796
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:32,501
HENRY: Wilma, I've had to leave in a hurry
because of a call from Dexter Stanley.

797
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:36,130
He seems to have gotten himself
in a great deal of trouble.

798
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:41,135
I'm ashamed to tell you of this,
but ever since Dexter's wife died...

799
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:45,889
...he's had problems coping
with certain young female grad students.

800
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,225
He's been able to cover up
several incidents...

801
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,395
...but this one looks very serious.

802
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,236
It seems he got a young woman
to accompany him to Amberson Hall...

803
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,738
...under false pretenses
and then attacked her.

804
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:08,412
When Dex called me,
he was barely coherent.

805
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,082
He was gibbering with fear
and crying, I think.

806
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,126
Aw. Poor Dex.

807
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,171
I tried to get him to tell me
what had happened to the girl...

808
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,590
...but for the most part,
he only kept repeating:

809
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:22,885
"It's awful, Henry. It's awful."

810
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:25,387
Wilma, could you come out here?

811
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,890
I know it's asking a lot...

812
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:31,018
...but you're always so clear-headed
about these things...

813
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,604
...and you know how to be firm.

814
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,900
I think Dex could use a firmer hand
than mine right now.

815
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,611
Not to mention the girl herself.

816
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:46,074
He said that she had curled up
in a dark place and won't come out.

817
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:51,622
I'm sorry to have to ask you to come over
to Amberson Hall and help me out...

818
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:56,210
...but as you so often say,
what would I do without you?

819
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,005
What indeed, Henry? What indeed?

820
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:10,701
WILMA:
Henry?

821
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,751
Henry?

822
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,300
Henry, where are you?

823
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,051
HENRY:
The laboratory, Wilma.

824
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,137
Downstairs.

825
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,041
What are you doing
creeping around down there?

826
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,544
Where's Dex?

827
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,756
What kind of a mess
has he gotten himself into?

828
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:11,094
Well, it's easier if I just show you, I think.
Come on down.

829
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:18,435
- What's this?
- Oh, I found them in the....

830
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,104
Oh, Henry.

831
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:23,440
Did he beat her?

832
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:24,941
Well....

833
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,362
Well, how bad is she? Is she conscious?

834
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:43,418
HENRY: I think it's easier
if you just see for yourself, Wilma.

835
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,797
What are you laughing about?

836
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:52,135
Your best friend gets in a scrape with a girl
and you're laughing?

837
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,138
Well, there is a funny side to it, Wilma.

838
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,100
Wait till you see. You'll think so yourself.

839
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,772
You're hysterical, Henry.
It's just what I would have expected.

840
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,902
No, I don't think you'll expect this,
Wilma.

841
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:13,490
No, this is going to be
an entirely new experience.

842
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,661
What are you doing, Henry?
Let go of me. Henry.

843
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:21,581
What's going on?
The lab's the other way.

844
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:27,003
The lab, yes,
but the girl is under the stairs, Billie.

845
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,007
Wait till you see. That's what's so funny.

846
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:35,929
The girl has crawled under the stairs,
and she won't come out.

847
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,890
She's all curled up,
you know, like a little baby.

848
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:42,060
- Oh, Henry.
- And making funny sounds and....

849
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:43,645
What did he do to her?

850
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,189
Well....

851
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,194
You can get her out, Billie.

852
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,779
I know you can get her out.

853
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,991
Why don't you give it a try?

854
01:30:57,076 --> 01:31:02,414
You always know how to handle
these things, Billie, no problem.

855
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:03,707
No trouble.

856
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,209
I know you can get her out.

857
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,339
What are you doing, Henry?
What are you doing?

858
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:15,552
What I should have done a long time ago.
Get in there, Wilma.

859
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,305
Just tell it to call you Billie, you bitch.

860
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,891
Stop it. Stop it, Henry. I'll scream.

861
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,269
Oh, scream all you want. I'll help you.
Wake up!

862
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:28,982
Wake up, whatever you are.
Wake up, wake up! Dinnertime!

863
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:34,988
Poison meat!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

864
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:40,368
Wake up. Wake up. Wake....

865
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,756
Well, that was great, Henry.
That was just great.

866
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,758
You think this is a Friday-night fight?

867
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,718
Huh?

868
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:57,928
Is that what you think?

869
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,765
You wanna see some real punching?

870
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,941
Same old Henry,
afraid of your own shadow.

871
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,071
You know what, Henry?
You're a regular barnyard exhibit.

872
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:21,493
Sheep's eyes, chicken guts,
piggy friends...

873
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,620
...and shit for brains.

874
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:28,833
No good at departmental politics,
no good at making money...

875
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:31,628
...no good at making an impression
on anybody.

876
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,800
And no good at all in bed.

877
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,636
When was the last time you got it up,
Henry, huh?

878
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,473
When was the last time
you were a man in our bed?

879
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,100
Now, get out of my way, Henry...

880
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:48,144
...or I swear to God
you'll be wearing your balls for earrings.

881
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,898
And I swear to God,
if you ever touch me again--

882
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:05,412
Oh, just-- Just tell it to call you Billie.

883
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,781
HENRY:
I didn't see anyone, not a soul.

884
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:09,577
At this time of the year and no other,
the campus is almost totally deserted.

885
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:13,665
The summer session is over, and the fall
semester doesn't start for two more weeks.

886
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,917
It was almost hellishly perfect.

887
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,545
I never saw so much
as a pair of headlights.

888
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,215
"Henry, what did you do with the crate?
The crate?"

889
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,092
That's the beauty of it.

890
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,470
You provided the final piece
in the jigsaw puzzle yourself.

891
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:30,640
The crate is at the bottom
of Ryder's Quarry.

892
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,977
I drove out there with the remains
of three human beings.

893
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,312
Well, two human beings and Wilma.

894
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:39,899
I began to wonder, where did they go?

895
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:42,819
I mean, how much could it eat?

896
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:47,157
I think maybe at the very end...

897
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:49,743
...it began to suspect
what was happening.

898
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:32,327
So the question is, what happens now?

899
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:37,999
There's no evidence of foul play,
I've seen to that.

900
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,211
And there are no bodies.

901
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,047
No.

902
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,633
No, I don't suppose there are.

903
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,179
So, what about you, Dexter?

904
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,681
What are you gonna say?

905
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:58,394
Nothing.

906
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,565
Thanks. Thank you, Dexter.

907
01:37:04,109 --> 01:37:06,236
No need to thank me.

908
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:09,656
After all, what are friends for?

909
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:15,745
You understand, of course,
that I expect to whip your ass at chess...

910
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:19,123
...twice a week for the rest of our lives.

911
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:22,877
We'll have to see about that, won't we?

912
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,847
I haven't done anything to anybody.

913
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:37,559
Neither have I.

914
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,356
What if I had waked up
before you got here and called the police?

915
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,110
You didn't.

916
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:53,116
What if it gets out, Henry?

917
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:55,451
What if it gets out of that crate?

918
01:37:57,746 --> 01:38:00,915
If you saw the way I chained it up,
you wouldn't worry.

919
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:04,878
That thing is drowned in its box
70 feet down.

920
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,798
So relax.

921
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,968
Relax.

922
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,666
Bastards.

923
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,712
Goddamn bugs.

924
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,173
I'll get them bugs.

925
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,425
I own this goddamn building.

926
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:37,679
There's not going to be
any more damn bugs.

927
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:54,195
Heads are going to roll,
I promise you that.

928
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:55,905
Oh, yes.

929
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,581
- Hello, is that you, White?
MAN: No, sir, Mr. Pratt.

930
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:08,835
This is George Gendron here.
I just got off the plane from Seattle.

931
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,920
I have my report ready for typing and I--

932
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:14,090
The building superintendent
is on vacation, George.

933
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,551
- Sir?
- You believe that? Vacation.

934
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,095
- Well, I--
- I told them I wanted to hear from him...

935
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,598
...within the hour. Within the hour.
And he now has--

936
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:25,435
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
It's 9:34 p.m.

937
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:27,353
--exactly 26 minutes to go...

938
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:31,107
...or he can stay on vacation permanently.
Bastard.

939
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,444
MAN: Mr. Pratt, I got to the office here
and found a telex from Seattle...

940
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:35,945
...I thought you'd want to--

941
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,948
What are you doing in the office
at 9:30, George?

942
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:41,784
There's no overtime at
the executive level, you know.

943
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,620
Yes, I know that.
It's about the Pacific Aerodyne takeover.

944
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:47,540
Bugger Pacific Aerodyne.
They're done for. They've had it.

945
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,459
Norman Castonmeyer is a dinosaur.

946
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,587
He's too fucking blind to find his way
into the nearest tar pit.

947
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:53,796
But, Mr. Pratt--

948
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,549
Air-pollution count's
up to almost 7, George.

949
01:40:57,468 --> 01:41:01,054
People are dying of carbon-monoxide
poisoning, and they don't even know it.

950
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,263
Yes, sir, but--

951
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:04,766
Oh, I found another cockroach
this evening, George.

952
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:06,642
- Oh, no.
- One of those big ones...

953
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:10,104
...right here in my $3200-a-month
penthouse apartment.

954
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:12,982
My supposedly germ-proof apartment.

955
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,694
Now, would you like to tell me, George,
how an apartment can be germ-proof...

956
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:20,740
...when it's not even bug-proof?

957
01:41:21,366 --> 01:41:24,827
Well, I guess it can't, Mr. Pratt.
But I wanted you to know...

958
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:29,082
...that Pratt International now owns
a majority of Pacific Aerodyne's stock.

959
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:32,168
Of course we do.
I can't talk to you now, George.

960
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:36,172
I'm gonna clear up this damn cockroach
problem once and for all. Bastards.

961
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:49,185
I'm not gonna have any bugs
in my building.

962
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:51,854
I loathe bugs.

963
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,898
- Yes, sir, but, Mr.--
- Loathe them.

964
01:41:54,066 --> 01:41:55,900
But there's something you should know--

965
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:59,862
I've gotta let you go, George.
You did well.

966
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:02,281
Go out and fuck somebody.
But wear a damn rubber.

967
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,408
Everybody's got the damn herpes
these days.

968
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:08,830
Sir, Norman Castonmeyer
shot himself an hour ago.

969
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,043
- What?
- He did it when....

970
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:18,464
Well, when it became clear
there was no way to stop the takeover.

971
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:22,343
At least, that's what his wife thinks.

972
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,555
Wonderful.

973
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:29,392
Now we won't have to offer the old fart
a seat on the board of directors.

974
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,643
Yeah.

975
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:35,940
Now, get off the phone, George.
Never run good news into the ground.

976
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,818
I've got this bug problem.

977
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:43,072
Once you get bugs,
you never get rid of them.

978
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:48,578
They breed in the crawl spaces,
in the conduits...

979
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:52,123
...in the very core of the building itself.

980
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:58,588
Mr. Pratt?

981
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:01,716
Goodbye, George.

982
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,051
Yes, sir. Good night, Mr. Pratt.

983
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:31,954
Once they get a foothold in the building,
you never get rid of them.

984
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,016
Bastards.

985
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:58,189
Reynolds? White?

986
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,149
Talk to me.

987
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:05,154
WOMAN: I just called to tell you
what a monster you are, Mr. Pratt...

988
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:09,325
...and how I will rejoice
when you're finally dead.

989
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:12,411
Lots of people are gonna rejoice
when I'm dead.

990
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:16,832
- Who are you?
- Lenora Castonmeyer.

991
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:21,212
I'm the wife of the man you murdered
this afternoon.

992
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,839
Mrs. Castonmeyer. How are you?

993
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:27,843
I hope they keep hell hot for you,
you son of a bitch...

994
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:29,136
...I hope they do.

995
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:32,098
It wasn't enough for you
to drive him to his knees, was it?

996
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:34,183
No, you had to kill him as well.

997
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:38,479
He came home, and his eyes....

998
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:41,023
His eyes were so dead.

999
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,317
I asked him what was wrong.

1000
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:48,823
What could be so bad
to make his eyes look that way?

1001
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:54,537
And the only word he could say
was your name.

1002
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:58,457
Ten minutes later, I heard the shot.

1003
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:02,878
Yes, George Gendron told me
old Norman went out with a bang.

1004
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,047
How many men have you destroyed?

1005
01:45:05,215 --> 01:45:07,466
How many men have you killed,
you monster?

1006
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:09,302
Only the stupid ones.

1007
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:13,556
Only the ones who handed me a knife
and then stretched out their throats.

1008
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:18,728
Only the ones who,
if you'll pardon the expression, fucked up.

1009
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:23,065
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got this bug problem...

1010
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:26,819
...so we'll have to defer your charming
conversation for another time.

1011
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,405
- I hope you die.
- By the way--

1012
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,074
I hope you get cancer in the worst place.

1013
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,869
- Mrs. Castonmeyer--
- Leprosy.

1014
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,747
- Scream in hell forever, you monster.
- Mrs. Castonjammer...

1015
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:40,708
...would you mind telling me
who gave you my private number?

1016
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:41,917
I'd like to fire him.

1017
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:45,087
It was in my husband's address book,
you son of a bitch.

1018
01:45:45,922 --> 01:45:48,174
Well, I can't fire him, can I?

1019
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:04,857
That better be you, Reynolds.

1020
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,697
- Talk to me.
MAN: It's Carl Reynolds, sir.

1021
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:15,826
- I'm calling from Orlando, Florida.
- Orlando? Florida?

1022
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,538
Yes, the wife and I decided to take the kids
to Disney World this year--

1023
01:46:19,706 --> 01:46:22,583
I don't give a fuck if you decided
to take the kids to Attica.

1024
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,960
There are still roaches in this place,
Reynolds.

1025
01:46:25,128 --> 01:46:28,214
- I killed one not five minutes ago.
- I see. I....

1026
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,299
Do you like your job, Reynolds?

1027
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,968
Sir, I've spoken to Mr. White,
who's on desk tonight.

1028
01:46:33,136 --> 01:46:36,013
- Do you like your job, Reynolds?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:38,724
I'm glad to hear it,
because I wanna see White.

1030
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:42,770
- Mr. Pratt, it's almost quarter of ten--
- And if I don't first see White...

1031
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,981
...and then the exterminators
within the space of a half an hour...

1032
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:48,734
...you will have no job by midnight tonight,
understand?

1033
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:52,571
Next year you can take the wife and kids
to Disney World on your welfare check.

1034
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,991
Have you got that?
Are we together on this?

1035
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:01,205
- Yes, sir.
- Good, I trust we are. Goodbye.

1036
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,632
You have to watch them.

1037
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,467
Oh, yes.

1038
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:16,554
Castonmeyer, Reynolds...

1039
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,597
...bugs.

1040
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,350
That's all they are.

1041
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,144
All of them.

1042
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:33,988
And although
they're essentially brainless...

1043
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,157
...you have to watch them...

1044
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:40,453
...because they creep up on you.

1045
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,040
They creep up on you.

1046
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,835
PRATT:
Talk to me. Who's there?

1047
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:32,963
Good evening there, Mr. Pratt.

1048
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,841
Got bugs again, huh, Mr. Pratt?

1049
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:39,845
- Don't you talk to me like that, you hear?
- What way, Mr. Pratt?

1050
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,555
Like I was crazy.

1051
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:44,600
Oh, no, sir, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1052
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:47,853
I don't think you is crazy. Not at all.

1053
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:50,189
I was just trying to run down
in my mind...

1054
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:53,275
...who might have
a 24-hour fumigating service.

1055
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:59,240
I might be able to get Pirelli Brothers
out here by, shall we say, 11:30?

1056
01:48:59,407 --> 01:49:01,033
You might go far, White.

1057
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:06,664
I've noticed that in service jobs,
people like yourself often do.

1058
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:10,709
People of color.
Yes, 11:30 would be fine.

1059
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:14,463
Thanks, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1060
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:19,260
I'll call them just as soon as I finish
with that shower on 23.

1061
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:23,973
- Do it first. Do it now.
- Yes, sir. Right now.

1062
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:31,689
Only stunned.

1063
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:34,149
That's the explanation.

1064
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:39,071
Roaches are very hard to kill,
and they're quick.

1065
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,407
They can creep up on you.

1066
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:44,577
They can creep up on you if you let them.

1067
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:07,516
See, Mrs. Castonmeyer,
I grew up in Hell' s Kitchen.

1068
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:08,851
Bugs everywhere.

1069
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:12,855
I know what to do with a bug
when I see it.

1070
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:17,443
Spray it. Squash it. Kill it.

1071
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:24,825
What the fuck?

1072
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:27,995
Another son-of-a-bitching blackout.

1073
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:33,000
If it was my power company,
this would never happen.

1074
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:41,634
Bastards. Goddamn bugs.

1075
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:45,888
Bastards!

1076
01:50:49,392 --> 01:50:52,686
Fucking roaches. Goddamn b--

1077
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:59,151
Bug bastards.
I'll kill you, you goddamn little bug-eyed--

1078
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:26,387
Come on, come on, come on.
What do I pay you for?

1079
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,434
MAN:
Police, Emergency.

1080
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,104
It's about time.
What are you people doing down there?

1081
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:36,772
We got problems tonight, fella.

1082
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,567
- Or haven't you looked out your window?
- Listen, this is the Upson Pratt.

1083
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:41,777
I've got bugs.

1084
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,280
Everybody's got bugs tonight,
and I don't have time for bullshit.

1085
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:47,950
No, no, you don't understand.
These are cockroaches.

1086
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:52,621
The biggest ones I've ever seen.
It has gotta stop. It's gotta stop!

1087
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:55,958
On a slow night we could talk about it,
but this isn't a slow night--

1088
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,460
I don't think you understand
who you're talking to.

1089
01:51:58,628 --> 01:52:00,963
This is Upson Pratt. Upson Pratt!

1090
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:05,884
I'll have your job, you asshole.
I'll have your--

1091
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:12,099
White. White, talk to me.

1092
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:15,769
White. White, I know you can hear me.
The PA's on the emergency circuit.

1093
01:52:15,937 --> 01:52:17,396
White, talk to me.

1094
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:22,651
-Mr. Pratt, I'm stuck in the damn elevator.
-You can't be stuck in the elevator.

1095
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,571
I want you up here now.
There are roaches, hundreds of them.

1096
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,657
I'm gonna be here
till the power comes on. Sorry.

1097
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:31,493
I'll have your job, you black bastard.

1098
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,017
Come on, come on.

1099
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,150
You'll never get in here. Never.

1100
01:53:03,318 --> 01:53:06,487
And when this blackout is over,
people are gonna pay. Oh, yes.

1101
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:10,866
And you'll pay too, every one of you.
Every damn one of you.

1102
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:15,078
I've been beating bugs all my life,
and I'll beat you too.

1103
01:53:15,246 --> 01:53:16,413
Bastards. Ba--

1104
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,209
Talk to me.

1105
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:27,716
WOMAN: Pratt, you old monster.
Oh, I hope you die.

1106
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:32,387
I hope you die.

1107
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:48,862
I hope you die.

1108
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:52,950
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
It's 1 0:29-- It's 1 0-- It's 1 1 -- It's 1 2--

1109
01:53:53,117 --> 01:53:55,702
It's 1 -- It's 2-- Four-- One-- It's 2--

1110
01:53:55,870 --> 01:54:00,249
Three-- Four-- It's 4-- Four-- Two--
It's 4-- Four-- Three-- Four-- Four--

1111
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,137
WHITE:
Mr. Pratt?

1112
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:16,640
You there, Mr. Pratt?

1113
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:19,434
Mr. Pratt? Talk to me.

1114
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:23,897
Talk to me, talk to me. Honky bastard.

1115
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:30,112
What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?
Bugs got your tongue?

1116
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:59,933
Mr. Pratt.

1117
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,102
Bastard.

1118
01:55:42,226 --> 01:55:44,853
Now eat, you bigmouth.

1119
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:53,862
Chew your food before you swallow.

1120
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,741
-What's that?
-It's a comic book.

1121
01:55:57,909 --> 01:55:58,951
What?

1122
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,661
-It's a comic book.
-What?

1123
01:56:00,828 --> 01:56:02,871
-It's a comic book!
-A comic book!

1124
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,749
MAN 1: My kids love these things.
MAN 2: I love them too.

1125
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:08,710
Hey, look, look.
You can send away for all this stuff here.

1126
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:11,546
-Look, x-ray glasses.
-They don't work.

1127
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:14,716
They make your eyes black.
You look in and it's a gag, you know?

1128
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:19,471
Look, an authentic voodoo doll.

1129
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:23,016
-Somebody already sent for it.
-Yeah, we can't get that.

1130
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:26,353
How about this?
"Tired of getting sand kicked in your face?"

1131
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:33,193
-Where's Billy?
-He'll be down in a minute. I know he's up.

1132
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:35,570
Billy?

1133
01:56:35,738 --> 01:56:37,197
Stan, are you all right?

1134
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:41,743
I didn't get much sleep last night.

1135
01:56:41,911 --> 01:56:43,745
The storm?

1136
01:56:44,205 --> 01:56:47,249
No, it's this goddamn stiff neck.
I can barely move my head.

1137
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,167
Well, you must have strained it.

1138
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:53,046
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

1139
01:56:53,923 --> 01:56:56,508
Well, you poor old bear.
You want me to get some Bengay?

1140
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,927
No. No.

1141
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,101
I'll teach him
to throw away my comic books.

1142
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:13,608
Ready for another shot, Dad?
