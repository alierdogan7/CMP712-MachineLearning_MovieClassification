What is your problem?

00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:47,049
You, Fabious,
you're being selfish and greedy.

Stealing all the attentions.

No. That's a... We call that a fork,

has made her ignorant to some of

00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:50,682
I don't believe you.

535
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,694
He is not the dashing young man
you believe him to be.

536
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,997
So

537
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:01,735
these are the harsh realities
of the outside world.

538
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:05,333
Welcome home.

539
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,508
SOLDIER: Halt! Steady.

540
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,050
Oh.

541
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:17,242
Sorry to disturb you two love birds

542
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:20,217
but we've arrived
at the home of the Wize Wizard.

543
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:21,855
Who the hell is the Wize Wizard?

544
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,954
He's an ancient seer who helps many

545
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,822
on their quest with added insight.

546
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:28,897
Great. Well, let me know how it goes.

547
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,032
Leave him in his carriage, Fabious.

548
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,363
You and I will seek counsel
with the Wize Wizard.

549
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:34,493
No.

550
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:37,868
Come, Brother. This is the first stop
on your first quest.

551
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,498
We shall go together.

552
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:48,182
(ARMOR SQUEAKING)

553
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,251
(GRUNTING)

554
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:53,378
Brother,

555
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,181
you look ravishing in that armor,

556
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,452
but I don't think you'll need it.

557
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:00,459
The Wize Wizard is a peaceful,
little old man.

558
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,389
I'm wearing it.
You're just being jealous.

559
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,588
Shit!

560
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,667
Thadeous!

561
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,827
Fuck.

562
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,035
Hello? Anyone home?

563
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:18,838
THADEOUS: Looks as if someone is
cultivating glorious herbs in here.

564
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,848
FABIOUS: Hey, Wize Wizard,
is that you over there?

565
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,710
WIZE WIZARD: Who dares enter my den?

566
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:28,982
It is I, Prince Fabious
and my brother, Prince Thadeous.

567
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,056
We come to seek counsel.

568
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,593
Come, come. Give me kisses.

569
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,094
(MOANING)

570
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,834
Kiss him.

571
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:44,940
Fuck, no.

572
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,029
Pretty please.

573
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,369
Kiss it on the mouth.

574
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:49,877
For the quest.

575
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,309
I do it every time I come.

576
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:58,044
Hello. Nice to meet you.

577
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:00,579
(MOANING)

578
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,689
Oh, god.

579
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,358
Sit, sit.

580
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,518
Sit.

581
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:09,586
Fabious has been coming here
since he was a boy.

582
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,857
You did this when you were a child.

583
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:12,991
FABIOUS: Yes!

584
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:14,894
We had great times, didn't we?

585
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,261
Yes, yes, we did.

586
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:18,362
(WIZE WIZARD CHUCKLES)

587
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,237
You would kiss him?

588
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:21,707
WIZE WIZARD: Mmm-hmm.

589
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,574
Yeah, sometimes we
would do other things.

590
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,408
Like what?

591
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:29,776
When I was younger, we'd take
our shirts off and jump on the bed.

592
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:32,445
Playful secrets.

593
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:34,289
Don't tell father.

594
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,379
WIZE WIZARD: Hmm.

595
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,821
Breathe deeply of these herbs

596
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,723
and share a vision with me.

597
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:40,852
FABIOUS: Of course.

598
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:41,930
(CLEARS THROAT)

599
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:45,230
(CHUCKLING)

600
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:48,931
Yes. Allow me to puff as well.

601
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:50,198
WIZE WIZARD: Hmm.

602
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:52,296
(SIGHS)

603
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:55,906
(WHISTLES)
Those are some powerful herbs.

604
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,136
Giving me dark visions.

605
00:28:58,347 --> 00:28:59,837
Shall we pack this again?

606
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,439
I'm not getting visions.
I'm not sure if it's working, Wizard.

607
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,540
(GROANING)

608
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:06,143
Visions. Visions.

609
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,552
Thadeous,
are you seeing what I'm seeing?

610
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,951
You making a fool yourself.

611
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,526
Handle your shit, Fabious, please.

612
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:12,753
No, I can't.

613
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,361
Please, interpret these visions, Wizard.

614
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,692
Prophecies foretell of an evil wizard

615
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,463
laying his seed inside a virgin

616
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,801
under the eclipse of the two moons.

617
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:27,699
What? What evil prophecy is this?

618
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,243
The child she would spawn

619
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:31,869
is said to be a dragon most powerful.

620
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:36,277
Ew. Leezar wants to make love
to Belladonna to create a dragon?

621
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,444
- That's fucking disgusting.
- (FABIOUS GROANS)

622
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,884
FABIOUS: I cannot let this happen.

623
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,281
When is this eclipse?

624
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,017
In five nights' time,

625
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:47,385
but you will need an enchanted blade
to do this warlock in.

626
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,056
A blade made of unicorn horn.

627
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:53,299
Say where I can find such a sword
and it shall be mine.

628
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:57,236
It rests in the depths
of the most perilous hidden labyrinth.

629
00:29:57,606 --> 00:30:00,040
Just beyond Muldiss Darton.

630
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:01,300
Muldiss Darton.

631
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,978
Well, what is Muldiss Darton?

632
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,806
It's a place of legend.

633
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:07,606
(EXHALES)

634
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:15,468
FABIOUS: Oh. Powerful magic.

635
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,301
This crooked compass
will catch the light

636
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,537
and point the way to
the labyrinth's location.

637
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,043
Be warned,

638
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:27,083
they say the walls of this maze
drive men to madness.

639
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,411
But if you can find your way,

640
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,784
the blade will be yours.

641
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,822
Thank you, Wize Wizard.

642
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:38,156
Not so fast. First you
must answer a riddle.

643
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:43,433
What journey be long and twisted
and sensitive at hand?

644
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:48,367
To what end must man go
to discover the depths of his ecstasy?

645
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,203
Think hard, strong warriors. (CHUCKLES)

646
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:53,542
Fuck, I know this.

647
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:54,633
Oh. (CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

648
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:55,734
FABIOUS: I've got it!

649
00:30:56,313 --> 00:31:00,977
You want us to twist what is long
with our sensitive hands.

650
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:03,082
He wants us to jerk him off.

651
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,812
Just punch the tip and twist it.

652
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:08,892
Yes, but we are not going to do that.

653
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,653
If it's for the quest,
we will do what needs to be done.

654
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:13,957
(CHUCKLING)

655
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:17,931
I'll work the tip, you tickle his balls.

657
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:25,542
Yuck!

658
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,166
Pervert.

659
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:28,336
Did you get any information?

660
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,571
Let's just make camp.

661
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,616
Sick. This quest sucks.

662
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:36,051
It used to be you that joined him.

663
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,279
Yes.

664
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:42,248
Don't worry. All will be well.

665
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,788
Ha!

668
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:54,094
Attentions please, warriors.

669
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:55,932
I propose a toast.

670
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,700
Let us drink till thine asses are drunk.

671
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:00,809
Brother, we do not celebrate

672
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,708
until we complete the quest at hand.

673
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:04,405
It is the code of the Knights Elite.

674
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,746
What of my code where we drink like men?

675
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,046
Thadeous, we have some traditions

676
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:10,814
of our own out here on the road.

677
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:14,690
Manious, prepare the warrior's tidings,
if you will.

678
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:19,090
If it is the first night
of your first quest, well...

679
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:25,468

00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:32,242
Feast upon the heart of the beast.

683
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:33,935
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

684
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:36,410
It is a tradition among men:

685
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,577
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

686
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,841

You fuckers! That's not funny!

691
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,240
You're not supposed to eat it.

692
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:06,636
You all were chanting.

693
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:09,542
Maybe there's some donkey cock
in your carriage!

694
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,146
Fuck you, Boremont! Manious, fuck you!

it is I, Julie.

(URINATING)

705
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,123
We have crossed the hazel meadow,

706
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:57,522
and are now taking rest
at the Cliffs of Kuneman.

707
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:00,993
Now that the Princes of Mourne
have left their stronghold

708
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:03,462
their vulnerabilities are in your hands.

00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,793
My hands.

710
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:06,562
Bring Prince Fabious to me alive.

711
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,567
I would like him to witness
as I impregnate his love.

712

(LAUGHS) Impregnate.

713
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,508
As for Thadeous and his boy,

00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,878
That would be like
me asking you to get rid of Courtney

895
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,708
just because Julie is no longer with us.

896
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:29,109
I will drown Courtney
in the shallow fucking pond right now

897
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:30,343
if that means fair is fair.

898
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,918
I don't like that idea, sir.

899
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,953
No, Simon can help us.

900
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,022
Simon,

901
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,721
you must take this message to father.

902
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,350
Tell him that
the Knights Elite betrayed us

903
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:43,897
and he must send an army
across the valley to Muldiss Darton

904
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:46,396
and help us retrieve
the Blade of Unicorn.

905
00:42:46,534 --> 00:42:47,626
Hurry, Simon!

906
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:50,795
Fly to Mourne
and deliver these desperate words.

907
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:52,369
Fly!

908
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,006

909

(SNIFFING)

910
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,215
Come on, Manious,
you've been sniffing dirt all morning.

911
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:05,080
We would not be in this position, Julie,

912
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,984
if you wouldn't have gotten caught
communicating with Leezar.

913
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,249
And if you ladies were proper assassins,

914
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:13,725
you'd have cut them down back there
as the Dark Lord commanded.

915
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:16,924
Manious, what do you see?

916
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:19,826
They stepped towards the sun here.

917
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:23,265
This blade of grass,
one of them pissed on it.

918
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:27,631
And then they moved, very quickly,
mind, towards...

919
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,398
There!

920
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,778
JULIE: That's Marteetee's land.

921
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,947
What?

922
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:36,844
JULIE: Our mission may
be completed sooner than I expected.

923
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:38,411
(LAUGHS)

924
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,783
If I may be so bold, Your Highness,

925
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,654
what is the meaning
of that ribbon that you hold?

926
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,484
This?

927
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:49,526
It's a gift from Belladonna.

928
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,619
A symbol of her virgin purity.

929
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,514
I hold it and savor it.

930
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:57,745
You do that instead
of have sex with her?

931
00:43:57,955 --> 00:44:00,116
Belladonna is unlike any maiden
in the kingdom.

932
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:02,054
She behaves without judgment,

933
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,683
defies expectation.

934
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,653
When I first heard her voice

935
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,628
a tear came to my eye,

936
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,392
and that tear turned to ice,

937
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,468
and I kept that frozen tear

938
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:14,036
far from my heart
that burns with passion.

939
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:16,495
If she had a wound,

940
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:18,675
I would kiss it.

941
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:21,040
If she had a splinter,

942
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:24,637
I would pull it
from her flesh with mine lips.

943
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:29,979
Just say we are too late
and Leezar has had his way with her,

944
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:33,848
would you still be able to be with her?

945
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:36,515
I don't want to think about that.

946
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:38,627
But just say that we were moments late,

947
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:42,165
and he was able to get her cookies.

948
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:43,524
Shut up.

949
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:47,570
Yes, I know, but what if he butt-fucked
her? Would you still like her?

950
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,161
Do I have to write you a poem?

951
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,908
There's never been
a love so true as ours.

952
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:54,510
That's pure love.

953
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:56,042
Yes, it is.

954
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,613
THADEOUS: No, that's pure love.

955
00:44:57,915 --> 00:44:59,906
There's a naked woman
standing behind you.

956
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,711
Who is that?

957
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,919
Is she looking at us?

958
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,751
Who is it? Is it him?
Are you looking to him?

959
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,925
Is it Courtney? Is it to me?

960
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,388
It's Courtney. I think it's to me.

961
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:15,427
COURTNEY: I believe she is
taking her trousers off.

962
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:18,758
Right, I will return momentarily.

963
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:19,995
COURTNEY: No.

964
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:21,264
Thadeous, it might be a trap.

965
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:26,035
The only thing those tits will trap
is my warm spray.

966
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,269

967
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:29,938

make you think that, sir?

972
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,970
Oh, shit! It's a trap. A booby trap.
