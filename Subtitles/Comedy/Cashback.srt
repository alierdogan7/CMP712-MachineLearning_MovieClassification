1
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:02,862
It takes approximately 500
pounds to crush a human skull.

2
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:07,434
But the human emotion
is a much more delicate thing.

3
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,950
Take Suzy,
my first real girlfriend.

4
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,418
My first real breakup,

5
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,420
Happening right in front of me.

6
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,958
I never thought it was going
to be similar to car crash.

7
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,925
I've slammed the brakes,

8
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,964
And I'm skidding towards
an emotional impact.

9
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,968
So is this all my fault?

10
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,472
Me. Ben Willis.

11
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:53,480
It's funny what goes through
your mind at a time like this.

12
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:56,983
The two-and-a-half years
we spent together.

13
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,987
The promises we made.

14
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,994
The holidays we took
with her parents.

15
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,999
The lamp we bought
at IKEA together.

16
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,973
It was my final year
at art college.

17
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,510
And in the weeks that
followed the breakup,

18
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,513
I tried to figure out
what went wrong.

19
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,515
Why did we break up?

20
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:33,019
It's funny, but when I think back
now the reason seems so small.

21
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:36,523
One day she's with me,
and she's saying "i love you,"

22
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:40,026
And the next week
she's with someone else.

23
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,529
Probably saying
the same thing.

24
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:44,531
So did she
really love me?

25
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,499
What is love anyway?

26
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,537
And is it really
that fleeting?

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,007
Forget about her. You
don't wanna waste your time.

28
00:02:56,042 --> 00:03:00,046
Thinking about a girl that dumped
you for a loser like Steve Jenkins.

29
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:03,014
She didn't dump me

30
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,051
Why did she
chuck you anyway?

31
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,019
It ended

32
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,057
'Cause Suzy thinks the grass is
always greener on the other side.

33
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,061
She's always worrying about there
being a better party to go to.

34
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,030
Or a better boyfriend to be had.

35
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,568
I just felt I could
never make her happy

36
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,575
And then Steve Jenkins
started texting her.

37
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,578
How did Steve Jenkins
get her number?

38
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,545
It was a good point.

39
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,082
I only imagined the worst.

40
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,051
I don't want to think about it.

41
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,589
You need to go out with a beautiful
girl. A model or something.

42
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,556
Why?

43
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,093
Well, because if you've got
a beautiful girl on your arm,

44
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,060
Then you must
be worth having.

45
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,062
Women are in competition
with each other, you see.

46
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,100
Suzy sees you with a sexy baby,
she'll think to herself

47
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:56,102
"If I can get Ben back
from that beautiful girl,

48
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,604
Then I must be more
beautiful than her."

49
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,608
Sean's success with women
was pretty impressive.

50
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,115
It's true.
Ask your mom.

51
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,622
The age-old question.
What is love?

52
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:18,625
Excuse me.

53
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:29,135
That's good. That's perfect.

54
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,636
Ben, Mr. Adams here has
given his time up for you.

55
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,675
Don't you think we should show
him a little bit of respect?

56
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,686
Excuse me.

57
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,828
I live in student accommodation
not far from the college.

58
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,582
It's basically
a four-story concrete block

59
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:35,835
Housing some 120
hormone-crazed students.

60
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
This is the haunting period.

61
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,349
The time when the demons
of regret come for you.

62
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,353
She stood right there

63
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,356
When I said those words:

64
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,822
"I'm sorry.

65
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,860
"I don't think
i can make you happy.

66
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,862
Maybe we should break up."

67
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
And that's when
she got angry.

68
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
Hello?

69
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
Suzy, it's me, Ben.

70
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,400
Ben! I was asleep.
What is it?

71
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,404
Suzy, um...

72
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,658
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,910
I'm sorry too.

74
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,918
Do you think there's any chance
we'll get back together?

75
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:02,189
I don't think so, Ben.

76
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:05,425
I think it ran its course.

77
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,928
Besides,
I'm with Steve now.

78
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
Have you
slept with him?

79
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
Yes.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,443
Was it good?
I mean, is it better than...

81
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:26,446
I don't wanna talk
about it with you, Ben

82
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:29,449
I've gotta go.
Sorry, Ben.

83
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,951
Suzy?

84
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,027
To think about her now
with someone else,

85
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,065
It felt like all the oxygen
had been sucked from the room.

86
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,131
After my breakup with Suzy, I
just couldn't fall asleep anymore.

87
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,636
The more I tried to sleep,
the less tired I felt.

88
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,156
I was wide awake.

89
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:41,606
I tried everything.

90
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,144
I'd just become
immune to sleep.

91
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,149
I suddenly found
I had eight extra hours.

92
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,987
My life had been
extended by a third.

93
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,990
I wanted time to pass quickly,
but instead I was forced to witness

94
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,993
The passing of every
second of every hour.

95
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,998
I wanted the hurt I felt
to go away.

96
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,518
But in some cruel trick
of events,

97
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:11,003
I now had even more time
on my hands.

98
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,472
More time
to think about Suzy.

99
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,010
Would you mind getting out
Just checking that wheel?

100
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,993
I took the bus
with no real place to go.

101
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:41,033
I watched the landscape slowly change as
it clung to the last hours of sunlight,

102
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,537
Before leaving me to get
another sleepless night.

103
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,554
I started to read all the books
I wished I'd had time to read.

104
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,558
With the extra hours, I even had
time to reread my favorite ones.

105
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,071
But she was never far
from my mind.

106
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,156
Two pounds 75, please.

107
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,167
Ah, how much is it without these two?

108
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,676
One pound 70.

109
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,187
It was getting obvious that I
needed to trade some of my time.

110
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,696
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,667
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,706
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
It all looks fantastic, man.

114
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
I think you'll fit in
very well here.

115
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,214
It's a great
feeling inside, Ben.

116
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,469
It's marvelous. We hope
you've enjoyed reading about.

117
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,722
What it's like to be part
of Sainsbury's and listening

118
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,223
I know, I've been
through this with you.

119
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:56,228
There's so many opportunities,
Ben. It's a life thing.

120
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,738
I could feel a faint shift
in a faraway place.

121
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,994
A current of unknown
consequences was on its way

122
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,248
Moving towards me like
an unstoppable wave of fate.

123
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,754
T-E-A-M-W-O-R-K. Work.

124
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,256
Teamwork, Ben.

125
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,259
Welcome aboard.

126
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,782
And so I started working
the night shift at Sainsbury's

127
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,286
During the hours most
normal people are sleeping,

128
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,754
I'm busy trading my time.

129
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,793
I give them my extra eight hours,
and they give me money. Cash back.

130
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,518
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

131
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:16,058
I'm late again. Jenkins is
gonna kill me. See you later.

132
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,524
Yeah, see ya.

133
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,028
- Sharon!
- Yes, Mr. Jenkins?

134
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,315
- Late again, Sharon.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Jenkins

135
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,567
- Second time this week.
- I know, Mr. Jenkins.

136
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:28,070
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

137
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,071
Ay.
Ok

138
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,334
My first year at art college
was boring to say the least.

139
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,372
But it helped me to appreciate
the fundamentals of still life.

140
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,375
I'd like to remind the custome
that there's a special

141
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,843
Two for the price of one
offer on aisle ten.

142
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:57,883
Fresh bread and cakes. That's aisle ten for
a special two for the price of one offer.

143
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,889
Well, don't just stare at it, Ben

144
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,392
Clean it up.

145
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,902
You see, I've always
wanted to be a painter.

146
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,370
And like many artists
before me,

147
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,408
The female form has always been
a great source of inspiration.

148
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,917
I've always been in awe of the
power they unknowingly possess.

149
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,924
Now, are you going
to clean them up or not?

150
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,401
There is an art to dealing with
the boredom of an eight-hour shift.

151
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,939
An art to putting your mind somewhere
else while the seconds slowly tick away.

152
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,693
I found that all
the people working here

153
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,945
Had perfected
their own individual art.

154
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,912
Take Sharon Pintey.

155
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,451
Sharon knows rule number one.
The clock is the enemy.

156
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,418
The basic rule is this:

157
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,957
The more you look at the clock,
the slower the time goes.

158
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,965
It will uncover
the hiding place of your mind

159
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,468
And torture it
with every second.

160
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,976
This is the basic art in dealing
with the trade of your time.

161
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,483
Any cash back?

162
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,969
This is Barry Brickman.

163
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,508
You see, Barry thinks of himself
as a bit of a daredevil stuntman.

164
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,204
For a start,
Barry is quite well-Known.

165
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,898
When one of Barry's
bike tricks went wrong,

166
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,317
The cameraman put it
on the internet.

167
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,238
Barry has stuck
to his scooter ever since.

168
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,742
Matt Stephens is also
a king scooterer.

169
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,750
And what was
the other thing?

170
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,758
And what was
the other thing?

171
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:40,262
- Sausage!
- Oh, yeah.

172
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,268
Now Barry and Matt
are good friends.

173
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,235
There you go.
Take care.

174
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,772
Between them, they have come
up with a very different way

175
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:53,775
Of dealing with
the trade of their time.

176
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,277
Look. Look.

177
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,783
Theirs is an art to finding
anything to do that isn't work.

178
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,045
A few days later,
Barry and Matt were reported

179
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,299
For what they called
"helping the ladies."

180
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,304
It was these shampoo bottles
that sent them on their quest.

181
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,271
Barry and Matt knew
what they looked like.

182
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
And they knew that the women in the
supermarket knew what they looked like.

183
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,811
Their theory was that even
though it was a sex toy

184
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,063
Masquerading as
a bottle of shampoo,

185
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,780
Women would like
to try it as a sex toy

186
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,284
But were embarrassed to buy it
because they knew what it looked like.

187
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,324
The decision to buy it would be an easier
one if they were already at the checkout.

188
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,826
If they didn't object,
then Barry and Matt knew

189
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:48,830
They'd helped a bottle
find a happy home.

190
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,718
Barry had challenged Matt
to a scooter race

191
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,221
In which they would sprint
down one aisle and up the next.

192
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,509
They would do all 14 aisles, and
then back to the starting line.

193
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,727
They had been waiting for the
day the manager called in sick.

194
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,767
The art of doing something else other than
the work you're supposed to do, is addictive.

195
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,769
The excitement of doing something
that you shouldn't be doing,

196
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,237
Along with the consequences
if you're caught doing it,

197
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,275
Are so strong that it often pulls
others away from their own art.

198
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,279
On your marks,
get set, go!

199
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
We got winded!

200
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,468
I hadn't slept in two weeks.

201
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,477
My breakup with Suzy had left me with
a sense that time had become unhinged.

202
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,247
I drifted between
imagination and reality,

203
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,983
Between past and present
with increasing ease.

204
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,988
I feel like a real man.
You like men.

205
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,007
You like real men,
don't you?

206
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,518
When I'm out there in the kit

207
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:09,960
On the pitch
with the boys,

208
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,498
I look like a god,
I'm an adonis.

209
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,515
I keep myself
in good shape.

210
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,484
I see the looks.
I ignore them.

211
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,023
I feel the bolts of time slowly
coming away from the breakup.

212
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,525
Time manipulation
is not a precise science.

213
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,778
Like any art, it's
personal to the individual

214
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,531
So what is the art in making
my shift go so fast?

215
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,039
I imagine the opposite.

216
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,007
That time is frozen.

217
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:01,546
I imagine the remote control
for life has been paused.

218
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,582
Within this frozen world, I'm
able to walk freely and unnoticed.

219
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,588
Nobody would even know
that time had stopped.

220
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,063
And when it started
back up again,

221
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,101
The invisible join would be
seamless except for a slight shudder.

222
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,605
Not unlike the feeling of
somebody walking over your grave.

223
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,371
That moment when you see someone
walking down the street

224
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:20,125
Who is so beautiful
you just can't help but stare.

225
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,130
Well, imagine as I do,
that with the world on pause

226
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,133
It becomes very easy to
understand the concept of beauty.

227
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,137
To have it frozen
in front of you.

228
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,138
Captured.

229
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,142
Unaware.

230
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,621
For me, this fascination with
beauty started at a very young age.

231
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,161
I was six or seven, and my mom and
dad had taken on a foreign student.

232
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,627
She was in her late teens,

233
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,630
And was studying English
at a nearby school.

234
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,669
Being swedish, the walk from the shower
to her room didn't need to be a modest one

235
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,676
It was at that moment that something
very profound happened to me.

236
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:16,681
I was exposed to the female form
in a way I had never experienced.

237
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:21,151
I felt fascination and wonder
at the beauty of her nakedness.

238
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,689
And I wanted to freeze the world so that
i could live in that moment for a week.

239
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,160
I have never had a feeling
of such completeness.

240
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,698
To this day I still think it was one of
the most beautiful things I have ever seen.

241
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,210
[knocking]

242
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,717
You dropped these.

243
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,739
And would it be wrong?

244
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,742
Would they hate me
for seeing them?

245
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,744
I mean, really seeing them?

246
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,754
I read once about a woman whose secret
fantasy was to have an affair with an artist.

247
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,259
She thought that he
would really see her.

248
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,726
He would see every curve,

249
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,265
Every line,
every indentation,

250
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,269
And love them because they were part
of the beauty that made her unique.

251
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,739
And when I'm ready, all i
have to do to start time again

252
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:03,241
Is crack my fingers.

253
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,252
You look like shit.

254
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:15,754
Cheers

255
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,228
- Still not sleeping?
- No.

256
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,766
- Feeling any better about Suzy?
- No.

257
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,267
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.

258
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,734
No? Why?

259
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,736
Because every morning
you come by,

260
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,238
And every morning I talk
about the same thing.

261
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,777
And I'm bored of saying the same thing,
and I'm bored of feeling shit about it.

262
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:41,745
And most of all I'm bored of
being awake 24 hours a day.

263
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,783
Eew! Look who didn't get out of
bed on the wrong side this morning.

264
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,751
Very funny.

265
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,288
Time. But seriously, you 're gonna
feel like shit. It's gonna take

266
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,291
For instance, how long a
go did you think about her

267
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,258
Before we started having
this conversation?

268
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,796
About ten minutes before
you knocked on the door.

269
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:00,298
Oh, yeah. And what was the thought?

270
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,307
I thought about the dust.

271
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,276
The dust? God, you're weird!

272
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,314
Anyway, whatever. My point is,
every day you think about her

273
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:19,282
And the things that you
associate with her less and less.

274
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,820
Before long, you'll go a whole
day without thinking about her.

275
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,822
You know what might help
speed up the process?

276
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:24,823
What?

277
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,799
Me and Sean had been friends
since we were five.

278
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,337
We lived across the street from
one another, and grew up together.

279
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:41,607
For his 12th birthday,
Sean's mom and dad

280
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,842
Had bought him
a state-of-the-art computer.

281
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:46,810
Oh, mom!

282
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,348
Come on, boys, it's a nice day
why don't you play in the park

283
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:53,852
No. We're
okay playing this

284
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,859
Okay, I'm off shopping. You
be all right by yourselves?

285
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,128
Yes, mom. Bye, mom

286
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,514
Bye, Mrs. Higgins.

287
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,866
I won't be long.

288
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,877
- Wanna see something?
- What?

289
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,853
- What are they?
- Girls with no clothes on

290
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,357
Sean had found the magazines
under his mom and dad's bed.

291
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,896
The swedish student was one thing, but
this was something completely different.

292
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,364
The smiles on the girls' faces
and the total lack of shyness

293
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,903
About what they were showing the
camera was so confusing for me.

294
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,908
I had never seen the female part
up close and in so much detail.

295
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:52,410
I guess I imagined
something neater,

296
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,914
Like a smooth hole
drilled into a piece of wood.

297
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:59,184
The sort of hole where
you might place a wooden peg.

298
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,071
But the reality was much more
sexually aggressive.

299
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:05,266
It was hard to imagine
that my teacher, Mrs. Booth,

300
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:08,426
Had one under her skirt
that looked just like it.

301
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:10,428
Mom!

302
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,936
Forgot my purse.

303
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,440
Hey, what have
you two been up to?

304
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,446
After that, Sean's mom
always thought we were gay.

305
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,249
What will help speed up
the process?

306
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,787
You need to distract yours
elf with a couple of natalies.

307
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,793
A natalie was a term that Sean
had coined for any sexual encounter

308
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,297
That happened with a girl you
weren't in a relationship with

309
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,311
The term had come from a girl called Natalie
who lived across the street from Sean.

310
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:05,316
- Hello. Is Natalie in?
- Yeah. Natalie!

311
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,283
- Yeah?
- It's for you.

312
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,285
You see, Sean had
worked out the connection

313
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,323
Between the smiling faces
of the girls in the magazines

314
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:15,326
And the fact that
they were naked.

315
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,850
Fifty p.

316
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,872
That's it.

317
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,379
Natalie became one of the most
popular girls on the street.

318
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,894
Croissants on special offer.

319
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,407
She had
massive tits.

320
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,878
Very funny.

321
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,915
We were only
having a laugh.

322
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,884
Who's that?

323
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,886
That's a new kid.

324
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,424
Apparently he's
a martial arts expert.

325
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,927
Hey, mate!

326
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,430
Come here.

327
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,938
What's your name?

328
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,940
Brian.

329
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,442
Ben says you know
kung fu.

330
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,910
Yeah.

331
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,448
- So you reckon you can have me?
- Yeah.

332
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,218
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

333
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,954
Show us your moves then.

334
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,470
Grab my arm.

335
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,480
That's not funny.

336
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,485
Hi.

337
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,487
Hi, Ben.

338
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,456
You're not
working tonight?

339
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,994
No, I swapped
two hours this week.

340
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,998
Is that a pickle sandwich?

341
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,966
Ah.
Oh, ah, ye

342
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,004
Could I have a bite?
I'm starving.

343
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,511
Mmm. Thanks.

344
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,017
- What?
- You got some there.

345
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:28,019
- Mmm.
- There.

346
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,527
Let me.

347
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,033
Thanks.

348
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,043
I wanted to freeze time.

349
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,052
I wanted to savor
that moment.

350
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,558
To live in that moment
for a week.

351
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,560
But I couldn't stop it.

352
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:12,563
Only slow it.

353
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,568
And before I knew it,
she was gone.

354
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,574
After the door closed, I felt
like the last person on Earth.

355
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,060
What are you doing?

356
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,098
- Jenkins wanted us to go and fill the shelves.
- So here we are.

357
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,066
Iiiieeee.

358
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,604
Take no notice of him. He's love
struck. He asked Sharon out today

359
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,608
You did?
What did she say?

360
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,111
Her she said "yes. " He's taking

361
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,078
To the pictures
tomorrow night

362
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:07,618
Then it's back to mine. I'll need about
half an hour to talk away me face.

363
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,622
And then, she's
gonna get some of this.

364
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,593
Crush.

365
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,131
It's funny how the same word
for the feeling of attraction

366
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,133
Can be used for the feeling
of disappointment.

367
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,137
The oxford English dictionary states
one of the meanings for the word crushed

368
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:30,141
As "a strong and unreasoning,
but transitory attachment."

369
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,111
I had three crushes
when I was young.

370
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,614
The first was an athlete
called Zola Budd.

371
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,652
She was 18, and looked like a
tomboy with a small, slender frame.

372
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,156
But it was the fact that Zola
Budd defiantly ran barefoot

373
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,159
That made her so completely
attractive for me.

374
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,664
It was the Los Angeles Olympics
that would go down in history.

375
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:59,170
In the 3,000 meter race, Zola Budd
clashed with the American, Mary Decker.

376
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:02,173
Budd's heart for the race
was left where decker fell.

377
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,642
Zola finished seventh.

378
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,680
Ow. Ben, it's time for bed n
ow. You've got school tomorr

379
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,148
Well, well.
What an upset.

380
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,187
Can somebody tell me something
about the white blood cells? Tim

381
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,691
Uh, they help fight off bacteria
and germs in the body.

382
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,193
Very well done

383
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,694
Types...

384
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,164
Of cells.

385
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,703
The second crush was for
my biology teacher, Mrs. Booth.

386
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:36,672
Okay, class, who can tell me
something about cells?

387
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,210
She was a confident woman
whose figure-hugging outfits

388
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,178
Hinted at the sexiness
that lay hidden beneath.

389
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,716
I imagined Mrs. Booth asking me
to stay behind after school

390
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,220
And showing me the same
thing under her skirt

391
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:52,188
As the girls I'd seen
in the magazines with Sean.

392
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,726
But the main crush I had was
with a girl called Tanya Green.

393
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,198
When I looked at Tanya, i
didn't just see her, I felt her.

394
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,736
R. The white blood cells and
red blood cells work togethe

395
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,243
[Mrs. Booth giving
homework instructions]

396
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,752
Oy

397
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,759
The next day, Tanya caused a
lot of excitement in the class.

398
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,234
Tanya had broken her arm
falling from a swing,

399
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,771
And her cast had caused much excitement
amongst the other kids at the school.

400
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,774
Settle down now,
please, class.

401
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,242
Ugh.
That's enogh

402
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,244
But I saw it
differently.

403
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,281
It was the way
Tanya dealt with it.

404
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,785
The way she
scratched an itch.

405
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,290
The way it restricted
her movements.

406
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,795
The increasing amount of graffiti that
appeared on it during its six-Week life span.

407
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,301
Would you like to sign it?

408
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,307
Just here.

409
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,813
Thanks

410
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,321
Go away!
Stop it!

411
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,827
On the day the cast
finally came off,

412
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,596
Tanya's arm
was covered in hair.

413
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,331
Go on back to the jungle.

414
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,837
The six weeks without light had caused
the hair to grow thick and black.

415
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,840
But while the other kids joked
and called her "monkey,"

416
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,343
It only heightened
my fascination for her.

417
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,350
Don't cry.

418
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,319
You don't have to
worry about them.

419
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,356
I think you're beautiful
the way you are.

420
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,363
Will you be
my girlfriend?

421
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
Yes.

422
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,372
There was a place that
i often went to by myself.

423
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,840
It was just
behind the school.

424
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,879
It was close enough to still hear the screams
and shouts of the kids playing their games.

425
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:32,383
But at the same time,
it felt hidden away from them.

426
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,388
I had arranged
to meet Tanya there.

427
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,895
Whatcha?

428
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,897
Whatcha?

429
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,413
You wanna kiss me?

430
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,417
So this was to be
my first kiss.

431
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,419
Yeah.

432
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,425
Hey! Where you going?

433
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,394
I gotta go.
I'll kiss you tomorrow.

434
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,933
- But tomorrow's Saturday.
- Meet me here at 11:00.

435
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,943
I often came to play around the
school grounds on a Saturday.

436
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:36,947
The familiar building,
so unfamiliar in its quietness.

437
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,950
Peaceful, as if time
had frozen still.

438
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,433
It's like the walls of this room.

439
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,435
It keeps the whole building standing.

440
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,475
Tanya's parents had taken her
on a surprise holiday to America.

441
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,977
They set up home there,
and never returned.

442
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,482
It was the first time my heart
felt the other meaning of crush.

443
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,458
Checkmate.

444
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,996
What's wrong with you? You
normally kick my arse at chess.

445
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,499
Have you met someone?

446
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,968
Well, come on.
Give me the juice.

447
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,507
No, it's nothing really. Just
a girl at work I think is nice.

448
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,010
Nice? Nice what?
Nice rack?

449
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,478
No.

450
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,515
Well, yeah, but nothing like that.

451
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,018
What?
Girlfriend material?

452
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,486
She got small hands?

453
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,524
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Makes your willy look big.

454
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,543
You're such a loser.

455
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:57,493
So have you asked her out?

456
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,781
- No. Someone already beat me to it.
- Ahh, she got a boyfriend.

457
00:45:00,816 --> 00:45:04,034
No, but one of the guys at work
asked her out. She said "yes."

458
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,304
They're going
to the pictures tonight.

459
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,504
That doesn't mean
she fancies him.

460
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,543
She might just like him, and want
someone to go to pictures with.

461
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,548
How many girls have you taken
to the pictures and then snogged?

462
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,553
Oh, yeah!

463
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,063
What?

464
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,567
Quite a few.

465
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:38,569
There you go.

466
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,075
Can I have that?

467
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,548
Yeah, yeah,
that's right, Rory.

468
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,087
Well, of course I played
professionally, before the injury.

469
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:58,554
Any day, Rory.

470
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,093
You name the date,
me and my boys'll be there

471
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,061
All right. Sunday.

472
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:10,601
Just don't go crying
to your mama.

473
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,106
- Ciao.
- Whatever.

474
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:17,608
Tosser.

475
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,080
Game on.

476
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,583
2,000 feet jump.

477
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,121
Can't beat it. 3,000, kill ya.

478
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,142
There he is!

479
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,145
So, how'd it go
with Sharon?

480
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,147
- Oh, mate!
- So, did ya?

481
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,115
Of course I did.
She loved it.

482
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,155
Couldn't get enough of it. She went like
the toilet door on a Bombay shrimp trawler.

483
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,623
- Rack?
- Well, put it this way.

484
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,160
At least you know your kids
will never go hungry.

485
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,127
And?

486
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,665
Like an artist's pocket.

487
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,136
Okay, champs. Rory Brown,

488
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,138
Manager of Sainsbury's, Islington

489
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,677
Has challenged us to a
football match on Sunday night.

490
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,681
Finished?

491
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:32,648
Good.

492
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,186
The reputation of
this supermarket is at stake

493
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,690
Your reputations, as
employees, are at stake.

494
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,158
This is not just
a game of football

495
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,697
This is what it means
to be a modern-day gladiator!

496
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:52,202
Now, I want you to think of
me as Russell Crowe.

497
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:55,671
And you, you're all
the other slaves.

498
00:47:55,706 --> 00:48:00,175
And as slaves,
you will play to the death

499
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,715
For what happens on Sunday
night, will echo through eternity

500
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,224
Sunday. 8:00 P.M.
Sunny sports center.

501
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,240
You have got to got
to be joking, right?

502
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,245
We're gonna get murdered.

503
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,248
[exhales]

504
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,751
Aaah!

505
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,758
- Hi.
- All right.

506
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,726
Ah, bollocks!

507
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,264
- Playing on this right wing. Like a train, I am.
- Hiya.

508
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,766
Heads up!

509
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,773
Gather round, whitechapel.
Whitechapel, gather round.

510
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:06,241
Okay, chaps, this is it!

511
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,279
That is Islington Sainsbury's
over there.

512
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,284
All I can see are
a lot of pretty uniforms.

513
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,787
Take a good look
at one another.

514
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:19,254
Why?

515
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,292
Natural-born killers!
Every one of you!

516
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,797
So let's get stuck in there
and settle this! Huh? Huh?

517
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,800
Huh?

518
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,813
Hey, Barry, I've got
this really great game.

519
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,314
All right, Rory.

520
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,281
Jenkins.

521
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,819
There's some pretty uniforms
you boys got.

522
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:53,323
See you've brought
your top team this time.

523
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,294
Looks can be deceiving

524
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,333
- Well, that's obvious.
- What?

525
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:06,802
Right. Call.

526
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,339
Heads. No, tails

527
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,808
Tails it is.

528
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,846
Come along!

529
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,320
We've got one goal.

530
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,858
All right.
Get in your spaces.

531
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,364
- Ahh!
- Look at that!

532
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,373
Get it!

533
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,878
Come on, take it, come on

534
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,385
Come on, after it.

535
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:10,400
I'm playing! I'm playing ! The safe
keys are hanging of f, on the top shelf!

536
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,403
Get it! Get it!

537
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,410
What?

538
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,916
S! Triangle s! Triangle

539
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,921
- Foul!
- No foul! Play on!

540
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:33,190
Play on, my ass!

541
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:35,390
I'm all right!

542
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,929
I'm all right!
I'm all right!

543
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,397
What are you doing?

544
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,684
Grow up.
Forget about the money

545
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,902
What money?
What are you doing?

546
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,440
What am I doing? I'm talking
to an empt y phone is what I'm doing

547
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,943
'Cause there's a dead man on the
other end of this fucking line!

548
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:57,412
- I love that film!
- Pachino. Didn't you hear though?

549
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,951
You oughta see the bank job
shootout scene on me plasma screen!

550
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,456
Come on, whitechapel,
we can still win this.

551
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:09,476
- Come on, lads!
- Shoot!

552
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:12,462
Aye! Dipstick!

553
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,463
Sorry!

554
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,469
The ball, the ball,
the ball, the ball

555
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,975
For the love of God!

556
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,983
Yeah! Finally!

557
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,487
Oh, my Lord!
Get a life, dipstick!

558
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,993
Time out, ref.
Time out.

559
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,499
Well, chaps,
could be worse.

560
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
How could it be worse?
It's 26-Nil.

561
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:54,970
It doesn't matter.

562
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:59,474
What matters is, there's
less than a minute to play.

563
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,513
And we are not leaving this
pitch until we score a goal!

564
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,519
Matt, get the ball to Ben.

565
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,025
Ben, this is your moment.

566
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,528
I need you.

567
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,530
Get your little legs.

568
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,035
Run up that right flank
like the devil were after you.

569
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,539
I'll be in the center
waiting for your cross.

570
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,059
Use Barry if you need to.

571
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:34,544
Matt, stay on my left flank.

572
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,298
I need that cross.

573
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,550
I need that ball

574
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,053
Here.

575
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,521
I'll take the shot.

576
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:51,561
And we, we will
share the glory.

577
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,529
- Got it?
- Yeah.

578
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,531
Now let's score a goal!

579
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,570
On! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come

580
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:03,573
Come on, boys, come on

581
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,575
[Blows whistle

582
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,138
No!

583
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,121
I often wonder
what it would be like

584
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,623
To spend the rest of my life
with the world on pause.

585
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:32,662
To live out the rest of my life
between two fractions of a second.

586
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:36,183
To die of old age,
and then have time continue.

587
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:39,669
The young me gone,
and a dead old man in my place.

588
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,197
Was I spending too much time
in this frozen world?

589
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,167
It felt safe, untouchable.

590
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,705
But how safe
is anyone's world?

591
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,748
Hello?

592
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,254
Anyone there?

593
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,267
It's funny, but the
last thing I imagined

594
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,306
Was that maybe I wasn't the
only one who could stop time.

595
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,319
Oh, my god!

596
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,791
You all right?

597
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,829
Don't just stand there!
Drive me to the hospital!

598
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,334
- Can you make sure Sharon gets home all right?
- Yeah.

599
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:25,335
Cheers, mate.

600
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,342
Right, I'll see
you both tomorrow.

601
00:58:32,377 --> 00:58:34,344
- See ya.
- Bye.

602
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,853
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

603
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,822
I felt that game was
never going to end.

604
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,361
- Matt's face when the ball hit Jenkins.
- Oh, I know.

605
00:58:51,396 --> 00:58:52,862
Do you think he'll be okay?

606
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,865
It was ego more than
anything, I'd say.

607
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,873
It's probably none
of my business, but,

608
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,341
Are you and Matt
seeing each other?

609
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,380
No. We went to the cinema the
other night, but just as friends.

610
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:12,847
Hmm.

611
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,635
Why? What has Matt said?

612
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,388
He said he slept with you.

613
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,394
- So you didn't?
- No, of course not! What do you take me for?

614
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,362
Sorry.

615
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,899
Did he say
if I was any good?

616
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,903
I think it was the best sex
he's never had.

617
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:36,371
[chuckles]

618
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,408
So you don't have a boyfriend?

619
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,376
No. We split about six months ago

620
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,413
He went off to university
in the States and

621
00:59:43,448 --> 00:59:45,415
It became impossible
to see each other.

622
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,420
And you? Do you have a girlfriend?

623
00:59:50,455 --> 00:59:53,190
We broke up
a few weeks ago.

624
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:55,925
I'm sorry. How are you doing?

625
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,928
Better.

626
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,935
So how long have you been
at the supermarket?

627
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,402
'Bout two years

628
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:11,441
- Did you get to college?
- I was doing P.T. Therapy, but I dropped out.

629
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,408
Why?

630
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,447
It wasn't me. And besides, I
needed to start earning money

631
01:00:17,482 --> 01:00:19,449
What are you saving for?

632
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,451
Putting myself
through evening classes.

633
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,953
Yeah? Studying...

634
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,472
Spanish.

635
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:26,921
Spanish?

636
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,923
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

637
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:33,963
N- N-Nothing. I just wasn't
expecting it. So what can you say?

638
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,434
Mmm...

639
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,972
Tu equipo de futbol
es una puta mierda

640
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,475
Which means?

641
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,978
It means your football team is shit.

642
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,981
26-Nil.

643
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,487
So why Spanish?

644
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,956
I've lived here all my life

645
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,495
I've worked at the supermarket
for two years and,

646
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,463
Even though it's happening slow,

647
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:13,468
I just feel that my life's
ticking away a second at a time.

648
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,007
I thought that Spanish would be one way that I'd
be able to find a job that would involve travel.

649
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:23,763
Like being an air hostess or teaching
English at Spanish-speaking schools.

650
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:29,018
I've always dreamt of travel into
far-off places... like South America.

651
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:32,021
To places where the sun
kisses every morning.

652
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:33,988
But more than that,
I wanna be able

653
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,027
To talk to people about their
lives and about their dreams

654
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:39,796
Silly, really.

655
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:41,496
No, it's not.

656
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,499
That's your dream.

657
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,001
Knowing what you want
is half the battle.

658
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,039
Most people go through their whole
lives not knowing what they want.

659
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:53,543
It's easy to find if you know
what you're looking for.

660
01:01:53,578 --> 01:01:55,812
So what is it that you're looking for?

661
01:01:55,847 --> 01:01:58,047
I've always wanted
to be a painter.

662
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,551
Maybe have my work hung
in a gallery one day.

663
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:04,554
I've always wanted to meet a painter.

664
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,557
Why?

665
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,560
Don't know.

666
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:16,065
I think it might be something to do
with their ability to see beauty in everything

667
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,069
To then capture it, and hang
it on a wall for all to see.

668
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,574
I find it romantic

669
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,088
Well, this is me.

670
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:41,358
Number 34

671
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:43,558
Thirty-four.

672
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,094
It's on the top floor.

673
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,596
Nice.

674
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,100
Adios.

675
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,603
Hasta luego.

676
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,113
Night, Ben.

677
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,589
That first kiss.

678
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,127
I've always made
such a mess of it.

679
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,130
Come!

680
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,137
Hiya. I just wanted to know
whether you were all right.

681
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:30,605
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm fine.

682
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,142
'Cause it looked
really painful last night.

683
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:37,111
This. Oh, no. I've had
worse than this

684
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,899
And the hospital said
you'd be okay?

685
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:42,794
Ah, you know. They said I'd live.

686
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:45,655
Are you sure
you're all right?

687
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,657
Ah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, ye

688
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,160
Do you know?
I've almost forgot it happened

689
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,664
I really can't feel a thing!

690
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,667
I'm thinking of having
a party on Saturday.

691
01:03:57,702 --> 01:04:01,636
You know,
cheer everybody up

692
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,174
Sure you'll all be there
Won't you, Sharon?

693
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,678
Um, yeah.

694
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,180
Great.

695
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,156
- Hiya.
- Whatcha?

696
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,159
Thanks for walking me
home last night.

697
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:29,699
That's all right. Thanks
for sharing your dream with me

698
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:32,201
So have you heard
the party rumor?

699
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:34,168
No

700
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,706
Jenkins' birthday on Saturday.
He's throwing a party.

701
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:38,708
We've all got to
be there apparently.

702
01:04:38,743 --> 01:04:39,709
Oh.

703
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,713
Will you be my date?

704
01:04:43,748 --> 01:04:45,715
Sharon

705
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,220
It's my lunch break.
Can you relieve me?

706
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,233
So, will you
be my date?

707
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,235
Yeah.

708
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,738
Great.

709
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,207
Shelf stacker to
aisle ten, please.

710
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,210
Can we have a shelf stacker
to aisle ten?

711
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,749
Steven, if you're in the shop,
can you report to aisle ten?

712
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,254
- It's your lunch break.
- No, it's not.

713
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,758
- It is. It's your lunch break.
- I don't want one.

714
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,264
Hama-vama!

715
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,277
Come.

716
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,787
You wanted to see us?

717
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,789
Take a chair.

718
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,299
Not there! Here!

719
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,778
Now, we were a bit unlucky
last night, chaps.

720
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,316
But to lighten the mood
and to celebrate my birthday

721
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:30,820
I'm throwing a party at
my house on Saturday night,

722
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:32,822
And you're all invited!

723
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,326
Good!

724
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,831
Now, no birthday party would be
complete without a surprise stripper.

725
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,334
And I want one of you
to organize it. Ben.

726
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,336
Me?

727
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,839
Yes. Here's 200 quid

728
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:54,093
That should be plenty for some
top-shelf entertainment.

729
01:06:54,128 --> 01:06:57,847
I'll put the details on the
staff board this afternoon.

730
01:06:57,882 --> 01:07:00,349
Well, get going then.

731
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,605
So, where are you
gonna find a stripper?

732
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,324
I don't know.
But I know a man who will.

733
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:15,364
So, your boss has given you 200 quid to get
a surprise stripper for his own birthday.

734
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,617
I like him! Yeah, I'll
help on one condition.

735
01:07:18,652 --> 01:07:21,335
- What's that?
- I can come to the party.

736
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,373
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Cool. Right, let's find you a stripper, eh?

737
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,888
? You know it, you love it
you want it, you got it?

738
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:42,857
? You know it, you love it
you got it?

739
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,395
Motherfuckers wanna get
with me lay with me, love with me?

740
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,401
Two halves, please.

741
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,406
? All right?

742
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,412
What was the other one?

743
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:04,931
Two halves.

744
01:08:04,966 --> 01:08:06,415
Oh, yeah.

745
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,418
I just found the world's
stupidest barman.

746
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,923
- Sean, I'm not sure about thi
- No, it's gonna be fine.

747
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:16,926
? Come on, let's set it off
come on, let's set it off

748
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:19,894
That's
three quid, mate.

749
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,933
? Come on, let's set it off
come on, let's set it off

750
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,401

751
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,940

come on, let's set it off

752
01:08:30,975 --> 01:08:34,909
? Come on, let's set it off

753
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,697
? Come on, let's set it off
come on, let's set it off?

754
01:08:38,732 --> 01:08:42,451
? Come on, let's set it off
come on, let's set it off

755
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:45,920

01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,959
? Motherfuckers wanna get with

757
01:08:49,994 --> 01:08:52,962

? Come on, let's set it off
come on, let's set it off

759
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,469
Yeah!

760
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,473
- How much?
- A quid.

761
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,978
Each.

762
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,487
I was, uh, wondering
if you could help us.

763
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,959
Um, it's his boss's
birthday on Saturday,

764
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,498
And we were looking for someone who
could come and do a surprise, uh, strip.

765
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,966
I'm busy on Saturday.

766
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:37,006
Oh, um, well, do you know anyone
else who might be available?

767
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:41,010
I know one. But she's very expensive.

768
01:09:41,045 --> 01:09:43,978
That's cool.
Is she here?

769
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,481
No. She only does
private venues.

770
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,019
She's gorgeous.
Top of the line, you see.

771
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,023
Hiya, Ben.

772
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,537
Will you be my date?

773
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,810
- Ben!
- Huh?

774
01:10:31,845 --> 01:10:34,028
- 200.
- What?

775
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,565
200 for the stripper.

776
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,067
Oh

777
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,569
Don't worry, love,
she's class.

778
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,038
- Okay.
- Great.

779
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,075
Two tickets
to Pittsburgh!

780
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,549
It was now my fourth
straight week without sleep.

781
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,088
I had slowly stopped thinking about Suzy
and had dragged myself into the present.

782
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,094
The extra eight hours of my life had
done nothing to slow the effect of time.

783
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:08,615
The minutes flew into hours,
the hours into days.

784
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,101
And the days joined
the fast rushing river of time.

785
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,570
The bad news
is that time flies.

786
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:20,074
The good news
is that you're the pilot.

787
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,612
Most of my shifts were now spent
thinking about Sharon.

788
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,622
I drew her endlessly.
Over and over.

789
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:39,628
Her pale, milky skin.
Her delicate frame.

790
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,135
In her eyes,
I could see the world.

791
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:52,641
I thought about Sharon escaping the
life-sapping neons of the supermarket...

792
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,645
Traveling to South America,

793
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,113
Pursuing her dreams.

794
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,151
I thought about her
asking me to go with her.

795
01:12:02,186 --> 01:12:04,653
Both sharing in our dreams.

796
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,657
Her love of people,
and my love of painting them.

797
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,645
- You off home?
- Yeah.

798
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,184
You still wanna be my date for
the party tomorrow night then?

799
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,151
Yeah, of course.

800
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,188
Will you come by
and pick me up?

801
01:12:39,223 --> 01:12:41,207
Yeah.

802
01:12:41,242 --> 01:12:43,157
8:00?

803
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,195
- Yeah, 8:00.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

804
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:01,175
Sharon had broken the spell.

805
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,677
For the first time
in weeks, I slept.

806
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,215
I slept right through
to the following afternoon.

807
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,185
Mmm. Yeah?

808
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,723
There's a call for you, Ben.

809
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,231
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Ben Willis?

810
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:23,732
Yeah.

811
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,735
My name is Alex Prout,
from the Prout gallery.

812
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,739
I saw some examples of your
work at the university yesterday.

813
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,208
Y- You did?

814
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,747
Yes. And I'd be very interested in
putting on a show of your latest works.

815
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:43,717
Hello?

816
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,720
Um, ah, yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

817
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,758
Great. Why don't you bring som
more examples of your work

818
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:53,262
Down to my gallery
next monday? Say 10:00?

819
01:13:53,297 --> 01:13:55,764
Okay. Thank you.

820
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,232
No. Thank you, Ben

821
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,770
Bugger off. You're the talent.

822
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,279
Better get ready
for the party.

823
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,291
? Jerk it, jerk it

824
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:30,299

[doorbell]

857
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,901
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Ben.

858
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,904
Hi, Ben, I'll be right down.

859
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,917
Hiya.

860
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,920
You look lovely.

861
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,922
Thanks. You too.

862
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:38,927
Are you okay?

863
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,931
I had some great news today.

864
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,398
What?

865
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,935
There's a gallery interested
in showing my work.

866
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,902
Ben, that's fantastic!

867
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:53,442
Look at you.
You're beaming inside out.

868
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,946
Wow. You're on your way.

869
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,951
Well, come on.
Let's go and celebrate.

870
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,487
We can leave
if you want.

871
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,989
Welcome!

872
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,992
Hello, mate.

873
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,461
Oy.

874
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,498
- Ben, this is, ah...
- Katrine.

875
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:51,465
- Katrink.
- Katrine!

876
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,503
Katrine. Ben. This is Sharon. Sean.

877
01:17:54,538 --> 01:17:56,505
I've heard a lot
about you.

878
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,507
- Nice to meet you.
- Very sweet.

879
01:17:58,542 --> 01:18:00,008
Hi.

880
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,511
Oh, no.

881
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:04,978
Hi, Ben.

882
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,480
- Hi.
- How are you?

883
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,519
- Uh, good, good. And you?
- Thanks.

884
01:18:10,554 --> 01:18:11,985
Suzy, this is Sharon.

885
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,988
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

886
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,527
- What are you doing here?
- It's Steve's brother's birthday.

887
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:19,993
What, Jenkins?

888
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,532
Yeah. He's Steve's older
brother. Do you know him?

889
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:25,499
Yeah. He's our boss.

890
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,036
- You're working at Sainsbury'
- Yeah, I work the night shift.

891
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,038
That's great.

892
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,007
Well, I'd better get back.

893
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,544
- It was good to see you.
- You too.

894
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,547
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

895
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,018
You all right?

896
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,556
No, that's disgusting.
No, sorry.

897
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,391
Isn't it great, your brother's face!

898
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:16,144
Come on, Jenkins,
you rotten git!

899
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:19,147
Kon-a-nichi-wa!

900
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:20,416
Yeah!

901
01:20:20,451 --> 01:20:21,650
Oh, no!

902
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,687
- Natalie!
- Sean?

903
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:01,154
Who's Natalie?

904
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,156
It's a long story.

905
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,194
Well, your act's grown leaps
and bounds since the garage.

906
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,697
- God, how long ago was that?
- Uh...

907
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,204
Will you, ah...
will you stay for a drink?

908
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,206
Yeah, I'd love to.

909
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,718
Is this the queue
for the loo?

910
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,193
Sharon!

911
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,230
Thanks.
Happy birthday

912
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:44,232
Thanks.

913
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,239
So, you wanna
come up to my bedroom?

914
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:53,742
Eat some popcorn?
Shag?

915
01:21:53,777 --> 01:21:55,243
No.

916
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,246
Why? What's the matter?
Don't you like popcorn?

917
01:21:58,281 --> 01:21:59,748
Barry's gonna do a stunt

918
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,752
Barry's gonna do a stunt ! Barry's
gonna do a stunt ! Everyone!

919
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:05,253
No, but seriously
though, Sharon.

920
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,756
I always thought that one day
you and me might...

921
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:09,758
Are you wearing
eyeliner?

922
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,770
Hey, Ben.

923
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,272
Hey.

924
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,778
We really made a mess
of things, didn't we

925
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:32,245
Wasn't that bad.

926
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,284
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry about everything.

927
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:40,055
I know I never really gave you
a chance to make me happy.

928
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:43,792
You can't rely on other people
to make you happy, Suzy.

929
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:45,293
I know!

930
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,302
Is that you?

931
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,808
Yeah. Jungle survival
course, Mexico.

932
01:22:59,843 --> 01:23:01,309
But enough about me.

933
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,812
You.

934
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,314
You!

935
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,783
You look

936
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,320
Gorgeous tonight, Sharon.

937
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,837
I still think about you
all the time, Ben.

938
01:23:28,872 --> 01:23:30,839
Why are you
telling me this?

939
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,307
Have you seen Ben?

940
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,095
Five! Four!

941
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:39,740
Three! Two!

942
01:23:39,775 --> 01:23:42,350
One! Go!

943
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,853
No.

944
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:59,367
? Aye, aye, aye, aye?

945
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,337
? Feels like fire?

946
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,375
? I'm so in love with you

947
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,346
? Dreams are like angels

948
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:17,385
? They keep bad at bay
bad at bay?

949
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:22,390
You can speed it up,
you can slow it down.

950
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:24,660
You can even
freeze a moment.

951
01:24:24,695 --> 01:24:26,796
But you can't
be rewind time.

952
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:28,897
You can't undo
what is done.

953
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,368
I thought about
what she'd seen.

954
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,655
I thought about
what she hadn't seen.

955
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,873
I thought about
how I could explain.

956
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,910
But the more I thought
about it, the more I knew

957
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,413
Nothing I could say
would make her anger go away.

958
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:47,916
How long could
I just wait there

959
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:49,918
Delaying
the inevitable?

960
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,423
I had sat there with the world
on pause for two days

961
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,926
And still
no solution had come.

962
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,928
I thought about the night
at the sports center

963
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:03,431
When I'd seen a person move
when time was frozen.

964
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,435
If other people could move
within the frozen world,

965
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,938
Then maybe it was something
I could bring Sharon in on.

966
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:12,941
It was the best
i could come up with.

967
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,959
Sharon?

968
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,926
I'm definitely winded.

969
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,464
I had forgotten how fast
everything was moving.

970
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,439
Hello?

971
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:47,976
Sharon, it's me

972
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,480
Hello?

973
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,524
This felt familiar.

974
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:44,497
I tried to explain
that Suzy was an ex.

975
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:48,001
And she had attacked me
when my guard was down.

976
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:51,039
Sharon had seen the wrong second
of a two-second story.

977
01:26:51,074 --> 01:26:53,541
But she wasn't listening.

978
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:03,111
Member of cleaning staff
to aisle three, please.

979
01:28:03,146 --> 01:28:05,613
Cleaning staff
to aisle three quickly.

980
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:45,153
- What language is that?
- Russian.

981
01:28:45,188 --> 01:28:47,923
- Do you speak Russian?
- No.

982
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,658
Can I get it back
on to English?

983
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,127
Yep? Can I help you?

984
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,663
I've got an appointment
with Alex Prout.

985
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:57,933
Yeah, that's me.

986
01:28:57,968 --> 01:29:00,168
Hi. Ben Willis.

987
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,638
You called me
about my work.

988
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:09,177
There must be some mistake
. I've never heard of you.

989
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,181
You didn't call me?

990
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,692
Bastards.

991
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:30,698
Ah, sorry.
Someone's played a joke on me.

992
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,703
Well, since you're here,
let me take a look.

993
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,718
- These are yours?
- Yeah.

994
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,192
You got any more?

995
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,479
Yeah, I've got hundreds.

996
01:30:01,514 --> 01:30:03,731
Can you bring them by?

997
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:04,732
Sure.

998
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,204
Why don't you make
an appointment with Lucy?

999
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,742
Proper one this time.
And we'll take it from there.

1000
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,244
Yeah.

1001
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,712
Ben.

1002
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:22,750
Ben.
All right, Ben

1003
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,810
Well done.
Wonderful show

1004
01:31:22,845 --> 01:31:24,277
Thanks.

1005
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:28,316
- I'm Anna. Anna Shapiro.
- Ben Willis. Nice to meet you

1006
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:30,318
I've got a gallery
in New York.

1007
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:33,321
I'd be interested to talk
to you about your next show.

1008
01:31:33,356 --> 01:31:34,787
My next show?

1009
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,325
Yes. Any ideas of what
you might like to do

1010
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,826
Um...

1011
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:46,834
I'd like to go and paint
in South America.

1012
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,338
Well, that sounds wonderfully romantic.

1013
01:31:50,373 --> 01:31:53,841
Here. Take my card.

1014
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,344
Call me.

1015
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,346
Well done.

1016
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,400
Hey.

1017
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:54,902
Hey.

1018
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,905
Congratulations.
This is...

1019
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,908
So great.

1020
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:02,875
Thanks.

1021
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,663
- How have you been?
- Good.

1022
01:33:05,698 --> 01:33:08,381
I haven't seen
you at work.

1023
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,918
No, I've got a job
at a travel agent's.

1024
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,922
So you're one step
closer to your dream.

1025
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:23,896
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened at the party

1026
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:27,400
Whether you saw the second
after or not, it doesn't matter.

1027
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,438
I've learned it's what you do
with every single second that counts.

1028
01:33:30,473 --> 01:33:31,939
Shh. It's okay.

1029
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,445
This tells me so much more
than you could ever say.

1030
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,955
It's snowing outside.

1031
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,964
Do you trust me?

1032
01:33:56,999 --> 01:33:58,466
Why?

1033
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,469
I need to know

1034
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,456
What happened?

1035
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,993
I need to show
you something.

1036
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:56,023
Once upon a time,
i wanted to know what love was.

1037
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:58,991
Love is there
if you want it to be.

1038
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,779
You just have to see
that it's wrapped in beauty

1039
01:35:01,814 --> 01:35:04,532
And hidden away between
the seconds of your life.

1040
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,538
If you don't stop
for a minute,

1041
01:35:10,573 --> 01:35:12,039
You might miss it.

1042
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:48,240
? Weightless
in her empty house?

1043
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:53,881
? Nothing's like she said
it would be?

1044
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:02,690
? The snow fell
and she walked out?

1045
01:36:02,725 --> 01:36:05,493
? Through the streets?

1046
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,895
? Outside of me?

1047
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,903
? Now she?

1048
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:23,110
? She's got
a very twisted mind?

1049
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:31,519
? Now she?

1050
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:38,325
? She's calling me away

1051
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:16,495
? Push and pull 'cause there's no time

1052
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:21,752
? To make amends
for all that's been said

1053
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:31,393
? Remember now
the words she said?

1054
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:36,600
? It doesn't seem to put it a
in its right place?

1055
01:37:41,872 --> 01:37:43,974
? Now she?

1056
01:37:47,578 --> 01:37:51,448
? She's got
a very twisted mind?

1057
01:37:56,654 --> 01:37:59,039
? Now she?

1058
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:05,010
[men shouting]

1059
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:08,549
Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry

1060
01:38:08,584 --> 01:38:11,051
Barry! Ooh! Oh
