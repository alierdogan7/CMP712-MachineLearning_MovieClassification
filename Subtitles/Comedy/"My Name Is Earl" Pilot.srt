1
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,790
<i>You know that guy you see
going to the convenience store</i>

2
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:14,757
<i>when you stop off on that little
town on the way to gramma's house?</i>

3
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,711
<i>Sort of shifty looking fella,</i>

4
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:22,165
<i>who buys a pack of smoke, a couple lotto
scratchers, and a tall boy at 10 in the morning.</i>

5
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>The kind of guy you wait to come
out before you and your family go in.</i>

6
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:33,665
<i>Well... That guy is me.</i>

7
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,238
<i>My Name is Earl.</i>

8
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,323
<i>And if you took the time to really get to know me</i>

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,293
<i>find out what kind of person I truely am instead</i>

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,028
<i>of just stereotype me
because of the way I look...</i>

11
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,917
<i>Well... You'd be wasting your time.</i>

12
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:50,236
<i>'Cause I'm exactly who you think I am.</i>

13
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:55,670
<i>Hell, I'll pretty much steal
anything that it isn't nailed down.</i>

14
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,302
<i>About 6 years ago, I was out drinking,
when I met this little firecracker.</i>

15
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:10,030
You got great boobs Peggy.

16
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,352
<i>Her name was not Peggy.</i>

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,629
My name is Joy.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,781
You got great boobs Joy.

19
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,455
<i>She kept buying me drinks, and later
that night, she drove us to Vegas.</i>

20
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,175
<i>By the time I sobered up,</i>

21
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,165
<i>we were married.</i>

22
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:33,333
<i>The next morning, I was recuperating
from being a little... overserved.</i>

23
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,504
Good morning happy.

24
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,340
<i>Hell, when I was drinking I just
thought she had a bit of a belly.</i>

25
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,061
<i>Some people might think getting so drunk,</i>

26
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:46,209
<i>you accidentally marry a woman that's six months
pregrant, is a good reason to stop drinking.</i>

27
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,851
<i>Personnally, I think it's a
good reason to "keep" drinking.</i>

28
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,942
<i>Joy didn't remember much
about the boy's real father.</i>

29
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,609
<i>Except that he drove a Ford.</i>

30
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:57,713
<i>So we named him Dodge.</i>

31
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:02,173
<i>Few years later, we were having our
first child from my own personal seed.</i>

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,781
<i>Doctors already told us he
was going to come out a boy,</i>

33
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:07,265
<i>so we went ahead and named him.</i>

34
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,197
<i>There he was.</i>

35
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,364
<i>Earl Junior.</i>

36
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:23,106
<i>People ask me how I can stay with a cheap
wife, and two horrible kids I don't mind.</i>

37
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,249
<i>I guess I just believe in
the sanctity of mariage.</i>

38
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,827
<i>Besides, I'm sure just as many people
ask her why she hasn't thrown out</i>

39
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:32,961
<i>a good-for-nothing husband and his
brother who lives on their couch.</i>

40
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,709
<i>That's Randy.</i>

41
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,281
<i>The best brother anyone could ever ask for.</i>

42
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:47,043
<i>We usually spend our days hanging
out over at Earny's Crab Shack.</i>

43
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:51,891
I got you Earl. You're it. You're it!

44
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,893
<i>That's Sonny. We
play beer-can-tag.</i>

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,116
No use to running fool. I know
where you mamma parks your house.

46
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,084
<i>That's Darnel. He's always hooking us up</i>

47
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:05,651
<i>with bowls full of stuff he's not
legally allowed to put in crab cakes.</i>

48
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,216
Thanks Crab Man.

49
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,394
No problem, Earl.

50
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:12,607
Thank you, Darnel.

51
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,499
Anytime, Joy.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,381
<i>Randy and I loved the free crab meat.</i>

53
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,847
<i>And for some reason, Joy loved coming here too.</i>

54
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,602
<i>And if we were lucky, Wanda would push B7.</i>

55
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,030
No, she didn't!

56
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:31,581
Wanda, don't tell me you pushed B7.

57
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,528
<i>Anyway, that was our life.</i>

58
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:40,903
<i>It wasn't glamourous or nothing.
But it was regular enough.</i>

59
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:45,222
<i>At least, it was regular
enough until 3 weeks ago.</i>

60
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,789
Son of a bitch...

61
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,522
Son of a bitch!

62
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,850
I'm rich! 100,000 dollars!

63
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:04,496
Sucker...

64
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,741
<i>That was the happiest 10 seconds of my life.</i>

65
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,635
<i>As soon as I was conscious, Randy
went back to look for my scratcher.</i>

66
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,920
<i>But I knew he wouldn't find it.</i>

67
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:32,214
<i>I would have been more upset,
if I wasn't so doped up.</i>

68
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:35,513
Hey baby.

69
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:38,735
Hey there. Sign this next to the
sticky little yellow things, please.

70
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,327
Okidoki.

71
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,727
Earl J. Hickey.

72
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,770
Hey Crab Man.

73
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,115
Hey Earl.

74
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,400
Darnel's parents threw him out
for growing weed in his closet

75
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,197
so he's moving in.
We're thinking about getting married.

76
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,789
But we're married.

77
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,080
Not anymore we're not.

78
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:00,945
Thank you for the trailer.

79
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,870
Trust me Earl. This going to be
better for everybody involved.

80
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,057
Earl Jr. really should be with his daddy.

81
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,464
Feel better now. Okay...

82
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:14,603
<i>I've never been much of a complainer,
but lying in traction that night,</i>

83
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,580
<i>knowing that I no longer had a home,</i>

84
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,364
<i>no longer had a wife,</i>

85
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,926
<i>and no longer had a $ 100,000 lottery ticket...</i>

86
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:25,962
<i>Well I think I might have cried if I wasn't
afraid of Randy waking up and seeing me.</i>

87
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:28,253
<i>Then it happened.</i>

88
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:32,095
<i>I was just flipping the channels, and he came on.</i>

89
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,722
Forget about me. I want to know about you.

90
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:37,285
I want to know about Carson Daly.

91
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,358
Everytime I see you, you got
a beautiful woman on your arm.

92
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:43,136
You got a talk-show. You
got your own record company.

93
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,641
What's your secret?

94
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:47,374
Well, if you must know... I'm Satan.

95
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:52,085
I don't know... Seriously. I
mean... I've been very blessed.

96
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:55,318
I also believe that what goes around come around.

97
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,624
And that's how I try in live my life.

98
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,703
You do good things, and
good things happen to you.

99
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,903
You do bad things, and
they'll come back to hunt you.

100
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,079
Karma.

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,176
<i>Karma!</i>

102
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,343
<i>There it was.</i>

103
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:10,564
<i>The secret of life coming straight from
Carson Daly's lips to my morphine-laced hears.</i>

104
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,486
<i>When they finally released me from
the hospital, we checked in to a motel.</i>

105
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,745
<i>Didn't take Randy long to
make friends with the help.</i>

106
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,050
<i>It never does.</i>

107
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,471
How long's your break, Catalina?

108
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,394
The manager went to the dog-track.

109
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,328
I'm on my own schedule for the afternoon.

110
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,895
"Do good things, and good things happen to you".

111
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,949
"Do bad things, and it
will come back to hunt you".

112
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,037
That's deep, Earl.

113
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:42,650
So why don't you stop hogging them Vicodin they gave
you, and we could all chat about that for awhile.

114
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,152
I'm talking about Karma.

115
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:44,932
Who's Karma?

116
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:48,079
I don't know... Something
Carson Daly came up with.

117
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,509
He says he does good things in life,
and that's why his life is so great.

118
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,957
Got me thinking. My life sucks,

119
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,118
and I ain't ever done
anything good I can think of.

120
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,769
Who's this Carson Daly?

121
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,545
Is he some sort of spiritual leader? A holy man?

122
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,950
You've never seen TRL? You need to
start putting on some of these TV

123
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,677
when you're cleaning the toilets.

124
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:10,436
If I want a better life, I
need to be a better person.

125
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,345
What's this?

126
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,864
I made a list of everything bad I've ever done.

127
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:16,815
-Why?
-Why?!

128
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:20,903
Randy, I just won a $ 100,000 in the
lottery and was immediately hit by a car.

129
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:23,975
I almost died because something good
happened to me that I didn't deserve.

130
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:28,350
That karma stuff is going to kill me unless
I make up for everything on that list.

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,408
Number 23...

132
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,002
"Peed in the back of a cop car."

133
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,406
I'm no longer proud of that.

134
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:37,795
Number 41...

135
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:43,299
"Snatched a kid's Halloween candy when
he came to my trailer to trick-or-treat."

136
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,517
That was wrong, and I know that now.

137
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:47,416
Number 102...

138
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:52,776
"Armed and possibly killed innocent
people with second-hand smoke."

139
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,796
Now, how in the world, are you
going to fix these things Earl?

140
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,510
I don't know. Start with the easy ones.

141
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,075
Like...

142
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,327
Number 64...

143
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:02,335
"Picked on Kenny James."

144
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,571
I used to torment the helluva out that
poor boy back in elementary school.

145
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,579
So what do you think you're
going do about it now?

146
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,973
I don't know. Find him, do something nice
for him, and then cross him off the list.

147
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:11,964
Excuse me...

148
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,686
But if my boss comes back,

149
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:17,269
and sees there's no garbage in the parking
lot he's going to get used to it like that,

150
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,927
so could you please put it back?

151
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,202
No I can't.

152
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:22,678
Number 136: "I've been a litter bug."

153
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,537
Well here... Cross that one off your stupid list.

154
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,801
I can't cross it off the list. Not until
I've picked up as much as I littered.

155
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,925
My list isn't stupid either.

156
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,034
My roadmap to a better life.

157
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:36,481
I hope that road has free gaz,

158
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,974
and free food,

159
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:40,230
and a van big enough for us to sleep,

160
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,002
'cause we just spent out
last 45 dollars on this room

161
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:46,734
and I'm not cutting-in my beer
money for some stupid-ass crusade.

162
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:55,166
Son of a bitch.

163
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,226
It's working.

164
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,228
<i>When I went over to the lottery office,</i>

165
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,866
<i>they sure did make a big fuss.</i>

166
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:09,366
<i>Randy had an idea to get an
extra 100,000 out of the deal.</i>

167
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,733
Thank you Eiseda.

168
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,389
<i>But I knew it wasn't going to work.</i>

169
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:18,071
Can I borrow a pen?

170
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,343
<i>I wanted to get started on
my list as soon as possible,</i>

171
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,159
<i>so my life would start getting better.</i>

172
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,382
<i>Hell, it was already better.</i>

173
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,718
<i>Our new friend Catalina had
the day off and nothing to do,</i>

174
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,067
<i>so Randy and I had something pretty to look at.</i>

175
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:36,219
<i>Plus I finally had enough money to buy
something I always wanted for my car.</i>

176
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,103
Which house belongs to this boy you torturred?

177
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,812
That's his parents house, right over there.

178
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,725
We don't know where Kenny lives
now, though. But Randy will find out.

179
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:46,926
-Wow, wow... That's four!
-I'm still thirsty.

180
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:49,973
Look. You had four. You can have
another one when you come out.

181
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:50,489
Go on now.

182
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,674
So why aren't going in?

183
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:55,383
I get nervous when I lie.

184
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:56,937
Randy is a pro.

185
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,549
So long as he's got the
right number of beers in him.

186
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,608
Four seems to be the magic number.

187
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,982
Any more, and he starts to get a little bit...

188
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,265
unpredictable.

189
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,542
3 months earlier.

190
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,639
Earl, your brother shaved the damn cat again!

191
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:23,203
<i>Randy hadn't been inside Kenny's parent's
house since we robbed it in high school.</i>

192
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,026
<i>All we got was a bagpack full of birds.</i>

193
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:29,866
So, are you visiting all of
Kenny's classmate's parents?

194
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,346
Only the ones we've lost contact with.

195
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,528
You see, as class president, it's
my duty to organize a reunion.

196
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,515
I'll hate for anyone to miss
out on all the fun. You know...

197
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:43,463
With all that catching-up, and
them little appetizers and all...

198
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,441
Isn't that sweet?

199
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,454
Can I get you a beer, son?

200
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:52,655
I would love a beer.

201
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:53,808
Thank you.

202
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,058
Wow, what are you doing?

203
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,831
You don't like me?

204
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,617
No, no, you're nice. It's just...

205
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,030
Randy, when you... you came in to give us towels,

206
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,504
he called dibs.

207
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,406
Dibs.

208
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:33,813
<i>In case you're wondering how many beers it
takes for Randy to get himself into trouble,</i>

209
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:36,351
<i>nine seems to be the magic number.</i>

210
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,711
<i>Luckily he got Kenny's address
before he pissed off Mr. James.</i>

211
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:45,093
I think I have Kenny's
yearbook in here, somewhere.

212
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:51,311
Dibs.

213
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:56,920
<i>At first, we had a little
trouble finding Kenny's house.</i>

214
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,227
<i>You see, Randy wrote the address on his hand, and
sweat it off the last digits during his getaway.</i>

215
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,566
<i>But eventually we found it.</i>

216
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:06,417
There he is.

217
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:08,501
Kenny James.

218
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,329
Man, I got a weird feeling in my stomach.

219
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,749
Maybe you got stomach cancer.

220
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,441
Can karma cause stomach cancer?

221
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:17,948
I don't know.

222
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,259
It's probably just guilt.

223
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,535
<i>She was probably right.</i>

224
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:25,074
<i>I wasn't proud of the way I treated Kenny.</i>

225
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:31,127
Hey Kenny! I bet you strike out again, you dork!

226
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,217
That's enough Earl.

227
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,186
Just ignore him Kenny and try your best.

228
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,515
You're out!

229
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,440
<i>I watched Kenny for a few days,</i>

230
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,052
<i>and tried to figure out how to make
up for all the abuse I put him through.</i>

231
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:05,308
<i>Kenny had a good job as an
assistant manager at the Copy Hut.</i>

232
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,560
<i>A powder-blue LaCar he took pride in.</i>

233
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,470
<i>And the nicest house on the block.</i>

234
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,859
<i>But he didn't have anyone to share it with.</i>

235
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:20,244
<i>He was lonely.</i>

236
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:25,085
<i>There was something special missing in his
life that every man needs to feel whole.</i>

237
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,062
I got to get him laid.

238
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:28,827
What?

239
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,556
Kenny! I made feel bad his whole childhood.

240
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:34,379
If I want to cross him off my
list, I got to make him feel good.

241
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,569
A little pleasure to make up for all that pain.

242
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,007
What kind of woman are you going to get to
have sex with a scrawny little man like that?

243
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,204
Yeah... You need muscle to get laid.

244
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,236
Not with Patty, you don't.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,154
<i>Patty wasn't your
run-of-the-mill prostitute.</i>

246
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,003
<i>She was a daytime hooker.</i>

247
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:57,294
<i>It takes a special kind of woman to
sell sexual favors in the light of day.</i>

248
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:01,337
<i>And I was right. Patty doesn't
care if a man has muscles.</i>

249
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:03,739
<i>Muscles can't buy mad dog.</i>

250
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,241
-Hey Patty.
-Hey boys.

251
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,980
Is this Randy's birthday already?

252
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,581
No we got another job for you.

253
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:14,056
Hello?

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,517
Hey sweety, I'm from Greenpeace.

255
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,894
I need to talk to you about the
sky, the whales and all that crap.

256
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:21,437
You got anything to drink in here?

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,976
Do you have a toothbrush I can borrow?

258
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:26,345
Mam...

259
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,239
Oh look who's coming...

260
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,819
You're it!

261
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,998
Hey Earl.

262
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:45,689
Nice one.

263
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,859
Hey, you guys looking to rob one of these houses?

264
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,635
'Cause there is an unlocked
one right down the street.

265
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:52,984
No thanks.

266
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,869
Alright, look, if it's about the last time,
I promise... I'm not gonna mess up again.

267
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,630
Where did Sonny go?

268
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,336
Sorry Sonny, but I'm out of
the house-robbing business.

269
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,305
And into the pimping business.

270
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:20,453
I could help out with that too.

271
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:24,774
I got an uncle, real lonely guy, but he
gets the disability check every Thursday...

272
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,444
Look Sonny, we'll talk about it later.

273
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,358
Alright.

274
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:29,712
How did it go?

275
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,032
He gave me 10 dollars to help baby monkeys.

276
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,221
How was the sex?

277
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:36,322
You got anything in the tank, left-over for me?

278
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:37,495
We didn't do it.

279
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,074
What? Patty, we had a deal.

280
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:39,976
I did what you said.

281
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:43,672
I told him I thought he was cute, and I
tried to kiss him, but he wasn't interested.

282
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:46,826
Damn it, Patty! I'm on a
schedule, here. Come on Randy.

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,505
I tried Earl! I did.

284
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,945
God's heaven, I even pulled out my good boob.

285
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:56,891
You think he's going to remember you?

286
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:01,978
Yeah, I think he remembers me.

287
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:07,893
Kenny, calm down.

288
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,278
I have a restraining order
against you, Earl Hickey.

289
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,998
Yeah, but that was written on a brown paper
bag, by the school nurse, 20 years ago.

290
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,145
Besides, I made you eat it, remember?

291
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:20,191
Yeah... Well... Just take
what you want, and leave.

292
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,309
All I want to do is talk.

293
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,765
Hold on a sec. If you're
giving stuff away, I take this.

294
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,593
Put it down.

295
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,582
It's got a CD player in it.

296
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,639
Put it down!

297
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:30,980
Listen Kenny...

298
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,359
I'm here to help ya.

299
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:34,781
I don't need your help.

300
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,977
Buddy, you just gave up a chance to
have free sex with a day-time hooker.

301
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:39,957
You need my help.

302
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:40,782
Earl...

303
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,043
Not now Randy!

304
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,080
Shut that drawer.

305
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:45,859
Kenny, I'm here to help you find a woman...

306
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,500
so that you can be happy.

307
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:48,547
Earl...

308
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:52,140
I think you're trying to sell
a cat to a man who fancies dogs.

309
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,971
<i>I know this might sound crazy in this day and age</i>

310
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,507
<i>but we live in a small town,</i>

311
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,792
<i>and I never been face to face with a gay before.</i>

312
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:18,064
<i>I understand now the running
probably wasn't necessary.</i>

313
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,821
-That's it! Kenny's off the list.
-Good.

314
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,141
Isn't that against the rules?

315
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,875
Look, I made the list.
That means I make the rules.

316
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,512
The guy was gay... Gay.

317
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,733
That's special circumstances.

318
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:33,260
I don't have to help if there
are special circumstances.

319
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,023
Here you go. Get us a couple of
cheeseburgers from the machine.

320
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,902
Okay... So what's next?

321
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:43,011
Number 86: "Stole a car from a one-legged girl."

322
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:48,372
What happened here?

323
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,511
Damn girl! Have you lost your mind?

324
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,294
-Who's the whore?
-What did you just call me?

325
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:56,045
She's the maid. Relax.

326
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,659
Did you think I wasn't going to find out?

327
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,024
Damn, look at that. My eyes are closed!

328
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,568
I want half that lotto money, Earl.

329
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:09,123
Yeah? Well I want a legitimate baby and a
wife who didn't have pained on Thanksgiving.

330
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:11,908
But I guess life is full of little
disappointements, now ain't it?

331
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,842
They only had one "Mel-O" left.
You want the rest of ford?

332
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,245
That's it. Give me the damn phone!

333
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,461
I'm going to get me that money, Earl! I want it!

334
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,092
That's your ex-wife?

335
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:36,231
Yep... Crazy as she is, I'd be lying
if I say I wasn't going to miss her.

336
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,017
Hey Earl.

337
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,424
Hey Crab Man.

338
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,261
What happened?

339
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:50,624
Karma...

340
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,397
Karma happened.

341
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,225
<i>And I believed it too.</i>

342
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,926
<i>Think about it. Soon I decided not to help Kenny,</i>

343
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:03,755
<i>Joy broke into my room,
and beat me up with a phone.</i>

344
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:07,213
<i>That's when I realized I
have to stick to the plan.</i>

345
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,455
<i>There are no special circumstances.</i>

346
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,228
<i>I may have made the list...</i>

347
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:13,251
<i>but I do not make the rules.</i>

348
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,973
<i>Karma makes the rules.</i>

349
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,158
<i>The one-legged girl would have to wait.</i>

350
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,111
<i>Kenny had to be first.</i>

351
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,635
Stay away. I bought mace.

352
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,268
I just want to talk, Kenny. Relax.

353
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:32,868
Kenny...

354
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,798
Hey, Kenny.

355
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,647
How is it feeling now?

356
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:39,902
Better.

357
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,223
Thanks for pinning me down on the ground,
prying my eyes open with your fingers,

358
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,476
and pouring the milk can.
I think that helped a lot.

359
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:49,889
Yeah, well... You steal enough purses
you learn a few things about mace.

360
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,282
Wh...

361
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,433
Oh... Wow... That's...

362
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,168
Why don't you have a man, Kenny?

363
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:08,538
What?

364
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,550
If you like...

365
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:12,688
...men,

366
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,658
why don't you have a man?

367
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,615
That's none of your business.

368
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,754
No it's not. I know that.

369
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,556
And trust me, I don't really want to know.

370
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:23,485
It's just that... You seem lonely,

371
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:26,863
and I've got to figure out how I am going
to help you, so I can cross you off my list.

372
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:29,783
What list?

373
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,373
You're number 64.

374
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,715
And don't let that fool ya, I'm doing you first.

375
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,752
You see... Kenny...

376
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,783
My life sucks.

377
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:43,879
And that's because I've been a bad person.

378
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,969
I'm hoping if I can do some good things, then...

379
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,260
maybe some good things
might finally happen to me.

380
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,833
You're talking about karma.

381
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,609
You're a Carson Daly fan too, huh!

382
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,855
Yeah, I'm talking about karma.

383
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,852
You're really trying to change?

384
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:04,099
If I don't, I think life's going to kill me.

385
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,742
I don't have a man because...

386
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,761
nobody knows I'm gay.

387
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,261
You know what this town is like, Earl.

388
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,602
Besides, even if people knew,
where am I going to meet anyone?

389
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:16,872
What about the city?

390
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,742
Don't they have special bars for the queers?

391
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:20,973
I'm sorry...

392
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,318
Huh... Homosexual...

393
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,395
Americans?

394
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,098
I tried that once.

395
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:30,407
I drove an hour and a half just to sit
outfront of my car, too scared to go in.

396
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:42,243
-You need to move your car.
-Oh I'm straight!

397
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,560
-You can't park here.
-Okay.

398
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:45,895
I'm... I'm straight.

399
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:51,616
What if I went with you?

400
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:54,677
What?

401
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:57,197
Maybe you won't be scared, if you're not alone.

402
00:21:57,492 --> 00:22:00,519
Earl Hickey is going to take me...

403
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,984
to a gay bar?

404
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,420
I don't have a choice, Kenny.

405
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,998
<i>I didn't want to be the
only non-gay there, so...</i>

406
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:17,769
<i>Luckily Randy agreed to go as soon as
he heard they were going to be bubbles.</i>

407
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:21,540
You like that one?

408
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,841
I don't... I don't know. He's cute I guess.

409
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:27,174
Alright, I'll go talk to him.

410
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,584
Wait, you want to be the man or the woman?

411
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:33,409
Wait, wai... You're just gonna
go over there and talk to him?

412
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:35,739
Yeah, he's gay but it ain't going to bite me.

413
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:37,633
He ain't going to bite, is he?

414
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,207
Maybe I should do this myself.

415
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:41,693
Kenny, I can't do let you that.

416
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:44,165
I've got to be the one to help ya
if I want to cross you off my list.

417
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:45,606
Wait, wait.

418
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,060
You have helped me.

419
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,044
Look, my whole life,

420
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,422
I've been scared to be who I really
am, because of what people might think.

421
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,083
But then Earl Hickey brought me to a gay bar.

422
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,881
Earl Hickey went to "Express
for Men", and bought me a shirt.

423
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,340
Earl Hickey, the one man I was the
most scared of in my whole life,

424
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,443
has accepted me as I am.

425
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:09,781
Look...

426
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,758
When we were kids, you took
away my confidence, but...

427
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:14,895
today you give it back.

428
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:17,280
Thanks Earl.

429
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:23,514
You can cross me off your list.

430
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,369
<i>There you have it:</i>

431
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,162
<i>"Never underestimate the power of confidence."</i>

432
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,870
It's midnight boys.

433
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,371
That means it's time to take you old school.

434
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:45,543
Oh no, you didn't. Tell me
he didn't just go old school.

435
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>And never underestimate 15 beers,</i>

436
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,037
<i>a little enlightenment,</i>

437
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,769
<i>and the power of "Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock"</i>

438
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:09,549
<i>Well, one down, 258 to go.</i>
