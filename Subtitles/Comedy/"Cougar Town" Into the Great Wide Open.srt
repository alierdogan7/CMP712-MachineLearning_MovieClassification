1
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:04,916
"Into the Great Wide Open"

2
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,176
(whispers)
All clear.

3
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,197
Thank you for coming over
and for parking a block away

4
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:18,725
and for leaving at 5:00
in the morning.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,232
Well, what can I say?
You're worth it.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,203
I just really want my business
to stay my business, you know?

7
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,806
I'm not some
crazy psycho chick

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,137
- who can--
- (dog barking)

9
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:26,705
Go, go, go,
go, go, go!

10
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,171
Hug the shadows!
Hug the shadows!

11
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,222
- Monster!
- Aah!

12
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,513
- (laughs)
- I am so getting you back.

13
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:36,530
Don't.
I hate being scared.

14
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:37,771
Oh.

15
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:40,886
Why are you even up?

16
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,363
Because my stupid baby
woke me up.

17
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:46,725
Better question is why are you
wearing full makeup?

18
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:49,022
I'm not ready for Josh
to see my morning face.

19
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,263
So I set 2 alarms--
One at 4:00 and one at 5:00.

20
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,758
I get up and do my hair
and makeup.

21
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:55,922
I go back to bed, fake asleep
until the next alarm goes off,

22
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,141
and then he thinks I wake up
looking like this.

23
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,413
- Crafty.
- I think so.

24
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:01,639
Is the sex worth it?

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,896
I'll have
to let you know.

26
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:05,926
I decided after that last guy
to reinstate my 10-date rule.

27
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,884
Oh.

28
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,375
But I should not have
let Josh sleep over.

29
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,773
The whole night
I spent playing defense.

30
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,499
(makes whooshing noises)

31
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:14,594
- Nice.
- (front door closes)

32
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,704
<i>Buenos días, chiquitas.</i>

33
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:19,294
What are you doing here?
Do you not get how divorce works?

34
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,321
I gotta give
a golf lesson at 6:30,

35
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,648
so I'm just gonna steal
a cup of coffee.

36
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,138
Well, then okay.

37
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:26,173
- (Travis yawns)
- Oh, morning, honey.

38
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,402
I need to study
for my advanced calculus test.

39
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,810
Hey, buddy,
you want some help?

40
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:33,315
(all laugh)

41
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,969
Yeah, you're right.
Who am I kidding?

42
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,412
(door closes)

43
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:39,266
Can you take Stan
so I can get ready for work?

44
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:40,491
I'd bring him in the shower
with me,

45
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,179
but he always
pees on my feet.

46
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,007
- Hey, Bobby!
- Hey!

47
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,516
- Much love. Much love. Mm!
- Mm!

48
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,411
That's a long hug there,
big guy.

49
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,629
- (snores)
- Travis!

50
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:52,076
I'm up!

51
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:54,190
What's the deal with
the golf cart outside?

52
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,645
Mm, my car died,
so I kind of borrowed that

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,753
from the golf course
as, you know, a substitute ride.

54
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,670
- It's a hybrid.
- Genius.

55
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:01,764
Just 'cause
it has a plug,

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,571
doesn't make it
a hybrid.

57
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,557
It hauls ass.
You want a ride to work?

58
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,899
Uh, definitely.

59
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,380
Oh, that's not happening.

60
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:08,811
- (snores)
- Travis!

61
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:09,633
Thank you.

62
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:10,985
I can't believe
I am up at 5:00 A.M.

63
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,977
'cause this idiot
dropped his binky.

64
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:17,748
Before I had my baby, the only
time I was ever awake this early

65
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:20,236
was in my 20s, and I was still
up from the night before.

66
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,640
I remember this crazy night
that started out in New York

67
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:24,926
and ended up in Miami...

68
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,030
There I am.
I'm 23 years old.

69
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm eating a 5-pound Belgian
waffle at 4:00 in the morning,

70
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:34,495
and I realize the Croatian chick
has got a gun.

71
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,332
...Until it ended,
'cause up until that point,

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,202
I had partied...
(inhales sharply)

73
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:39,712
And I am talking
legitimately partied--

74
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,406
for 45 nights in a row, baby!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

75
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:48,344
What?

76
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:49,797
It's your turn.

77
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,948
Best war story
from your 20s.

78
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:54,944
Um, okay, uh,
once when I was 22,

79
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,356
I had a baby,
and I stayed home by myself,

80
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,503
raising him,
for the rest of my 20s.

81
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:01,758
(chuckles)
The end.

82
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,593
Boo!

83
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,704
You know, I don't want to play
this game anymore, okay?

84
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:07,470
Let's go. Out of the kitchen.
Come on.

85
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,141
Can I just grab
a cup of coffee?

86
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:11,803
No. I can't deal.
He drinks every sip

87
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:13,927
like it's the most delicious
thing on the planet.

88
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,099
Do you know
how annoying that is?

89
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,642
Oh, sweetie,
I want to pretend to care,

90
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,008
but I just don't think
I can get there.

91
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:18,899
I feel ya.

92
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,279
Yi yi yi yi yi yi!

93
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:24,833
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

94
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,911
I'm just trying
to be a good mom.

95
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,087
(dog barking in distance)

96
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:32,822
Good morning, Grayson.

97
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,981
Hey.

98
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,660
- I've been up for hours.
- I had eggs for breakfast.

99
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,952
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,630
I thought we were sharing

101
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,961
incredibly boring facts
about ourselves.

102
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,933
When you act like you
don't want to talk to me,

103
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,958
it just makes me
want to talk to you even more.

104
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:49,272
That may be the world's most
annoying personality trait.

105
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,276
Right? Do you ever get
that overwhelming feeling

106
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,912
that you just missed out
on everything?

107
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,479
I don't have
overwhelming feelings.

108
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:59,383
Would you, come on?
We--we are both recently divorced,

109
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,030
and we're going through
this stuff.

110
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,095
You know what?
This should be our thing.

111
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,885
We talk when we get our papers.
We can be paper buddies.

112
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:08,331
No, thank you.

113
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:10,760
Now I just want it
even more!

114
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,314
Blah, blah, blah.

115
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,972
ANDY: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-
hoo-hoo! (laughs)

116
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,735
Ahh! Don't tell Ellie.

117
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:20,303
Later, J-Bird.

118
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,108
Ohh! Holy crap,
that's good coffee.

119
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,123
(laughs) I know. Right?

120
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,022
Wait. What exactly was
upsetting you?

121
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,825
I don't know.
I was just so bummed

122
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,332
that I don't have one
good story to tell, you know?

123
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:35,902
Hold this
for a second.

124
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:43,392
Yes!

125
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:47,225
I spent so much time
on my hair this morning,

126
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,041
that felt like
cheating death.

127
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:52,219
(laughs)

128
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:54,914
I don't believe
in having regrets, Jules,

129
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:58,954
because in this great, big,
crazy thing we call life--

130
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,811
It sounds like you're
ramping up for a long one,

131
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,789
so first I have to ask--
Do you think

132
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,103
that's an appropriate outfit
for work?

133
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,233
I did until a second ago.

134
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,692
Fair enough.
Oh, whoa, whoa.

135
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:10,962
You're not gonna wear
trashy thongs.

136
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,920
I've got some emergency
work underwear in my drawer.

137
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:21,479
What I was
going to say is

138
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,871
that if you don't have
any good stories,

139
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,860
you can just start
making some now.

140
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,929
Are you changing your underwear
at my desk?

141
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:29,825
Who cares?

142
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:33,274
- I feel like I do.
- Jules, you can still have your 20s.

143
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,265
I mean,
you're halfway there.

144
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,331
You've already got the cute
boyfriend, who, for some reason,

145
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,494
you're still
not sleeping with.

146
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,604
10-date rule.
(makes whooshing noises)

147
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:42,907
I'm not sure what that means.
But the point is,

148
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,380
now all we have to do is
add in the fun stuff--

149
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,882
You know, barhopping,
road trips...

150
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,718
(gasps) Eating pancakes
at 3:00 in the morning.

151
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,754
Crap, I love pancakes.

152
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,889
Come on an adventure
with me tonight.

153
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,960
The word "adventure"
makes it sound really fun.

154
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,410
- That's why I picked it.
- All right, I'm in.

155
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,347
- Yeah! Ow!
- Ow!

156
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,598
Oh, wait. I'm seeing a movie
with Ellie tonight.

157
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,118
So because you want
to relive your youth,

158
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,405
instead of getting a barrel
of popcorn and eating it

159
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,422
while we stare
at Viggo Something-son's ass,

160
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,743
I've gotta go get drinks with you
and your stupid, slaggy, townie friend?

161
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,043
Ellie's so excited
to come.

162
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,449
- Tell her to bite me.
- Laurie's psyched, too.

163
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,115
Oh, and, Ellie, um, we are even
for this morning.

164
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,850
- What?
- Monster!

165
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,754
I just made a horrible mistake,
didn't I?

166
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,802
Yeah.

167
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,960
All right, lipstick,
eyeliner, tissue,

168
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:35,213
granola bars, aspirin.
What else?

169
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:35,997
Stamps.

170
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,053
Stamps. Right.

171
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,668
Wait.
Why are you messing with me?

172
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,038
Because it's fun.

173
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:44,081
When you get older,
you need more stuff.

174
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,874
That's why I-I brought out
old Bessie here.

175
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,605
It's a purse.
It doesn't have a name.

176
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,444
Bessie does.

177
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,514
Have fun, for once.

178
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,615
Thanks.
You have fun at Dad's.

179
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,819
Well, this shouldn't be
embarrassing at all.

180
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,091
Helps with the bugs.

181
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,886
Good God.

182
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,435
So Ellie took a shower
with her baby,

183
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,364
and, of course,
he peed all over her feet.

184
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,637
But here's the kicker.
Ellie said afterwards

185
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,334
her skin
was so soft and smooth,

186
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,409
so of course I've gotta
find myself some baby pee.

187
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,375
But it's no biggie, 'cause
Ellie's just gonna hook me up.

188
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,210
You know, people can't unhear
the things you say.

189
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,143
Come back, paper buddy.

190
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,945
All right, I'll just see you
at your mailbox in the morning.

191
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,812
Not ever.

192
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,161
Ellie. I'm back.

193
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,496
You have to re-engage.

194
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:35,823
- Oh.
- On the plus side,

195
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,393
I was able to put peanuts in
her wine without her noticing.

196
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,155
Hmm. So witty.

197
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,355
Mm. I should probably slow down.
I'm getting a little buzzy.

198
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,937
(laughs)

199
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,354
These are just
the drinks that we get

200
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,325
<i>before</i> we go out
and get drinks.

201
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,241
Oh, good.
She's here.

202
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,185
I've got a bad case
of the gotta-gos.

203
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,400
No, no. Don't leave.

204
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,023
Why don't you just come
with me?

205
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,388
No, I'm having fun.
I just want you to stay.

206
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,347
But this isn't
how I do fun anymore.

207
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:59,619
I've got much better wine
at home,

208
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,689
and I really need to take
my bra off. Enjoy your 20s.

209
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,289
(laughs) So I invited my friend
Nezzie to roll with us.

210
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,744
Oh, that's great.
I love <i>rolling</i> with people.

211
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:13,594
Yo, this is really cool.
It's like drinking with my mom.

212
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,663
But don't worry.
She looks great.

213
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,994
- How old is she?
- 62.

214
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,125
I will kill her.

215
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:23,771
(singsong voice)
Here's the shots.

216
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,007
Oh, I didn't order one.

217
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,380
- Cheers.
- (clink)

218
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,111
- Aah!
- Aah!

219
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,399
- I'll get more.
- Ooh.

220
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,619
Did you see how tiny
her purse is?

221
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,265
You can't even put
a credit card in there.

222
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,405
She probably has to fold
her money into tiny squares.

223
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,073
Oh, I was right.

224
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,524
Jules, quit stalling.
Toss it back.

225
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,159
Just one, though.

226
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:47,407
Oh, wait, wait. I want to get
a picture with my phone.

227
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:49,079
Ready?

228
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,429
(Beyoncé)
# All the single ladies #

229
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,647
# All the single ladies #

230
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,803
- # All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #

231
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,430
- # All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #

232
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,759
# All the single ladies,
now put your hands up #

233
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,618
# Up in the club,
we just broke up #

234
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,671
# I'm doing
my own little thing #

235
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,316
# You decided to dip
and now you want to trip #

236
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,384
# 'cause another brother
noticed me #

237
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,957
# I'm up on him,
he up on me #

238
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,424
# Don't pay him
any attention #

239
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,165
# Just cried my tears
for three good years #

240
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,703
# You can't be mad at me,
'cause if you liked it #

241
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,387
# then you should have
put a ring on it #

242
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,781
# If you liked it, then you
should have put a ring on it #

243
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:27,248
# Don't be mad
once you see that he want it #

244
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:27,905
# 'cause if you liked it #

245
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,616
# then you should have put
a ring on it, oh, oh, oh #

246
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:32,278
# If you liked it, then you
should have put a ring on it #

247
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,030
Jules!

248
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:40,074
Oh. Oh. Hello, gang.

249
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,847
I did not think
you were coming back

250
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,553
to see
the guest room again.

251
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,233
We're just gonna go look
around a little more.

252
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,118
You guys
take your time.

253
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,145
Party rookie.

254
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,329
How did <i>she</i> know?

255
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:54,957
(snorts)

256
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:56,501
That is upsetting.

257
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:57,703
(laughs)

258
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,451
Someone actually dared you

259
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:01,450
to make out with Barb's neck
for a second.

260
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,985
- I didn't, did I?
- No.

261
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,095
- Let me see that.
- No, no.

262
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,901
- Let me see it.
- You don't want to see it.

263
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:06,949
- Laurie!
- You don't want to see it.

264
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,925
Oh, there, it's gone.
It never happened.

265
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:10,542
- (chuckles)
- You know what's weird?

266
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:14,183
We par-tayed last night,
and I feel fine.

267
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,688
You're probably
still a little drunk,

268
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:18,376
- and you don't realize it.
- Oh, what, I'm gonna go home

269
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,702
and all of a sudden just have
some nasty hangover?

270
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,631
Oh, God.

271
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,806
Why?

272
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,350
Uh, sorry to intrude,
but I wanted to return this.

273
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:31,785
(grunts, straining)
Oh, my... Ohh.

274
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,179
Help me.

275
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,984
Nah. Gotta go.

276
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,381
Ah. Bessie.

277
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,166
Are you okay?

278
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:43,773
My head hurts, I kissed Barb,
and Grayson made fun of Bessie.

279
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,522
Oh.

280
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,828
Does Andy still eavesdrop
every time you're on the phone?

281
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,182
I assume so.
Andy?

282
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:50,291
Right here.

283
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,426
Okay, tell Andy
to go over to Grayson's,

284
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,981
and make friends with him
and then be <i>mean</i> to him.

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,578
We need you to go over
to Grayson's, make friends

286
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,773
- and then be mean to him.
- Fine.

287
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,596
- He's in. Go take a nap.
- Oh, thank you.

288
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,549
- (doorbell rings, beep)
- What?

289
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:07,792
You said I should stop by
once your son left.

290
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:10,353
- Is that what I said?
- Uh-huh.

291
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:11,961
Okay, yeah.

292
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,188
Whoa! Andy, what's up?

293
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,848
- I brought over pizza and beer.
- Why?

294
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,962
You know...
I-I'm not sure.

295
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,277
Okay, well, I have to go
open up my restaurant, so...

296
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,884
I can't go home yet.
They'll just make me come back.

297
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,329
Lock the door
when you leave.

298
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,344
Ah. What a lovely turn
of events.

299
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,084
Oh, mother,
that's good beer.

300
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,009
(hisses)

301
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,276
(sighs)

302
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,613
You always have
to make the sound?

303
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,419
I do.
It's what makes it fun.

304
00:11:58,461 --> 00:11:59,419
So fun.

305
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,983
Oh, I know it's frustrating.

306
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,343
But we only have
four dates left,

307
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,144
and when we get there,
it is gonna be amazing.

308
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:11,465
Maybe we could even, uh...
Nah, never mind.

309
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,159
What?

310
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,186
Just this crazy position
I read about,

311
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:16,315
but you're way
too classy for it.

312
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:19,147
and besides, it's more
of a young chick thing.

313
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,933
Tell me more.

314
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,798
Well, you just take
one of your legs

315
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:24,676
and just put it
over my arm.

316
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,912
Like this?

317
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,681
Oh!
(crack)

318
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:31,827
(moaning)

319
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,593
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah! I'm great.

320
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,422
Why don't you go ahead and let
yourself out? There you go.

321
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,008
Yeah.

322
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:40,769
(door opens)

323
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,637
- Bye, Josh.
- (door closes)

324
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:46,950
Okay, so you hurt yourself
by not having sex?

325
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,743
That's right.
(sniffles)

326
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,237
I'm gonna get some take-out,

327
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,014
and do you remember
my aunt Carol?

328
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,374
The one
who hates my hair?

329
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,613
Yes. I'm gonna go
get my wedding video,

330
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:59,162
and we're gonna watch her break
her hip over and over again.

331
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,870
Ooh, I love it
when she screams and cries.

332
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,749
(telephone rings)

333
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,164
(ring, beep)

334
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:07,429
Hey, Laurie.

335
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,205
Nezzie's getting us
a free limo tonight.

336
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,419
(chuckles) I don't think
I can go out tonight.

337
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:14,848
It's done, girl.

338
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:16,939
But Saturday night's
the best night for going out.

339
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,974
(gasps) She says
Saturday's the best night.

340
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,116
No! You're staying in.

341
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,548
Come on. We'll soak our hands
and feet in baby pee.

342
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,981
This is your 20s weekend.

343
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,651
Would you look?
You're an invalid.

344
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,051
Slaggy ho.

345
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,662
Do you know what people think
when they see you

346
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,872
out with those kids?

347
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,234
Don't say it
if it's too mean.

348
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,355
I mean, you're too old
for this crap.

349
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,079
You look pathetic.

350
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:43,615
Give me the phone.
Give it to me.

351
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,885
LAURIE: <i>Jules, are you in a fight?</i>
- Give me! Give me!

352
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,028
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- Laurie, I'm in. Come get me.

353
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,305
Ellie, go home.

354
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,939
What are you doing?

355
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,975
What are <i>you</i> doing?

356
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,552
I came out to get the mail,
and I got thirsty.

357
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:05,842
I'm a little hungover.

358
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,009
Hey, but thanks for checking
on me, paper buddy.

359
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,578
No, not your paper buddy,
just an annoyed neighbor.

360
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,219
Don't send tiny bald men
to my house.

361
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,780
Is Ellie watching us
right now?

362
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,399
We got into a huge fight.

363
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,905
You see, I feel like you
don't listen to what I say.

364
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:21,588
- You just move on--
- Turn around and catch her on three.

365
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,934
One, two--

366
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:26,501
Just do me a favor
and stop trying to drag me

367
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:28,575
into your little,
"Where did all the years go?"

368
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,032
Little nervous breakdown thing
you seem to be going through.

369
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:33,877
Three!

370
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,967
Ha! Ha!
Oh, I got you!

371
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,016
I wasn't looking at you,
you stupid head!

372
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:44,176
Does anybody on this block
like you?

373
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:47,090
Ooh!
Catch you later, P.B.!

374
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,060
Hey! That stands for...
(singsong voice) "paper buddy"!

375
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,633
(cell phone alert chimes)

376
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:53,790
I just got a text.
Who's it from?

377
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,767
Someone named
Bitch-Slap Harris.

378
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,436
Huh. Good guy.
He's a college professor.

379
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,471
Of course he is.

380
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:05,671
Apparently, he saw a bouncer
being mean to Mom last night.

381
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:08,113
What? Why would anyone
want to be mean to Mom?

382
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,594
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad, Dad, I know those girls.

383
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,561
- Turn around.
- No detours.

384
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,286
We're running
low on juice, buddy.

385
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,603
<i>Fine.</i>

386
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,197
Ah, ha ha! Aah!

387
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:21,602
Sarah, Tina...
Don't know you...

388
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,560
What's the haps?

389
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:28,477
(giggling)

390
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,604
Just drive.

391
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,143
(moaning)

392
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,857
(telephone rings)

393
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,094
Andy?

394
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,112
Hey, Jules.
You--you okay?

395
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:53,223
So Ellie had you call.

396
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,662
(chuckles) Oh, please,
girlfriend. I'm my own man.

397
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,852
I'm assuming she's so close,
you can't speak freely.

398
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,256
(chuckles)
Yes.

399
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:01,294
I know she wrote you
a script,

400
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:03,017
so say something wrong
so I can catch her.

401
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:06,304
Uh, "When--when did
this whole 20s thing

402
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,255
start being about
<i>proobing</i> something?"

403
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,687
<i>Proving</i> something!
Proving!

404
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:12,209
Hang up the phone.

405
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:13,229
Go.

406
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,734
Ellie, I know
you can hear me.

407
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:21,758
I-I don't know when this thing
became about proving something.

408
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:22,844
It just did.

409
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:26,476
I hate the feeling that
I missed out on everything.

410
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,715
You--you have your stories.
I've heard all of them--

411
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,743
The night you were
in New York, Miami,

412
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,252
the--the month
you didn't see the sun,

413
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:34,834
the time
you kissed a girl.

414
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,622
(falsetto singsong voice)
Awesome!

415
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,130
I know that
I'm being crazy.

416
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:43,134
But when I'm being like that,
it is your job to support me!

417
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,842
I mean, remember when you
didn't smile at your baby

418
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,278
because you thought it would
give you mouth wrinkles?

419
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:50,440
I was there for you, Ellie!

420
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:53,814
It's hard for me
to be out there doing things

421
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,127
that I know are stupid,

422
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,194
and people are probably
talking about me.

423
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,345
But the last person I thought
who would ever say mean things

424
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,201
is my best friend!

425
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:07,418
Ellie, are you still there?

426
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:10,910
All right,
I'm going out.

427
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,105
You didn't smile at Stan?

428
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,143
Only for three weeks.

429
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,811
They want another round.
I feel like I'm 100.

430
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,067
You look like you're 800.

431
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,582
You know, I've seen
the endless parade of girls

432
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,131
you've brought home,
tagged and released.

433
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,803
No matter
how young they are,

434
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:34,351
you don't ever seem the slightest bit
self-conscious about your age.

435
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,189
I'm not.

436
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,390
Show me
how to do that.

437
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:41,478
I can't. You see, when women
get older, it's icky.

438
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,600
When men get older,
it's adorable.

439
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,647
It's actually
my favorite double standard.

440
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,653
- Yeah, I'm not a huge fan.
- Mm.

441
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,095
(grunts)

442
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,833
My, my.

443
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,130
I hurt myself hiking.

444
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,889
No, you didn't. Darling,
if you're going to attempt

445
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:01,162
a move like that, you gotta
hit the yoga class <i>hard</i>.

446
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,324
Hi. I'm Barb.

447
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:08,692
Wow.

448
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,464
Uh... Wait.
Where's your drink?

449
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:15,638
I don't even want it.

450
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,386
I'm just gonna borrow
some ice from this one.

451
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:22,572
- Ah. Ohh.
- That's it. You're done.

452
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,163
But Saturday night is
the best night for going out.

453
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,248
Sweetie,
it's time to go home.

454
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:30,689
I don't want you to have
to leave because of me.

455
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,415
You're going home.

456
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,017
It's Saturday night.

457
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,708
I'm going out.

458
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,272
(cell phone rings)

459
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,537
Hey, Mom. What's up?
Why are you calling?

460
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:45,530
I just wanted to hear your voice
before I went to sleep

461
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:49,026
- in case I never wake up.
- T-minus five, Goose.

462
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,512
Okay, gotta go, Mom.
Love you. Bye.

463
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,704
(tires screech)

464
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,307
(falsetto voice)
This is for my mom!

465
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,373
Aah!
(grunting)

466
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,213
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

467
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,705
Oh, my God!
That was incredible!

468
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,979
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Floor it! Floor it!

469
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:08,856
Hey. I saw that limo driver
help you in.

470
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,773
Did you come over here
to make fun of me?

471
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,740
No, I came over
to check on you.

472
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,859
So how are you?

473
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,502
Younger people just don't
get tired like we do.

474
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,256
I know.

475
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,760
But one day they will.

476
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,521
And if we're not dead,
I say we rub it in their faces.

477
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,908
I'm sorry
I was mean.

478
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,554
That's okay.

479
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:34,165
I'm never gonna have
my 20s again, am I?

480
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,196
Of course you are,

481
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:39,049
but just not two nights
in a row.

482
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,964
But you had a great
first night, right?

483
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:41,802
Yeah.

484
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,581
You never told me about it.
I bet you have great stories.

485
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,325
I do. Laurie sent some pictures
on my cell phone here.

486
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:52,373
Look at this.
Okay, this is me dancing.

487
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,095
Oh.

488
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,509
Um, that's a-a mean bouncer--
Oh, so mean.

489
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,300
That's, uh, that was
my first fistfight.

490
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:01,385
- I won.
- Cute.

491
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,940
This is me dancing on a pole.
I was just--

492
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,214
- That looks great. Yeah.
- Thank you.

493
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,079
And this is me eating
the world's largest pancake--

494
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:12,059
- so dadgum good.
- Oh, could we go get some?

495
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,175
- Yeah.
- All right.

496
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,870
(chuckles) Hi!

497
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,010
Oh, good.
You're chipper again.

498
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:25,339
I wanted to thank you
for the $6 of business

499
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,806
that you personally gave me
last night in an effort to show

500
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:29,852
that you could still hang
with the youngsters.

501
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:32,291
Why do you always have to--
Hey, wait a second.

502
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:34,631
You're out here with
your paper waiting for me!

503
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,690
To make fun of you.

504
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,450
It still counts.
You're my paper buddy!

505
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,452
Nuh-unh.
I was--I had to--

506
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,909
- I was reading--
- Sorry, P.B. I gotta go.

507
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:43,160
You save that
for tomorrow.

508
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:45,412
Damn it.
