( instrumental
"Hey Jude" plays )

7
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,217

and then they separated.

10
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,687
Are you
getting divorced?

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,733
At the moment, no...
but... it doesn't look good.

12
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,694
Do you still love us?

13
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,028
Of course I do.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,613
Do you still love Mom?

15
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,574
Yes, very much, but your
mother's asked me to leave

16
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,325
and I must respect
her position on the matter.

17
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,577
Is it our fault?

18
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:16,786
No.

19
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,787
No.

20
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,081
Obviously,
we made certain sacrifices

21
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,667
as a result of having children,
but, uh...

22
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:23,668
no, Lord, no.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,920
Then why'd she ask you to leave?

24
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:29,382
I don't really know anymore.

25
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:35,138
Maybe, uh, I wasn't as true
to her as I could've been.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,014
Well, she said...

27
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,056
Let's just drop it

28
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,349

her highest priority.

Yes, I'll hold, please.

35
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,113

standing up at his desk
with a cup of coffee

48
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,820
to save time.

He started buying real estate
in his early teens

54
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:51,005

to invite their father
to the party.

112
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,630
What'd you think, Dad?

113
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,216
Mmm... didn't seem
believable to me.

114

Well, did you at least think

118
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,933
the characters
were well-developed?

119
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:49,934
What characters?

120
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,769

122
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,106

failure, and disaster.

gunfire, shouting )

183
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,587
...had earned him a sudden,
unexpected literary celebrity.

184
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:49,299
Well, everyone knows Custer
died at Little Bighorn.

185
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,927
What this book presupposes is...
maybe he didn't.

186
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,179
Let me ask you something.

187
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,264
Why would a review
make the point of saying

188
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,473
someone's nota genius?

189
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,768
You think I'm especially
nota genius?

190
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,313
I know w...

191
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,815
You didn't even have
to think about it, did you?

192
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:09,319
Well, I just don't use
thatword lightly.

193
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,155
( knocking on door)

194
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:15,116
I have to go, Eli.

195
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,452
( knocking on door)

196
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,578
MAN:
Margot?

197
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,579
Uh-huh.

198
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,998
May I come in, please?

199
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,001
( water running )

200
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,799
( squeaking )

201
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,305
How are you, my darling?

202
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:41,142
NARRATOR:
Margo was married
to the writer and neurologist

203
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,478

204
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,522
( gulls cawing )

205
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,358
I'm fine, thank you.

206
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,984
You need to eat something.

207
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,361
May I make you dinner?

208
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,362
No, thank you.

209
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,197
( tapping prosthetic finger)

210
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,832
NARRATOR:
She was known
for her extreme secrecy.

211
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,252
For example,
none of the Tenenbaums knew

212
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,672
she was a smoker, which she
had been since the age of 12.

213
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,132
Nor were they aware
of her first marriage

214
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,844
and divorce to
a recording artist in Jamaica.

215
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:19,514
She kept a private studio
in Mockingbird Heights

216
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,308
under the name "Helen Scott. "

217
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,020
She had not completed a play
in seven years.

218
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:32,527
17 October, third examination
of Dudley Heinsbergen.

219
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:35,572
All right, Dudley

220
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,074
make yours like mine.

221
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,576
( clicks )

222
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,662
NARRATOR:
Raleigh's next book was
on the subject

223
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:45,790
of a condition he called
"Heinsbergen Syndrome. "

224
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,335
Where's that red one

225
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,337
going to go?

226
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,258
Done.

227
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,721
Good.

228
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,848
Very good.

229
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,766
( chuckles )

230
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,518
My goodness.

231
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,354
How interesting. How bizarre.

232
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,274
Dudley suffers
from a rare disorder

233
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,902
combining symptoms
of amnesia, dyslexia

234
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,945
and color blindness.

He has a highly acute
sense of hearing.

236
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,908
There is also evidence of...

237
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,451
I'm not color blind, am l?

238
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,871
I'm afraid you are.

239
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,915
( watch ticking )

240
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,550
( alarm blaring )

241
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,681
Ari, fire alarm! Let's go!

242
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,183
Out you go!

243
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,268
Let's go!

244
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,274
Uzi, emergency! Let's go!

245
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,739
Uzi... what did I just say?!

246
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:00,823
Look alive!

247
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,116
Fire!

NARRATOR:
Chas's wife Rachael

249
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,995

the previous summer.

250
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:06,996
What about Buckley?

251
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:08,498
It's too late. You forgot him.

252
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,999
Buckley! Buckley!

253
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,588
No elevator! There's a fire.

254
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,798
Go, go!

255
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,133
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

256
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:22,887
NARRATOR:
Chas and theirtwo sons,
Ari and Uzi

257
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,849
were also on the flight
and survived

258
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,309
as did their dog

259
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,019
who was discovered in his cage

260
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,522
several thousand yards
from the crash site.

261

262
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,116
Four minutes, 48 seconds.

263
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,451
We're all dead,
burnt to a crisp.

264
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,161
NARRATOR:
Over the last six months

265
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,873
he had become increasingly
concerned with their safety.

266
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,875
We left Buckley.

267
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,002
It doesn't matter.

268
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,468
NARRATOR:
Etheline became
an archaeologist

269
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,179
and had overseen excavations

270
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,056
for the Department of Housing
and the Transit Authority.

271
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,058
Apropos of my question

272
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,980
regarding l-40
slash l-9 adjustments...

273
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:14,981
um...

274
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:16,357
( clears throat)

275
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,860
NARRATOR:
She taught a bridge class
twice a week

276
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:21,654
with herfriend and business
manager, Henry Sherman.

277
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:25,658
( calculator clicking )

278
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,036
It would probably be
advantageous

279
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,038
for your marital status

280
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,582
to be legally established
as single

281
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,042
in light of the circumstances.

282
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,210
What do you mean?

283
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,253
I mean for tax purposes.

284
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,254
But I thought...

285
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,048
-Etheline...
-Yes?

286
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,758
Will you marry me?

287
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,011
l...

288
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,387
I love you, uh...

289
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,431
Did you already know that?

290
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,226
No, I didn't.

291
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,436
Since herseparation
from her husband

292
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,104
she had had many suitors...

293
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,281
...but had not considered
a single one until this moment.

294
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:08,910
This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

295
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:12,121
That's true, uh...

296
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,999
I don't know why
I put it that way.

297
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,838
Let me think about it, Henry.

298
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,970
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal
this is the Pagoda.

299
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:30,807
( bell dings )

300
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:33,601
Lobby.

301
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:35,770
Thank you, Dusty.

302
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,480
You're welcome.

303
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,984
Good morning, Jerry.

304
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,318
Hmm...

305
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,322
Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

306
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,657
Who is it, Frederick?

307
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,534
A Mr. Pagoda.

308
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:51,911
( phone ringing )

309
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,373
What do you got?

310
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,334
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

311
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:02,297
No shit?

312
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,132
What did Ethel say?

313
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:06,551
She think about it.

314
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,556
I don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

315
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:14,642
I mean... Lord knows

316
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:18,396
I've had my share
of infidelities

317
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,857
but she's still my wife.

318
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,653
And no damn two-bit,
chartered accountant

319
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,072
is going to change that.

320
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,999
Hi.

321
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,840
Hey, Pagoda,
give us a hand, huh?

322
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:48,051
( classical music plays )

323
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,093
( door closes )

324
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,845
( footsteps )

325
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,314
Chas?

326
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,817
What's going on?

327
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,402
We got locked out
of our apartment.

328
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,780
Did you call a locksmith?

329
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,949
Uh-huh.

330
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,367
Well, I don't understand.

331
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,744
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

332
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:15,912
or how did you...?

333
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,456
It's not safe over there.

334
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,584
Excuse me for a moment.

335
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,672
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:26,673
The apartment.

337
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,591
I have to get
some new sprinklers

338
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,885
and a backup
security system installed.

339
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,097
But there are
no sprinklers here, either.

340
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:37,225
Well, we might have
to do something about that, too.

341
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,356
Okay.

342
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:45,483
lsn't this fun, huh?

343
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:46,693
lsn't this great?

344
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,528
Feels like we're camping.

345
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,363
When are we going home?

346
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:51,364
Huh?

347
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:52,365
Hey, look at this.

348
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,616
( chuckles )

349
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,827
Pretty cool, huh?

350
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,912
/ Who am I supposed to be? /

351
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,247
Who put that in here?

352
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,125
/...Look at me /

353
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,005
/ What am I supposed to be? /

354
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,631
Okay.

355
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,509
Well, I will see you boys
in the morning.

356
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,719
-Good night.
-Good night.

357
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,887
Good night.

358
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,930
/ Look at me /

359
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,265
You know what?

360
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:19,893
I think I'm going
to sleep in here with you.

361
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,144
That way...

362
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,188
( grunts )

363
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,607
...we can all be together.

364
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:26,733
( sighs )

365
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,777
/ Oh, my love /

366
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,447
/ Oh. /

367
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,499
What kind of side effects
can be expected?

368
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,460
Well, there are
a number of possibilities.

369
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,378
Severe nausea and dizziness
are standard.

370
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,340
A certain percentage of patients
may also experience seizure.

371
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,176
You mean, like flopping around
on the floor and everything?

372
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:55,011
In some cases.

373
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,012
( sighs )

374
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,430
( knocking )

375
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:01,351
You have a visitor, my darling.

376
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:03,353
MARGOT:
Who is it?

377
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:06,940
It's me, sweetie.

378
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,233
( water splashing )

379
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,578
Raleigh says you've been
spending six hours a day

380
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,580
locked in here,
watching television

381
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:23,998
and soaking in the tub.

382
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,668
I doubt that.

383
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,711
I don't think that's
very healthy, do you?

384
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,505
Nor do I think
it's very intelligent

385
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:33,341
to keep an electrical gadget
on the edge of the bathtub.

386
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,176
I tie it to the radiator.

387
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,473
Well, it can't be very good
for your eyes, anyway.

388
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,819
Chas came home.

389
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,238
What do you mean?

390
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,657
He and Ari and Uzi
are going to stay

391
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,993
with me for a little while.

392
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,705
Why are they allowed
to do that?

393
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,373
I don't know exactly

394
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:08,251
but I think he's been
very depressed.

395
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:09,878
So am l.

396
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,255
So are you, what?

397
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:14,340
But why is this necessary?

398
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:17,594
'Cause I'm in a rut,
and I need a change.

399
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,804
Hang on.

400
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:21,681
( Vince Guaraldi Trio's

401
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:24,184
"Christmas Time is Here"
playing )

402
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,602
ETHELlNE:
Taxi!

403
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,609
That cab has a dent in it.

404
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:38,406
You don't love me anymore,
do you?

405
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,575
I do, kind of.

406
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,452
I can't explain it right now.

407
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,705
Another dent here,
and another dent here.

408
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:48,416
( horn honks )

409
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,758
I'll call you, okay?

410
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,932
/ /

411
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,531
Hello.

412
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:22,867
Hello?

413
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,789
Hello, beautiful.

414
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:39,634
Got a minute?

415
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,010
( gasps )

416
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,971
What are you doing here?

417
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:44,305
Uh, I need a favor.

418
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,975
I want to spend some time
with you and the children.

419
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,852
Are you crazy?

420
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,186
Well, wait a minute, damn it!

421
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:51,354
Stop following me.

422
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,689
Well, I want my family back.

423
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,190
Well, you can't have it.

424
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:57,318
I'm sorry for you,
but it's too late.

425
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,653
Well, listen...

426
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,697
Baby, I'm dying.

427
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:05,577
Yeah, I'm-I'm sick as a dog.

428
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,663
I'll be dead in six weeks.

429
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:10,999
I'm dying.

430
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,799
What are you talking about?

431
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,016
What's happening?

432
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:34,939
Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,318
I didn't know.

434
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:45,617
( sobbing ):
Well, what'd they say?

435
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:47,619
What is the prognosis?

436
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,370
Take it easy, Ethel.

437
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,706
Now, hold-hold on, baby,
hold on.

438
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:54,709
Hold on, okay?

439
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:57,212
( hysterical sobbing )

440
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:59,464
Ethel, hold on, hold on.

441
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:00,757
Where is the doctor?

442
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,050
Don't... Well, just...

443
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,301
W-Wait a second now.

444
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,636
Wait a second.

445
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:09,224
Okay, uh, listen,
I'm not dying...

446
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:10,975
but I need some time.

447
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,228
A month or so, okay?

448
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:16,064
I want us... I want us to-to...

449
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,066
What's wrong with you?!

450
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:19,526
Damn!

451
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,610
Ethel.

452
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:21,611
Are you crazy?!

453
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,196
Ethel, baby...

454
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:26,407
I am dying.

455
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,921
Are you or aren't you?

456
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:43,675
What? Dying?

457
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:45,885
Yeah.

458
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,306
Have you told your children?

459
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:51,808
More or less.

460
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,601
And are they all right?

461
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:55,228
It's hard to say.

462
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,646
Who's your father?

463
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:58,481
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.

464
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,275
You told us he was already dead.

465
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,110
Yeah, well, now
he's really dying.

466
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,152
-Ready.
-Print it.

467
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:04,654
I am very sorry, Margo.

468
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:05,697
That's okay.

469
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,657
We're not actually related,
anyway.

470
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:09,742
True.

471
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:12,912
I'd like to send a response,
please.

472
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,497
MAN:
Yes, sir, go ahead.

473
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,374
Dear Mom:

474
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,084
I received your message.

475
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,587
I'm coming home
as soon as possible.

476
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,297
Who do I see about that?

477
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:26,259
NARRATOR:
The ship's porter arranged for
Richie to disembark at Halifax

478
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,553
and transfer
to a third-class state room

479
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,013
on board the Queen Helena

480
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,015
destined for
the Eastern seaboard.

481
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:35,935
His trunks would not arrive
for another 1 1 days.

482
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,896
Hey, Baumer.

483
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,856
Do you mind if we get
a picture with you?

484
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,149
Not at all.

485
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:46,279
NARRATOR:
He had made a request
for his usual escort

486
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,489
the one from his days
on the circuit

487
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:51,784
to meet him at the pier
by way of the Green Line bus.

488
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,244
Hi.

489
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:58,625
NARRATOR:
As always, she was late.

490
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:17,393
( upbeat guitar strumming )

491
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:34,869
/ I've been out walking /

492
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:41,668
/ I don't do too much talking
these days /

493
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:46,548
/ These days /

494
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:49,217
/ These days I seem
to think a lot /

495
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:54,055
/ About the things
that I forgot to do... /

496
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,727
/ And other times, l... /

497
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:01,563
Stand up straight.

498
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:04,065
Let me get a look at you.

499
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:09,654
What's so funny?

500
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:15,159
Well it's nice to see you, too.

501
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:27,130
NARRATOR:
That night, Etheline found
all of her children

502
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,048
living together under
the same roof

503
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,717
for the first time in 17 years.

504
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,093
Where's your dad?

505
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:42,604
NARRATOR:
The next morning,
Richie woke at dawn.

506
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:46,107
He had decided birds should not
be kept in cages

507
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:49,777
fed Mordecai three sardines,
and set him free.

508
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,926
( doorbell chimes )

509
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:31,861
I've missed the hell out of you,
my darlings.

510
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:34,197
Well, you know that, though,
don't you?

511
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:37,158
I hear you're dying.

512
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,410
So they tell me.

513
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:40,954
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,289
Well, I've had a good run.

515
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:45,542
You don't look so sick, Dad.

516
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,335
Thank you.

517
00:27:47,377 --> 00:27:48,878
What have you got?

518
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
I've got a pretty bad case
of cancer.

519
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,216
( Chas yawning ):
How long you going to last?

520
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:55,552
Not long.

521
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,303
A month, a year?

522
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,556
About six weeks.

523
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:00,765
Let me get to the point.

524
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,226
The three of you and your mother
are all I've got

525
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,894
and I love you
more than anything.

526
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:05,979
CHAS:
Ho-ho!

527
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,438
-Ho-ho.
-Chas, let me

528
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,399
finish here.

529
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,236
Now, I've got six weeks
to set things right with you

530
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:14,696
and I aim to do it.

531
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,573
Will you give me a chance?

532
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:17,699
No.

533
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,533
You speak

534
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:19,701
for everyone?

535
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:21,035
I speak for myself.

536
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:22,829
Well, you've
made your views known.

537
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,164
Let somebody else do some of
the talking now.

538
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,292
What do you propose to do?

539
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,294
I can't say, really.

540
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,881
Um, make up for lost time,
I suppose.

541
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:34,382
First thing I want to do is

542
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,177
take you out to see
your grandmother, at some point.

543
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,888
I haven't been out there
since I was six.

544
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:41,764
I haven't been out there at all.

545
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:43,016
I was never invited.

546
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:45,643
Well, she wasn't
your real grandmother

547
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:49,606
and I never knew how much
interest you had, uh, sweetie.

548
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,524
Anyway, you're invited now.

549
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:52,650
Thanks.

550
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,694
RlCHlE:
You know, Rachael's buried

551
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:55,695
out there, too.

552
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:56,988
Who?

553
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,948
My wife.

554
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,241
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

555
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:02,410
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

556
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,919
Uh, I'll be right back.

557
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,003
Chas.

558
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,131
Chas.

559
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,052
Can I see my grandsons?

560
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:20,637
Why?

561
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,932
Because I finally want
to meet them.

562
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,308
( sighing )

563
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,143
Don't give me that guff.

564
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:31,356
I think we'll pass.

565
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,239
Pagoda...

566
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,242
where's my Havelina?

567
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,287
I'll say good-night
to you now, children.

568
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,664
Dad.

569
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,795
Thank you, my sweet boy.

570
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,467
I'll contact you
in the next 12 hours

571
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,094
with further instructions.

572
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:11,062
Look at that old

573
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,815
grizzly bear.

574
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:16,025
Hello, Ethel.

575
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,360
Good evening, sir.

576
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:19,362
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

577
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:20,947
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

578
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:22,156
Hey, lay it on me, man.

579
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:23,241
How do you do?

580
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,326
Not too well. I'm dying.

581
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,328
( upbeat music playing
on radio )

582
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,122
How's Richie?

583
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,832
I don't know.

584
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:32,584
I can't tell.

585
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,127
Yeah, me neither.

586
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,171
He wrote me a letter.

587
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:38,423
He says he's
in love with you.

588
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,177
What are you talking about?

589
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,678
That's what he said.

590
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,931
I don't know how
we're supposed to take it.

591
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:48,141
Hang on.

592
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:51,144
( male vocalistsinging
on radio )

593
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,106
( buzzer sounds )

594
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:56,608
MAN:
Hello.

595
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,484
Sugar, it's Eli.

596
00:30:58,526 --> 00:30:59,986
Hey, baby, give me a second.

597
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:01,779
What are we doing, Eli?

598
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:04,032
Oh, I just got to pick
something up.

599
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,952
Don't repeat that, by the way.

600
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,037
About Richie.

601
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:12,498
It was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

602
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,504
( lock buzzes )

603
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:18,838
Good.

604
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,258
Now just remove the loose soil

605
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,221
and note the
decomposition levels.

606
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:28,181
I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

607
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:30,391
Don't be silly.

608
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,060
Come on.

609
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,687
I just want to apologize
for the other day

610
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:36,189
when I proposed to you.

611
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:37,190
Why?

612
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,566
I thought it was very sweet.

613
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:41,402
I know I'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

614
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:42,904
you've been involved with.

615
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:45,782
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright,

616
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,158
and your ex-husband.

617
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,493
Oh, that's ridiculous.

618
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,203
But, but, I feel...

619
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:53,122
I can offer
just as much as them.

620
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:56,709
I know I went about it
backwards, but...

621
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,212
Henry, I have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

622
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:01,130
or Doug Cartwright--
I never did--

623
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:03,883
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

624
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:05,343
Henry?

625
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,764
Henry, are you all right?

626
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,808
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

627
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,311
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

628
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:18,314
Henry, wait a second.

629
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:22,277
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

630
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,070
Th-That's okay.

631
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,492
Oh, thank you.

632
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:33,079
Why are you so nervous?

633
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:35,999
Well, to tell you the truth

634
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,378
I haven't slept
with a man in 18 years.

635
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,422
/ Dah-dah-dum /

636
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,929
/ Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah,
dah-dum /

637
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,103
/ Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah /

638
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:03,401
( giggling )
/ Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah... /

639
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:11,159
/ La-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah... /

640
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,662
( whistling )

641
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:17,498
/ Lah-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah... /

642
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,042
( Royal whistles )

643
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,756
/ Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah... /

644
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:31,054
/ Dah, dah-dah-dah,
dah, dee... /

645
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:42,315
/ Dah, dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah... /

646
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:43,691
/ Dah-dah, dah-dah... /

647
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,361
That's a hell of an old
hound dog you got there.

648
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:47,487
What's he go by?

649
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:48,863
Buckley.

650
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:50,740
Buckley, sit.

651
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,287
You know who I am?

652
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,373
I'm Royal.

653
00:33:58,414 --> 00:33:59,999
Have you heard of me?

654
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,962
I'm very sorry for your loss.

655
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:06,714
Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

656
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:07,882
Thank you.

657
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,759
Which one are you?

658
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,010
Ari.

659
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,720
Uzi, I'm your granddad.

660
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:14,055
Hello.

661
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:16,683
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

662
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:18,768
I don't get invited around
very much.

663
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,104
What do you think of that,
by the way?

664
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:22,397
Oh, you...

665
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:24,524
you don't have to say anything.

666
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:27,902
It's kind of a "fuck you"
to the old man, I guess.

667
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,320
How's your daddy?

668
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,321
Fine.

669
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:31,322
You think so, huh?

670
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,199
How often has he got you
working out?

671
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,118
16 times a week.

672
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:37,245
Do me a favor.

673
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:38,788
Tell him you want to meet me.

674
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,415
But we just met.

675
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,457
No, we didn't.

676
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:44,043
Look, I'd like us to have
a relationship

677
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:47,463
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

678
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:50,717
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

679
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,886
ARl:
Well, I bet
Mom would have wanted us

680
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,345
to meet him before he died.

681
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:55,471
Wouldn't she?

682
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:56,931
Don't you think?

683
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:14,574
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

684
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,951
I wouldn't know.

685
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:18,494
Excuse me. Come on.

686
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:19,621
Oh, that's right.

687
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:21,664
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

688
00:35:21,664 --> 00:35:22,665
Uh, hold on.

689
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:27,003
Take some of these.

690
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,215
Come on.

691
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:36,554
So what do you think
of this big, old black buck

692
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:37,639
moving in up there?

693
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,307
Who?

694
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,517
Henry Sherman.

695
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:41,726
You know him?

696
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,144
Yeah.

697
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:45,021
Is he worth a damn?

698
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,775
I believe so.

699
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,032
What happened to your finger?

700
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:57,033
Uzi, shh.

701
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,117
It's okay, I'll tell you.

702
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,494
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

703
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:02,121
Well, I am.

704
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:05,416
When I was 14, I went to find
my real family.

705
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,668
They live in lndiana.

706
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:09,546
All right, now, just set one
of them hickory trunks

707
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,548
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

708
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:18,513
( gasps )

709
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,934
Did you try to sew it back on?

710
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:25,520
Wasn't worth it.

711
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,988
Hell of a damn grave.

712
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:38,491
Wish it were mine.

713
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,868
It's a shame, isn't it?

714
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,202
What?

715
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:43,872
Well, you probably had another
good two or three years

716
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:45,373
of competitive play in you.

717
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:46,541
Probably.

718
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:50,211
I had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

719
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,505
Financially and personally.

720
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:56,593
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

721
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,679
TENNlS ANNOUNCER:
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

722
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:05,768
( crowd reacts )

723
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,645
COMMENTATOR:
That's 72 unforced errors

724
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:08,980
for Richie Tenenbaum.

725
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,982
He's playing the worst tennis
of his life.

726
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:12,984
What's he feeling right now,
Tex Hayward?

727
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,402
HAYWARD:
I don't know, Jim.

728
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:16,571
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

729
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:18,823
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

730
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,700
and... actually,
I think he's crying.

731
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,410
COMMENTATOR:
I think you're right.

732
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:24,996
Who's he looking at
in the friends' box, Tex?

733
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,915
HAYWARD:
That's his sister, Margot

734
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,958
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

735
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,960
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

736
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:32,545
COMMENTATOR:
Oh, yes.

737
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:35,381
( crowd reacts )

738
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:40,929
COMMENTATOR:
I've never seen anything
like this.

739
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,889
HAYWARD:
Neither have l.

740
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:46,267
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

741
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:48,853
I kind of disappeared
after that, didn't l?

742
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,855
Yeah.

743
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:53,858
But I understood.

744
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,153
I know you're not very good
with disappointment.

745
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,953
You still got that little BB

746
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:08,248
in your hand, Chassie?

747
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:11,125
( chuckling softly)

748
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,422
Why did you shoot me?

749
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,299
It was the object
of the game, wasn't it?

750
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:19,634
No.

751
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,178
We were on the same team.

752
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:24,264
Were we?

753
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:27,517
Well... you sued me.

754
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,602
Twice. Got me disbarred.

755
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:32,480
I don't hold it
against you, do l?

756
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:33,565
And how is it possible

757
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,525
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

758
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,193
without your written
authorization?

759
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:38,736
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, l...

760
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,822
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

761
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:43,032
Because I started the
corporation when I was a minor.

762
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:44,659
So, my father
was the primary signatory

763
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:45,994
on most of my accounts.

764
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,161
He also stole bonds

765
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,706
out of my safety deposit box
when I was 14.

766
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,960
( chuckles uncomfortably)

767
00:38:54,002 --> 00:38:56,129
You think you could
start forgiving me?

768
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:03,094
Why should l?

769
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:05,096
Because you're hurting me.

770
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,183
Come on.

771
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,854
Were you in prison?

772
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,897
Kind of.

773
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:15,481
Minimum security.

774
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,984
I got jacked by the lRS.

775
00:39:18,026 --> 00:39:19,319
Should we split?

776
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,320
Yes, sir.

777
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,988
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

778
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,323
Okay.

779
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:25,992
No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy.

780
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,660
Okay.

781
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:31,372
Come on, let's shag ass.

782
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:32,832
Well, just let me know

783
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:35,335
ifyou need somebody
to talk to, okay?

784
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:36,920
I like Raleigh very much.

785
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,297
I know he's a lot older
than you are

786
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:41,674
and you two are having
some problems

787
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,760
but... anyway,
maybe I can help.

788
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,553
Okay. Thanks.

789
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,431
Hey, Baumer! All right!

790
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:53,561
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

791
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:56,898
By the way, I heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

792
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:03,696
You dropped some cigarettes.

793
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,076
Those aren't mine.

794
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:10,495
They just fell
out ofyour pocket.

795
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:25,426
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

796
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,183
Come in.

797
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,230
Did you tell Margot

798
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:39,524
about that letter
I wrote to you?

799
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:41,734
Why? Did she mention it?

800
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:44,320
( sighing )

801
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:47,031
Yes, I did.

802
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:49,951
Why would she
have repeated that, I wonder?

803
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:52,704
Well, I would ask you
the same question.

804
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:55,748
Rightly so.

805
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:06,134
What'd you say?

806
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:07,802
Hmm?

807
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,179
What?

808
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,598
I didn't say anything.

809
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,766
When? Right now?

810
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:20,356
I'm sorry; don't listen to me.

811
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,691
I'm on mescaline.

812
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,693
I've been spaced out all day.

813
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,695
( cork pops )

814
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,780
Did you say you're on mescaline?

815
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,741
I did, indeed.

816
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,993
Very much so.

817
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:34,412
How often do you, uh...?

818
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:36,164
I'm worried about you, Richie.

819
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,166
Why?

820
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,044
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

821
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:42,462
But I did find it odd

822
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:45,215
when you said
you were in love with her.

823
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,345
She's married, you know.

824
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:52,138
Yeah.

825
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,516
And she's your sister.

826
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:56,976
Adopted.

827
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:09,364
Where are my encyclopedias?

828
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:10,782
They've been placed in storage.

829
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,700
Well, damn you.
You're taking my encyclopedias.

830
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,369
-Th-this is humiliating.
-I'm sorry.

831
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,371
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

832
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:17,539
Where am I supposed to go?

833
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,082
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

834
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,000
I'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

835
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,710
-at another hotel.
-You son of a bitch.

836
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,045
Frederick.

837
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,046
Hello there, Dusty.

838
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:26,714
Hello.

839
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:28,550
Could you spot me a quarter?

840
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:30,385
Of course.

841
00:42:31,427 --> 00:42:33,721
Richie? Hi.

842
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:35,849
It's your dad.

843
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:41,187
I think he's very lonely...

844
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,064
lonelier than he lets on

845
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:45,900
maybe lonelier
than he even realizes.

846
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:48,695
Have you spoken
to him about this?

847
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,864
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

848
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:53,241
I'm sorry, maybe I'm
a little confused here.

849
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:54,576
What are you suggesting?

850
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:56,911
That he come here
and stay in my room.

851
00:42:56,953 --> 00:42:59,497
Are you out ofyour mind?

852
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,915
No, I'm not.
Anyway, I think that

853
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:03,126
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

854
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,085
Who gives a shit?

855
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:05,753
I do.

856
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:07,005
You poor sucker.

857
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:09,382
You poor, washed-up papa's boy.

858
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:10,884
SHERMAN:
All right, let's not
get out of hand.

859
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,428
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

860
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:14,596
This is a family matter.

861
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:16,806
Don't talk to him like that.

862
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:18,558
-Call me Henry.
-I prefer Mr. Sherman.

863
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,143
Call him Henry.

864
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:21,603
Why? I don't know him
that well.

865
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:22,937
You've known him for ten years.

866
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,647
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

867
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:25,982
Where are you going to sleep?

868
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:27,692
I'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

869
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:29,110
We brought our sleeping bag...

870
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:30,153
Uzi!

871
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:31,529
ARl:
We don't mind, Dad.

872
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:32,530
We like him.

873
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:33,573
UZl:
Who, Pappy?

874
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:34,574
"Pappy"?

875
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:36,451
He can sleep in
the room above us.

876
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:38,036
Ari, it's not your decision.

877
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,370
Nor is it yours.

878
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,122
Well, he's already up there.

879
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,210
What?!

880
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:46,461
I think he's asleep

881
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:48,630
because of the medication
he's on

882
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:52,467
but l... I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

883
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,720
if Mom says it's okay.

884
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,182
( monitor beeping )

885
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,812
Get out.

886
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:06,898
( grunting ):
All right.

887
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,567
Let me just collect my things.

888
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:11,569
( groans )

889
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:14,280
Would you mind handing me
my cane, Richie?

890
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,074
Let me see,
where's my suitcases?

891
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,408
I'll get 'em.

892
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,660
Oh, thanks.

893
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:20,328
( grunting ):
Oh!

894
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,579
Dad!

895
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:22,914
( groans )

896
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:23,915
Mom!

897
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:26,751
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

898
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:28,586
Are you okay?

899
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:30,547
What the fuck you care?

900
00:44:30,588 --> 00:44:32,507
ETHELlNE:
Oh, my goodness.

901
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:34,592
ROYAL:
Pagoda?

902
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,094
Call Doctor McClure.

903
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:38,346
( monitorflatlines )

904
00:44:38,388 --> 00:44:39,722
( moans )

905
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:41,724
Take a breath and hold it.

906
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,102
( inhales )

907
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:45,103
Now cough.

908
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:47,480
( coughs weakly)

909
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:50,900
His condition is stable.

910
00:44:50,942 --> 00:44:53,319
The attack was
just a side effect.

911
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:56,322
I recommend you push fluids

912
00:44:56,406 --> 00:44:58,783
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

913
00:44:58,825 --> 00:45:00,827
( pager beeping )

914
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:06,916
CHAS:
Can we move him?

915
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:08,918
Absolutely not.

916
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,087
For how long?

917
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:12,964
We'll have to wait and see.

918
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:14,841
Is he going to be all right?

919
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:16,843
That depends. Is he a fighter?

920
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:18,386
Yeah.

921
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:20,221
Then that's the best we've got.

922
00:45:23,766 --> 00:45:25,310
Pagoda's in possession

923
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,437
of a parcel containing
my will

924
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,899
and some instructions
for the funeral

925
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,026
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

926
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:34,360
Proofread it for me

927
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:36,738
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

928
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:38,406
Okay.

929
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:41,910
I never did stop loving you,
by the way.

930
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:43,244
Do you believe that?

931
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:44,871
Not really.

932
00:45:44,913 --> 00:45:47,457
You look terrific.

933
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:49,250
That dress is stunning.

934
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,252
Thanks.

935
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,566
( acoustic guitarplays
soft, slow melody)

936
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,402
/ Tears that angels cry... /

937
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:18,112
( loud slurping )

938
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:21,824
/ And the dark
and all the sky... /

939
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,244
Lights out, old man.

940
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:27,789
I thought I'd read
for a while, Chas.

941
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,625
Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.

942
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,627
I'm right in the middle
of a sentence.

943
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:35,964
Well, you'll have to finish it
in the morning.

944
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:37,173
Them's the rules.

945
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:39,175
Chas?

946
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:42,971
Good night, my boy.

947
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:46,182
/ When the oneyou love
says good-bye /

948
00:46:48,226 --> 00:46:52,480
/ Sing a lullaby /

949
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:56,359
/ Dee-dee-dee,
dee-dee, dee-dee /

950
00:46:56,401 --> 00:47:00,697
/ Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee,
dee-dee... /

951
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:03,491
Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?

952
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,536
He's your dad, too, Chas.

953
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,121
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is.

954
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:09,998
You really hate me,
don't you?

955
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,624
No. I don't. I love you.

956
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,295
Well, I don't know
what you think

957
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:17,255
you're going to get out of this

958
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:20,425
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

959
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:24,762
Chas...

960
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:26,973
I don't want to hurt you.

961
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:29,684
I know what you and the boys
have been through.

962
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,644
You're my brother,
and I love you.

963
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,479
Stop saying that!

964
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:51,414
What's that jackass doing?

965
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,670
I know you, asshole!

966
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:11,142
Did Eli send you that?

967
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:12,977
Mm-hmm.

968
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:15,980
He always sends me
his clippings.

969
00:48:16,022 --> 00:48:18,816
What for?

970
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:21,069
I think he just likes
the encouragement.

971
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,445
He's done it for years.

972
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:24,822
He used to send me
his grades in college.

973
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:25,990
( sighs )

974
00:48:26,032 --> 00:48:27,659
That's ridiculous.

975
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,036
( tapping )

976
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,503
How long do you intend
to stay here?

977
00:48:38,545 --> 00:48:40,839
I don't know.

978
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,008
Are you ever coming home?

979
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,846
Maybe not.

980
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:50,348
You're joking.

981
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:53,393
No.

982
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:58,064
Well, I want to die.

983
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:04,779
Raleigh, please...

984
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,990
Have you met someone else?

985
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,160
I couldn't even begin
to think about

986
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,163
knowing how to answer
that question.

987
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,922
ROYAL:
I don't like the way
you're treating Raleigh.

988
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,011
What are you talking about?

989
00:49:28,011 --> 00:49:29,512
You don't even know him.

990
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:31,472
Well, I've met him,
and I don't think he deserves...

991
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:34,559
Stay out of it.

992
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:37,645
You're two-timing him
with that bloodsucker

993
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:40,607
Eli Cash.

994
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:43,610
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

995
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,695
You used to be a genius.

996
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:50,909
No, I didn't.

997
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:55,788
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

998
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,464
RALElGH:
Richard, I know you're
terribly close to Margot

999
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:06,716
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

1000
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:09,719
May I confide in you?

1001
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:12,847
( sighs )

1002
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:16,518
Okay.

1003
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,062
I believe
she's having an affair.

1004
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:22,524
I'm utterly devastated.

1005
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:26,194
l... don't know
where else to turn.

1006
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:29,364
Will you advise me?

1007
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:30,532
I don't know.

1008
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:31,866
What do you want to do?

1009
00:50:31,908 --> 00:50:33,034
I don't know.

1010
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:34,202
Perhaps, uh...

1011
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:35,703
Find the guy and get him?

1012
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:37,455
Well, no,
I thought we could...

1013
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:43,878
Who do you think it might be?

1014
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,257
I don't know at the moment.

1015
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:51,761
CHAS:
Let's look
at the actuals, okay?

1016
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:53,847
I agree with you
a hundred percent.

1017
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,057
That's why we have
marketing grids.

1018
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:57,684
ROYAL:
Hey.

1019
00:50:57,725 --> 00:50:59,561
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokyo

1020
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,187
and get some fireworks?

1021
00:51:01,229 --> 00:51:03,064
What do you need?

1022
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,275
Nothing.

1023
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,735
I see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

1024
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:11,364
Please don't
come in this room.

1025
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:12,866
Chas has those boys cooped up

1026
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:14,868
like a pair ofjackrabbits,
Etheline.

1027
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,369
He has his reasons.

1028
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:17,704
Oh, I know that

1029
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:21,082
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

1030
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:24,377
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

1031
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:28,047
I think that's terrible advice.

1032
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:32,051
No, you don't.

1033
00:51:32,093 --> 00:51:34,512
ARl:
We take boxing
and self-defense classes.

1034
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,598
I'm not talking
about dance lessons.

1035
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:38,516
I'm talking about
putting a brick

1036
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,560
through the other guy's
windshield.

1037
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:44,856
I'm talking about taking it out
and chopping it up.

1038
00:51:44,898 --> 00:51:46,608
What do you mean?

1039
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:48,067
/ The mama pajama
rolled out of bed /

1040
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:49,235
( all yelling )

1041
00:51:49,277 --> 00:51:50,778
/ And she ran
to the police station /

1042
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,908
/ When the papa found out,
he began to shout /

1043
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:57,619
/ And he started
the investigation /

1044
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,786
/ It's against the law /

1045
00:51:58,828 --> 00:51:59,954
Go!

1046
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,080
/ It was against the law /

1048
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:05,126

it was against the law /

( chuckling )

1050
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:10,131
/ The mama looked down
and spit on the ground /

1051
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:12,634
/ Ev'ry time my name
gets mentioned /

1052
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:15,136
/ The papa said,
"Oy, if I get that boy /

1053
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:18,306
/ I'm gonna stick him
in the house of detention" /

1054
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,433
/ Well, I'm on my way /

1055
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:22,894
/ I don't know where I'm goin' /

1056
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:24,646
/ I'm on my way /

1057
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,272
/ I'm takin' my time /

00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:27,607
/ But I don't know where /

1059
00:52:27,649 --> 00:52:31,528
/ Goodbye to Rosie,
the Queen of Corona... /

1060
00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:33,196
Come here.

1061
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:34,697
/ See you, me and Julio /
-That's it! Run!

1062
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:36,533
/ Down by the schoolyard /

1063
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:40,578
/ See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard. /

1064
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:44,749

( giggling )

1067
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:00,723
Whoo-hoo!

1068
00:53:00,765 --> 00:53:02,475
Yippee!

1069
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:06,521
He saved my life, you know.

1070
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:10,191
30 years ago, I was
knifed in a bazaar
in Calcutta.

1071
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:12,861
He carried me
to the hospital on his back.

1072
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:14,028
( chuckling )

1073
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,030
Who stabbed you?

1074
00:53:16,072 --> 00:53:17,198
He did.

1075
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,033
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

1076
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:22,203
and he was a hired assassin.

1077
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:25,665
Stuck me right in the gut
with that. Shoot.

1078
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:27,041
( all yelling )

1079
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,044

1080
00:53:35,758 --> 00:53:37,552
CHAS:
Hey!

1081
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,053
What?

1082
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,056
Where have you been?

1083
00:53:42,098 --> 00:53:44,726
Uh, we just stepped out
to get some air.

1084
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:47,395
What's that?

1085
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:48,563
Holy shit.

1086
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:50,064
That's not...?

1087
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:52,400
What is that?

1088
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:54,903
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

1089
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,237
Come here.

1090
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:57,447
What?

1091
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:03,828
You stay away from my children.

1092
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,163
Do you understand?

1093
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:07,081
My God, I haven't been
in here for years.

1094
00:54:07,123 --> 00:54:08,666
Hey! Are you listening to me!

1095
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:10,210
( yelling ):
Yes, I am!

1096
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:12,795
I think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

1097
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,506
I don't think you recovered

1098
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:15,840
from Rachael's death.

1099
00:54:15,882 --> 00:54:17,383
l...

1100
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:21,387
( door slams )

1101
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:31,064
There you are.

1102
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,777
( chuckling )

1103
00:54:42,742 --> 00:54:45,036
How are you feeling?

1104
00:54:45,078 --> 00:54:46,871
I'm having a ball.

1105
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:50,208
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

1106
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,919
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

1107
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:57,382
I want to thank you
for raising our children

1108
00:54:57,423 --> 00:54:59,384
by the way.

1109
00:54:59,425 --> 00:55:01,553
Okay.

1110
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,805
I'm not kidding.

1111
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,849
You always put them first,
didn't you?

1112
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:07,475
I tried to.

1113
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:10,520
Lately I feel like maybe
I didn't do such a great job.

1114
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,064
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

1115
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:14,983
I'm the one that failed them.

1116
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,985
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

1117
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:18,486
Plus, that-- it doesn't...

1118
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:21,531
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

1119
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,534
Why didn't you care?

1120
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:25,827
I don't know.

1121
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,538
I'm ashamed of myself.

1122
00:55:31,374 --> 00:55:34,002
I'll tell you
one thing, though...

1123
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:37,046
you got more grit, fire and guts

1124
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:40,008
than any woman
I have ever met.

1125
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:42,177
What... what are you
smiling about?

1126
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:43,678
Nothing.

1127
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,180
No, wha... what's so funny?

1128
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:46,347
Nothing.

1129
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:48,850
It's these little
expressions ofyours.

1130
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:51,019
I don't know
what you're talking about

1131
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,396
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

1132
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,859
You're true blue, Ethel.

1133
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,069
You really are.

1134
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:05,825
How's your love life?

1135
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,493
None ofyour business.

1136
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:09,996
( chuckling )

1137
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,502
( hoots )

1138
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:19,005
I'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

1139
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:20,381
ifyou don't mind.

1140
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:24,177
I don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

1141
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,678
Well, I'd agree

1142
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,848
if I thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

1143
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,850
but I don't.

1144
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,938
Well, I hopeyou're right.

1145
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:40,693
Actually, I don't believe
I'll join you tonight.

1146
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:43,696
I'll call you in the morning.

1147
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:52,580
She said that?

1148
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:54,874
( chuckling )

1149
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:57,210
Great.

1150
00:56:57,252 --> 00:57:00,880
Got the sucker on the ropes.

1151
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:03,216
( Royal chuckles softly)

1152
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:19,983
Can I ask you something, Hank?

1153
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:26,656
Okay.

1154
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:30,285
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

1155
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,454
I beg your pardon?

1156
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,456
You heard me, Coltrane.

1157
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,458
Coltrane?

1158
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,169
What?

1159
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,004
Did you just call me "Coltrane"?

1160
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:42,297
No.

1161
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:43,423
You didn't?

1162
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:45,675
No.

1163
00:57:45,717 --> 00:57:47,927
Okay.

1164
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:49,804
( clears throat)

1165
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,514
But if I did...

1166
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:56,144
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

1167
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:57,812
You don't think so?

1168
00:57:57,854 --> 00:57:59,355
No, I don't.

1169
00:57:59,397 --> 00:58:00,648
Listen, Royal

1170
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,317
ifyou think
you can march in here...

1171
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:03,651
You want to talk some jive?

1172
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:05,987
I'll talk some jive.

1173
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:07,655
I'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

1174
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:09,073
-Oh, yeah?
-Right on!

1175
00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:10,658
-Sit down.
-What?!

1176
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,659
Wh-what did you say?

1177
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:12,785
I said sit down, goddamn it!

1178
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:14,579
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!

1179
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:15,705
This is not your house!

1180
00:58:15,747 --> 00:58:17,123
I want your raggedy ass out!

1181
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:18,416
Don't talk semantics with me.

1182
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:19,417
Oh, this is not your...

1183
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:21,211
What's going on here?

1184
00:58:21,252 --> 00:58:23,254
Nothing.

1185
00:58:26,508 --> 00:58:29,052
Mmm.

1186
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:40,605
( whirring and pumping )

1187
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:46,861
( no audio )

1188
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:50,156
Hello, I'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure-- yes--

1189
00:58:50,198 --> 00:58:51,991
at Colby General.

1190
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,494
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

1191
00:58:54,577 --> 00:58:56,538
Hmm...

1192
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,667
Is that a Tic-Tac?

1193
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:04,879
( foreboding organ music plays )

1194
00:59:04,921 --> 00:59:06,381
( knock on door)

1195
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:10,301
( recorded sitar music playing )

1196
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:13,096
How much is he paying you?

1197
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:17,058
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1198
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,853
Well, I grew up with the
Tenenbaum family, you know.

1199
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:20,895
Right.

1200
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,063
Across the street.

1201
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:23,356
Mm-hmm.

1202
00:59:23,398 --> 00:59:25,567
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

1203
00:59:25,608 --> 00:59:27,527
I can't say no.

1204
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:29,237
This is bullshit.

1205
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:30,572
Change it, huh?

1206
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,243
What did you do to your hand?

1207
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:38,204
Uh, nothing.

1208
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:42,458
ROYAL:
Can we get somebody over here

1209
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,669
to kill these mice for us?

1210
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:46,713
No. They belong to Chas.

1211
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:49,424
Or anyway, he invented them.

1212
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:51,885
Well, get him to stick them
in a fucking cage

1213
00:59:51,926 --> 00:59:54,387
or something.

1214
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:57,807
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

1215
00:59:57,849 --> 01:00:00,393
What's cooking, Pops?

1216
01:00:00,435 --> 01:00:02,604
You'll see.

1217
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:03,438
Now, your previous novel...

1218
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:04,772
Yes. Wildcat.

1219
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:05,815
Right.

1220
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,109
Not a success.

1221
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:09,777
Why?

1222
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:18,620
Well, Wildcatwas written
in a kind of obsolete

1223
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:20,622
vernacular...

1224
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,127
( whispers ):
Wildcat...

1225
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:28,796
Wild... cat...

1226
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:33,718
( quietly imitates gunshots )

1227
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,720
Wildcat...

1228
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:38,973
I'm going to go.

1229
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,267
I'm taking this off
and I'm going.

1230
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:42,560
Stepping out.

1231
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:45,438
What the hell
kind of way to act is that?

1232
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,814
ELl:
Open the door.

1233
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:47,941
He's on drugs.

1234
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:51,152
I'll be right back.

1235
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:54,656
James Bradley...

1236
01:00:54,697 --> 01:00:56,533
Hold on a minute, please.

1237
01:00:56,574 --> 01:00:57,784
What's going on?

1238
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,286
Pagoda has something to say.

1239
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:07,460
He has a cancer.

1240
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:09,796
No, he doesn't.

1241
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:11,840
I know what stomach cancer
looks like.

1242
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:13,466
I've seen it.

1243
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,885
And you don't eat

1244
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:19,472
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

1245
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:20,849
The pain is excruciating.

1246
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,809
How would you know?

1247
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:24,811
My wife had it.

1248
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:29,190
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure at Colby General

1249
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:31,317
there is no Colby General.

1250
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:33,903
It closed in 1974.

1251
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:35,488
Aw, shit, man.

1252
01:01:35,572 --> 01:01:37,532
Oh, shit, man.

1253
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:42,370
( Chas grunts )

1254
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:46,457
( dialing rotary phone )

1255
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:49,669
Yes, can you send a taxi

1256
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:51,421
to 111 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

1257
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:52,422
Thank you.

1258
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:53,506
( slams receiver)

1259
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,975
I guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

1260
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:06,311
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

1261
01:02:06,352 --> 01:02:07,896
Of course he was.

1262
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:09,397
No, well, yeah, he was

1263
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,774
but, I mean,
he wasn't thatinvolved.

1264
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:14,611
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

1265
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:17,197
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favor.

1266
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:20,992
I did some malpractice work
for him.

1267
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:23,912
I do have
high blood pressure, though.

1268
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:30,043
Look, I know I'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

1269
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:33,421
But I just want to say,
the last six days have been

1270
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:36,382
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

1271
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:38,760
NARRATOR:
Immediately after
making this statement

1272
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:41,304
Royal realized
that it was true.

1273
01:02:46,851 --> 01:02:49,812
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1274
01:02:49,854 --> 01:02:53,107
What was the point?

1275
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,443
I thought I could win you back.

1276
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:59,405
And then I thought I could
get rid of Henry...

1277
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:02,033
and at least keep
the status quo.

1278
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,743
But we hadn't spoken
n seven years.

1279
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:05,119
I know.

1280
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:08,790
Plus, uh...

1281
01:03:08,831 --> 01:03:11,125
I was broke.

1282
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:14,963
And I got kicked out
of my hotel.

1283
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,799
You're a bastard.

1284
01:03:17,841 --> 01:03:20,510
Good-bye, Royal.

1285
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:36,109
Take it easy
on those boys, Chassie.

1286
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:39,153
I don't want this
to happen to you.

1287
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,332
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

1288
01:03:51,374 --> 01:03:53,334
has had a profound effect
on me.

1289
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:56,337
l-I feel like a different
person, I really do.

1290
01:03:56,337 --> 01:04:00,967
Dad, you were never dying.

1291
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:05,138
But I'm going to live.

1292
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:18,151
He's not your father.

1293
01:04:18,193 --> 01:04:21,029
Neither are you.

1294
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,051
( taxi engine idling )

1295
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,348
( dropping bags )

1296
01:04:53,228 --> 01:04:55,438
You son of a bitch!

1297
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,815
God.... damn...

1298
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,946
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

1299
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:09,744
( groans )

1300
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:16,626
The 375th Street Y, please.

1301
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:20,380
( grunts )

1302
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,227
Everyone's against me.

1303
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:36,229
It's your fault, man.

1304
01:05:36,271 --> 01:05:39,983
Yeah, I know, but damn it,
I want this family to love me.

1305
01:05:40,024 --> 01:05:41,234
How much money you got?

1306
01:05:41,276 --> 01:05:42,569
I don't have.

1307
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,362
What, you're broke?

1308
01:05:44,404 --> 01:05:46,781
You got to be kidding me.

1309
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:48,908
How are we going to pay
for this room?

1310
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,205
All right,
we'll think of something.

1311
01:05:56,165 --> 01:05:57,709
Ow.

1312
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:09,929
( singing quietly)

1313
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:15,101
( sighing )

1314
01:06:15,143 --> 01:06:19,731
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

1315
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:22,358
I didn't know you ever were.

1316
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,027
Let's not make this
any more difficult

1317
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:25,820
than it already is.

1318
01:06:27,906 --> 01:06:30,658
Okay.

1319
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,494
Okay, what?

1320
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:37,498
Okay, I'm not in love
with you, either.

1321
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:41,252
Yes, I know;
you're in love with Richie

1322
01:06:41,294 --> 01:06:43,588
which is sick and gross.

1323
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:51,179
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

1324
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:53,473
and your grades from college?

1325
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:59,521
Please stop belittling me.

1326
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,155
You never gave me
the time of day

1327
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:11,533
till I started getting
good reviews.

1328
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,577
Your reviews aren't that good.

1329
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:16,913
But the sales are.

1330
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:22,252
( shutter clicks )

1331
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,216
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

1332
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:31,261
Very little, I'm afraid.

1333
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:33,221
Would you like
to examine the report?

1334
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:35,723
Yes.

1335
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,734
( driving rock intro )

1336
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:49,112
/ Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt /

1337

/ They both went down to Berlin,
joined the lce Capades /

1338
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:55,743
/ And, oh, I don't know why /

1339
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:58,413
/ Oh, I don't know why /

1340
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:00,874
/ Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah /

1341
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:02,709
/ Perhaps they'll die /

1342
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,710
/ Oh, yeah /

1343
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:06,421
/ Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah /

1344
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:08,756
/ Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah /

1345
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:12,218
/ Second verse,
same as the first /

1346
01:08:12,302 --> 01:08:14,679
/ Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt /

1347
01:08:14,721 --> 01:08:18,641
/ They both went down to Berlin,
joined the lce Capades /

1348
01:08:18,683 --> 01:08:21,603
/ And, oh, I don't know why /

1349
01:08:21,603 --> 01:08:23,813
/ Oh, I don't know why /

1350
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:26,232
/ Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah /

1351
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:27,942
/ Perhaps they'll die /

1352
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,068
/ Oh, yeah /

1353

/ Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah /

/ Third verse,
different from the first /

1357
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,297
/ Jackie is a punk... /

1358
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,264
She smokes.

1359
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:00,266
Yes.

1360
01:09:06,147 --> 01:09:07,315
All right, well.

1361
01:09:07,357 --> 01:09:09,526
Everything seems
to be in order.

1362
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:12,570
I'll contact you
in the next 24 hours.

1363
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:14,072
I appreciate that.

1364
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:17,492
Uh, which way are you leaning,
by the way?

1365
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:18,868
I'll inform you of my decision

1366
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,036
at the appropriate time.

1367
01:09:20,078 --> 01:09:21,454
I get it.

1368
01:09:21,496 --> 01:09:23,873
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word
for us, will you?

1369
01:09:23,915 --> 01:09:25,333
I already did.

1370
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:32,757
You want to play some word games

1371
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,552
or do some experiments
on me or anything?

1372
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:37,595
No.

1373
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:41,558
/ Your hand on his arm /

1374
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:43,726
/ Haystack charm /

1375

/ He's acting dumb /

1379
01:09:54,863 --> 01:09:58,825
/ That's what you've come...
to expect /

/ A reaction to you /

1388
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:35,528
/ You say you know what he did /

1389

/ But you idiot kid /

1390
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:40,241
/ You don't have a clue /

1391
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:41,910
/ Sometimes they just /

1392
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:44,120
/ Get caught in the eye /

1393
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:46,539
/ You're pulling him through /

/ Needle in the hay... /

1396
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:54,881
( whispering ):
I'm going to kill myself
tomorrow.

( acoustic guitar crescendos )

01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:40,927
( tires squealing )

1403
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,392
Dudley, where is he?

1404
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:50,979
Who?

1405
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,150
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

1406
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:58,528
and then I'll come back
to check on him.

1407
01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,904
All right?

1408
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:06,452
How are you feeling?

1409
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:08,162
Fine, thanks.

1410
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:10,623
Are you in any pain?

1411
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:12,000
Not really.

1412
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,334
Why'd you try
to kill yourself?

1413
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:15,003
Don't press him right now.

1414
01:12:15,003 --> 01:12:17,338
I wrote a suicide note.

1415
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:18,756
You did?

1416
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,091
Yeah.

1417
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:23,136
Right after I regained
consciousness.

1418
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:26,806
Can we read it?

1419
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,016
No.

1420
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:31,144
Can you paraphrase it for us?

1421
01:12:31,186 --> 01:12:33,813
I don't think so.

1422
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:35,940
Is it dark?

1423
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:37,358
Of course it's dark.

1424
01:12:37,358 --> 01:12:38,776
It's a suicide note.

1425
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:40,320
All right, that's enough.

1426
01:12:40,361 --> 01:12:42,155
Doctor said to let him sleep.

1427
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,535
What?!

1428
01:12:51,581 --> 01:12:53,541
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?

1429
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,210
Yes. Yes, Royal.

1430
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:09,974
You've made a cuckold of me.

1431
01:13:10,016 --> 01:13:13,144
I know.

1432
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:16,648
Many times over.

1433
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:20,318
I'm sorry.

1434
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,654
And you nearly killed
your poor brother.

1435
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:25,823
ETHELlNE:
What's he talking about?

1436
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:28,493
It doesn't matter.

1437
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:31,663
She's balling Eli Cash.

1438
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,706
ETHELlNE:
Oh, my goodness.

1439
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:39,337
May I have a cigarette?

1440
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:42,507
What?

1441
01:13:42,549 --> 01:13:46,010
Shall I repeat the question?

1442
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:48,179
You don't smoke.

1443
01:13:48,221 --> 01:13:50,223
I know that.

1444
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:55,061
( sighs )

1445
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:04,153
And a light.

1446
01:14:11,786 --> 01:14:13,830
Au revoir.

1447
01:14:23,173 --> 01:14:26,968
ETHELlNE:
How long have you been
a smoker?

1448
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,596
22 years.

1449
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:33,099
Well, I think you should quit.

1450
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:39,647
( door opens )

1451
01:14:42,317 --> 01:14:44,527
How can I help?

1452
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:49,532
Let me look at these forms.

1453
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:04,005
Oh, Henry.

1454
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:13,306
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1455
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:14,474
NURSE:
Your name?

1456
01:15:14,516 --> 01:15:15,642
Royal Tenenbaum.

1457
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:18,811
I'm afraid visiting hours
are over, sir.

1458
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:21,689
Wh-Wh-What does it say there--
they don't want me?

1459
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:22,899
l-I'm sorry.

1460
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:24,317
I have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

1461
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,611
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

1462
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,739
( mumbles )

1463
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:42,335
We could shimmy up
that gutter

1464
01:15:42,377 --> 01:15:44,295
jump over that window ledge

1465
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:47,507
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

1466
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,342
There he is.

1467
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:50,635
Richie!

1468
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:54,389
Richie.

1469
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:59,018
Where's he going?

1470
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:02,730
Richie!

1471
01:16:12,991 --> 01:16:14,576
Well, I have to say

1472
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:17,620
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

1473
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:20,957
Attempted, anyway.

1474
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,500
Thanks.

1475
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:25,461
/ Please /

1476
01:16:25,503 --> 01:16:28,006
/ Give me second grace /

1477
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,887
/ Please /

1478
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,764
/ Give me a second face /

1479
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:43,646
/ I've fallen far down /

1480
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:47,901
/ The first time around /

1481
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:52,322
/ Now I just sit on the ground
in your way /

1482
01:17:00,538 --> 01:17:03,541
( on record player):
/ Now /

1483
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,793
/ If it's time
for recompense /

1484
01:17:05,835 --> 01:17:07,170
/ For what's done... /

1485
01:17:07,212 --> 01:17:09,172
MARGOT:
Who's there?

1486
01:17:09,214 --> 01:17:11,633
/ Come /

1487
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:14,844
/ Come sit down
on the fence in the sun... /

1488
01:17:14,886 --> 01:17:16,304
Hello?

1489
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:21,976
/ And the clouds will roll by /

1490
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:24,687
/ And we'll never deny-- /

1491
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:27,398
( needle lifts from record )

1492
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,442
( tentflap opens )

1493
01:17:32,403 --> 01:17:35,823
W-What are you doing in my tent?

1494
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:39,118
Just listening to some records.

1495
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,871
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

1496
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:44,123
I checked myself out.

1497
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,681
( rock intro playing
on organ )

1498
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:09,607
How many stitches did you get?

1499
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:11,359
I don't know.

1500
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:13,027
You want to see?

1501
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:19,367
/ They seem to stay
for day after day /

1502
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:20,493
/ And won't disappear... /

1503
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:21,744
Jesus.

1504
01:18:21,786 --> 01:18:23,746
/ I tried every way... /

1505
01:18:23,788 --> 01:18:27,792
Richie, that looks horrible.

1506
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:31,462
I heard about your ex-husband.

1507
01:18:31,504 --> 01:18:32,505
Desmond?

1508
01:18:32,547 --> 01:18:33,631
I guess so.

1509
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:35,550
I didn't get his name.

1510
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,885
Yeah.

1511
01:18:36,926 --> 01:18:39,387
I met him in the ocean.

1512
01:18:39,387 --> 01:18:40,597
I was swimming

1513
01:18:40,638 --> 01:18:43,516
and he came out to me
in a canoe.

1514
01:18:43,558 --> 01:18:45,727
We were only married
nine days.

1515
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:47,562
And I heard about Eli.

1516
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:48,855
I know.

1517
01:18:48,897 --> 01:18:53,568
Poor Eli.

1518
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:56,946
Anyway, they mostly
just talked about you.

1519
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:59,741
They did?

1520
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:02,577
Yeah.

1521
01:19:02,577 --> 01:19:07,707
I guess that was the attraction,
ifyou know what I mean.

1522
01:19:07,749 --> 01:19:11,836
/ She smiled sweetly /

1523
01:19:11,878 --> 01:19:14,923
/ She smiled sweetly /

1524
01:19:14,964 --> 01:19:17,342
/ And says don't worry... /

1525
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:19,511
I have to tell you something.

1526
01:19:19,552 --> 01:19:21,513
What's that?

1527
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:24,224
I love you.

1528
01:19:27,894 --> 01:19:31,064
I love you, too.

1529
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:37,612
/ There's no use tryin' /

1530
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:40,198
/ You're here /

1531
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:44,577
/ Begin again /

1532
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:46,955
/ And o'er again /

1533
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:54,045
/ That's what she said
so softly... /

1534
01:19:54,087 --> 01:19:56,714
I can't stop thinking
about you.

1535
01:19:56,756 --> 01:20:00,009
I went away for a year,
and it only got worse

1536
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:02,053
and I don't know
what to do.

1537
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:06,057
Let's lie down for a minute.

1538
01:20:08,518 --> 01:20:10,478
( sighs )

1539
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,564
/ She smiled sweetly /

1540
01:20:12,605 --> 01:20:14,983
/ She smiled sweetly... /

1541
01:20:15,024 --> 01:20:17,193
This is the sleeping bag

1542
01:20:17,235 --> 01:20:20,154
we took to the museum,
isn't it.

1543
01:20:20,196 --> 01:20:23,157
Mm-hmm.

1544
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,493
/ Oh, no, no, no... /

1545
01:20:25,535 --> 01:20:27,495
Why'd you do it?

1546
01:20:27,537 --> 01:20:30,331
Because of me?

1547
01:20:30,373 --> 01:20:33,543
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

1548
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:38,173
( song ends )

1549
01:20:38,214 --> 01:20:42,010
You're not going
to do it again, are you?

1550
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:43,678
I doubt it.

1551
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:48,224
/ Shewould never say /

1552
01:20:48,266 --> 01:20:51,019
/ Where she came from... /

1553
01:20:51,019 --> 01:20:54,564
( crying quietly)

1554
01:20:54,606 --> 01:20:58,109
/ Yesterday don't matter /

1555
01:20:58,151 --> 01:21:00,445
/ If it's gone /

1556
01:21:04,365 --> 01:21:06,326
/ While the sun is bright /

1557
01:21:08,203 --> 01:21:11,164
/ Or in the darkest night /

1558
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:12,999
/ No one knows... /

1559
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:14,876
I think we're just going
to have to be

1560
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:16,544
secretly in love with each other

1561
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:18,129
and leave it at that, Richie.

1562
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:26,387
/ Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday /

1563
01:21:26,429 --> 01:21:31,184
/ Who could hang a name
on you? /

1564
01:21:31,226 --> 01:21:35,688
/ When you change
with every new day /

1565
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:38,733
/ Still I'm gonna miss you... /

1566
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:40,860
Lobby floor.

1567
01:21:40,902 --> 01:21:44,030
( song continues
softly in background )

1568
01:21:44,072 --> 01:21:45,031
Thank you, sir.

1569
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:52,872
Going up?

1570
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:54,207
Yeah.

1571
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:55,542
What floor, sir?

1572
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,544
Doesn't matter.

1573
01:22:05,426 --> 01:22:06,970
So, you're
elevator operators now?

1574
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:08,179
Yeah, just started.

1575
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:10,181
We'll get a bump as soon
as we join the union.

1576
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:11,808
( song fades out)

1577
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,143
What made you decide
to do that?

1578
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,895
We're broke.

1579
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:19,023
But in answer to your question

1580
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:20,108
I wanted to prove

1581
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:21,651
I could pay my dues,
and whatnot.

1582
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:25,196
I just hope
somebody notices.

1583
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:30,827
You asked me
why I choked out there that day.

1584
01:22:30,869 --> 01:22:32,370
I think I may know the answer

1585
01:22:32,412 --> 01:22:33,788
and I wanted your advice.

1586
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:37,250
Sure.

1587
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:46,342
Margot Tenenbaum?

1588
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:47,343
Yeah.

1589
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:49,345
Well, since when?

1590
01:22:49,387 --> 01:22:52,182
Since always.

1591
01:22:52,223 --> 01:22:53,349
Does she know?

1592
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:54,851
Uh-huh.

1593
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:58,188
Well, what does she feel
about that?

1594
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:59,856
I think she feels confused.

1595
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:01,024
Well, I can understand that.

1596
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:02,525
It's probably illegal.

1597
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:03,902
I don't think so.

1598
01:23:03,943 --> 01:23:06,154
We're not related by blood.

1599
01:23:06,154 --> 01:23:07,989
That's true.

1600
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:10,116
Still frowned upon.

1601
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,328
But then, what isn't
these days, right?

1602
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,088
I don't know, maybe it works.

1603
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:25,340
Why not, what the hell.

1604
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,841
You love each other.

1605
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:29,969
Nobody knows
what's going to happen, so...

1606
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,471
You know something.

1607
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,308
Don't listen to me.

1608
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,393
I never understood her myself.

1609
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:39,437
I never understood any of us.

1610
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:41,189
I wish I could tell you
what to do

1611
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:43,358
but I just can't.

1612
01:23:44,526 --> 01:23:46,069
That's okay.

1613
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:49,364
No, it's not.

1614
01:23:49,364 --> 01:23:52,700
You still consider me
your father?

1615
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,329
Sure, I do.

1616
01:23:56,371 --> 01:24:00,208
I wish I had more to offer
in that department.

1617
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:03,211
I know you do, Pop.

1618
01:24:09,008 --> 01:24:11,010
I don't blame you, by the way.

1619
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:13,346
Uh, she's a
great-looking girl

1620
01:24:13,388 --> 01:24:14,806
and smart as a whip.

1621
01:24:14,848 --> 01:24:16,266
Mordecai.

1622
01:24:16,307 --> 01:24:24,148
/ Stephanie says
that she wants to know /

1623
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:28,653
/ Why she's given
half her life /

1624
01:24:28,695 --> 01:24:32,907
/ To people she hates now... /

1625
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:35,159
Holy shit.

1626
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:38,162
You came back.

1627
01:24:38,204 --> 01:24:39,372
Jiminy crickets.

1628
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:42,667
That damn bird must
have radar in its brain.

1629
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:44,002
Is that true, Mordecai?

1630
01:24:44,043 --> 01:24:46,004
l-I'm not so sure
this is Mordecai.

1631
01:24:46,045 --> 01:24:47,172
What do you mean?

1632
01:24:47,213 --> 01:24:48,506
He flew right in here.

1633
01:24:48,548 --> 01:24:50,925
This bird has much more
white feathers on him.

1634
01:24:53,553 --> 01:24:56,764
Oh, the son of a bitch
must be molting.

1635
01:24:56,806 --> 01:24:59,517
Oh. I need your help
with something else.

1636
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:01,227
You got it.
What's the situation?

1637
01:25:01,269 --> 01:25:02,937
Well, um, I think Eli maybe...

1638
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:04,564
Hold it.

1639
01:25:04,606 --> 01:25:07,108
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.

1640
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,443
Let's hit it.

1641
01:25:08,443 --> 01:25:10,570
( shoves lever,
elevator speeds up )

1642
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:13,781
I didn't mean right this second,
but... that's okay.

1643
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:16,451
I don't think it was Ramses.

1644
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:17,869
I believe
it was Tootinkamen.

1645
01:25:17,911 --> 01:25:19,037
Tutankhamen.

1646
01:25:19,078 --> 01:25:20,288
Tutankhamen?

1647
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,497
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1648
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:23,499
( knock at door)

1649
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:26,294
( "Rock the Casbah"
playing in background )

1650
01:25:26,336 --> 01:25:28,505
Yes?

1651
01:25:32,926 --> 01:25:34,886
Hey, Richie.

1652
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:44,729
We want to take you
to get some help.

1653
01:25:46,648 --> 01:25:48,650
Is it just you guys?

1654
01:25:48,691 --> 01:25:50,944
ROYAL:
Would you

1655
01:25:50,985 --> 01:25:52,070
excuse us, please?

1656
01:25:54,531 --> 01:25:56,616
Okay.

1657
01:26:02,997 --> 01:26:05,083
( turns music off)

1658
01:26:05,124 --> 01:26:07,126
Are we still friends?

1659
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:10,129
What do you mean?

1660
01:26:10,171 --> 01:26:11,297
Are we?

1661
01:26:11,339 --> 01:26:12,465
Of course.

1662
01:26:12,507 --> 01:26:14,467
How can you even ask me that?

1663
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:15,885
Well, it doesn't matter.

1664
01:26:15,927 --> 01:26:17,053
It doesn't matter?

1665
01:26:17,095 --> 01:26:18,221
It does matter.

1666
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,723
I heard about you and Margot.

1667
01:26:31,234 --> 01:26:32,527
I'm sorry.

1668
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:33,820
I don't know what to say.

1669
01:26:33,862 --> 01:26:35,822
You don't have to say anything.

1670
01:26:35,864 --> 01:26:40,326
I always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1671
01:26:40,368 --> 01:26:41,870
Me, too.

1672
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:43,037
Me, too.

1673
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:45,331
ELl:
'Cause it doesn't mean

1674
01:26:45,373 --> 01:26:48,168
what it used to though, does it?

1675
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:50,712
I wish he'd done this for me
when I was a kid.

1676
01:26:52,922 --> 01:26:55,300
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

1677
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:59,554
Yeah, but it would've meant
a lot to me.

1678
01:26:59,596 --> 01:27:01,598
Anyway, I'm glad
you're here now.

1679
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:05,143
I recognize
that I have a problem...

1680
01:27:05,185 --> 01:27:08,605
and I want to get better.

1681
01:27:10,732 --> 01:27:12,734
I'll just grab my stuff.

1682
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:24,746
There he goes.

1683
01:27:24,787 --> 01:27:26,080
What?!

1684
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:27,081
There he goes.

1685
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:28,458
Tucker!

1686
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:30,210
Skiddly, skiddly.

1687
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:32,712
( mumbles incoherently)

1688
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:37,091
("Christmas Time is Here"
playing )

1689
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:41,513
/ Christmastime is here /

1690
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:43,932
/ Happiness and cheer... /

1691
01:27:43,973 --> 01:27:47,268
I'd like to order some ice cream
for my daughter, please.

1692
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:48,603
What would you like, Margot?

1693
01:27:48,645 --> 01:27:51,523
Nothing. I told you
I have to go in five minutes.

1694
01:27:51,564 --> 01:27:53,691
Oh.

1695
01:27:54,734 --> 01:27:56,236
( quietsigh )

1696
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:59,072
I'll have a butterscotch sundae,
I guess.

1697
01:28:04,994 --> 01:28:07,747
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

1698
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:10,959
Well, so am l, but I'm not going
to discuss it with you.

1699
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,671
Oh...

1700
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:16,673
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

1701
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:18,007
and try to repair the damage?

1702
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:21,469
l-I mean, I think people want
to hear that.

1703
01:28:21,511 --> 01:28:22,470
Do they?

1704
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:23,471
Mmm.

1705
01:28:23,513 --> 01:28:25,473
You probably don't even know

1706
01:28:25,473 --> 01:28:27,475
my middle name.

1707
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,481
That's a trick question.

1708
01:28:33,523 --> 01:28:34,941
You don't have one.

1709
01:28:34,983 --> 01:28:36,192
Helen.

1710
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:39,279
That was my mother's name.

1711
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,323
I know it was.

1712
01:28:56,337 --> 01:28:58,965
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

1713
01:28:59,007 --> 01:29:00,967
and hitting the cemetery?

1714
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:11,853
( solemn organ music plays )

1715
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:20,320
( Royal whistles )

1716
01:29:22,864 --> 01:29:25,116
I got something for you, Ethel.

1717
01:29:25,158 --> 01:29:26,618
Actually, I made it.

1718
01:29:26,659 --> 01:29:28,036
What's this?

1719
01:29:28,077 --> 01:29:29,370
It's a divorce.

1720
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,164
From you?

1721
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:32,332
Yes.

1722
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:33,499
This is Sanchez.

1723
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:34,667
He's a notary public.

1724
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:35,835
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

1725
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:37,128
You just sign here

1726
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,297
and initial here
and sign there.

1727
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:44,135
You own this building,
don'tyou, Henry?

1728
01:29:44,177 --> 01:29:46,179
Hmm.

1729
01:29:46,221 --> 01:29:48,890
It's magnificent.

1730
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,808
I used to be a homeowner myself

1731
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:53,186
until our son expropriated it
from me.

1732
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:55,563
I got to catch my bus.

1733
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:56,731
Thanks, Sanchez.

1734
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:57,899
You're welcome.

1735
01:29:57,941 --> 01:29:59,901
ETHELlNE:
Are we divorced?

1736
01:29:59,943 --> 01:30:01,069
Almost.

1737
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,404
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

1738
01:30:03,404 --> 01:30:04,781
I love you, Etheline.

1739
01:30:04,822 --> 01:30:07,450
Congratulations to both ofyou.

1740
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:09,452
I didn't think so much
of him at first.

1741
01:30:09,494 --> 01:30:10,703
But now I get it.

1742
01:30:10,745 --> 01:30:12,705
He's everything that I'm not.

1743
01:30:14,874 --> 01:30:16,918
( chuckles )

1744
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,712
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1745
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:21,673
( bus drives off)

1746
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,722
( string quartettuning )

1747
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:34,978
( playing classical music )

1748
01:30:53,413 --> 01:30:54,873
Uh, slightly uneven.

1749
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:56,791
Looks okay. You're just nervous.

1750
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,293
( knocking )

1751
01:30:58,293 --> 01:30:59,794
Henry?

1752
01:30:59,836 --> 01:31:00,920
Hello, Richie.

1753
01:31:00,962 --> 01:31:02,172
Hi.

1754
01:31:02,213 --> 01:31:04,132
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

1755
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:06,968
Hi, Walter. Nice to meet you.

1756
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,261
Nice to meet you.

1757
01:31:08,303 --> 01:31:09,512
Henry's your dad?

1758
01:31:09,554 --> 01:31:11,931
Yes.

1759
01:31:11,973 --> 01:31:13,933
So you've been married before.

1760
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:16,811
Yes. I'm a widower.

1761
01:31:16,853 --> 01:31:18,897
Oh, yeah.

1762
01:31:18,938 --> 01:31:21,441
I forgot.

1763
01:31:23,943 --> 01:31:26,779
You know, I'm a widower myself.

1764
01:31:29,782 --> 01:31:32,493
I know you are, Chas.

1765
01:31:32,493 --> 01:31:35,205
( plastic rattling
againstteeth )

1766
01:31:35,246 --> 01:31:37,540
What are you chewing on?

1767
01:31:37,582 --> 01:31:39,209
My nicotine inhaler.

1768
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,211
It's supposed to help me quit.

1769
01:31:41,252 --> 01:31:43,838
Is it working?

1770
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,799
Not really.

1771
01:31:50,345 --> 01:31:52,138
Well, of course,
I'm half Hebrew

1772
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,682
but the children are
three-quarters Mick Catholic.

1773
01:31:54,724 --> 01:31:56,935
So they were raised
in the church?

1774
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:58,978
I believe so.

1775
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,855
I really don't know.

1776
01:32:00,897 --> 01:32:02,982
( tires squealing )

1777
01:32:03,024 --> 01:32:04,859
( engine roaring )

1778
01:32:10,615 --> 01:32:12,742
Here I come.

1779
01:32:16,204 --> 01:32:17,664
Boys!

1780
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:19,207
( scream and crash )

1781
01:32:19,207 --> 01:32:20,917
What was that?

1782
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,420
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

1783
01:32:24,462 --> 01:32:25,755
Oh, my God.

1784
01:32:36,057 --> 01:32:38,393
Where's my shoe?

1785
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:43,690
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1786
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:45,024
They're okay, Chas.

1787
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:46,359
It's okay. They're safe.

1788
01:32:46,401 --> 01:32:47,819
They're safe.

1789
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:48,987
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

1790
01:32:49,028 --> 01:32:49,988
What?

1791
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:51,739
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.

1792
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:52,907
He saved them.

1793
01:32:52,949 --> 01:32:54,075
Who?

1794
01:32:54,117 --> 01:32:56,119
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

1795
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,162
You did?

1796
01:32:59,497 --> 01:33:01,082
Did I hit anyone?

1797
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:04,043
Is everybody okay?

1798
01:33:11,593 --> 01:33:13,553
Eli!

1799
01:33:13,595 --> 01:33:14,762
What's going on?

1800
01:33:14,804 --> 01:33:16,097
( mumbles )

1801
01:33:21,603 --> 01:33:23,563
( yells )

1802
01:33:23,605 --> 01:33:25,982
CHAS:
Eli!

1803
01:33:26,024 --> 01:33:28,026
What?

1804
01:33:29,277 --> 01:33:30,778
Hey, man.

1805
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,739
You should try this.
It's very tasty.

1806
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,663
( screaming )

1807
01:33:43,041 --> 01:33:45,293
( groaning )

1808
01:33:46,586 --> 01:33:48,588
( groaning )

1809
01:33:51,799 --> 01:33:53,801
( screaming )

1810
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:55,220
ELl:
Tenenbaum!

1811
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:57,430
( gasping )

1812
01:33:57,472 --> 01:33:59,432
Chas?

1813
01:34:09,317 --> 01:34:11,277
( grunts )

1814
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,875
Did I hit the dog?

1815
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:27,919
Yeah.

1816
01:34:30,713 --> 01:34:32,799
Is he dead?

1817
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:34,926
Yeah.

1818
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:40,181
I need help.

1819
01:34:40,223 --> 01:34:43,726
So do l.

1820
01:34:48,731 --> 01:34:51,526
Go around to the other side.

1821
01:34:51,526 --> 01:34:52,944
ROYAL:
You kids stay there.

1822
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:54,070
We'll be right back.

1823
01:34:54,112 --> 01:34:56,114
HENRY:
Yeah.

1824
01:34:57,866 --> 01:34:59,450
Can I say something
to you, Henry?

1825
01:34:59,492 --> 01:35:00,660
Okay.

1826
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:02,328
I've always been considered
an asshole

1827
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:03,830
for about as long
as I can remember.

1828
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:05,248
That's just my style.

1829
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:06,332
But I'd really feel blue

1830
01:35:06,374 --> 01:35:08,501
if I didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

1831
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:11,921
I don't think
you're an asshole, Royal.

1832
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:14,799
I just think you're kind
of a son of a bitch.

1833
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:17,218
Well, I really
appreciate that.

1834
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,512
( sirens approaching )

1835
01:35:19,554 --> 01:35:21,514
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

1836
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:23,516
We've got a couple boys
back there.

1837
01:35:23,558 --> 01:35:25,560
I think you may
have broken an ankle.

1838
01:35:25,602 --> 01:35:28,354
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

1839
01:35:28,396 --> 01:35:30,732
Do you have an alternate?

1840
01:35:30,732 --> 01:35:31,983
No.

1841
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:33,610
Ready?

1842
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:35,570
Are there priests on call?

1843
01:35:35,612 --> 01:35:37,697
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

1844
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:41,075
At which point, I apparently
lost control of the vehicle

1845
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:43,828
smashed it into the house,
and killed that poor dog.

1846
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:45,580
You're Eli Cash.

1847
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,207
Yes indeed, I am.

1848
01:35:47,248 --> 01:35:48,708
I love your work.

1849
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,502
Oh, how sweet ofyou to say.

1850
01:35:50,543 --> 01:35:52,420
DlSPATCHER ( on radio ):
78-35, Code Six.

1851
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,380
105 North Sandler...

1852
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:56,716
ROYAL:
I think he's part mutt.

1853
01:35:56,758 --> 01:36:00,303
What kind of papers
do you have for him?

1854
01:36:00,345 --> 01:36:02,514
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

1855
01:36:02,555 --> 01:36:05,099
Good boy.

1856
01:36:07,685 --> 01:36:10,730
Put this on.

1857
01:36:10,772 --> 01:36:12,774
( laughs )

1858
01:36:12,774 --> 01:36:13,983
What's so funny, Dudley?

1859
01:36:14,025 --> 01:36:15,985
You look great.

1860
01:36:16,027 --> 01:36:17,570
( laughing )

1861
01:36:17,612 --> 01:36:19,239
DUSTY:
Can you see out of it?

1862
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,406
Not really.

1863
01:36:20,448 --> 01:36:22,575
Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage.

1864
01:36:22,617 --> 01:36:24,953
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

1865
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:26,246
( sirens approaching )

1866
01:36:26,287 --> 01:36:27,413
Who do I make it out to?

1867
01:36:27,455 --> 01:36:29,207
Alex? Okay.

1868
01:36:29,249 --> 01:36:30,750
( fire engine horn blasting )

1869
01:36:30,792 --> 01:36:33,169
But these aren't structure-
bearing elements, Dad.

1870
01:36:33,211 --> 01:36:34,629
It doesn't matter.

1871
01:36:34,629 --> 01:36:36,506
It's still best
to file another force majeure

1872
01:36:36,548 --> 01:36:37,882
and recoup the deductible.

1873
01:36:37,924 --> 01:36:39,926
( horn blasting )

1874
01:36:39,968 --> 01:36:43,054
( background radio
communication )

1875
01:36:43,096 --> 01:36:45,348
You boys come up here with me.

1876
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,392
But Buckley's
still under there.

1877
01:36:47,433 --> 01:36:52,397
I know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

1878
01:36:52,438 --> 01:36:54,440
( quietly):
Come on.

1879
01:36:57,944 --> 01:37:00,363
I got you a new dog
for the boys.

1880
01:37:00,405 --> 01:37:02,365
I just bought him.

1881
01:37:02,407 --> 01:37:04,617
You did?

1882
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:06,870
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

1883
01:37:06,911 --> 01:37:08,955
All ofyou.

1884
01:37:08,997 --> 01:37:11,624
I been trying
to make it up to you.

1885
01:37:18,006 --> 01:37:20,091
What's his name?

1886
01:37:20,133 --> 01:37:22,135
Spark Plug.

1887
01:37:25,013 --> 01:37:26,973
Thankyou.

1888
01:37:27,015 --> 01:37:29,100
You'rewelcome.

1889
01:37:31,686 --> 01:37:33,730
I've had a rough year, Dad.

1890
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:36,024
I know you have, Chassie.

1891
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:45,158
Hey.

1892
01:37:57,921 --> 01:37:59,380
( fluttering )

1893
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:00,798
( soft chirping )

1894
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,013
RlCHlE:
See, now he has

1895
01:38:07,055 --> 01:38:08,890
more white feathers
on his neck.

1896
01:38:11,768 --> 01:38:14,229
I wonder
what happened to him?

1897
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:15,813
I don't know.

1898
01:38:15,855 --> 01:38:18,858
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

1899
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,443
their hair turns white.

1900
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,405
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it.

1901
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:44,050
This was one
of my first hiding places.

1902
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:49,848
How old do you think those are?

1903
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,685
I'd say about ten years.

1904
01:38:56,104 --> 01:38:58,106
Come here.

1905
01:39:00,608 --> 01:39:02,569
( soft chirping )

1906
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:25,133
( gentle melody plays
on acoustic guitar)

1907
01:39:32,015 --> 01:39:35,351
NARRATOR:
Royal dug a hole for Buckley
behind the garden shed

1908
01:39:35,393 --> 01:39:37,520
and buried him
in a canvas duffel bag.

1909
01:39:37,562 --> 01:39:38,980
All right, boys.

1910
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,106
Say a prayer.

1911
01:39:40,148 --> 01:39:41,649
Dear Heavenly Father...

1912
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:43,026
I do.

1913
01:39:43,067 --> 01:39:45,820
Etheline and Henry were married

1914
01:39:45,862 --> 01:39:48,323
48 hours later
in judge's chambers.

1915
01:39:48,364 --> 01:39:54,370
Margot's new play was produced
at the Cavendish Theatre.

1916
01:39:54,412 --> 01:39:57,749
This is my adopted daughter,
Elaine Levinson.

1917
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,293
( chuckling )

1918
01:40:00,335 --> 01:40:04,631
It ran forjust under two weeks
and received mixed reviews.

1919
01:40:04,672 --> 01:40:07,926
Yes, can the boy tell time?

1920
01:40:07,967 --> 01:40:09,636
Oh, my Lord, no.

1921
01:40:09,677 --> 01:40:11,221
No. No.

1922
01:40:11,262 --> 01:40:13,389
Raleigh and Dudley
went on a lecture tour

1923
01:40:13,431 --> 01:40:14,474
to 11 universities

1924
01:40:14,516 --> 01:40:16,309
in the promotion
of their new book.

1925
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:20,313
( audience applause )

1926
01:40:20,355 --> 01:40:22,690
Eli checked himself into
a rehabilitation hospital

1927
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,359
in North Dakota.

1928
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:28,821
Oh, hey, this is my sponsor,
Runs With Two Horses.

1929
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:31,533
Wind's blowing up
a gale today.

1930
01:40:31,574 --> 01:40:33,493
This is the grip
that Rod Laver used.

1931
01:40:33,535 --> 01:40:34,994
Are you familiar with Laver?

1932
01:40:35,036 --> 01:40:36,788
Richie started a program

1933
01:40:36,829 --> 01:40:40,667
teaching competitive tennis
to eight-to-12 year olds

1934
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:42,669
at the 375th Street Y.

1935
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:45,380
Game. Change sides.

1936
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:51,594
( hooting, hollering,
and laughing )

1937
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:58,685
Royal had a heart attack
at the age of 68.

1938
01:41:02,605 --> 01:41:04,607
Chas rode with him
in the ambulance

1939
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:07,485
and was the only witness
to his father's death.

1940
01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:13,408
In his will, he stipulated

1941
01:41:13,449 --> 01:41:16,536
that his funeral
take place at dusk.

1942
01:41:30,216 --> 01:41:32,218
( music ends )

1943
01:41:49,652 --> 01:41:53,281
Among the few possessions
he left to his heirs

1944
01:41:53,323 --> 01:41:56,201
was a set
of Encyclopedia Britannica

1945
01:41:56,242 --> 01:41:59,412
in storage
at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

1946
01:41:59,454 --> 01:42:02,457
under the names
Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.

1947
01:42:02,498 --> 01:42:05,126
No one spoke at the funeral

1948
01:42:05,168 --> 01:42:09,923
and Father Petersen's leg
had not yet mended...

1949
01:42:09,964 --> 01:42:11,799
but it was agreed among them

1950
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:14,344
that Royal
would have found the event

1951
01:42:14,385 --> 01:42:16,054
to be most satisfactory.

1952
01:42:19,432 --> 01:42:20,683
Fire!

1953
01:42:23,102 --> 01:42:24,604
Fire!

1954
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:28,483
Fire!

1955
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:32,779
( harpsichord intro
playing over rock beat)

1956
01:42:38,535 --> 01:42:43,122
/ We shall walk again /

1957
01:42:43,164 --> 01:42:47,752
/ All along the lane /

1958
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:52,590
/ Down the avenue /

1959
01:42:52,632 --> 01:42:57,136
/ Just like we used to /

1960
01:42:57,178 --> 01:43:01,766
/ With our heads so high /

1961
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:06,312
/ Smile at passersby /

1962
01:43:06,354 --> 01:43:10,984
/ And we'll softly sigh /

1963
01:43:11,025 --> 01:43:15,446
/ Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi /

1964
01:43:15,488 --> 01:43:19,951
/ Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone /

1965
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:25,999
/ Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone /

1966
01:43:27,709 --> 01:43:32,755
/ By the winding stream /

1967
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:37,218
/ We shall lay and dream /

1968
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:41,806
/ And these dreams come true /

1969
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:46,352
/ If we want them to /

1970
01:43:46,394 --> 01:43:50,899
/ Yes, all will come /

1971
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:55,486
/ Playing pipes and drum /

1972
01:43:55,528 --> 01:43:59,991
/ Sing a happy song /

1973
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:04,412
/ Yeah, we'll sing along /

1974
01:44:04,412 --> 01:44:08,875
/ Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone /

1975
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:14,631
/ Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone /

1976
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:37,278

1977
01:44:47,163 --> 01:44:52,293
/ We shall walk again /

1978
01:44:52,335 --> 01:44:57,131
/ All along down the lane /

/ Down the avenue /

01:45:01,386 --> 01:45:06,224
/ Just like we used to /

1981
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:10,520
/ With our heads so high /

1982
01:45:10,562 --> 01:45:15,149
/ Smile at passersby /

1983
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:19,779
/ And we'll softly sigh /

1984
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:24,075
/ Ai-yi-yi-yi-
yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi /

1985
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:28,705
/ Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone /

1986
01:45:28,746 --> 01:45:34,669
/ Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone /

1987
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:41,342
( scatting )

1988
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:55,064
/ Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah. /

1989
01:46:02,071 --> 01:46:05,533
( gentle acoustic music
continues )
