1
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,900
New York... one of the biggest cities
in the world

2
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,100
Business capital of the world.

3
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,700
Every breath of the city... every
heartbeat is filled with speed

4
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
People are always in a hurry here...

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
in a hurry to leave home... in a hurry
to reach the office...

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,900
always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life

7
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here

8
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,100
Miles away from India, this city
is infested with Indians

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,700
In fact they say every fourth face
in New York is an Indian

10
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,900
One more thing...

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
Oh... by the way that's mel

12
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
This city taught me
to be independent...

13
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
it taught me to fulfill
my responsibilities...

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
taught me to face life...

15
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,500
...but it couldn't teach me to love...

16
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,500
where was the time?

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,100
Whenever I watched the
city from far...

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
I felt Papa was closer

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Whenever I missed him,
I came here

20
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,300
I am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story

21
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,200
I understand Mr. Shah,

22
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,900
but try and understand my problem

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,200
I must have the loan extension, please.

24
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,500
I know the restaurant
is centrally situated.

25
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,200
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...

26
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,900
My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,300
the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her

28
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,200
But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows

29
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
Thank you... l.
- I'm home.

30
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Where were you?

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Central Park

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,100
Central Park? Why?

33
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,200
To meet someone.
- Who?

34
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
To meet my boyfriend...

35
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,200
Bill... bills... bills
Private & confidential.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,200
That's mine.

37
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
What is this?
It's Sweetu's mail again

38
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
When will the mailman understand
that we are Kapur with a 'U'...

39
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
and they are Kapoor with an 'O'?
He always...

40
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,100
Were you crying?

41
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,900
No... you were crying...

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,400
No mom.

43
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,900
My mother and I...
We lied to each other everyday

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Kunwari kudi

45
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
Kunwari kudi marriage bureau,
what's this?

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,900
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
It must some new plan
to find you a groom

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,300
But I don't want to get married...
Why doesn't Dadi leave me alone?

49
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
Why doesn't she just leave?

50
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,700
Mom! Where's she?

51
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,200
It's going to be eight...

52
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

53
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
8 seconds to go.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,600
4,3,2,1... bang.

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,600
My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
One that New York
becomes a part of Punjab

57
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Two, that I marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Saraswatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you with their music for years

59
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,400
But from today Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo...

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Hello! Will serve you.

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So without delay further we are
going to present you a song

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,100
The words are 'Pritam come hither... '

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
The song is specially requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...

64
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
That's very kind of you

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,300
Kammo... Vimmo...

66
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Go Lajjo...

67
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,600
"Pritam, come hither..."

68
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,300
"Pritam, come hither..."

69
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,300
"My sad heart calls out to you..."

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,500
"Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither..."

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,100
Dadi! Stop it.

72
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh God! Interrupted our prayers?

73
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Insulted the goddess?

74
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't you have any shame?

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?

76
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,600
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
What is his first name?
- Pritam...

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,400
And what is this?

79
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,900
What? - This.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Wow! Pictures from Kunwari Kudi!

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
All three of them are so goodlooking

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,700
Three? They look
like the same guy

83
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,800
No, no my child...
they are different

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Now what is that Kunwari kudi ad?

85
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,500
"Hey girl, Hey Girl, hey Girl...
choose your groom and be free"

86
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
"Choose one, two or three"

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one two or three

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
If you don't marry, my child,
how will you have children?

89
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,900
I can have my children.
There's no need to marry

90
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,000
My brother Shiv, a handicap.

91
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,100
He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Shiv, put off the T.V.

94
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Whenever I see,
it's always basketball!

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,900
Just because I can't play
doesn't mean I can't see...

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't get cute with me.
All right. Hurry up.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Gia, help your brother.

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,700
Didi, did you see my new dolls?
- Gia!

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,400
This is Mama, this is you...

100
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,900
this is bhaiyya, this is me and...

101
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,700
Oh, so you are awake...!

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Looking so good...
like Hari Putter...

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Harry Potter, dadi...

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Ya ya... whatever... Hari, Harry...

105
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
What's your schedule today?

107
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,600
Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia

108
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,300
Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own

109
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,000
And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family

110
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,500
Distance was not just
between the two in the family...

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house

112
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
It's so cold! Is the heater on?

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
You are always on, aren't you?

114
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,800
What? - Nothing!

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Will it? - Shut up.

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Bet? - Don't irritate me.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,300
Chicken is just 1 dollar.

118
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,100
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereal

119
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
What? - Cereal...

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Has it started? The serial
Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki...?

121
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,500
Not the TV serial...
the cereal we eat

122
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,300
So what's new?
That we eat everyday

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Poor daughter-in-law... she doesn't
know how to make Indian food

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
Our dear daughter-in-law, Jenny

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,300
Do you know, Naina?

126
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
I saw a lovely dream last night

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
In the dream, I was eating
hot aloo parathas...

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,200
with lots of white butter
Oh... how I missed Chandigarh!

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go away there

130
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,600
What do you think Naina?

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm going nowhere. If I leave,
what will happen to these children?

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm very concerned about them

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
And I'm concerned only about them

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,900
Yes of course... why would
you be concerned about me?

135
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Who am I to you?
If only my son was alive today...

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Only if he was alive...

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Stop it. Just stop it.

138
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,600
Here's your dollar. You won.
As usual, are you happy now?

139
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,000
And both of you... just forget it.

140
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
My morning began
this same way everyday

141
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,500
Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,900
Oh Hi! - One minute.

144
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,700
Okay, make that 2 glaced doughnuts,
2 blue berry muffins.

145
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,800
2 chocolate frappechinos.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,900
And what will you have?

147
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,300
Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor...
Kapoor with two 'o's.

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
My neighbour...
& unfortunately best friend.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,200
She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
and the fact that she
never feels sad about it

151
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,000
Tell, Na...
- One double expresso please.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Here's your letter.
It came again to our house

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,500
Your name had to be J. Kapoor...

154
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,300
Oh wow Naina! Blind date application.
- What application?

155
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a very cool service...
it's very popular in New York

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Just fill in a form describing
the guy of your choice...

157
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
write something about yourself...

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,300
they match the details and bingo,
you get the guy...!

159
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
Wow! And what have you written
about yourself?

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
See Naina, I have written
what's the truth... what is... is

161
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,100
What did you write?

162
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
That from far,
I look like Aishwarya Rai...

163
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
And up close,
like Aishwarya Rai's house

164
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,600
Oh my god!
- Just look at me...

165
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh my god! Just look at him

166
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,300
Look at me. I'm out of control.
- He's so cute.

167
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,400
Sweetu, look at me...
- I see you everyday...

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,200
He's so cute...
- Shut up... shut up.

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
Boys, boys boys...
That's all you are interested in

170
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,500
What will happen?

171
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,000
You will get the boy you want...

172
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,700
you will get married, you will
have his children and then...

173
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,800
he will leave all of you and go away

174
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,500
What will you do then?
What will you do?

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
I will marry again... What else?

176
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Forget it. Just...

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,300
Naina, what Didi says is right...

178
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,500
Babes! You need help.

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
You & your Didi!

180
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Bloody... Eating all our business!

181
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,000
Jazz... Full name Jaswinder Kapoor

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Sweetu's elder sister
and unfortunately...

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Mama's best friend and
restaurant partner

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,100
She had problems too

185
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Youth, that she is desperately
holding on to...

186
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,000
and age that she refuses to accept

187
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh customers!

188
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
3 coffees please.
- Coming up.

189
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
Thanks... mummy.

190
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Look, I said I'm sorry Jenny.

191
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,900
It's okay.
- It's not okay.

192
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
With great difficulty,
we have four or five customers coming in

193
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Thanks to you, if they run away,
what are we going to do?

194
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

195
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,900
You know very well that if we don't
return the loan from the bank...

196
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,400
on time we will have
to leave this place

197
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,500
Then, what are we going to do.
I mean what...

198
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
Oh god! This rain.
I hate this rain.

199
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,400
Opps! Sorry. That's my friend.
I forgot to mention about him

200
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
Meet Rohit Patel.

201
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
Son of Karsanbhai & Sarlabhen Patel.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,700
Karsanbhai was one of the
richest Gujaratis in America

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,600
His food chain was quite popular
in the whole country

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Name: Dial a Dhokla

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Rohit lived alone in New York

206
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,900
As for work, in the last three years
he had made no progress

207
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,800
Hi guys. Have fun.

208
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,700
Yes, Thank you. - Good.

209
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,700
Okay. So, if I can get this file
with this...

210
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
Ah Julia!

211
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,500
Dinner at 8?

212
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Dinner at 8... 8... Dinner

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,600
Dinner at 8 - Yeah.

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,700
All right. I'm going to
pick you up at 7.30.

215
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,400
Poor Rohit... he wasn't as cool
as he thought he was

216
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,900
But...

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,500
He never stopped trying.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
Hey Gorgeous!
- Are you talking to me?

219
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,900
Who else? You think I was talking
to this rhino here?

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My name is Rohit

221
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Don't bother. I'm married
- So what?

222
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
So what if you are married...

223
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,400
...to him

224
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- Put him down.

225
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,500
I don't even like her.
- Put him down.

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Bye, take care.

227
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,900
So that's Rohit Patel.

228
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
How do I know him?
For the last one year...

229
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
I have been studying with him
in the evening MBA classes

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Sorry, I'm late. - Walk.

231
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
What happened? - Nothing
I was coming down in the lift and...

232
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
I understood...
What's the girl's name?

233
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
I don't know.
- Husband hit you or boyfriend?

234
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
Husband... - What was his name?

235
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Hari Prasad Chaurasia...
How do I know? Husband's name...

236
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Oh Rohit... I'm feeling so bad...
- It's ok...

237
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,800
...that he didn't hit you more...
- Thanks.

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
How was your weekend?

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,700
Fantastic! I went to London
and Paris...

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
It shows. Anyway my
weekend was rocking

241
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Laila and I. In the same room...
on the same bed... all weekend

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You know what I mean.
- Oh please.

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh... Ah Laila, stop it. Not there.

244
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,900
Stop it. No. Stop it.

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,200
Listen. Will you

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Laila, no...

247
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,800
Thank God you are not like the
other girls in New York

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You are neither sexy, nor beautiful
and you always have time for me

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I like you. - Thanks Rohit.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,700
Thanks Rohit... if it wasn't
for you, I would have died

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Jerk!

252
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
Gita Patekar, New entry.

253
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Today is her first day. Divorcee,
for God's sake leave her alone

254
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,300
Hi! - Hi!

255
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,800
Please sit - where?

256
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,400
I'd say in my heart... but for now...
right here behind me.

257
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Sick!

258
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,400
DINNER AT 9.

259
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,300
Please don't, okay.

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I wonder what Rohit wrote
in his black diary...

261
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,400
I never asked him about it...

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,900
He is mad

263
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,200
When I met him the first time,
I didn't like him at all

264
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,800
But today, he's my friend...
a very close friend

265
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,600
Basically, he's a nice guy and
this I can vouch for... you know why?

266
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,900
Because that night
he did not cancel his date

267
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,200
To you.

268
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,200
Rohit Patel, I forget about all
my household problems when I meet him.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you all right, my son?
Hope you are not hurt... - Sorry, dadi.

270
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,700
What sorry? Can't you see?
What if my Shiv had got hurt?

271
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,200
What are you doing?
She's just a child...

272
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Child? You have spoilt her

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
It's her duty to
take care of her brother

274
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,400
And yours, to forgive...
not to raise your hand

275
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I haven't been able to forgive you...
so who's she?

276
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Forgive me? What have I done?
- Forget it...

277
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,900
No no... please say...
what wrong have I done?

278
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Listen... Just keep quiet...

279
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,600
The same comment everyday!
Please blurt it out today

280
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,500
Don't make me open my mouth

281
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,100
Why are you scared? Please say...

282
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
It's because of you that my son...

283
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Dadi... Enough!

284
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
The fact that was known all these years
but never spoken about...

285
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,000
was mentioned today

286
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,100
Papa's death was not incidental

287
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,100
He had taken his own life...
he commited suicide

288
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,700
The truth is always bitter.

289
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,500
No one knows the truth.
Not even you

290
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,000
Stop it Gia... stop it...
Don't cry now...

291
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,700
She hates me.
- No darling, she doesn't hates you.

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
She hates you.

293
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,900
Don't say that...

294
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,800
she's angry now...
everything will be alright

295
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,100
When will everything be alright, Mama?

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Do you know, when I was young...

297
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I used to cry over little things.
My mother used to tell me...

298
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,800
that Jesus sends his angel
to all of us to wipe our tears

299
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Angel? - Angel darling, Angel!

300
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,100
Our angel will come...
he will wipe our tears

301
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,500
He will give us lots of happiness...

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
and will leave our sorrow
somewhere far away

303
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
When will our angel come?

304
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,400
Let's do one thing

305
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Today, in our prayers let's ask
Jesus for our angel... OK?

306
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Dear god, if you're listening.

307
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,500
Please bring some light into
these dark times... A little light...

308
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,800
And suddenly the season changed...

309
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,800
no one knows how, but moving
aside the gloomy clouds...

310
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
the sun smiled on all of us

311
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,300
Come on, he's open... He's open.
Come on.

312
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,000
What are you doing guys?

313
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
Want to come & teach me, you shit.

314
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,300
If I could play,
I'd surely have played

315
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,400
Hello boy, Hello girl, Hello doll.

316
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

317
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No, I'm sorry.
I'm Aman... Hello.

318
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,800
Mama has said not to talk to...
str... str... stranglers...

319
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Not stranglers, silly... Strangers

320
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,100
But I'm not a stranger.
I live in that opposite house

321
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,500
Wrong. That stupid Chadda uncle
lives there

322
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,800
I know... That's my uncle

323
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,500
You made a Boo boo.

324
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,200
Yes, he made a boo boo. It's okay.

325
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I know he's a little stupid...

326
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,400
and I have also heard that he has
something on with a silly old hag here

327
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,300
That's our grandmother

328
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
Oops! I made a - Boo Boo

329
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,700
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
By the way, what's
your grandmother's name?

331
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Grandmother! - What a nice name!

332
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,900
Listen to us poor... and God will
hear your prayers

333
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,500
Oh wow! What's this?
Beggars in New York?

334
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Those are not beggars...
That's our grandmother!

335
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,200
Oh! I'm sorry for you.
I'll do something about it

336
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Best of luck.

337
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,600
"Listen to us poor... and God will
hear your prayers"

338
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,300
"You give us a dollar and
He will give you ten lakhs"

339
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Grandma! Grandma!

340
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Oh Lajjoji...
He has heard our prayers!

341
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,200
Who? - He...

342
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Grandma! Oh Grandma...

343
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,300
Jennifer Lopez!

344
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,000
Spice Girls... here... here...

345
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,500
What's the matter? We were
praying to Goddess Saraswati!

346
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,300
You were not praying to Saraswati...
you were torturing her!

347
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
Now... Saraswati can't come here

348
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,600
herself so on her behalf I beg you...

349
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Please don't sing!

350
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,000
What?

351
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,500
What do you mean 'what'?

352
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Just look at them... these young
children who are playing here...

353
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
it will have such a bad effect on them

354
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,300
They will lose faith in music!

355
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,500
And who are you to say
all these things to us?

356
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm sorry I forgot
to introduce myself...

357
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,700
I'm Aman Mathur,
your new neighbour...

358
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,000
and Chaddaji's nephew

359
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,300
Chadda's nephew?

360
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,000
Lajjoji... Don't mind.
My nephew is a bit mischevious!

361
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
Hmmm... Chadda and
Lajjo's love story...

362
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
doesn't care about age
and blooms in glory...

363
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
She's quite sexy!

364
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
Chadda! - Lajjo.

365
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,100
Lajjoji... don't shout
so much at this age

366
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,700
If you do, it's straight...

367
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If you guys are so fond of singing,
I will come and teach you

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
Tell me... When do I play you guys...?

369
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Chadda! He doesn't even know
how to speak

370
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,400
What's happening here? What's this
noise so early in the morning!

371
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,400
Specsy!

372
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,300
He comes to our locality
and stops us from singing?

373
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,400
We were singing so well and he says
we don't know how to sing...

374
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,500
He must be that Chadda's relative...
- Let's speak to him...

375
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,900
"I saw someone moments ago..."

376
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,900
"who is that girl?"

377
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,200
"The more I look at her..."

378
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
"the more I wonder..."

379
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,900
"what may I say to her?"

380
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,900
Hit it.

381
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,100
"I saw someone moments ago..."

382
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,000
"who is that girl?"

383
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,400
"Is she a bud...? Is she a ray...?"

384
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,200
"Or is she part of a legend?"

385
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,700
"The more I look at her,
the more I wonder..."

386
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,000
"what may I say to her?"

387
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,900
"Pretty Woman..."

388
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,700
"Look... Pretty Woman"

389
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,300
"Say with me... Pretty Woman"

390
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,500
"Ya Pretty Woman!"

391
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,800
"Listen up, girl...
you're feeling this way"

392
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,400
"Don't you see the sunshine
coming up today?"

393
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
"You got to feel it right,
just like day after night"

394
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,000
"Don't let the sunshine
out of your sight"

395
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,600
"I can feel you..."

396
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,500
"I'm crazy about you.
Pretty Woman"

397
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,300
"The colour of gold..."

398
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
"the colour of crystal..."

399
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,500
"the sight leaves me breathless...
I'm amazed"

400
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,100
"What trait is this...?"

401
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,500
"Why're there so much of pride...?"

402
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,300
"What secret is it...?
How will I say it"

403
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
"Happy in a moment and angry too..."

404
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
"she changes colours every moment"

405
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,800
"But when I look at her,
I find her oh so beautiful"

406
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,000
"The more I look at her..."
"the more I wonder..."

407
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
"what may I say to her?"

408
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
"Pretty Woman..."

409
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
"Go for it!"

410
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,900
"Her eyes hold an intoxication..."

411
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,700
"Her tresses are ike the clouds..."

412
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,200
"such trait, O lovely one,
I had never seen"

413
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,400
"I see this fairy..."

414
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,200
"it brings my heart alive..."

415
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,900
"isn't this a spell being a cast?"

416
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,100
"I know not her name,
nor where she lives..."

417
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,400
"but this much I surely know"

418
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,700
"The one she casts a look at
will surely go crazy"

419
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
"The more I look at her
the more I wonder..."

420
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,600
"what may I say to her?"

421
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,600
"Pretty Woman..."

422
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,000
"Look... Pretty Woman"

423
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,300
"Say with me... Pretty Woman"

424
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,000
Gia!

425
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Sorry... sorry.

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Hello! Hi, I'm Aman.

427
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,900
I know. Everyone heard it this morning

428
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,300
I never knew that
Chaddasaab had a nephew!

429
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,100
Even I didn't know that my uncle's
neighbours are so beautiful! - What?

430
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
I was talking about your mother!

431
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Jennifer right!

432
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,600
Jennifer you're very very very beautiful.
- Thank you.

433
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Let me say this.

434
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,700
This is shiv, Basket ball champ.

435
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,100
And this is my sweet heart Gia.

436
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,600
And you're...
- Not interested.

437
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,500
That shows on your face

438
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,100
Anyway, It's very to nice meet
the rest of you.

439
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,800
Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you.

440
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Do you know Aman?

441
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,200
I saw so much colour together in
our street for the first time today?

442
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,100
I know. It's a boring sort of a street.

443
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,500
But don't worry. Now that I am here...

444
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,700
Just see what happens in future!

445
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,900
You must have come here
on important business

446
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,900
No, not at all.
Just to get married! - Really!

447
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,800
Jennifer, I want to marry your daughter!
- What?

448
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,100
Do you mind?
I'm talking to Gia.

449
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,100
Gia, my sweet heart
will you marry me?

450
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,900
Yeah... please... - No... no.

451
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,400
Doesn't matter...

452
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,600
Just one thing... is she in
a bad mood or was she born this way?

453
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
She has always been like this
- Don't say like that.

454
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,300
Please don't mind her.
- No... no, not at all.

455
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
This is a childhood problem.

456
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,300
Anyway, lovely to meet you all.

457
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,200
I will see you guys at about 7 or 8...

458
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,900
7 or 8? - For dinner

459
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,400
At your place...
I'm your new neighbour

460
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,500
Obviously you will invite us to
show your hospitality... won't you?

461
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,100
Okay.

462
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,800
Okay... okay... okay.

463
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,400
Actually not 7... at 8...
I'm a bit busy...

464
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
and after I go she will be
angry with you.

465
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,900
...for inviting me to dinner

466
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,700
But don't worry...
it's a childhood problem

467
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,200
She won't say any such thing

468
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,100
Where was the need
to invite him for dinner?

469
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,300
Yes... What was the need?

470
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,600
One minute weren't you there?

471
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
I did not invite him...
he invited himself

472
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,000
I tell you Lajjoji...
Our Mrs. Sharma was telling me...

473
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,300
Who? - From Kunwari Kudi...

474
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,000
She was saying that

475
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,100
these young goodlooking
boys come from India...

476
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
and take our girls for a ride...

477
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,300
Ride? For what?

478
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
For a card... - Ya... ration card

479
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Oh Shut up. For a Green card...
what else?

480
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,400
Lord! Did you hear that?

481
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,600
Lord, please protect us

482
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,500
Oh forget it aunty.
It's just one guy...

483
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I can handle an entire army

484
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm inviting Sweetu
and Rohit for dinner

485
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,300
Rohit? A boy! - Is he single?

486
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,000
He's a boy... he's single
and he is Gujarati

487
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,500
Gujarati! - They are vegetarians

488
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Relax dadi.

489
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,300
He's a close friend.
Just like Sweetu. - Sweetu?

490
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,200
What? I was getting ready
for my blind date!

491
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,500
Blind date? - Oh! A date with a blind boy

492
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
No wonder she has
blindfolded herself!

493
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,000
Blind date means a date with
a boy who has never seen me

494
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,800
And when he sees, he will
be blinded with shock

495
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,700
How rude is that?

496
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,800
Anyway Naina, I can't come
tonight bye all.

497
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,500
Bye ball make your call.

498
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm coming... Wait for me.

499
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
Hey Naina. - Hey Rohit.

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,600
What's up?

501
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
What are you doing?
- Nothing... I'm with Gita.

502
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,700
Gita. - Yeah you remember Gita.

503
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,200
Exchange student from our class.

504
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,700
She lives in Soho
with two other girls

505
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,200
Two other girls?

506
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,000
You have got a bonus! - Well.

507
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Yes. - You please come home
for dinner tonight

508
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
What dinner!

509
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,700
Yes... Mom has invited some
stupid neighbours for dinner...

510
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
so even you come

511
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,800
What time? - 8 o clock...

512
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,100
8 p.m.? Such a short notice
for Kunwari Kudi?

513
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,200
Sorry Mrs. Sharma

514
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,300
but the honour of my family now
lies in your hands

515
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,400
You have really put me
in a tight spot

516
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:24,900
Sardar! Sardar!

517
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,100
And yes... the boy should be
a Sardar, please

518
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Enter this. They want a Sardar boy

519
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,700
Should I go then? - Oh Shut up

520
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,000
All you think of is your marriage sorry,

521
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,000
Please tell me the address...

522
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
Where were you?
You took so much time

523
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Go and ask supermarket.

524
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,900
Naina's come home...

525
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,200
Let me help, close the door darling.

526
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,700
Not so much... it's too much...

527
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,900
I said I'd do it, Jenny...

528
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Thank you. - What's the need...?

529
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,400
What have I done? I'm just
impressing my mother-in-law

530
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
What do you say?

531
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,700
You're very sweet.
- You're also very sweet.

532
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,700
I know her

533
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,800
I forgot to tell you...
Rohit had called

534
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
He said he would be
15 to 20 minutes late

535
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,900
Sweet boy. Boy friend. - Friend!

536
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,300
Mom... I need to speak
to you privately

537
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,400
Gia... Go out!

538
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Now what is it?

539
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,300
Mom. - What are you doing Naina?

540
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,100
This Aman... - Aman's mother...

541
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Hello aunty! - Hello. - Hello uncle.

542
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Can't see Lajjoji anywhere

543
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Yes... sometimes we are lucky

544
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,900
So funny.

545
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Is it our house or theirs?
- Mine

546
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,100
See I've got a new T. Shirt.

547
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,000
Wow! Who gave it? - Aman!

548
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,300
Mr. Mathur - Yeah darling.

549
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,100
Don't call me darling.

550
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Then call me Aman.

551
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,600
Is something less? - Salt!

552
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Even you have the same problem

553
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Why are you following me?

554
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Don't you have anything to do?

555
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,000
The restaurant accounts
are so bad...

556
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,700
How's it so bad?

557
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,300
How dare you, it's
my private affair.

558
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,000
Let me look.

559
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm sorry my son is
really mad.

560
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
I'm really sorry child.
- It's okay.

561
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,200
What is this?

562
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
When will you change your
childhood habits?

563
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,800
One slap... in the childhood
should have helped

564
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,800
Tell me.

565
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
Lajjoji... this pink
really suits you

566
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Your blue is not so bad either!

567
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Mr. Blue... Ms. Pink...
the dinner is ready

568
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,000
I can see that...

569
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,200
Indian Food! I'm sure Jenny hasn't made it

570
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,600
Aman helped a lot!

571
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,700
Congratulations on getting
a new servant!

572
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,100
Congratulations on getting
a new son-in-law!

573
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Keep the change.

574
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Your father must be a waiter!
Waiter, where's the party?

575
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,200
Excuse me, I'm looking
for No.29 - 27.

576
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Oh my darling son...

577
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,400
you must eat all the Indian food
that's cooked today...

578
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,900
you have become white eating
that silly bread everyday

579
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,500
Have rice.

580
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,900
He looks so good my son.
Just like Rakesh Roshan

581
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,700
Hrithik Roshan, stop it dadi.

582
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,300
Stop it sister... stop it.

583
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,900
I'm seeing it for the first time
in New York...

584
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
had seen it once in Bombay...
- What?

585
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,200
BEST bus. There comes your blind date
I'll get it.

586
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,100
It's Rohit... - I'll get it...

587
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Dadi... - I said I'll get it

588
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,200
O hello. - Hello!

589
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,900
You?

590
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,500
Yes... me

591
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,000
Have you come from the bureau? - Yes

592
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
But I asked for a
Sardar on the phone

593
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,900
And I'd said 'young' on the form

594
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,200
It's not me... lt's my granddaughter

595
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Sweetu... he is here

596
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,400
Oh! You call her Sweetu at home?

597
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,700
Come on...

598
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,400
No no... My name's Guru
- Come... my son

599
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,200
Mrs Kapoor... - Miss Kapoor.

600
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
"Come into my arms..."

601
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Music. - "come into my arms..."

602
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,600
You look like you are
Sweetu's sister

603
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I am Sweetu's sister,
silly boy. - What?

604
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,100
What's the matter? Our guest
is our God... Just sit down

605
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,600
You naughty, you never told us that
Rohit is so handsome

606
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,600
You are Rohit.

607
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,600
Who did you call Rohit?
Who's Rohit?

608
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,500
What is this Rohit business...?
His name is...

609
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,900
Guru Guru Guru...
C'mon, get started

610
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Who is Guru? - You 'Guru'...

611
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Forget it... Tell me where
do you live...?

612
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,700
I live in Jackson heights
First I had my den in Mumbai...

613
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,000
I left Mumbai and took an
entry into US... What say?

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Absolutely fit bhai! Wanna have
chicken? Naina's made it.

615
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
Who's Naina? - That one...
Specsy

616
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,700
Who else lives in your
house? - Where? - Home?

617
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,300
At home... there's mummy,
I and Master...

618
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,700
You mean your father...?
- Master is a dog!

619
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,600
Never say such things
about your father!

620
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Long nose.

621
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
What do you do?

622
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Video Pirate! - Pilot?

623
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Piracy... Long live video piracy

624
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,500
You mean crime... theft

625
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
E... Specsy... Don't call me a thief...
Who did you call a thief?

626
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,500
Don't you get scared, my son?

627
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
What's to get scared? Big brothers...
they handle everything

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,900
Brothers? How many
brothers do you have?

629
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,500
Brothers... Four but one
has been sent up there

630
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,800
Up there? You mean even
he's a pilot?

631
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Up there meaning... - Oh! I'm so sorry...
How sad! - It is okay.

632
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
What happened?

633
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,900
Mummy, Papa... live in Connecticut
...- Connecticut.

634
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,800
...and I'm alone in Manhattan... - Manhattan.

635
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,700
You speak too much

636
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,800
Just look into my eyes...
what do you see?

637
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,200
Bathroom.

638
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,700
The bathroom is over there. - Where?

639
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,600
There! - It is okay.

640
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,500
It's okay... Everything will
be alright...

641
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,900
The mother's slightly mad but
everything will be alright

642
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Why are you guys shouting?

643
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,900
E... Mummy...

644
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,800
You old hag! I'm running out of here...

645
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
This doesn't work for me.
And this specsy...

646
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
She's like cactus... thorny...
What Sweetu is she man?

647
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,500
You are Sweetu?
- Who are you?

648
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,600
You are mine!

649
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
Look, I have come
to the wrong house...

650
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,900
I came to meet Naina...
I will take leave... - Please

651
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,100
Please don't go...
I'm going...

652
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,100
if you need any DVDs or video tapes
You must come to my shop...

653
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,900
You'll come, won't you? - Yes!

654
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,800
Please don't go... Please...

655
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Let me go... For God's sake,
let me go!

656
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
You! - Are you alright?

657
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Are you alright... I'm fine

658
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,700
Those guys are lunatics!

659
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,700
I will call you later.
- I will also call you later.

660
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Run... run...

661
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,900
We don't want to go there.

662
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,100
You are laughing?
I don't believe this.

663
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,800
Normal people find
such situations funny

664
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Are you trying to say
I'm not normal?

665
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,300
If you are normal...
then I'm Sridevi

666
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,100
Well. According to me.
You are not normal

667
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
Since morning, you have been behaving
like you have known us for years

668
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,000
Not years, darling...
For eons

669
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
In fact, I feel our bond is
from several past lifetimes

670
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,500
Listen... You are our neighbor
so please behave like one

671
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,600
Open the door... May I please
borrow half a cup of milk?

672
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,800
What are you doing?

673
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,700
Didn't you just say that I should
behave like a neighbour?

674
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,600
So may I have half a cup of milk?

675
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,800
So funny.

676
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,500
See... please take this
happy-go-lucky nature...

677
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,000
and knock on someone else's door

678
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,800
And we're genuinely
not interested.

679
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,600
What happened?
- What's your problem?

680
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,800
Problem? - Yes... why do you feel...
that the entire weight of the world

681
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
is on your delicate shoulders?

682
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Who are you?

683
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,100
Don't...

684
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,500
What's the point of
praying to God...

685
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
when you don't know how to value
the life he has given?

686
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,100
What do you know
about my life anyway?

687
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Not much, but enough to say...

688
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,900
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much

689
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
But look at your life
through someone else's eyes...

690
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,400
and you'll know you have a lot!
- Now I have to hear a lecture

691
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,500
Listen... Live... be happy...
Smile... Who knows?

692
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,700
Tomorrow may not be...

693
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
What a thought.

694
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,000
Tomorrow may not be...
Oh, It is too good.

695
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,900
Anyway, I will teach you to smile

696
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,000
It is a simple 3 parts process.

697
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Try...

698
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,500
Try... - Don't touch me.

699
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
God... the poor thing has
forgotten how to smile

700
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,200
Just keep practicing
and it will come back

701
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,200
Your problem is that you think...

702
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,900
I know! I am very sexy.

703
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:54,400
But you are not my type
For now, just practise

704
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,700
Forget it. I am sorry.

705
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,200
I kept thinking the whole night...
was that idiotic Aman right?

706
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,400
Had I really forgotten to smile?

707
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,000
Of course she smile
The last time she smiled when... Uh

708
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
Now she will smile
only during her wedding!

709
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,300
Uh... uh...

710
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,100
Whenever she was with her
father, she smiled...

711
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,800
Uh... uh...

712
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,700
When the big brother threatens her...
that's when she will smile

713
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,900
What a beautiful smile!

714
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,100
Whose? - Priya... Who else?

715
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,200
The photograph was taken
at the wedding...

716
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,200
where did you find it?

717
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,200
It was lying in this file

718
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,900
I spoke to Priya this morning

719
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
She said you are meeting her today?

720
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,300
I was just leaving to go there...

721
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,400
Should I come with you?
- What will you do there?

722
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,300
In any case, I want to speak
to Priya in private...

723
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:06,100
Aren't you scared? - I'm not scared

724
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,900
You keep worrying unnecessarily.
There's nothing to worry

725
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,100
Everything will be alright...

726
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,100
everything will be alright...

727
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,800
Nothing will be alright...

728
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,400
till you lose weight
you are going to get no boy

729
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,300
But I'm trying Naina...
- I can see that

730
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,500
Wow! He is so cute, Naina.

731
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,700
He looks cute to you?
- You don't find any guy cute!

732
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,100
That is not true.
- I can't hear anything...

733
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,800
You were listening
to our conversation?

734
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,500
I wasn't listening...
I was trying to listen

735
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,300
If you speak so softly
how do you expect me to listen?

736
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,500
Excuse me, move... move...

737
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,600
We didn't meet that day...

738
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm Ms. Square's new neighbour
...Aman

739
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,700
I'm Ms. Square's old
neighbour, Sweetu

740
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Shut up. We were talking.
- Now we are talking

741
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,400
Look Sweetu... Any guy who looks
at your figure and loves you...

742
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,200
...will be blind!
...will be wrong. Ignore her.

743
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,700
He should look into your
heart deeply... - You're right.

744
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,400
I am always right.

745
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,900
Tell me something... ls there a guy
here whom you like?

746
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,700
That one.

747
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
His name is Ramdayal?
You know him?

748
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,500
No... but he looks the Ramdayal type

749
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah. Calling me?
- I am talking to you, Ramdayal.

750
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,600
Name's Frankie

751
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Frankie Ramdayal

752
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,200
This girlfriend of mine
wants to leave me for you...

753
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,900
she says you are cool, sexy...

754
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,800
she says your hairstyle is wow!

755
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,500
What do I do Sweetu,
If I've not seen 'Dil Chahta Hai'?

756
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,400
So what if I don't know
much about hairstyles?

757
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,900
Are you going to leave me for this...
this shriveled mango?

758
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,200
What? - Sorry, Ramdayal.

759
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,000
How would you feel if I left you
for this... specsy?

760
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,000
You are a lucky dog, Ramdayal.

761
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,100
Go Sweetu... Go live your life...

762
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,100
be happy... be prosperous...
be happy with Ramu...

763
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,900
Is he coming?

764
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Come on... come on...

765
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Hi! Franky here.
- Hi! I'm Jaspreet.

766
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,500
Jas... what?

767
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,700
Sweetu. - Sweetu, sweet name.

768
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,100
I DJ at Club Nirvana.
Tonight's the retro night

769
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,900
Why don't you guys come along?
And get your mummy along

770
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,700
You take care, man.
Everything will be alright

771
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,600
How did you like my performance?

772
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,300
You are jealous because
now Sweetu has a boyfriend...

773
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,400
and you don't, Mummy!
- I do... I have a boyfriend!

774
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,800
You do?
- You do? Who's he?

775
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,900
Rohit!

776
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,300
But you said Rohit
was just a friend

777
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,800
I said that because I don't talk
about my personal life to everyone

778
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,900
But you should have told me

779
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,500
Oh! Sweetu, don't mind.
We'll go to the disco... and there

780
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,600
you won't have Ms. Square, Mummy!

781
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,800
Of course Rohit and I will come!

782
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,500
Of course we won't go!

783
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,700
But why? - I said no!

784
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,300
Rohit!

785
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,900
Gita is coming home for dinner

786
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,100
You can do all this but you
can't come for dinner with me?

787
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Naina, try to understand.

788
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,300
Gita says she likes me...
- Why won't she say that?

789
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,600
After all she's found
a father for her kids...

790
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,500
Liar! - So she's a liar...
and you?

791
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,800
I spoke lies because that
stupid Aman irritates me a lot

792
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,000
He just met you yesterday...
How can he irritate you so much?

793
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,300
Do you know what he was saying? - What?

794
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,800
You won't believe it.

795
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,700
That I don't laugh...
I don't know how to smile...

796
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,700
that I don't have a life...
That I don't know how to live...

797
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,200
Naina... all that is true

798
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,800
I know, But why should
I hear it from him?

799
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,100
2 cream bagels... - Low fat.

800
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I want to show him that even
I can have a boyfriend...

801
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,700
who's cool, handsome and sexy...
- What did you say?

802
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,700
How much? - 3 dollars.

803
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,400
Before that... - Before what?

804
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,200
Before how much? - Just a second lady.
- Oh that...

805
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,400
That you are handsome,
cool and sexy...

806
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,300
You mean that? Do you really
think I'm sexy?

807
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
You are right! Just for that
stupid Aman we don't have to...

808
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,600
No... No... Let's do it.
- Let's do what?

809
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,100
Me boy friend.
You girl friend.

810
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,700
What about Gita?
- Who's Gita?

811
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,700
So we'll meet this evening at Nirvana

812
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,900
Yeah! What do you guys say?
- Having fun.

813
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,900
Sweetu! - I'm going to the DJ cabin.
You want to come here?

814
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,800
Yeah sure.

815
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Aman, he called me Babe.
I love you Aman.

816
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,300
Now, go & love him.

817
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,600
By the way, where did you two meet?

818
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,400
In the park... - Park?

819
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,200
In the park?

820
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
But I thought you two studied
together in the MBA classes?

821
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,900
So what? Can't we meet in the park?

822
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,400
Of course you can meet... but what
were you doing in the park?

823
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Very good question.

824
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,300
I had taken my doggy for a walk...

825
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,100
and she had taken her doggy for a walk...

826
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
That's strange.

827
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,800
But Naina doesn't have a doggy

828
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,400
Yes. - No.

829
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,300
I had taken my neighbour's doggy
for a walk

830
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,300
That's stranger.

831
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,400
I'm your neighbour.
And I don't have a doggy

832
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,100
Naina, you silly silly girl
you're forgetting.

833
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,500
...you took my doggy for a walk that day...

834
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
Rohit, you silly silly boy.

835
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,000
If she took your doggy for a walk

836
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,900
Then whose doggy did you
take for a walk?

837
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
I have two doggies

838
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
In fact, I have a lot
of doggies in my house

839
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,100
In fact, at times even
I look like a doggie

840
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
And then we met
at a friend's house

841
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,100
What's your friend's name?

842
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,900
Gita! - Gita?

843
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,800
That same Gita with
two filthy children

844
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,500
Hello Gita, hi.

845
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,000
Rohit... what are you doing here?

846
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,600
Didn't you say that you were
going out with your family? - Yes, yes.

847
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,300
Meet my mummy and papa.

848
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,300
He's a funny man.

849
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,500
Gita, my child!

850
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
I just got to know that their

851
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,000
love story was born in your house
- My house?

852
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you the same Gita
who has two filthy children?

853
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Filthy children?

854
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,200
How dare you?
- Are you mad? Little Angel.

855
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,000
Stop...

856
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,300
You didn't even tell me
you had a girl friend.

857
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,800
I didn't know it myself...

858
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,500
She's not my girl friend.

859
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,200
Rohit, I'm confused...
what's going on?

860
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,900
Ask her!

861
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,900
Naina... What's going on?
I'm very confused ya.

862
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,500
You just shut up.

863
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,200
You knew all along that

864
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,700
Rohit and I are not boyfriend-girlfriend

865
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Then why did you act? - Was I acting
or were you? - It's you.

866
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,900
It's all because of you...

867
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,500
Didn't you say 'laugh, sing, smile...?

868
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,300
I didn't say he he he...
I said EEEEEEEEEEE

869
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,700
Oh, please just keep quiet.

870
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,700
What do you think?

871
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,700
Coming here, dancing, singing
and drinking... means living life?

872
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,500
Well... anyone can do it
But I don't want to do it...

873
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,400
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bloody bore.

874
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,700
You're a cute boy.

875
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,700
Tell me about Gita, she's very hot ah?
- She's very hot man.

876
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,000
She has two children.
- Hey, you mad...

877
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,000
Nice, come on.

878
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,400
Yeah, come on, go ahead.

879
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,800
Come on...

880
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,200
Hey you nude... get down...

881
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,000
Hey babie, I'm talking to you.

882
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,800
Get down you scum...

883
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
Hey, stop this music.

884
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,100
She's taking her clothes off, man...

885
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,900
That doesn't matter.
Everyone here is nude anyway

886
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,100
Come on, Naina...

887
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,200
"Mine is a crazy heart..."

888
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,600
"what has it to fear...?"

889
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,600
"When I sway to the beat..."

890
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,300
"what have I to feel
shy or hesitate about?"

891
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,000
"Let's dance, let's sing..."

892
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
"let's say together..."

893
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:40,200
"it's the time to disco"

894
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,200
"There's no saying
whom you might find"

895
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,100
"Mine is a crazy heart..."

896
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,600
"what has it to fear...?"

897
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,300
"When I sway to the beat..."

898
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,300
"what have I to feel
shy or hesitate about?"

899
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,500
"Let's dance, let's sing..."

900
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,300
"and let's say together..."

901
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,600
"it's the time to disco"

902
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,400
"Whom might you come up against...?"

903
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,400
"Bodies gyrate to the pulsating beat..."

904
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,300
"hearts being carried away
in the storm..."

905
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,900
"that's our state...
we're drowned in merriment"

906
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,500
"Lose yourself,
make merry..."

907
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,900
"say to the one
who provokes you..."

908
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:29,900
"it's the time to disco"

909
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,300
"Say it to everyone you meet..."

910
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
"it's the time to disco"

911
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,300
"This colourful evening,
dancing to the spirits..."

912
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,100
"there's intoxication in the air"

913
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,900
"What has sobriety to do...?"

914
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,200
"It's all about young hearts"

915
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,500
"This is the way to be..."

916
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,500
"and say it openly..."

917
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,600
"it's the time to disco"

918
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,000
"Try and get the word..."

919
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,800
"it's the time to disco"

920
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,400
"Mine is a crazy heart..."

921
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,000
"what has it to fear...?"

922
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,600
"When I sway to the beat..."

923
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,700
"what have I to feel shy or hesitate about?"

924
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,800
"Let's dance, let's sing..."

925
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,800
"and let's say together..."

926
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:18,000
"it's the time to disco"

927
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,500
"Whom might you come up against...?"

928
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:30,800
"It's the time to disco"

929
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,000
Listen, I'm telling you.
- What?

930
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,600
I think she's drunk.
- Rohit, one minute.

931
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,300
Naina fell down.

932
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,700
Rohit. He too.

933
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,500
Okay, then.

934
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,200
Leave me...

935
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,900
Hey, you Mohamed Ali.

936
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,200
Naina, What's going on here?
- How dare he? Let's leave...

937
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,100
Who are you?

938
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,300
I'm Aman and you are Naina

939
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,000
And he is Mohammed Ali- Yeah.

940
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,600
Shut up. I'm going

941
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,300
What's going on?

942
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,100
Why? Didn't you say laugh, smile...
Live for today

943
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,300
And now when I'm enjoying,
you say let's go home...

944
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,400
You are so confused.

945
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Hey, even I'm confused.
Is he Mohammed Ali?

946
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,400
Shut up. I'm going

947
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,600
Now, listen.
- No... leave me... leave me...

948
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,300
Hey, listen... - Leave me...
- Shut up.

949
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,400
If you scream, I'll slap you
across your face!

950
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
Why are you shouting?
- I'm not shouting

951
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,400
Excuse me. - Shut up.

952
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,000
Now you two... hold hands
and start walking

953
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,100
Idiot. Not each others.
Hold my hand... Now come on

954
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,300
It's the time to disco.

955
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,600
Hey, please both of you shut up.
- Okay. And you...

956
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,800
What is it?
Can I say something? - Say...

957
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,600
It feels like we are all
going to school

958
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,700
Wow, Ya... Papa used to hold my hands
like this and take me to school

959
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,300
What happened to you?
- I miss Papa...

960
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,300
I'm sorry... when did he die?

961
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,600
He's alive...
can't I miss him?

962
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,600
Of course you can...
I miss my Papa very much...

963
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,300
I don't know why he had
to leave us and go away

964
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,600
I miss him.

965
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,800
Yeah, - Thank you sir.

966
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,500
You don't look nice
when you cry

967
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,100
You look nice when you are angry

968
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,500
Whenever you miss your father,

969
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,700
think about me...
you'll get angry

970
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,300
Hey, I really like you.
I like you Naina

971
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,100
My day is not complete
till I have met you

972
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,000
You are so cute.

973
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,700
Hey, I'm not cute, okay.
I'm Mohammed Ali.

974
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,300
No, you are cute...

975
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,000
Good mornign, Laila...
- Good morning, Rohit.

976
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,200
Laila...

977
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,300
You have learnt to speak?

978
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,400
Ya... I... what?

979
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,700
What do you mean speak?

980
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,800
Last night the two of you
had gone berserk...

981
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
I came to drop you.
Got late, so I stayed back

982
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,400
No problem. - Okay, can I've
some water please?

983
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,400
Please get it yourself.

984
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,100
Oh... last night...

985
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,600
Oh...

986
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,100
Good morning Kanthaben.

987
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,600
Kanta...

988
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,100
The newspaper and breakfast
are ready

989
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
What should I get for the guest?

990
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,600
Banana!

991
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,100
Rohit... won't you introduce us?

992
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,600
This is... - Aman!

993
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,100
And this is... - Kantaben...

994
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,600
Kantaben, how are you? Ok?

995
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,100
Anything else?

996
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Nothing else

997
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,400
Kantaben.

998
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,100
So you didn't meet Naina
in the park...? - Park.

999
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,300
No... we met in the MBA classes

1000
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You know, when I met her the
first time I didn't like her at all

1001
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,300
But now... - I know...

1002
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,000
Isn't it strange? You guys
are so close to each other...

1003
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,500
you spend so much time together...

1004
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,000
You even take your dogs
for walks together

1005
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,000
Do you want more?
I mean do you want more?

1006
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,200
No no yeah, no more more?

1007
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,800
With Naina... I'm happy
with just friendship No... no.

1008
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,500
Not Naina... I was
talking about the milk

1009
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,000
Do you want more? - Oh yeah,
little please.

1010
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,500
Anyway Thank you, bye,
- see you Aman.

1011
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,300
Oh sorry.

1012
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I forgot to tell you

1013
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,800
I didn't know much about Naina,

1014
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,300
but now I know everything!

1015
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,700
Thanks to your diary!

1016
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,000
You read my diary?
- Not all of it...

1017
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,700
only till the part where you have

1018
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,800
Written that you wear red underwear

1019
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,000
Red underwear... - Aman,
that's not cool.

1020
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,700
You can't read my diary.
