it doesn't seem like
you're a danger to yourself.

73

gonna suggest is that
we contact your parents,

let them know
what's going on,

into this facility,

00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,155
are very, very sick.

serious business.

back out there.

93

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,417
my brain starts
this cycling thing
about not getting in.

340
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,462
What would happen
if you didn't get in?

341
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,525
CRAIG: <i>Then I wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to put it on my</i>
<i>college applications.</i>

342
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>Which means I wouldn't</i>
<i>get into a good college.</i>

343
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,761
But not even Adam Smith
could have foreseen

344
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,068
the inequities of
modern capitalism.

345
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,132
<i>If I didn't get</i>
<i>into a good college,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have a good job.</i>

<i>Diffusing the situation</i>
<i>in Iran through</i>
<i>unilateral diplomacy</i>

347
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,443
<i>is my top priority</i>
<i>as Commander in Chief.</i>

348
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,549
<i>Which means I wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to afford</i>
<i>a good lifestyle.</i>

349
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,912
Hey, MTV. It's your boy,
Craig Gilner.

350
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,719
Welcome to my crib.

351
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,119
<i>So I wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to find a girlfriend.</i>

352
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,892
<i>Which means I'd</i>
<i>probably get depressed.</i>

353
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,200
<i>And I'd end up like Muqtada</i>
<i>in a place like this</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

354
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,902
So, what would happen
if I didn't get in?

355
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,634
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

356
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,648
Do you have anyone
you can explain it to?
Friends? Family?

357
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,613
I have friends and family,
but it's not always easy.

358
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,354
It's important to
have a support system.

359
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,986
People you can
really talk to.

360
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,428
Have you been having
any other symptoms?

361
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,197
I have trouble eating.
I can't keep it down.

362
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,465
All right.

00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,475
You'll start group
activities tomorrow,

364
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,101
we'll check in
again on Tuesday.

365
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,837
You have any questions?

366
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,245
Yes. Um...

367
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,410
If I'm feeling better,

368
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,452
do you think I can get out
of here by tomorrow?

369
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,953
Because I have school
and this application and...

370
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,013
Five days, Craig. Minimum.

371
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,082
I know this seems
like a strange place
at first,

372
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,423
but try to make
the most of it.

I do have...
I will have a place.

504
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,271
(STUTTERS) I have a...
I'm gonna have a place
on Thursday. It's true.

505
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,242
Listen, I never asked
you for anything.

506
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,586
Could you just, for once,
maybe do what I say.
Hello? Hello!

Hey, Craig. It's me.

<i>It's sick, I know.</i>

513
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,181
You were acting
a little weird earlier,

514
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,446
so I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

515
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,919
All right, that's it.

516
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm with Aaron.
He's being such
a tool. Bye!

517
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,253
Hello, Mr. Gilner,
this is your science teacher,
Mr. Reynolds.

518
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,957
We really need to talk
about your missing
lab assignments.

Hello?

00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,821
Hey, Nia. What's up?

524
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:31,219
Hey! Just finishing
my Gates Summer app.
I'll freak if I don't get in.

525
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,824
<i>What's up with you?</i>

526
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,128
Um. Just feeling
kind of, you know...

527
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,872
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that why you weren't
in school today?

528
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,472
Yeah, I was
feeling pretty shitty,
so I just stayed home.

529
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,573
<i>Yeah. I get like that</i>
<i>sometimes, too.</i>

530
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,244
Depressed or whatever.

531
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,710
Do you take
anything for it?

532
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,881
Um...

533
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,617

told anybody this.

For, like,
over a year now.

CRAIG: <i>I had no idea.</i>

539
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,468
Yeah, it's pretty
embarrassing.

540
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,866
I take Zoloft.
<i>Shut up!</i>

541
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,264
<i>I do.</i>

Oh, my God!
We're like so
screwed up.

I would ask you to
please keep it down.

Excuse me.

Will you be much longer?

00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,719

00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,326
It'll come to you.
It will always
come to you.

<i>Craig...</i>

557
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,332
It's all yours.

558
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,242
Thanks, Mom.

559
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,216
You know,
your dad really wanted
to be here today,

560
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,185
he just had a client crisis.

561
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,080
Client crisis?

562
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,317
Yeah, but he said,
he's for sure
coming tomorrow.

563
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,657
Have you made
any friends yet?

564
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,159
CRAIG: Yeah, I guess.

565
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,492
Are you friends
with the tranny?

566
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,588
Oh, the tranny.

567
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,093
Not really.

568
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,696
Did you talk to my school?

569
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,796
Because I really
can't have them finding
I'm in a place like this.

570
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,238
It could really
damage my future.

571
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,469
No, no. I just said
you were in the hospital.

572
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,805
I didn't say
anything specific.

573
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,778
Good. The last thing
I need is for them

574
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,108
to find out I've
been institutionalized.

575
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,648

What's going on, babe?

578
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,192
Uh...

579
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,105
Sorry. I was just
dropping the shirt off.

580
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,168
She's cute, isn't she?

581
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,372
Yeah. Is she yours?

582
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,279
Veronica. Like the
Elvis Costello song.

583
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,544
How old is she?

584
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,777
Eight and three-quarters.

585
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,984
That's what she says.
Three quarters.

586
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,256
Well, good luck
with your interview.

587
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,761
What's it for,
if you don't
mind me asking?

588
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,229
A group home.

589
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,524
Basically,
I need a place to live

590
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,592
when they kick me out
of here on Thursday.

591
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,832
Let me know if you
need somebody to practice
with or something.

592
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,204
What do you mean?

593
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,039
Like a practice interview.
So you're better prepared.

594
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,944
Yeah?

595
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,379
Yeah.

596
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,472
You want to try?

597
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,538
You want to try now?

598
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,341
If you're not
doing anything.

599
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,614
Okay, great.
Uh... Hold on.

600
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,421
Let me do this with
the official shirt on.

601
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,190
Okay. You're ready?

602
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,268
Hold on one second.
I don't know if
I'll do it like...

603
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,971
Which is better, like...

604
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,834
This?

605
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,965
Yeah. That looks natural.

606
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,168
Okay.

607
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,670
You can relax.

608
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,015
(SIGHING) I'm nervous.

609
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,677
Okay, why is it that you
think you qualify to live
in this group home?

610
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,419
Because if you
don't accept me,
I'll be homeless.

611
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,129
Okay, good.

612
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,301
Yeah, I think you're ready.

613
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,496
Really? I didn't
sound too desperate?

614
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,801
No. But, uh...

615
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,408
You might want to focus
on the positive things

616
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,002
that you get from
this experience

617
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,207
as opposed to, you know...

618
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,077
The negative.

619
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,410
Exactly. Like what
is it that you could
bring to the home?

620
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,717
Something special that
only you could offer.

621
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,955
It could be anything.
Maybe you have
a great attitude?

622
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,087
No.

623
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,131
You always clean up
after yourself?

624
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,166
Not really.

625
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,931
You know, I think
in these situations

626
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,031
it's okay to bend the truth
just a little bit.

627
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,976
Yeah. I just
don't want to get
people's expectations up

628
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,309
and then
disappoint them later.

629
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,481
That's it. You're pragmatic.
That's what you tell them.

630
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,452
Okay, yeah. Right?

631
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,318
Yeah, I know
you're gonna do great.

632
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,151
Thanks.

633
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,860
You want to play
some table tennis?

634
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,354
I'm pretty terrible
at table tennis.

635
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,729
It's all right.
It's just for fun.
Come on.

636
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,799
BOBBY: We play
a lot around here.
The problem is,

637
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,634
most people are
too zonked out on
their meds to compete.

638
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,765
One, zip.

639
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,302
She's a liar.

640
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,877
Please, baby. Baby.
Please listen. Listen.

641
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,815
I love you.

642
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,674
(CHUCKLES)

643
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,012
Don't worry about it.

644
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,090
Of course,
I forgive you, baby.

645
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,960
Johnny doesn't phone kiss.

646
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,770
You came.

647
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah. I mean,
I had other plans,
but I canceled them.

648
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,943
Good. I thought
I might have scared
you off yesterday.

649
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,355
Oh, yeah,
celebrity suicide.

650
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,355
It's kind of weird.

651
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,795
Okay, so check it out.
We're gonna play
a different game today.

652
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,062
Okay.

653
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,969
I ask you a question
and you ask me a question.

654
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,332
Do we answer them?

655
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,174
It's up to you,
but no matter what,

656
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,476
you have to finish
with a question.

657
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,072
Here we go. You ready?
Yeah.

658
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,346
(CHUCKLES) I said
finish with a question.

659
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,881
Are you stupid?

660
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,220
Uh, no... Are you?

661
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,387
There you go.
Do you think
I'm gross looking?

662
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,993
No. You look awesome.

663
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,098
What's your question?

664
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,909
Why'd you invite me here?

665
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,541
I thought it was nice
that you loaned
Bobby your shirt.

666
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,549
Don't you think
this is a good way
to get to know someone?

667
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,743
Sure.

668
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,809
Have you played this before?

669
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,285
Not in here.

670
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,314
Are you a virgin?

671
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,450
(CHUCKLES) So...

672
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,795
How long have
you been here?

673
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,297
Nice transition, Craig.

674
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,058
Twenty-one days.

00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,211
How was your interview?

844
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,890
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

845
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,702
(PANTING)

846
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,848
I blew it.

847
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,413
What happened?

848
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,770
(SCREAMING)

849
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,875
Calm down! Calm down!

850
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,722
SMITTY: Okay, man.
Easy, easy. Easy does it.

851
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:23,481
Here we go.
Okay. It's all right.

852
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,368
And was that
difficult for you?
Seeing Bobby like that?

853
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,541
I was scared.

854
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,338
Not that he was gonna
hurt me or anything.

855
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,471
Just, you know,
seeing someone
lose it like that.

856
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,645
You know,
it reminded me of
how I feel sometimes.

857
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,049
How's that?

858
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,851
Like I'm on the verge
of just blowing up.

859
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:58,324
All the stress and pressure
and anxiety just bubbling up.

860
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,158
But I'm never able
to let it out like that.

861
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,494
You know,
I just keep it inside.

862
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,432
Have you always
felt that way?

863
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,597
Well, not when
I was a kid.

864
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,066
Tell me about it.

865
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,900
What do you mean?

866
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,579
About a time you remember
being happy. Carefree.

867
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,776
Uh...

868
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,723
There was this one day
back in eighth grade.

869
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:33,252
<i>It wasn't that long ago,</i>
<i>but time felt different</i>
<i>back then.</i>

870
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,256
<i>Like there was more of it.</i>

871
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,636
<i>We spent the morning</i>
<i>at Coney Island.</i>

872
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,575
<i>Afterwards,</i>
<i>we rode our bikes</i>
<i>through Bay Ridge,</i>

873
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,981
<i>Sunset Park,</i>

874
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,018
<i>Park Slope,</i>

875
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,219
<i>Downtown Brooklyn,</i>

876
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,221
<i>Brooklyn Heights,</i>

877
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,498
<i>all the way to</i>
<i>the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

878
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,715
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

879
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,116
Girls, grades,
parents, two wars,

880
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,250
impending
environmental catastrophe,
a messed up economy...

881
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:40,558
All these things seemed
to come out of nowhere,
like on the same day.

882
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:48,765
Craig, there is a saying
that goes something like,

883
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,737
"Lord, grant me the strength
to change the things I can,

884
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,912
"the courage to accept
the things I can't,

885
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,914
"and the wisdom to
know the difference."

886
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,210
So...

887
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,123
So, let's talk
about your parents.

888
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,152
You think I can
change my parents?

889
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,025
No, but I'm a psychiatrist.

890
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,496
So I have to ask you
about them at some point.

891
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,691
(SNICKERING)

892
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,755
Um...

893
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,994
They're good people.

894
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,972
But, okay, take my dad.
I just saw him today.

895
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,477
And he knows I'm in here
'cause I'm stressed out,

896
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,479
but he still brings up
the Gates application.

897
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,141
It's, like,
"Get a clue, Dad.

898
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,411
"There's something
bigger going on here."

899
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,311
And what's that?

900
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,357
I don't know.

901
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,089
But it feels big.

902
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,727
Thanks.

903
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,167
No problem.

904
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,835
Is everything okay?

905
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,808
Yeah, just screwing
the pooch with my interview.
It's okay.

906
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,244
Oh, I'm sorry.

907
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,303
I'm over it.

908
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,679
Really?

909
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,116
Not really,
I'm just zonked on Ativan.

910
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,346
Where'd you get
the ice cream?

911
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,445
Mister Softee,
across the street.

912
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,517
JOHNNY: Bobby, man!

913
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,717
I want ice cream.

914
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,623
Can I have a lick, Bob?

915
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,457
SMITTY: Got to do
two points off, Bob.

916
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,019
It's worth it.

917
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,159
What's with these points?

918
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,530
Yeah, what is
with these points?

919
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:28,093
I mean, seriously,
no one could possibly be
keeping track of all of them.

920
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,334
SMITTY: That's
three points off for
doubting the system.

921
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,706
Ah, screw the system.
You can have some
of my points.

922
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,540
Johnny needs a lick.

923
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,102
It looks good.

924
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,579
What's this?

925
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,847
Dollar.

926
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,352
For the pizza party.

927
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,284
Where'd you get this?
Don't worry about it.

928
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,101
(LAUGHING)

929
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,600
Yeah, it's a true story.

930
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,437
He was one of
the Black Panthers.

931
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,067
And you never
heard from him again?

932
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,505
Mmm-mmm.

933
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,078
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

934
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,843
Don't touch me.
See that lady right there?

935
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,612
She was a radical
academic up at Columbia,

936
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,118
and then they
passed the Patriot Act.

937
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,950
You know what
the Patriot Act is?

938
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,148
Yeah.
Okay.

939
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,852
When they passed
the Patriot Act,
then she went bonkers.

940
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,230
She thought that Bush
put bugs in all the phones.

941
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,466
<i>Pretty crazy, right?</i>

942
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,578
And that guy,
Solomon, over there?

943
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,246
He's nuts, too.

944
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,944
He's part of this
Hasidic acid-head scene
in Williamsburg.

945
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,659
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

946
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,432
He did 100 tabs of acid.

947
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,735
Don't look, don't look.
In one night.

948
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,875
And hasn't been
the same since.

949
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,905
Yeah.
Wow!

950
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,882
Yeah. Crazy, right?

951
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,476
Kinda cool.

952
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,110
Some cool people in here.

953
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,882
Yeah, uh...

954
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,447
What about you?

955
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,483
What about me?

956
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,629
I just...

957
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,291
You know, um,
your daughter, Veronica.

958
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,891
When are you
gonna see her again?

959
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,135
You know, I think
my daughter is just
better off without me.

960
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,742
Come on.
No, really.

961
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,711
I mean, I'm not really
a role model in this place,

962
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,610
and I think she's just...

963
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,444
She's better off.

964
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,949
Look, I know that
it's none of my business,

965
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,559
and you can
tell me to get lost
whenever you want,

966
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,597
but I think that she's just
gonna want her dad around,

967
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,861
and I don't think
she's gonna care about...

968
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,698
You should get lost.

969
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,633
Okay.

00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,877

wearing off, I'm sorry.

and my sister.

it would mess them up.

01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,201
Only Egypt music.

1189
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,070
Oh, well, let's see.

1190
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,312
Excuse me, if you please.
I am trying to rest.

1191
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,176
Sol, have you
met Muqtada?

1192
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,259
If you could
please keep it down.

1193
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,220
He has sensitive hearing.

1194
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,266
This I think is enough
for one day.

(CHATTERING ON TV)

1196
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,048
NIA: Hey, Craig.

1197
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,048
Hey.

1198
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,552
Um, this is a surprise.

1199
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,526
Me and Aaron broke up.

1200
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,556
I'm sorry.

1201
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,306
NIA: Are you okay?

1202
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,100
Uh, yeah. Sorry. Um...

1203
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,610
You must be
really loaded, huh?

1204
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,378
Yeah. I'm pretty zonked.

1205
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,811
So, you know
I've been thinking
about you non-stop

1206
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,320
since we talked on
the phone the other day.

1207

(STUTTERING)

1208
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,320
I've been thinking
about you a lot, too.

1209
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,053
I woke up and my bed
was on fire!

1210
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,363
What's wrong with that guy?

1211
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:43,957
He's schizophrenic.

1212
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,692
Weird.

1213
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,395
Anyway,

1214
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:53,169
it's like you told me
all this stuff about you
and you're really mature.

1215
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,243
Not like everyone else
with their stupid
little problems.

1216
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,405
I mean, you're really,
really screwed up.

1217
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:00,880
I'm a mess.

1218
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,716
But in a good way.
You know, in the way
that gives you

1219
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,410
experience.

1220
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,254
So you and Aaron broke up?

1221
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,123

1227
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,243
Do you want to see my room?

NIA: You haven't
finished that yet?

1229
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,484
What?

1230
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:46,717
Oh.

1231
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,958
Yes, we have a lot of

Takes up...

1233
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,875
Me and Aaron never did
anything like this.

1234
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,219
This was totally
on my checklist.

01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,299
Um, this is my
roommate, Muqtada.

1245
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,843
Don't talk to her!

1246
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,071
She try and
make sex in my bed!

1247
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,080
Calm down. No one
was having sex, okay?

through a hard time.

No, you!
What's wrong with you?

1252
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,951
I'm also going
through a hard time.

1253
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,219
Um, you know what?
You should get some rest,

1254
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,521
and I'll call you
tomorrow or something.

This is pretty cool, too.

So, our meeting tonight.

Is it safe to assume
that's not happening?

1271
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,204
You've had it figured
out all along, Muqtada.

1272

know about that?

Solomon. That dude's
got sensitive hearing.

Look, it's not
just women, okay?

1285
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:33,681
I can't do anything right.
My life's a mess.

1286
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,455
No, my life is a mess.

1287
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,490
Muqtada's life is a mess.
No offense, babe.

1288
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,189
All good, papa.

1289
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,326
Look, I happen
to like you, Craig.

1290
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,496
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

1291
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,037
I was much better looking,
and I didn't have as much
trouble with women...

1292
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,270
Get back on track, man.

1293

1294
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,939
if you're celebrating
your daughter's
eighth birthday

1295
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,041
in a place like this,

1296
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,649
I swear to God,

1297
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,380
Muqtada and I are going
to kick your ass.

01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,820
is busy dying.

This Bobby,

1302
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,811
I think, very wise man.

1303
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,080
By the way, I was just
coming in to tell you that

1304
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,415
I'm not gonna be
homeless tomorrow.

1305
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:41,714
I'm just saying.

1308
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,840
It's right next door
to the YMCA.

1309
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,279
Yeah. So we can go swimming
in the swimming pool,

1310
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,444
and maybe play
table tennis.

1311

01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,551
Ping-pong, yes.

1313
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,583
It's the same thing.

1314
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,185
So listen, your mom will
bring you by on Saturday,

1315
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,924
and we could have a feast.

1316
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,733
There are so many people,
you know, not just
in this hospital,

1317
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:03,498
but in the whole world,
who are struggling
so hard just to live.

1318
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:09,001
And, it's like,
self-indulgent for me to
not appreciate what I have.

1319
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,602
Like what?

1320
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:17,317
Well, there's my family,
my home, and my friends.

1321
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,780
And you know,
there's this.

1322
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,719
I used to think art was just
bourgeois decadence, but...

1323
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,563
It's really wonderful, Craig.

1324
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,230
Thanks. Um...

1325
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,139
Yeah, I've done
about 20 of them

1326
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,038
and it's something
that I really enjoy.

1327
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,134
What do you enjoy about it?

1328
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,036
It's fun.

1329
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,846
And it takes my mind
off the things
that stress me out.

1330
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,814
You gonna continue it
when you leave?

1331
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,880
Yeah.

1332
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,753
Or, I think.
But my dad might freak.

1333
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,958
Have you told him
how you feel?

1334
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,222
Not yet.

1335
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,691
But you will?

1336
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:05,861
I think so.

1337
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,132
Thank you.

1338
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,642
It's my last
night tonight, Smitty.

1339
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,646
It is your
last night, Craig.

1340
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,673
I hate to break it to you,
Craig, but I think
I'm really gonna miss you.

1341
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,251
Well, it's Bobby's
last night, too,

1342
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,121
so I was wondering if we
could have a pizza party.

1343
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:35,229
Yes, we can.
Yeah. Do you have the money?
If you can get the money.

1344
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,629
Yeah, no, I'll have
the money. Yeah, I...

1345
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,326
You have records
you could bring?

1346
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,968
(VOCALIZING)

1347
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,011
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

1348
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,087
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

1349
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:05,816
That girl I was with,
she's my best
friend's girlfriend.

1350
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,555
I've been obsessed
with her forever and...

1351
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,187
And you're
in love with her?

1352
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,889
No.

1353
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,434
Well, of course not.
But you think she's hot,

1354
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,526
so you told her what you
thought she'd want to hear.

1355
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,939
And now you're going to
do the same thing to me.

1356
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,540
No, I'm not.

1357
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,141
You're not?

1358
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,981
Look, um,
I do think you're hot.

1359
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,248
And I do want to say
the right thing,

1360
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,756
but that's only
because I really like you.

1361
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,457
I like how you don't
hide your problems
like everyone else.

1362
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,758
And I feel like I don't
have to hide mine
when I'm around you.

1363
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,371
You know, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently,

1364
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,168
and I've realized that

1365
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,034
if you're not busy being born,
you're busy dying.

1366
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,178
And I, for one,
think that we could
both benefit from

1367
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,242
being born, again.

1368
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,654
Not being born again,
but you know what I mean?

1369
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,887
Gee, thanks for
the wisdom, Bob.

1370
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,327
What? He told you that, too?

1371
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,130
Who?
Bobby.

1372
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,894
Yeah, me and about
a billion other people.

1373
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,701
Bob Dylan.

1374
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,973
It's the song
you just quoted.

1375
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,104
What? No.
Yes.

1376
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:31,936
Oh.

1377
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,417
Anyway, my point is

1378
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,287
I want to play
doctor with you.

1379
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:03,664
This is awesome.

1380
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,136
So, how come you
never asked me why?

1381
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,179
Why what?

1382
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:29,626
I guess I just
assumed you'd tell me
when you wanted me to know.

1383
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,093
Thanks.

1384
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,606
Do you like music?

1385
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,113
Do you like breathing?

1386
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:50,077
That's right.
It was a dumb question.

1387
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:57,924
I like... I like
Radiohead a lot,
the Pixies, T. Rex.

1388
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,317
Oh, what else?

1389
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,854
Have you seen them live?

1390
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,594
I saw Radiohead
and the Pixies once.

1391
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:08,260
Cool.

1392
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,738

doing a show at the end
of the month.

1395

Yes, I would.

1396

1397
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:31,551
No, with Solomon.

1398
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,688
