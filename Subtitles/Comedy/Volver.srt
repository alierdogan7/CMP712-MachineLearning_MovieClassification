00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:25,477
#I went out of the common
people with the little herd,

3
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,680
#And as then dawn was coming

4
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,048
#I was receiving it

5
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,152
#Singing like a little bird

6
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:37,888
#This very little premature morning

7
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,859
#For the lanes of the brushwood,

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,561
#I am the hormiguita of the spoils

9
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:47,799
#And as he has very good eyes

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,238

He is very clumsy. I do not
know how he covers up for  them.

128

He eats every day his pa's bar When

Yes.

134
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,017
The fact is that he stops she has not
died And he does not get used to the idea .

135
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,786
Sit down a little bit, he walks .

136
00:07:52,787 --> 00:08:01,995
I was intending to pay you every month,
stops that you put in an eye every day.

137
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,630
But I eat no, cast out my husband,
To see where I introduce it.

138
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,099
But we have to do something.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,369
All mornings, before of Doing
the buy, I touch his window

140
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,705
And until I do not hear her surrendering
The good days, I do not go away .

141
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,374
I am concerned about her.

142
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,043
You do not know how I
thank it to you, Agusti.

143
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,680

The one and only the
common people's hippie.

148
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:42,301
He looks at lasjoyas of plastic.

149
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,302
They are a passage!

150
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:49,575
A plastic good guy.

151
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,877

And your sister Brígida?

156

Succeeding in the telebasura.
