00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,790
No, no, no! Wait, wait.

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,958
I just... I figured,
with my guts and your glory...

174
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,477
Your guts would be a grease spot
on a runway somewhere.

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,877
Go home. You're in over your head, kid.

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,838
Look, you flew all those...

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,830
(SIGHS)

178
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,950
CHUG: Let's try the back door.

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,997
CHUG: Hello, Lincoln!
(HONKS HORN) Hey, Dusty!

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,554
I don't know how
you talked me into coming to this.

181
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,710
Now, come on, Dottie.

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,635
Wow! I don't believe it. A Red Tail P-51!

183
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,791
DUSTY: Oh, man! A Sea Fury!

184
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,472
Check it out!

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,710
Wow!

186
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,030
NED: (OVER PA)
Ladies and gentleplanes.

187
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,197
May we have your attention, please?

188
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,829
Kindly direct your windscreens
to the heavens above

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,312
and give a warm welcome
to our special guest.

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,517
The Prince of Propellers.

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,512
When he's speeding, he's leading.

192
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,154
Get my good side, fellas.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,354
When he's grinning, he's winning.

194
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,910
The one and only

195
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,515
- Ripslinger!
- (CROWD CHEERING)

196
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,677
You're caught in the riptide!
(CHUCKLES)

197
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,638
- Thanks for coming out.
- (DOTTIE COUGHING)

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,030
Who wants a picture?
All right, one at a time.

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
Well, with all that self-promotion,
at least he's modest.

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,357
Dottie, that's Ripslinger.

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,433
He's captain of Team RPX.
They call him...

202
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,432
BOTH: The Green Tornado.

203
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh, he's so good, he's pre-qualified.

204
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,193
Oh. And those two, Ned and Zed.

205
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,630
BOTH: The Twin Turbos.

206
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
They're world-class racers.

207
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,110
You know, I hear they used to be
one plane and were separated at birth.

208
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,478
Wow. I wish I was separated at birth.

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,870
Okay, people.

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,953
This is the last of four time trials
being held worldwide.

211
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,112
Today's qualifying round
is one lap around the pylons.

212
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,272
The top five finishers will qualify
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

213
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,470
Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,359
Fonzarelli, you're up, my man.

215
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,430
(SPITS)

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,757
Oh, man! That's nasty.

217
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,151
And he's through the start gate!

218
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,760
The racers must pass through
the blue pylons on the horizontal

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,276
and around the red pylons
on the knife-edge.

220
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,152
Now he's coming back to Gate Three!

221
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,833
Nicely done, my man.

222
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,152
Setting himself up a little high
through the blue pylons there,

223
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
lining up for the quadro.

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,831
He's taking a hard right with a
270-degree high-G turn! Yeah!

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,912
Back all the way around. Whoo!

226
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,118
- Cleanly through. Ha! Look at you, man!
- That guy's good.

227
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,760
It doesn't get much better than that.
All right. Good speed.

228
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,913
Lining up for the three-pylon chicane,
amazing pitch control.

229
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,873
Smooth! Fast! Clean!

230
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
He's going into the final turn,

231
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,638
into the half-Cuban 8,
pulling an aggressive 9.2 Gs.

232
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,439
Attacking the climb!

233
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
Wow. Now that's some speed.

234
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,910
Coming out of the Cuban 8 at
the end of a fantastic first run, people.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,229
A 01.24. 16.

236
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,311
A very good time for
the other racers to try and beat.

237
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,277
Fast, tight through the pylons.

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,954
He's got a great pace going, here.

239
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,640
He’s just a half a second behind.

240
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,473
- Oh! Engine failure!
- CROWD: Oh!

241
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,074
Out of the race. Bye-bye.

242
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,675
Great performance.
Watch the clock here.

243
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
I can't wait. Lining up for the Blue Gate.

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,996
Oh, no, he did not!
That's a major penalty.

245
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,237
- Sorry, dude. Eighth place.
- (GROANS)

246
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,800
Talk about fast.

247
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,236
Coming out the Cuban 8.

248
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,634
Fueled and ready, man.

249
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,632
Okay, bud, you're up.

250
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Good and tight.

251
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,549
- All set.
- It's been a wonderful day here,

252
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,040
and we're down to our last competitor.

253
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,560
This is it.

254
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,156
From Propwash Junction,
Strut Jetstream.

255
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,960
"Strut Jetstream"?

256
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,954
Yep. Awesomest call sign ever.
(CHUCKLES) It was my idea.

257
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,236
- Ah. That explains it.
- Hey, ag-plane!

258
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,720
Landscaping was yesterday, man.
Get off the runway. We're racing, here.

259
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,877
- Second call for Strut Jetstream.
- No, no, no!

260
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,600
- Looking for...
- Yo! I'm Strut Jetstream.

261
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
- You are Strut Jetstream?
- Yep.

262
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,681
A crop duster?
Man, what's going on here?

263
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,596
Is everybody getting to fly today?

264
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,876
Man, your momma must have
had high hopes for you.

265
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,317
Now, you know you are
built for seed, not speed.

266
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,680
You have got to be kidding me.

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,274
- That farmer's going to race?
- (LAUGHS)

268
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,556
Seriously, with a prop that small?

269
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
Maybe he races that leaky,

270
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,801
old fuel truck next to him.

271
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,956
Who are you calling leaky?

272
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,077
I'll leak on you,
if you don't check your intake.

273
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,118
Don't lower yourself to their level.

274
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,590
Go on Dus...
Go on, Strut.

275
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,520
- (PLANES LAUGHING)
- PLANE 1: Who's that guy?

276
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,120
- You're going to try out?
- PLANE 2: A crop duster?

277
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
FORKLIFT: Cornfield is over that way.

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,112
Nice of you to take the day off
just to lose!

279
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,316
(ALL LAUGHING)

280
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,949
Go, Duster!

281
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,478
It's going to be a tall order for him
to knock Fonzarelli out of fifth place.

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,115
And he's off!

283
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,350
Well, he's starting a little conservative.

284
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,470
This ought to be rich.

285
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,870
193 miles per hour.

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,669
He's into Gate Two,
clean through the horizontal.

287
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,554
What?
He's practically mowing the lawn.

288
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,710
Come to my house, man.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,514
Okay. At the first split,
he's a full second behind Fonzarelli.

290
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,354
Yo, that's a lot of time to make up,
but this guy's aggressive.

291
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,875
Now he's making that hard
270-degree high-G turn!

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,196
Whoo! That's it!

293
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,841
Setting himself up. Left vertical turn.

294
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,832
Lining up for the three-pylon chicane.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,070
He's gaining speed.

296
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,231
Now, he's only half a second
behind Fonzarelli.

297
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,710
And he is closing rapidly.

298
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,914
Now he's back on that stick.
Up he goes! Up and away!

299
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,789
Now only two-tenths of
a second behind Fonzarelli!

300
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,997
- Come on, Duster!
- Oh, it's going to be close.

301
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,753
He's going to do it. He's going to do it.

302
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,231
Oh, yes! What a finish!
Now, that's what you call flying!

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,079
Way to go, Dustmeister.

304
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
That's what I'm talking about.

305
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,796
Jetstream, the official time is

306
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,431
1 minute, 24.26 seconds.

307
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,310
Sixth place,
but what a close one, people.

308
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Well, folks, that wraps up the trials
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

309
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,871
Hey, pal, sixth place
ain't nothing to be ashamed of.

310
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,713
That was a heck of a run.

311
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,349
Thanks.

312
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,400
ROPER:
Ow! Dagnabbit! Let me drive!

313
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,075
There you go, topped off
and all set, Mayday.

314
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,074
Will you stop! Unbelievable!

315
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,230
Why don't you just go back!

316
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,312
I mean, I think you actually
missed a pothole!

317
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,799
Man, you got to be the worst,

318
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,521
I mean the worst delivery truck
that has ever delivered a delivery!

319
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,115
- Can I help you?
- (COUGHING)

320
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,920
Please tell me
this is Propwash Junction.

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,036
Sure is.

322
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,079
Oh, finally. You know,
you're not even on the map.

323
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,152
Yeah, pretty drive though, ain't it?

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,636
Oh, yeah. Especially if you
like looking at dirt and corn.

325
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,679
Anyway,
I'm looking for a Strut Jetstream.

326
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,799
- Who?
- Jetstream. Strut Jetstream.

327
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,391
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
Do you have a photo?

328
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,597
Yeah, I got one right here.
No, I don't have a photo!

329
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,796
I have documentation that says

330
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,440
Strut Jetstream
lives in Propwash Junction.

331
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,796
Oh, whoa, whoa! Whoa,
wait a minute! Okay! Oh...

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,434
No, gosh I...

333
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,353
Hey, I'm Strut Jetstream.

334
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,989
Yeah! That's right!
(LAUGHS)

335
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,073
I knew I'd remember.
There he is, strutting on over here.

336
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

337
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,189
- I am?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

338
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,070
It's actually pronounced
"Dusty Crophopper."

339
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,517
Dusty Crophopper.

340
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,190
Yeah. It's Scandinavian.

341
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,672
Right, and I'm Egyptian.

342
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,594
(SNIFFS) Googly moogly!
What is that smell?

343
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,637
- It's Vita-minamulch.
- Vita-mina-what?

344
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,440
The finest-smelling compost
this side of the Mississippi.

345
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,637
Original, creamy and chunky style.

346
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,111
(SNIFFS) Oh, yeah.
Smell that? It's like daffodils

347
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,390
and like Sunday dinner.
I just love it. I love it.

348
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,918
I got some minamulch, yeah!
I got some minamulch, yeah!

349
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,361
That old airplane needs some help.
Y'all know that, right?

350
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,590
BOTH: Yeah.

351
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,200
Are you familiar with
the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

352
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,550
Oh, yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

353
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,836
That stuff will blur your vision
and slur your speech.

354
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,070
- It's illegal.
- Totally illegal.

355
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,516
Wouldn't know what it looks like.
Yeah, you were saying?

356
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,480
That substance was found in the tank
of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,029
Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

358
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,431
(STAMMERS)
Wait, so you're saying...

359
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,360
He's out, you're in. Congratulations.

360
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,920
- You're in?
- Hmm.

361
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,999
He's in!
(WHISTLES)

362
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,912
You're never going to believe this.
He's in!

363
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,356
Dusty's in the race! Dottie, he's in!

364
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,079
What? Are you serious?

365
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,310
Whoo! Dusty.

366
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,073
DOTTIE: Don't do anything crazy.
Fly safe.

367
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,389
Man, it's going to be cool.

368
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,075
You're going to cross oceans
thousands of miles wide.

369
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,072
Freezing your rudder off one day...

370
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,320
- And burning it off the next!
- Freaking hurricanes.

371
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,636
- Cyclones!
- Typhoons!

372
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,234
- Monsoons!
- Tornadoes!

373
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,879
- Sandstorms!
- Gale force winds!

374
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,189
Yeah! (WHOOPING)

375
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,315
Hmm. (SIGHS)

376
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,954
SKIPPER: Bad idea.

377
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,953
You'll end up a smoking hole
on the side of a mountain

378
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,037
with your parts
spread over five countries.

379
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,315
What makes you say that?

380
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,796
You're going up against
the best racers in the world.

381
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,519
And some of them don't even finish.

382
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,955
You're sloppy on your rolls,

383
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,311
wide on your turns,
slow on your straightaways.

384
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,557
You've been watching me?

385
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,518
Yeah, watching you
make a fool out of yourself.

386
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,672
You need to be tighter getting
in and out of your knife-edge.

387
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,750
Okay.

388
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,196
Any extra control input
costs you speed and seconds.

389
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,559
- So, you think I'm overcorrecting?
- Absolutely. Rookie mistake.

390
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,359
Are you giving me pointers?

391
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,359
No! I'm telling you to forget
all this racing malarkey.

392
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,080
You just ain't built for it.
You're a crop duster!

393
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,717
You don't think I know that?

394
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,076
I'm the one who's been
flying back and forth

395
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,639
across the same fields day after day,
month after month, for years!

396
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,397
I have flown thousands of miles

397
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,353
and I have never been anywhere.

398
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,476
Not like you.

399
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,431
You were built to fight,
and look what you did!

400
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,593
You're a hero.

401
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,159
I'm just trying to prove
that maybe, just maybe,

402
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,960
I can do more than what I was built for.

You know what? Just forget it.

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,077
You'll never understand.

406
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,195
0500, tomorrow. Don't be late.

407
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,192
Wait. 0500?

408
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,751
Yeah, 5:00 a.m.

Those are some
mighty clean optics, there.

413
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,240
What do you use?
Some kind of shammy?

414
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,670
- Oh, no, it's a special microfiber cloth.
- Ah. Microfiber.

415
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,355
Yeah, lint-free, scratch-free.
I'll get you some.

416
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,909
I got an ex-Navy buddy
who sells them to me wholesale.

417
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,070
I helped him set up his web...

418
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,630
Knock it off. We got a lot of work to do.

419
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,077
- (WHISPERS) I'll hook you up.
- Thanks.

All right, Dusty, remember this.

421
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,075
It ain't how fast you fly,
it's how you fly fast.

422
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,590
- Roger that.
- Show me what you got.

go up and down. What else?

425
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,001
- Show me your turns.
- Here we go!

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,874
You think that was good? That stunk!
Knife-edge those elm trees.

Oh, come on. Keep your nose up!

Hey, Skip.

429
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,713
- You want speed, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,871
- Serious, bolt-rattling speed?
- Oh, yeah!

431
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,111
Then look up.
Do you see those clouds?

I feel like I was having some problems

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,716
I've never flown over a thousand feet.

461
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Are you kidding?

462
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,473
Scared of heights and you want to
race around the world?

463
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,354
Uh, Skip, during the attack
of Tujunga Harbor,

464
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,029
why, even the P-38s
had trouble at high altitudes.

465
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,159
Well, they didn't have to fly
over the Himalayas, did they?

466
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,869
I'll still be low to the ground,
just high up.

467
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,549
And after the war,
those 38s went on to win races.

468
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,876
Really? Is that true?

469
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,311
Yeah, true.
Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

470
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,198
- For real?
- Wait, it gets better.

471
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,195
In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger
averaged 337 miles per hour.

472
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,430
Wait, 337?

473
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,593
Well, actually 337.4, but they
round it down in the record books.

474
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,756
Why would you do that?

475
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,240
Some people just have
no respect for decimal points.

476
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,636
- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
- Why couldn't they round it up?

477
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,235
- Seriously, he...
- All right, all right.

478
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,432
So, you're a flat-hatter.
We'll work on that.

479
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,310
But for now let's see if we can turn
low and sloppy into low and fast.

480
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,920
Roger that.

481
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,189
It'll go like this.

482
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,638
The flag marks the start line.

483
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,155
Across the cornfield,
three silos are waiting for you.

484
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,674
Slalom those with a radial-G pass.

go to your optimal rate of climb
to about 500 feet.

Roll inverted and extend,
trading altitude for air speed

489
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,430
- and dive toward the finish line.
- DUSTY: Uh, okay.

490
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,194
You string all that together,
you might have a chance to beat him.

501
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,070
You're falling behind.

502
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,516
Begin your climb
and catch him in the dive.

503
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,797
Start your dive now.

504
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,111

506
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,636
So, we can increase power

I have a humble suggestion.

853
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,513
Would you not be much faster

854
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,718

and whatnot weighing you down?

856
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,835
Yeah.
Why carry around the extra weight?

858
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,240
Perhaps you need to start
thinking like a racer.

He's an amazing instructor.

about being that high up,

you see, there's not a lot of oxygen.

940
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,919
So, if you crash, no explosion.

instead of over them?

flew through terrain like that

And Dottie is right.

Yeah. All of us who want to do more
than just what we were built for.

1529
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,119
(ALL CHEERING)

1530
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,956
Whoa! Thanks, guys!

1531
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,190
ROPER: Whoo-wee!

1532
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,677
Ripstinker. Yeah, that's your name.
That's some supersonic sewer sauce.

1533
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,840
Man, I thought
Vita-stink-a-bunch was bad.

1534
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,799
That's got nothing on you.

1535
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,675
Ooh! You're just nasty. Nastilicious.

1536
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,553
You need to go home and wash up.

1537
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,120
Twice. (CHUCKLES)

1538
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,516
- Whoa!
- (ALL LAUGHING)

1539
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,557
CAR: Who's that guy?

1540
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,875
Thanks, Skip.

1541
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,150
Don't thank me.

1542
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,273
I learned a lot more from you
than you ever learned from me.

1543
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,234
Attention on deck. Victory!

1544
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,476
ALL: Victory!

1545
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,110
It's an honor to be here.

1546
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,230
Hook them up.

1547
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,159
- You ready, wingman?
- Roger that.

1548
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,355
An honorary Jolly Wrench.
How's that feel, Dusty?

1549
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,510
It feels great!

1550
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,189
(LAUGHS) Back in the saddle again,
eh, Skipper?

1551
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,114
Well, they didn't have these fancy toys
the last time I did this.

1552
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,429
Nothing to it.

1553
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,989
They hook you up,
you nod to the shooter over there,

1554
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,236
and hang on!

1555
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,513
SKIPPER: Yeah!

1556
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,358
DUSTY: Last one back
to Propwash buys!

1557
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,760
SKIPPER: Ha-ha! You're on!

1558
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,830
(DUSTY WHOOPING)

1559
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,912
