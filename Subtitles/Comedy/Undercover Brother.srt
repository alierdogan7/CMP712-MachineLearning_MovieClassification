00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,158
Man-man.

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,327
The GeneraI's
press conference is starting!

170
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,995
<i>Newscaster:
We interrupt this broadcast to take you live</i>

171
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,539
to a press conference
by GeneraI Warren BoutweII,

172
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,999
in which he is expected
to announce

173
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,169
that he is a candidate
for presidency of the United States.

174
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,047
I wonder if he'II run
as a Democrat or an Independent.

175
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,675
- Never know.
Might be a RepubIican.
- Oh, pIease.

176
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,511
What kind
of seIf-respecting
bIack man

177
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,012
wouId run
as a RepubIican?

178
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,181
Name one thing
the RepubIican party

179
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,058
has done
for bIack peopIe. One!

180
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,060
WeII, they were
the party of LincoIn.

181
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,853
<i>They stood against
the tyranny of oppression</i>

182
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,522
by Ieading the caII
for the CiviI War,

183
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,233
<i>and forced passage
of the Emancipation Proclamation,</i>

184
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,526
which freed the sIaves.

185
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,154
AII right,
name two things IateIy.

186
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,156
Damn it, It doesn't matter
what party!

187
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,742
This couId be the first step
on the road to putting

188
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,036
an African-American
in the White House.

189
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,997

for bIack peopIe of aII races.

190
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,711
- GeneraI: "Good morning."
- Think about it!

191
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,048
I've thought Iong and hard about how
I can best serve my country

192
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,842
now that I'm no Ionger in uniform.

193
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,010

Yes, sir.

199
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,904
So, you're passing up a chance
to be President

200
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,364
to open a chicken joint?

201
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,409
A man Iike me doesn't have
any business in poIitics.

202
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,911
They say you shouId
aIways do what you know.

203
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,038
And what I know
is good fried chicken.

204
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,999
- Ohh...
- GeneraI: "Yes, ma'am."

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,127
Don't you think your supporters

206
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,921
wiII be particuIarIy disappointed?

207
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,048
Not after they taste
the GeneraI's fried chicken.

Good is an ancient

Go-od, meaning
the absence of coIor,

i.e.--
''It's aII good,''

319
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,586
which it is,
or ''Good WiII Hunting,''

320
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,921
meaning,
''I'm hunting niggas!''

321
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,091
So if you say ''good morning'' to me,
you're saying,

CongratuIations, Mr. Feather.

333
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,306
Thank you, Mister...

334
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,225
The Man.

335
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:05,395
As you can see,
the GeneraI is totaIIy under our controI.

<i>The Man:
Yes, our little experiment was a success.</i>

337
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:14,905
In fact, I've decided to use the GeneraI
to Iaunch ''Operation Whitewash.''

338
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,408
FabuIous. I'II inform MuItinationaI
to step up production.

339
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,745
The onIy thing standing
in our way is the Brotherhood.

340
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,249
And they won't be a probIem,
wiII they, Feather?

341
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,376
No, sir.

342
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,627
Good.

343
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,298

357
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,735
And that's why we beIieve
there's got to be

358
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,614
some connection between
the GeneraI's announcement and The Man.

359
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,366
Come on, y'aII.
Y'aII teIIing me there's reaIIy "a" Man?

360
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,661
What do you think,
Undercover Brother?

361
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,288
If that is your reaI name.

362
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,582
<i>You think things
just happen by accident?</i>

363
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,668
No! Sometimes peopIe,

364
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,671
mostIy white peopIe,
make things happen.

365
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,298
That's where we come in

366
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,677
and our never ending struggIe
against The Man,

367
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,805
a.k.a. Whitey,
a.k.a. Mr. CharIie,

368
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,767
a.k.a. Honky McGee.

369
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,769
So, the conspiracies we've beIieved

370
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,271
for aII these years are reaIIy true?

371
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,273
The N.B.A. reaIIy instituted

372
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,568
the three-point shot
to give white boys a chance?

373
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,861
Smart Brother: AbsoIuteIy.

374
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,489
So the entertainment industry
reaIIy "is" out to get Spike Lee.

375
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,991
- Is that right?
- Come on, man!

376
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,952
Even Cher got an Oscar.

377
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,495
Cher-rr!

378
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,414
And O.J. reaIIy
didn't do it?

379
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,420
Let's just move on,
shaII we?

now that
you're working for us,

395
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,208
you're gonna need to memorize
our ruIes and reguIations.

396
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,128
Trim the hair, and for God's sake,
get rid of the cIothes.

407
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,537
Yeah?
''It's my money.

408

I don't care whose bank it is!''
Right.

409
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,000
I know whose money is
in it.
I'm keeping it reaI.

410
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,503
- That's aII I'm saying.
- Hi, Conspiracy Brother.

411
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,254
''Hi''?
What you mean, ''Hi''?

412
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,340
Like, ''Hi, y'aII
want to be white?''

413
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,009
High, Iike the white man
wants to keep us? Huh?

00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,429
You don't smeII
no weed on me, did you?

415
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,473
Hey, brother, can I get a Iist

417
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,101
Man, you reaIIy need

Whoo!

437
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,145

in the parking Iot beIongs to you?

And secondIy,
this is not a neckIace,

453
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,857
it's a medaIIion
given to me by my father

454

buys a few CeIine Dion records,

Maybe you've heard of it?
