00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,988
Your breakfast, sir.

3
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,800
Pork bellies.

4
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,638
I have a hunch something very exciting
is going to happen

5
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,473
in the pork belly market this morning.

6
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,323
Will Miss Penelope be dining
with you this evening, sir?

7
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,076
Yes. Yes, she will.

8
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,121
-Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
-Morning, Folsey.

9
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:48,972
-Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
-Morning.

10
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,223
Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

-Morning.

MAN 1: Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
MAN 2: Morning, Mr. Winthorpe.

Good morning.

00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:05,947
-Good morning, Mr. Winthorpe.
-Morning.

15
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,637
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

16
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,115
-Good morning, Mr. Duke.
-Good morning, Mr. Duke.

17
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,369
-Good morning, Mr. Duke.
-Morning, Mr. Duke.

00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,538

WOMAN: Good morning, Mr. Duke.

20
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,162
When do we sell?

21
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,665
I just cannot believe
how stupid these scientists are.

22
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,459
"The eternal question."

23
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,586
There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

24
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,131
I don't care
about heredity versus environment.

25
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,383
In fact, I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

26
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,594
I care about how much money
we can get for our pork bellies.

27
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,513
Winthorpe put in a sell order
for 76 and a quarter.

28
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,891
His charts say
that's as high as it's gonna go.

29
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,810
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

30
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,938
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see ifWinthorpe's right.

31
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,319
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I saywe sell now.

32
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,279
Just anotherfew seconds.

33
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,115
The market's closing.
We won't get the order in.

34
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:35,347
Wejust made an extra $347,000.

35
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,350
Get me Winthorpe.

36
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,770
Well, of course I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

37
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:46,107
Oh, yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

38
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,485
I'll see you at the club.

40
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,517
Morning, Mr. Duke.

41
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,020
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

42
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,065
Vietnam did this to me,
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

43
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,694
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?
Yeah, how're you doing?

44
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,195
Spare a poorwar veteran
some change?

45
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,530
I'm on my knees for life.

46
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,699
I have no money to give you.

47
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:40,704
Please, anything. A quarter.
Anything, just a couple of dollars.

48
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,750
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

49
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,838
I don't care what it is.
Smoked ham, anything. Some crackers.

50
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,091
Thanks a lot.
How'd you like a stump up your ass?

51
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,884
Stay out of here!

52
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,720
You got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

53
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,560
Listen to this.

00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,692
"until the Department of Agriculture's
January crop report."

56
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,279
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

57
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,657
Wrong. Quite wrong. Untrue.

58
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,411
They've given this genetics fellow
the Nobel Prize.

59
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,456
The man doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

60
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,585
Randolph. We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orangejuice

61
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,712
and you're talking to me
about human nature.

62
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,672
Money isn't everything, Mortimer.

63
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,090
Oh, grow up.

64
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,259
Mother always said you were g

65
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,178
She meant it as a compliment.

66
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,937
Ezra, right on time.

67
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,108
I'll betyou thought
I'd forgotten your Christmas bonus.

00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,986
There you are.

by myself.

71
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,245
Half of it is from me.

72
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,123
Thank you, Mr. Mortimer.

00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,347
Looking good, Louis.

Feeling good, Todd.

No can do. I'll be having dinner
with Penelope tonight.

Winthorpe, my boy,
what have you got for us?

83
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,087
Well, it's that time ofthe month again.

84
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,674
Payroll checks for our employees,
which require your signatures.

85
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,261
And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

86
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,265
We seem to be paying some
of our employees an awful lot of money.

87
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,059
Can't get around
the old minimum wage, Mortimer.

(CLEARS THROAT)

90
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,867
I meant to ask you about that.

91
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,370
I went through personal records
thoroughly and there doesn't seem to be

92
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,539

Neverforget
she's our grandniece, Winthorpe.

You'd better make
an honestwoman of her.

Well, I'll certainly try, sir.

Actually, the wedding invitations
go out this week.

00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,688
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,650
Don'tworry about this, Winthorpe.

00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,653

-Goodbye, Winthorpe.
-Goodbye, Winthorpe.

00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,131
Winthorpe is a very steady young man.

We're lucky to have him
managing ourfirm for us.

he's the product of good e

With his genes,
you could put Winthorpe anywhere

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,604
and he's gonna come out on top.

Breeding, Randolph,
same as in race horses.

It's in the blood.

Hey, baby, what's happening?
How you doing?

115
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,290
Once you have a man with no legs,
you never go back, baby.

I knowwhatyou're thinking.
You seen Porgy and Bess?

Oh, I'd love to help you, man,

123
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,156
but I ain't seen nothing
since I stepped on that landmine

124
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,034
in Vietcong back in '72.
Itwas rough, very painful.

125
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,495
You were in Nam? So were we. Where?

126
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,958
I was in Sang Bang, Dang Gong.

basically a lot of places, a lot of places.

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,868
I have... I have legs.

138
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,747
I have... Oh shit, look at this.
Man! I can walk.

139
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,083
Jesus, praise Jesus.

140
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,879
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe... Thank you.

141
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,214
I just don't knowwhat to do. It's...

142
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,052
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

143
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,596
This is too much. I can't believe it.

144
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,848
You're beautiful.
Listen, I can't thank you.

First Moses, now this. God, Jesus...

146
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,686
Oh, baby, look at me.

147
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,773
I'm so happy. Oh, God.
Look at me, this is too much.

148
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,317
What a happy day. What a happy day!

149
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,236
Really, I appreciate it, y'all.
Okay now. All right. Look at this.

150
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,240
I can walk. I don't knowwhat to say.
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

You're beautiful,
both ofyou all, the two ofyou.

-Oh, I'm sorry about that, man.
-Stop, thief.

154
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,642
-Help, help!
-What are you talking about, man?

155
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,396
Don't shoot. Take it, take it.
Please don't kill me. I'm getting married.

He's in there. After him.

160

-Excuse me.
-Watch out. He probably has a weapon.

WINTHORPE: Stop him. He has
my briefcase. Stop him! Stop him!

162
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,631
He's inside. That boy's crazy.

-Shit.

MAN 2: Get out ofthe way.

Get him. He's getting away.

There he is. That's him.
Get him. Get him.

He's underthe table.
Somebody go underthere.

00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,393
Somebody get down there.

169
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,770
Right there. Right there. There he is.

170
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,192

I did not. You knocked me down
and tried to grab my briefcase.

-Yeah, but itwas an accident, man.
-An accident, really?

What's going to happen to this man?

back to him.

state prisons and all that?

There's absolutely nothing wrong
with him, I can prove it.

something wrong with him.

Are we talking
about a wager, Randolph?

203
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,929
I suppose you think Winthorpe,
say if he were to lose hisjob,

204
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,932
would resort to holding up people
on the streets?

would be enough forWinthorpe.

00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,590
Soft hands.

673
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,134
And a manicure.

in your life, have you?

the dude that had me busted.

680

-Right overthere.
-That's my car.

696
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,127
Yes, Mr. Valentine, they're waiting
foryou in the last office down the hall.

697
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,654
William, my boy. Right on time.
Come in, come in.

Sit down.

699
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,499
No, thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast this morning.

700
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,502
This is not a meal, Valentine.

701
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,714
We are here to try to explain to you
what it is we do here.

702
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,467
We are commodities brokers, William.

703
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,303
Now, what are commodities?

704
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,515
Commodities are agricultural products.

705
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:38,018
Like coffee, thatyou had for breakfast.

706
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,729
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

707
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,024
Pork bellies,
which is used to make bacon,

708
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:48,028
which you might find in a bacon
and lettuce and tomato sandwich.

709
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:54,535
Then there are other commodities
like frozen orangejuice and gold.

710
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,207
Though, of course,
gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

711
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,877
-Clear so far?
-Yeah.

712
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:08,048
Good, William. Now,
some of our clients are speculating

713
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,969
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

714
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,887
And we have other clients
who are speculating

715
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,807
that the price of gold is going to fall.

716
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:23,730
They place their orders with us
and we buy or sell their gold forthem.

717
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,150
Tell him the good part.

718
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,361
The good part, William, is that,

719
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:34,408
no matterwhether our clients
make money or lose money,

720
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,661

721
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,539
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

722
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,752
Well, it sounds to me
like you guys are a couple of bookies.

723
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,464
I told you he'd understand.

724
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,385
It doesn't take a genius
to figure outwhat happened.

725
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,971
It's the same guy
who tried to rob the payroll.

726
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,182
No doubt about it, that's him.

727
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,267
He planted the drugs on me.

728
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,853

How you guys doing?

729
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,772
RAHIM: Hey, how you doing?
LARRY: Hey, how you doing, baby?

730

You know those people?

731
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,957
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,962
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh, sure, he went to Harvard.

733
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,425
I mean, if he's being driven around
in my car,

734
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,886
he could actually be living in my house.

735
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,680
Maybe he's even taken my job.

736
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,307
You know, for all I know,

737
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,352
right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancée.

738
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,898
And Coleman.
Afteryears of service, this betrayal.

739
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,983
I don't understand it.

740
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,612
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

741
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,323
-The things that I am going to...
-Shut up, Louis.

742
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,991
Listen, taxis cost money,

743
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,577
food costs money
and rent costs money!

744
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,914
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

745
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,211
These were here when I moved in.
Put them on ifyou want.

746
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:19,012

how much I appreciate this...

748
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,017
Ophelia. You realize that
that's the name...

749
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,727
I know, I know, I know.
Hamlet's girlfriend.

750
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,982
He went crazy, she killed herself.
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

751
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,818
Look, I'm 24 years old.

752
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,572
I'm from a small, miserable little mining
town you probably never heard of.

753
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,616
The only thing I've got going for me
in this whole big, wide world

754
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,537
is this body, this face,
and what I got up here.

755
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,217
I don't do drugs
and I don't have a pimp.

756
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,929
This place is a dump,

757
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:05,100
but it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

758
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,395
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

759
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,981
I figure,
I got three more years on my back.

760
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,858
I'll have enough to retire on.

761

You're a prostitute?

762
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,536
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

763
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:29,541
I help you getyourself back on yourfeet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

764
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,003
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

765
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,589
Understood?

766
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,606
By the way,

767
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,193
food and rent are not the only things
around here that cost money.

768

You sleep on the couch.

769
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,492
It's hit rock bottom. Come on, let's buy.

770
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:08,538

771
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,374

is going on here. Justwatch.

All right, butyou all gonna get
reamed on this one.

775

Why shouldn'twe buy now, William?

776
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,553

we're playing with.

of pork bellies is going down, William.

780
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,863
It's Christmastime. Everybody's uptight.

781
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,533
Could we please buy now, Randolph?

782
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,326
All right, ifyou want to lose money,
go ahead.

783
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,620
What are you trying to say, William?

784
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,040
Okay. Pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

785
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,834
Which means everybody's sitting
in their office

786
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,168
and they're waiting forthem
to hit rock bottom

787
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,837
so they can buy cheap and go long.

788
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,506
So people that own the pork belly
contracts are going bat shit.

789
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,134

"Hey, we're losing all our damn money

01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,018

and they panicking.

01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,854

01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:20,026
They out there. They panicking.
Look at them.

800
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,946
He's right, Mortimer, my God, look at it.

801
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,283
I'd wait till you get to about 64,
then I'd buy.

802
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:29,077
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

803
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,998
Do you realize how much money
hejust saved us?

804
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,709
Money isn't everything, Randolph.

805
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:42,549
Advise our clients interested
in bellies to buy at 64.

806
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,510
Mr. Valentine has set the price.

01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,475
Well done, William. Verywell done.

You can count it. It's all there, all of it.

813

It's all there, man, count it.

I'm sure it is, William.
Thank you and keep up the good work.
