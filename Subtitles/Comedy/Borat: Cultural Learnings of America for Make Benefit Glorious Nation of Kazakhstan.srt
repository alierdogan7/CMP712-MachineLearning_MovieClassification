Should I make joke about

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
In America, that's a very popular
joke. Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

122
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,080
I have sexy time with my mother-in-law?
- A what time?

123
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,560
Sexy time. I made sexy time
with my mother-in-law.

124
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,040
You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

125
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,840
I don't think that americans will find
that funny. - No, it is not a joke.

126
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm talking about humor.
- Oh, yes, you ask me about my mother-in-law.

127
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,960
Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?
- No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?

128
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,320
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

129
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.

130
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,680
But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.

131
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,360
My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.

132
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,960
Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.

133
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,440
Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say

134
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
You will never get this!
You will never get this!

135
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,360
He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.

136
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,720
But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!

137
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,640
That would not be funny in America.

138
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,440
What is a NOT jokes?

139
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,920
A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,

140
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,440
and what we do is we make a statement,

141
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,000
that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.

142
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,120
Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.

143
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,760
What color is your suit?
- This suit is grey.

144
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Grey, I would call it blue.
- It's grey.

145
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
All right, it's blue grey,
but it certainly not black.

146
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Let's say it's grey
- It is grey.

147
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,640
A NOT joke I would say:
that suit is black NOT!

148
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,120
This suit is not black.
- No, no, no. Not needs to be at the end.

149
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,000
This suit is black-not.

150
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
This suit is black, pause, you know what
pause is? - Yes.

151
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,640
This suit is black NOT!

152
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,240
This suit is black pause NOT.

153
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
You don't say pause.
This suit is black.

154
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
That's a pause NOT.

155
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,080
This suit is black.
- Ok.

156
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,080
NOT.

157
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,920
Everybody say USA television much better,
but this I watch for three hours and do not change.

158
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,760
This two arrows to change the channel.

159
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,480
Be careful, be careful, CJ.

160
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,480
This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.

161
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,440
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.

162
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,000
And the ass hole of a 7 years old.

163
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,280
For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,480

165
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Why you aren't you ready?!

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,960
Learn what you can from this women's group.

169
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,560
My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.

170
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,360
In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Except for in brothel or in grave.

172
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,520
In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
I find them all.

174
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,360
Feminist Veterans Of America.

175
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,360
So what does means this feminism?

176
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,080
It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...

177
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,280
You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.

178
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,720
But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?

180
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,840
That is wrong.

181
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,160
But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.

182
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,720
Your government scientist?
He's wrong.

183
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?

184
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,040
Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.

185
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,520
I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.

186
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,080
All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,480
Who was this CJ?

188
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
Last night, I see, in my hotel room,

189
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,840
a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.

190
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,480
She from a town called the Baywatches.

191
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,480
She's just on television.
Her name was Pamela.

192
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,480
Do she live here in New York?
- She lives in California.

193
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,000
O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.

194
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,120
Ok, can we finish now?

195
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,480
Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.

196
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,080
We're finished, we have to leave.

197
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,560
Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.

198
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,640
or else my wife will snap off my cock.

199
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.

200
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,920
I have a telegram for you.

201
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,600
You can read?
- Yes, I can.

202
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,200
Dear Boratsendiev, your wife
Oksana was walking your retarded

203
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,720
brother in the woods when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

204
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,280
She is now dead.

205
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,040
What you saying my wife is dead?

206
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,120
This it what it's...

207
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,040
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.

208
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,200
Hi 5!

209
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
What do you mean "California"?

210
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,960
I have arranged all our filming for New York.

211
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,480
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America -

212
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,960
Rodeos, cowboys...
it will be better for our documentary.

213
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
But why California?
What's there?

214
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Pearl Harbor is there...
and so is Texas.

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,560
Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California

216
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,280
and make our reportings along
the way.

217
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,520
He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

218
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,280
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.

219
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,880
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your
driving instructor. Wellcome to our country.

220
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,960
My name Borat.

221
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

222
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,600
Now, you do know how to drive a
little bit? - Yes.

223
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,960
Put it in D.
- What?

224
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Drive.

225
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,680
Wait a second, wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?

226
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,920
Yes, many times.
- All right, let's go this way.

227
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,160
Wait a minute, I don't want
you to hit anybody.

228
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,840
Now use two hands now.
- What?

229
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,320
But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.

230
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,440
I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?

231
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,400
Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.

232
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,520
Must not hit the children.

233
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,800
Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?

234
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,280
And maybe make a sexy time with her.

235
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

236
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,880
What!? They do?
- There must be consent.

237
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,320
How about that. That's good, ha?

238
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,560
It's not good for me.

239
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,680
You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.

240
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,720
Who is this car that follow us?

241
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.

242
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,040
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.

243
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
We'll make a right turn right here.

244
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.

245
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,440
You fuck my mother.

246
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,640
He.. do before.
Look on me.

247
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,880
They're gonna throw us in jail.
Me with you.

248
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,320
Why in jail.
He look on me! Behind.

249
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,400
You can't say that.

250
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,720
I like you? Do you like me?
- I do like you.

251
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,160
You are my friend? - You're a nice
young man and I am your friend.

252
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,880
Will you be my boyfriend?
- I won't be your boyfriend.

253
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,520
Why not? You don't like me?
- Don't push, I can be.

254
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,760
Great success. Now time to make purchase
of motorcars.

255
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,000
I want to have a car that attract woman
with a shave down below.

256
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,800
That would be a Corvette.
Or a Hummer.

257
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,360
We will try to help you out here.

258
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,880
A man, yesterday, tell me,
if I buy a car,

259
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,800
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
- He means a car that women would like.

260
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,680
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, no there's no magnet.

261
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.

262
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,040
Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

263
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,080
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

264
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,480
There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.

265
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,000
If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?

266
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,120
It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!

267
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,520
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.

268
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,880
How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?

269
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,520
With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.

270
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,560
When I buy my wife,

271
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,200
at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,

272
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,200
and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,

273
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,240
she become weak, her voice become a deep
Borat, Borat.

274
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,960
She receive a heir on chest.

275
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,480
And her vagin hang like
sleeve of wizard.

276
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,640
How do I know that this will not
happen with the car?

277
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
Chevrolet guarrantees that with
the warantee.

278
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,720
I like very much buy this Hommers.
How much is it? - 52 thousand.

279
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,080
I am looking for something between
600- 650 dollars.

280
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,120
We don't have cars for 650 in
that you can buy.

281
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,320
I might be able to sell you
a ho-sale car, a car with a lot of mileage

282
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,080
for 700 but with no warranty.
- Ok.

283
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,800
California, I coming.

284
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,000
First on my journey was Washington DCs,
home of the mighty US warlords,

285
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,360
premier Bush.

286
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,600
Look who has an embassy here!

287
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,320
Fuck you, mother fuckers!

288
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,720
We arrive here to learn from
american politic.

289
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,760
As I arrange interview with party
official from ruling regime.

290
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,080

Former Georgia Congressman.

291
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,920
We're are good friend, yes?
- I hope so.

292
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:46,200
It is custom to have cheese
at the start. - Thank you.

293
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,560
My wife, she make this cheese.
- Very nice.

294
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,000
She make it from a milk from her tit.

295
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,720
After interview, I encounter
traditional american street festival.

296
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,960
Gay Pride Parade

297
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,040
People here were much more friendly
than in New York.

298
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,240
Next morning, I interview politician
who is a genuine chocolate face.

299
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,840
No make-up.

300
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,960
ALAN KEYES
2-time Republican Presidential Candidate.

301
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,880
On a sunday, I arrive in Washingtons,
there was a parade, I make two friends,

302
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,240
from this parade, I invite them back to my
hotel room, we drink like a normal in Kazakstan,

303
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,000
we wrestle like a normal in Kazakstan,

304
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,240
then they say I wash you in the shower,
he wash me in the shower.

305
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,760
It sounds like you met somebody who is from,
what is called in America, the Gay community.

306
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,480
What it mean... gay?
- Homosexual.

307
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,080
Homosexual... you mean?

308
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,400
You telling me that man who tried to put
rubber fist in my anus was homosexual?

309
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Even though my anus was broken, I knew that
rest of our journey would be great success.

310
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,160
We left Washingtons and continue towards
California. Howdy, partners!

311
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes Minister, we're on schedule.

312
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,960

middle of Times Square.

It is time to prepare for your
TV appearance.

314
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Remember to talk of singing
National Anthem at rodeo.

315
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Don't worry, I am a TV professional.

316
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,240
This morning, we have a very special guest
here in the studio, this is Borhat Sahadyev.

right here that's the microphone.

332
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,120
Hello, hello, nice to meet you.

333
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,280
Welcome to the United States. Thank you
very much for coming on, we appreciate it.

334
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,440
When you come to Kazakstan,
you can stay my house,

335
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,320
you can sleep my house and
you can use my sister.

336
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,560
Metereologist Ted Johnson with the latest
on tropical storm...

337
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,440
Traffic is flowing along smoothly along
interstate 55

338
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,760
Very nice have me.
What your name?

339
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,240
We're on air right now, doing the weather.

340
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,680
Go with Adrianne, she's calling you
to go over here.

341
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,240
He is a she? - Somehow!
- Very nice.

342
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,360
What your name? What you do here?
- I'm the weather guy.

343
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Let's get over to the weather.
You can see the rain..

344
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,080
Nice to meet you!
- Thank you.

345
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,960
You are singing at a rodeo tonight!
Why didn't you mention it?

346
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,520
What can I do? They are not professional.

347
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,120
Get a move on, we have
100 miles to go.

348
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,040
Of course, every picture that we get back
from the terrorists or anything else

349
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,520
the muslims, they look like you,
like your black moustache

350
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,520
Shave your damn moustache so you not
look so conspicuous

351
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,320
so you look like maybe an italian, or
something, as far as people looking at you.

352
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,840
I see a lot of people....
Young muslims working on bomb... strapped to it.

353
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,440
And you probably are not a muslim.
Maybe that't not your religion.

354
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,120
No, I'm kazak. I follow the hawk.
- But you look like one.

355
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,840
This thing gets over with, and we win it,
and kick the butts over there,

356
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,440
and all the damn sons of the buck hanging
from the gallow, by that time,

357
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,880
you've proven yourself and they'll
understand you and be accepted.

358
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,480
I don't kiss you.
- Why not?

359
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,160
The people that do the kissing over here
are the one that float around like that.

360
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,880
Ah, they...
- Yes, they'll wait for them to kiss.

361
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,200
In my country, they take them and they take
them to jail and finish them.

362
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,080
Take around and hang them?
That's what we're trying to get done here.

363
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,240
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
give a worm american welcome

364
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,600
to a gentleman who has come all the
way from Kazakstan

365
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,360
and we are honored to have singing our
national anthem

366
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Borat Sagdiyev.

367
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,200
My name Borat. I come from Kazakstan.
Can I say first

368
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,640
we support your war of terror.

369
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,160
May we show our support to our
boys in Irak.

370
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,880
May US and A kill every
single terrorist.

371
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,840
May George Bush drink the blood of every
single man, woman and child of Irak.

372
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,720
May you destroy that country so that for
the next thousand years

373
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,560
not even a single lizard will survive
in their desert.

374
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,080
To show our friendship,
I now will sing

375
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,400
our kazak national anthem to the tune
of your national anthem.

376
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,800
Listen.

377
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,640
Kazakstan is the greatest
country in the world,

378
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,960
All other countries are run
by little girls,

379
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Kazakstan is number one
exporter of potasium,

380
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:09,000
Other central asian countries
have in theory our potasium

381
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,000
Kazakstan is the greatest country
in the world,

382
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,360
All other countries is the home
of the gays.

383
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,960
We nearly died last night.
This journey is cursed.

384
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
We should have stayed in New York.

385
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,080
I was sad. The rodeo peoples
did not like me.

386
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
What if Pamela did not like me too?

387
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,080
We needed something to change
our fortunes.

388
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Look Azamat, a Gypsy village.

389
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,080
Let us extract some of their tears
so we can remove the curse.

390
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,080
Do not fear me, gipsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

391
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,040
Let's give them to me or
I would take them.

392
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm not a gipsy. I'm midwestern
farmer's daughter, americana.

393
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,960
You have many treasures.
Who did your rob for this?

394
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,760
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

395
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,680
I will look in your treasures, gipsy.

396
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,120
Is this understood?
I will look on them. - Please, do.

397
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,080
Who is this lady you shrunk? Was she the owner
of this house that you came in front of?

398
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
There's couple more child's doll.

399
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,680
Do not try and shrink me, gipsy.
I, serious.

400
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,360
These are your spells?

401
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,040
No, look on this.

402
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, Baywatch.
- Baywatch.

403
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,440
Azamat, great success!
I have the tears.

404
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,280
Onwards to California!

405
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,960
Lets go!

406
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,480
What's that you've got there?

407
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,480
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

408
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,160
Are we going the right way?

409
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
I do not know, this map is from 1917.

410
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
- Where the hell are we?

411
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I am going to stop to ask.

412
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,160
- No, no, no, keep going. Keep going.

413
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,720
I need a direction to California, please.
- You're far away from home.

414
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,680
I travel with my friend Azamat Bagatov,
we travel across the country

415
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,880
You look like Michael Jackson,
Beat It.

416
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,760
I like you, peoples. Can you teach me how
to dress? How can I be like you?

417
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,680
First is to loosen up your belt

418
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,440
Don't pull down like you try to go...

419
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,040
Like this?
- But don't show your Huggies down there.

420
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,560
What kind of music do you listen to?

421
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,840
I like very much...
Do you know...?

422
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,720
You gotta lick it,
before you kick it.

423
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,480
Can you teach me speak like you?
- What you're trying to say?

424
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,160
How do you say How do you do?
- What's up with it.

425
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,480
Pull over and let's see
if we can stay here.

426
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,520
What's up with it, vanilla face?

427
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,200
Me and my homie Azamat just
park our slab outside,

428
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,440
We're looking for somewhere to post up
are black asses for the night.

429
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,160
So, bang-bang, skid, skid,
nigger.

430
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,640
We're just a couple of people

431
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,000
Leave now or we'll call the cops
and have you taken out.

432
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,160
We can't stay here,
they are 'player haters'.

433
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,320
You have a room for tonight?
- Yes, definitely.

434
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,120
So, come on in. Your friend also.

435
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Beautiful house. This..
- All the paintings in the house I did.

436
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,360
What is this man?
- This is a yemenite jew, and he's working

437
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,600
on a piece of jewellry. The yemenites were
also jewellers.

438
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,280
Why do you have a picture of a jew?
- Because I'm jewish, so.

439
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,240
This is the room, and...

440
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,880
do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

441
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,440
Great. Thank you.
Lovely place.

442
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,280
They're Jews.
- I know that now.

443
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,240
Look if we can stay here.

444
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,640
We cannot stay here,
they are motherfuckers.

445
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,440
They'll kill us.
We need to escape.

446
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,680
Wait, wait.
- Ok.

447
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,960
Hello.
- How are you? - Great.

448
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,520
This is a special sandwich for you.
- I not so hungry.

449
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,800
He can eat this.
Here, fat.

450
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,120
Take a half.

451
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,040
Not so hungry.
- Eat a little bit.

452
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,720
Go ahead, eat something, because you're
hungry and you're a guest.

453
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't want to see you go hungry.

454
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,960
What is this picture over here?

455
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,160
It is three in the morning, I am in
the nest with jews.

456
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,880
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

457
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,280
One of them has taken the form of a
little old woman.

458
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,080
You can barely see her haunts.

459
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,600
She have try to poison me already.

460
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,320
This rats are very clever.

461
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,280
Look, the Jews have
shifted their shapes.

462
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,240
OK, OK. How much shall
I give them?

463
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,960
I don't know.

464
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,480
More.
Give them more.

465
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,360
Go, go.

466
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Let's go back to New York,
at least there's no Jews there.

467
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,160
Calm down.
We'll keep heading to California.

468
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,960
Why California?
What's so special about California?

469
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
We are going to California!

470
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,480
And get killed on the way?

471
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,080
Relax Azamat!
I will get us protection.

472
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,720
What is the best gun to defend
from a jew?

473
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,520
I would recommend either a 9 mm
or a 45.

474
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,360
Very nice!

475
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,440
I, movie star, Dirty Harold.

476
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,400
Come on and make my name, jew.

477
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,280
But he would not sell me guns,
since I'm not american.

478
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,240
So I look for other protection.

479
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,640
What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

480
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,840
Is this a cat in a hat?

481
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,080
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

482
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,160
I need the animal for protection.
What you have for me?

483
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,440
We're safe
Now we continue to California.

484
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,480
Switch it off.
It's so annoying.

485
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,440
Happy times. We were safe and well
on our way to Pamela.

486
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
It was time to get back to work.

487
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Kazakhstan needs to learn about
American fine dining.

488
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,440
First, a lady will teach you
Southern manners.

489
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
How long have I got?

490
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,960
An hour. Then you have
dinner date with high society.

491
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,720
Hello and nice meet you. - Hello, it's so
nice to meet you. welcome to America.

492
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,080
Will you please teach me how to
dine like gentlemen?

493
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,480
Of course, I'll be happy to.

I make entry? - Yes, it is.

00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,360

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,440
to people right in your vicinity.
- Very nice.

502
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,600

503
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,480

You are retard?
- Yes.

507
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,520
Physical or mental?

508
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,440
Retired.
- Not retarded.

509
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,240

511
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,280
That's not what he was saying.
He is not what you refer to as retard.

512
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,880
Do you have a telephone in this village?

513
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,000
Should I show photos of my family?
- You have photos of your family. Wonderful.

514
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,320
This my favourite son,...

He grow 6 centimetreand now is
17 centimetre long.

518
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm not sure one would show this photo to...

519
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,440
Should I pay compliments to the peoples?
- Yes.

520
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,760
But only if you truly agree with
that compliment.

521
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,840
You have a very gentle face,

522
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
and a very erotic physique.

523
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,360
That's a very good observation.

524
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,360
She is your wife?
- No, that's my wife.

525
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,640
In my country, they would go crazy.

526
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,480
For this two,
not so much...

527
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,080
What should I say if I need to
go to the shit-hole?

528
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,480
You mean to the restroom?

529
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,360
To the place to make the shit.
- Bathroom?

530
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,400
Not the bath to make dirty hands...
The brown... - The toilet.

531
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,920
Where you make, you understand...
bad, bad thing from.

532
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,640
What you do..
- Brown.

533
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,400
You say, excuse me, I need to go to the
restroom.

534
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,120
Excuse me, is it possible to go and do...

535
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,760
how you say in there, you know...

536
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,520
Excuse me a moment.

537
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,920
I think that the cultural differences
are... vast. - Exactly.

538
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,440
And I think he is a delightful man...
and it wouldn't take

539
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,400
a very large time for him to really
become americanized.

540
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,240
Thank you very much, I feel much better.
Cindy, where should I put this?

541
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,680
Excuse me for just a moment.

542
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,200
Like this. And you wipe your bottom.
And you put the paper.

543
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,920
I? - You. No, I wouldn't.
This is a very private thing.

544
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,960
The host cleans the anus of the other?
- No, no, no.

545
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,240
Nobody touches you except you.

546
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

547
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,600
If you have been invited to a home
or to a party... - Yes.

548
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,040
it is acceptable to bring a guest if
you ask your host in advance.

549
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,200
Hi, I'm looking for Borat.
- Yes, is me.

550
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,720
This my friend, Luennel.

551
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,320
I don't know exactly what all that we're
doing. It is getting very, very late.

552
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,080
You have to excuse me.
I have to go home.

553
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,480
It's getting very very late and it's time...

554
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
that we are ending our dinner party
and everything.

555
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,080
But can she come for desserts?

556
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
Absolutly not and neither can you!

557
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,240
The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

558
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,280
Why you call police?
Has the retard escaped?

559
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,400
I want say I'm very sorry way treat
you in this house. - Thank you.

560
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,560
I was thinking maybe I just take the night
off and...

561
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,240
Why don't we just go out and have some
fun. What do you think about that?

562
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
You want to come with us?

563
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,120
Up yours!

564
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,920
Hi, my name Borat. This my
friend, Luenell.

565
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,680
She is a prostitute.

566
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,200
You were funny on this wolf.
Everybody almost see your underpants.

567
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,080
I never rode a bull before.

568
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,320
You wanna come in for a little while?

569
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,360
I would like very much...

570
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,840
but I in love with a woman in Malibu.

571
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,560
It would be nice to her for me to...

572
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,040
If you ever in town again,
look me up.

573
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,680
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

574
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,560
I would very much like to
pay you for sex.

575
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,120
Good night, Luenells.
- Good night, Borat.

576
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,280
You say my name right.

577
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
...she recently explained...

578
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,480
...I very spontaneous...

579
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,960
I'm very spontaneous too.

580
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,680
I needed a gift to give to Pamela so that
she would grant me entry into her vagin.

581
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,760
Therefore, I convince Azamat to let me
film a report in a american store.

582
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,640
Don't spend more than 3 dollars.
We're low on money.

583
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,920
This your shops?
- Right, this is my antique shop.

584
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,040
Why do you have so many things with a flag?
- We're honouring our heritage.

585
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,040
And in here.
What is this?

586
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,080
These are a number of collectibles,
I mean, this is...

587
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,720
A lamp. You know, to use in your home.
This is a chinese closet...

588
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,240
And this is just a little decorative
derrick.

589
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,680
And... do you think..
you know... when they...

590
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,000
You need help?
- No, it's ok.

591
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,200
I sorry.

592
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,960
Don't worry, my friend...
he can make glue...

593
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,640
I don't think you gonna be able to glue
that stuff back, I think you gonna have

594
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,680
to pay for it.

595
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,320
Ok, I have digital watch from the future.

596
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,560
I will give you this.
We are small than all of this.

597
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,160
You broke 425 $ worth of stuff.

598
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,240
160,...170...

599
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,160
...180.
- That's not enough.

600
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,520
Do you want a hair?
- No, I don't want any damn hair.

601
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,960
This is the best hair in Kazakstan. Feel the
quality. - I don't want your damn hair.

602
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,720
This hair from pubis. I can get you
2000 bags by next friday.

603
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
We don't use that stuff in this country.

604
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,800
Have you offered them pubic hair?

605
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,800
- Yes!

606
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,720
Just gimme another 20, that's good
enough.

607
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
It was a mistake.

608
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,640
- You screwed up again!

609
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,240
I didn't see the truck.

610
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,200
I slipped on it and that was it.

611
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,240
- Only an idiot could do this.

612
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Would you have believe this
if I have told you?

613
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,000
All right, go, go!

614
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,120
You have ruined this documentary
and almost bankrupt us!

615
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,120
- So call the Ministry
and get more money.

616
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,120
What?!  If I did that they
would kill us!

617
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,640
California better be as good as you
say, or we're finished.

618
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,640
You bastard!

619
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,120
What's the matter with you?!

620
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,120
How dare you make
hand-party over Pamela!

621
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Why do you care who I
pleasure myself to?

622
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Because I love this woman!

623
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,120
She's the reason
we travel to California!

624
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,640
What?

625
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,640
You lied to me!

626
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,360
You lied about California!

627
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,280
Lhal jsi o Kalifornii!

628
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,920
Eat my asshole!

629
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,120
- Mortgage Brokers Annual Banquet -

630
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,680
So.. bad news.

631
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,200
Azamat leave.

632
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,760
And he also decide to take all money
and also my passport.

633
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,760
And, he leave me all this bag.

634
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,120
It's a hen.

635
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,800
And ticket to Kazakstan,
but no passport.

636
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But at least he's...

637
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,680
man enough to leave me...

638
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,280
my beautiful.

639
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,760
Which I have cleaned since last night.

640
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,120
And I decide to continue
making documentary.

641
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,720
Making without Azamat I think it will
be better.

642
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,160
I will have a.... without.

643
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,800
I only want 17 cents, please.

644
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,320
I have no car, no money and
no Azamat.

645
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,840
The only thing keep me going was my dream
of one day holding Pamela in my arms

646
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,760
and then making romance explosion
on her stomach.

647
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,080
Aventually, I managed to hike a hichings with group
of young scholars also travelling across country.

- I try.

654
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,480
So you like the bitches out there,

What be a bitch?

656
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,200
It's a fucking halloos,
baby, the fucking girls.

657
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,480
You fuck the shit out of me.
And then you never call them again.

658
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,760
Why you don't call them, because they
do not have a telephone, yes?

659
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,760
They do not have my respect.
- So what do you do here in America?

660
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:59,400
They film me travel across US and A.

Anyone that is minority has the uppper hand.

You in America now.
You'll make it. You keep going.

690
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,000
You're bigger than a woman.
You're better than a woman.

691
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,120
We'll always be behind you.
- Do not let a woman ever...

692
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,040

- Goodbye, my friend.

693
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,360

Run to freedom.

697
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,480
Go! Go!
I leave you alive.

698
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,240
It is good to be here.

699
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,880
This is my tenth penticostal camp
meeting, a decade.

700
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,880
The bottom line is we're a
christian nation now,

701
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,040
we were a christian nation in the beginning,
and we gonna always be a christian nation

702
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,600
until good Lord returns. Amin.

703
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,280
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

704
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,120
I didn't use to be a...,
I is what I is.

705
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,560
I don't care what the devil is done to you
or what he's trying to do,

706
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,960
all you have to do is step
out of that... now,

707
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,600
and make your way down to this altar,
let's have a little old time church right now.

708
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,880
I need somebody to play for me right now.

709
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,560
The blood over my neighbour.
I believe the blood over my church.

710
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,760
I want you to help to save me, please.

711
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,800
Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman standing
right here next to me, his name is Bolak,

712
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,320

714
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,280
I have no friends, I am alone
in this country.

715
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,640
Nobody like me.
My only friend Azamat

he leave me alone.

01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,520

01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,160
Nobody love my neighbour

727
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,200
Can Jesus heal the pain that is
in my heart?

728
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,520
Jesus can heal the pain in your
heart.

729
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,160
Make him heal the pain that is in my heart.
- Lift your hands.

730
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,720
And begin to worship.
As we pray in the name of Jesus.

731
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,640
I think I near I see him.

732
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,280
Cleanse me, God, cleanse me.

733
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,080

734
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,920

I will go to Malibu with me
and my friend, mister Jesus.

738
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,120
And together, we will take her.

739
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,800
I took a bus to Los Angeles with
some friends of mister Jesus.

740
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,000
Finally, I have arrive.

741

Azamat?

743
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,360
You traitor!

744
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,360
Look, I can explain!

745
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,360
You attack me.
My mustache still tastes of your ass!

746
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,360
Calm down.
Let me explain.

747
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,840
What did you do with the bear?

748
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,360
She ran off! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

749
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,360
Hey! Fuck off, Death!

750
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,360
You need to calm yourself.

751
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,160
You have to calm down.

752
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,280
Ok, ok. Take it easy.

753
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,880
Well thats another fine mess
you've gotten me into.

754
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,760
I have not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.

755
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,560
I have come to make Pamela
Anderson my wife.

756
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,880
So I forgave Azamat.

757
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,600
I knew that you'd make it, Borat.

758
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,080
I felt so bad that I prepared this.

759
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,080
It's everything I could find about Pamela.

760
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:51,360
Last friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty toward animals.

761
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,360
<i>Against</i> cruelty toward animals?

762
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,360
And tomorrow she's doing autographs.

763
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,880
She wrote a book.

764
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,360
What? A woman has written a book?

765
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,560
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

766
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,880
I know.

767
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,640
We will go to this historical event
and I will marry Pamela there.

768
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,680
...but in the traditional Kazakh way.

769
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,480

770
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,360

789
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,720
Pamela... Don't worry...

790
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,400
I never stood... my wife.

791
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,400
Pamela, I will give you your own plow.

792
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,680
Put your hands around your back.
- OK.

793
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,840
Pamela, I am not attracted to you
any more!

794
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,880
NOT!

795
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,840
I was humiliated.

796
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,280
It was time for me to return
to New York,

797
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,600
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

798
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,160
While I sat on the bus, I thought of my
journey over the past three weeks.

799
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,520
The great times.

800
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,640
The good times.

801
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,600
And the shit times.

802
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,760
Mainly there were shit times.

803
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,800
I have come to America to learn
lessons for Kazakstan.

804
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,520
But what had I learn?

805
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Suddenly, I realized.

806
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,000
I have learned that if you chase a dream,

807
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,200
especially one with plastic chests,

808
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,560
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.

809
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
8 Months Later.

810
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,240
Welcome back in my town of Kusek.

811
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,160
Since I return, there has been
much improvements.

812
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,600
We no longer here running of the jew,
it's cruel.

813
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,200
