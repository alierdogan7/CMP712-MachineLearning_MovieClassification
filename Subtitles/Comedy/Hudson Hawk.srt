00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,491
Long ago, the duke of Milan
commissioned a little-known artist

2
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,379
...to erect a mammoth statue
of a horse.

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,924
The time was 1481.

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,678
The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,306
The guy on the donkey
is just a guy on a donkey.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,062
Anyway, they called this statue
the Sforza...

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,397
...and it was gonna be
the largest bronze statue ever built.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,981
But wouldn't you know it...

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,193
...war broke out,
and bronze became scarce.

10
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,451
So da Vinci decided
to create a machine...

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,239
...to change common lead
into bronze.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,500
But when da Vinci
finally turned this machine on...

13
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,960
...it was to give him something
more than he expected.

14
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,295
Something much more than bronze.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,510
Leonardo, che pazzo!

The one of cat burglary.

33
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,262
--Was getting out of Sing Sing.

34
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,474
He was known
<i>as</i> the Hudson Hawk.

35
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,899
Got a coat, hat.

36
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,855
Here's your personal items.

37
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,861
Here's your wallet.

38
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,239
I think you'll find
everything in there.

39
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,195
Don't you want your receipt?

40
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,984
Keep it. Ready?

41
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,903
I got it, Charlie.

42
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,117
Eddie. Eddie.

43
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,658
So the Hudson Hawk is
finally getting out.

44
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,247
Remember all the reporters
that here when you came in?

45
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,128
"World's greatest cat burglar."

46
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,164
Now who gives a fuck?

47
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,583
I got a proposition for you.

48
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,467
Answer's no, Gates.
Even if you bathe.

49
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,470
Listen, smartass, as your
parole officer, I found you a job.

50
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,179
- No way.
- It's a terrific job. An auction house.

51
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,093
One night's work, and you're free.

52
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,433
No checking in with <i>a</i> shrink.
No more community service.

53
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,598
But I want to do
community service.

54
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,109
I want to teach the handicapped
how to yodel.

55
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,941
I ain't stealing no more, Gates.

56
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,572
Ten years later, you're still
impressed with yourself.

57
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,110
Same old coat, same old hat.
You're extinct, Hawk.

58
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,370
Coming from you,
that's a powerful statement.

59
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,405
Look, aren't you supposed to stop me
from committing crimes.

60
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,416
You know, "Book 'em, Danno."
"Give a hoot, don't pollute."

61
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,794
You ain't out yet, wise guy.

62
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,457
I can set you up and send you back
any time I want.

63
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:42,847
It's a very fine line
between ex-con and escaped con.

64
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,099
Hey, Gates, do it yourself.

65
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,182
Hey! He's got my keys!

66
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,721
I'll be seeing you, Hawk!

67
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,271
Open the gate!

68
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,367
- See you around, Mike.
- Take it easy, Eddie.

69
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,884
That's the first thing I did:

70
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,970
Smooch the ground
and taste the freedom.

71
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,135
Sorry I'm late, Eddie.
I miss anything?

72
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,929
As always,
your timing is impeccable.

73
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,685
- Where's the kiss?
- Get away from me.

74
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,946
No tongue this time, I promise.

75
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,356
Whoa.

76
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,617
What?

77
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,824
- Looks like you been expanding your--
- Don't say it, Eddie!

78
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,365
I'm incredibly sensitive
about my fucking figure.

79
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,001
My next word was gonna be
“consciousness"...

80
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,628
...tubbo.

81
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,375
You're free, you son of a bitch!

82
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,843
Now that you're born again,
what do you wanna do?

83
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,304
Statue of Liberty?
Entertain some ladies?

84
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,344
Broadway tix?
Seduce some women?

85
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,480
Play Nintendo?
Bone some chicks?

86
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,647
What's Nintendo?

87
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,857
Just get me to
the Five Tone, Tommy.

88
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,364
I don't get a cappuccino soon,
I'll strangle somebody.

89
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,571
You still got a thing for those
unmasculine European coffees?

90
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,204
- What can I say?
- Who's your buddy?

91
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,367
The man knows! The man knows!

92
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,207
So, Mr. Coffee, you have
any trouble checking out?

93
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,416
Not much.

94
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,879
Gates just tried to blackmail me
into doing a job.

95
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,135
That doughnut-hole-eating,
son of a bitch...

96
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,763
...take-it-in-the-ear-for-a-beer
rat bastard!

97
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,720
Had the perfect amount of foam.

98
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,510
Come on, I'll get you 10 of them
back at the bar.

99
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,099
An auction house? Gates wants you
to rob an auction house?

100
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,730
Yes, an auction house.
What are you, going deaf?

101
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,439
He's your parole officer, for Christ's sake.
And, look, I am not going deaf.

102
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,649
Tommy, just get me
in the Five Tone.

103
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,189
Yeah, all right.

104
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,733
"Going deaf."
Don't make fun of my hearing, right?

105
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,698
Tell you something about the bar.
You're gonna love it.

106
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,908
Five Tone Bar and Grill.

107
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,076
At least I know there's one thing
that will never cha--

108
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,744
I don't know how
to tell you this, Eddie.

109
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,538
Couple of brokers stopped in
for Stoli spritzers one night.

110
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,504
Now we're a nice local bar
that none of the locals can afford.

111
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,261
I read about these people
in Newsweek.

112
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,966
Where's all the regulars?

113
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,349
- Where's Crazy Jeff Cava?
- Gone.

114
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,805
- Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?
- Gone, Eddie.

115
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,312
Tommy, you took down
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

116
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,723
Eddie, Eddie, they're all gone.

117
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,812
But look at the bright side:

118
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,228
Half this joint is yours.

119
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,398
Hey, Blackjack! Give my
irritable partner a cappuccino.

120
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,066
I gotta go be a boss.

121
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,030
Give me a Scotch and water.
Thanks.

122
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:56,369
- Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!
- Yo!

123
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,125
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

124
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,684
Cute shot, Antony.

125
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,569
Cesar Mario. Antony Mario.

126
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,355
I didn't know the circus
was in town.

127
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,899
So why won't you do
the auction house?

128
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,363
Well, call me superstitious, Cesar.

129
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,201
I don't like to commit a crime
within 24 hours of getting out of the joint.

130
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,333
It's very simple.
There's a safe on the seventh ﬂoor.

131
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,960
You take their thingy
and you put it in this thingy.

132
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,962
Directions even your brother
could understand.

133
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,998
Yeah, directions
even I could understand.

134
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,758
Shut up.

135
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,794
Hawk, you're the best.

136
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,930
You're the only one who can
do this job. You know that.

137
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,432
Don't tell me a lot of horse shit,
you wanna open up a hardware store...

138
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,719
...go straight and sell spatulas.

139
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,810
You know Cesar, if the Mario brothers weren't
New Jersey's third-largest crime family...

140
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,770
...I'd say kiss my ass.

141
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,062
But considering your status,
I will say slurp my butt.

142
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,275
- Sit.
- Sit.

143
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,405
Have you lovely ladies
tried our house wine?

144
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,612
- I think you'll enjoy.
- Beat it, Tommy.

145
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,527
No dinosaurs allowed.

146
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,695
Enough!

147
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,461
You don't do that auction house job,
I'm gonna put you on trial...

148
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,212
...and I promise you, my friend...

149
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,123
...there will be no bailiff.

150
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,633
You understand?

151
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,169
Get him out of here.

152
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,485
-"Witchcraft."
- Three minutes, 57 seconds.

153
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,321
-"Night and Day"?
- Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald?

154
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,032
- Sinatra.
- Five minutes, 12 seconds.

155
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,662
"Hit the Road, Jack."

156
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,869
Tommy, where are my
needle-nose pliers?

157
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,625
Check the bar. "Hit the Road, Jack."

158
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,880
Five minutes, 15 seconds.

159
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,918
How the hell could you take this down, man?
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

160
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,212
Don't you remember the night he came in?
Nobody could figure out where he got this thing.

161
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,096
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

162
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,054
- Yes?
- Quiet. Come here.

163
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,436
We got a nasty little safe
on the seventh ﬂoor here.

164
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,596
- Simpson?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,516
- What's the mechanism?
- Seventy-one.

166
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,027
Last time I went to bat,
Simpson only made a 40.

167
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,189
So it's gonna take you another
extra 31 seconds to seduce it.

168
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,357
- I'm not worried about the safe, Tommy.
- I know you're not worried about it.

169
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,650
What about these guards?
We know any of these guys?

170
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,864
No.

171
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,119
- Not one?
- Not one. No.

172
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,872
- Well, what about the video surveillance?
- I have a plan.

173
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,954
- Oh, you got a plan.
- I have a great plan.

174
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,337
Great.

175
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,748
What the hell am I doing?

176
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,134
Huh? What the hell am I doing?
I'm getting ready to do some crime.

177
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,545
Go rob some fakakta horse
with you?

178
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,837
All right, Eddie--

179
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,677
I should be out there
getting myself a Daily News,

180
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,308
looking in the "Want Ads“
trying to get a job selling spatulas.

181
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,889
We're moving too fast, Eddie.

182
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,852
You see, I'm putting out a fire
with kerosene.

183
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,439
- What is that?
- That's five seconds. My record's 18.

184
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,648
Is this funny?

185
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,859
You think this is
some kind of fucking joke?

186
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,175
- How many seconds?
- How many what seconds?

187
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,710
On the thumbcuffs.

188
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,006
Not counting the bitching and whining,
I'll be nice and say eight.

189
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,769
You know, they're not gonna let you
walk away from this job, kiddo.

190
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,272
I ain't never gonna get
rehabilitated this way, Tommy.

191
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,103
You think you still got it, Eddie?

192
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,484
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

193
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,988
-"Mack the Knife"?
- Four minutes, 17 seconds.

194
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,819
"I Only Have Eyes for You."

195
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,654
Why, Tommy,
I didn't know you cared.

196
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,114
Three minutes, <i>22</i> seconds.

197
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,074
-"Xanadu."
-"Xanadu"?

198
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,706
-"Xanadu.“
- Four minutes, 19 seconds.

199
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,834
"Star-spangled Banner."
Whitney Houston, Super Bowl XVII.

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,619
- Hi.
- Hi, Hank.

201
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,915
- Seven minutes, 17 seconds.
- You're full of shit.

202
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,424
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

203
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,425
How come I'm not out
trying to get laid tonight?

204
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,131
Eddie, you're bumming my high.

205
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,796
Come on. It's show time.

206
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,258
Tommy, hold on. Hold on a minute.

207
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,473
The sign here says
"no horseplay in the pool area."

208
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,932
This isn't horseplay.

209
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,439
This is a major felony.

210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,677
Come on, Grandpa.

211
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,640
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

212
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,475
Give me one good reason
why we're up here.

213
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,232
I can give you two:
Antony Mario and Cesar Mario.

214
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,688
Well, you don't really think
that they're gonna--

215
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,853
Cut off our balls
if we don't do the job.

216
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,397
I see.

217
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,689
- Let me ask you something else.
- What?!

218
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,982
- Did you have dinner tonight?
- Why?

219
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,277
Because this rope only holds
900 pounds.

220
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,912
- Eddie, stop fooling around!
- I'm not fooling around.

221
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,118
You are! You're fooling around!

222
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,251
- Pick me up. Pick me up.
- All right, all right.

223
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,537
- Come on.
- I wish you'd lay off the pasta.

224
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,302
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

225
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,013
Covering our tracks.
We leave through the basement.

226
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,177
Well, now we have
no choice, do we?

227
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,566
- What?
- I better make the hole a little bigger.

228
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,531
Don't worry, bonehead.
I'm wearing my girdle.

229
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,811
Six hundred and seventy-three Wongs
in the phone book.

230
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,230
That's a hell of <i>a</i> lot of "Wong" numbers.

231
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,398
Look up "Chin."

232
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,339
That's it.

233
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,341
- You got a key?
- No.

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,047
Just checking.

235
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,070
They record everything
video surveillance takes in.

236
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,327
Yes, I can see that, master thief.

237
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,657
I thought you
said something about a plan.

238
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,744
Oh, am I boring you, smartass?

239
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,409
Hey, Jerry, check out Big Stan.

240
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,294
Watch this.

241
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,716
Big Stan!

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,927
Now watch.
A little rewind and replay...

243
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,970
...and the guards are gonna be
watching a rerun...

244
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,811
...and they're gonna miss out
on tonight's exciting episode.

245
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,691
- You figure this out by yourself?
- Yeah.

246
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,942
Good plan, junior.

247
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,822
We got about five minutes
and change.

248
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,948
Five thirty-two,
"Swinging on a Star."

249
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,860
You know the invented something
while you were inside. It's called a watch.

250
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,279
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

251
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,072

252
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,626

Hey, Dean, I don't get it.

293
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,047
I'm looking at the auction room,
and I see that little blue chair.

294
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,058
I didn't wanna do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

295
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,264

- Let's go out the back way.

00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,255
Get up. You're embarrassing me.

306

- What?

310
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,492
I'm not as fat <i>as</i> that guard, am I?

311
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,954
Oh, no. You're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

312
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,587
Come on, Slim Jim.

313
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,893
Hudson Hawk gets
the chair of honor.

314
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,474
Good job. Not pretty, but good.

315
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,358
All this trouble for a horsey.

316
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,771
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

317
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,564
- You certainly do.
- So...

318
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:23,453
...when's this Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace-looking,
butler-head motherfucker getting here?

319
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,660
Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

320
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,339
- Sorry, Jeeves.
- May I?

321
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,010
Exquisite.

322
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,300
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the duke of Milan.

323
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,139
Irreplaceable.

324
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,851
Hey, Mr. French. I'm--

325
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,856
What the...? What...?

326
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,602
Ah, yes

327
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,861
You son of a bitch.

328
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,445
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards.

329
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,826
Now, where's my cut?

330
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,878
So much for his cut.

331
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,044
Forgive my dry British humor.

332
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,421
You know, I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut too.

333
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,230
Lovely work, Alfred.
You taking the Concorde back?

334
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,437
Always, Mr. Mario.

335
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,732
I'm really racking up
those frequent-ﬂier points.

336
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,821
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

337
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,738
Yo, Five-Tone.

338
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,781
Did I miss anything?

339
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,418
Gates tries to blackmail me.
You ask me, "Did I miss anything?"

340
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,748
Gates gets killed.

341
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,754
You say, "Did I miss anything?"

342
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,335
I bet you'd go up to
Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre:

343
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,593
and say, "How was the show?
Did I miss anything?“

344
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,060
- You may wanna get this looked at.
- Jeez, Gates was killed?

345
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,936
So who do we send
a thank-you note to?

346
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,221
The butler did it.

347
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,062
Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

348
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,398
Took Mr. Ed, Humpty-Dumptied it
over Gates' head, and get this:

349
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,657
- He said it was made by Leonardo--
- Da Vinci's Sforza.

350
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,032
I consider it to be the prize...

351
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,617
...of tonight's auction
of objets d'equestrian.

352
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,372
Horse things.

353
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,954
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

354
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,414
Morning edition.

355
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,922
It says here, two thieves
attempted to steal it last night...

356
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,300
...but thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

357
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,881
Attempted?

358
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:49,299
I didn't wanna steal the goddamned
thing in the first place, but I do have my pride.

359
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,808
I don't understand this.

360
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,593
Why try? Forget about it.

361
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,559
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.
Cops, Mafia...

362
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,021
...butlers forcing me to steal something
which now it appears I didn't steal after all.

363
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,858
It's all too goddamn
peculiar, Tommy.

364
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,237
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

365
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,898
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

366
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,740
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

367
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:14,624
Now, who will start at 140,000?

368
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,500
Hundred-and-forty thousand.

369
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,080
Hundred-and-sixty thousand?

370
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,747
Seventy? Eighty? Ninety thousand.

371
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,167
Two hundred'?

372
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,711
Twenty.

373
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:31,428
Forty.

374
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,594
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand.

375
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,435
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand?
Sixty thousand?

376
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,725
Seventy? Eighty?

377
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,646
Ninety? Three hundred thousand.
Three-ten.

378
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:45,984
Sold.

379
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,069
You know, after all these years...

380
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,236
...I still get goose bumps
coming to these auctions.

381
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,826
The paintings, the sculptures...

382
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,366
Things that aren't really
paintings or sculptures.

383
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,254
Pretentious vultures who never look up from their
calculators to see what they're buying.

384
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,290
Now, that gives me goose bumps.

385
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,958
Auctions are disgusting.

386
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,593
I couldn't agree more.

387
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,628
Savages.

388
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,844
Now, lot 15.

389
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:18,103
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Trillini school.

390
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,766
Now, who will start at 250,000?

391
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,355
Two-hundred-fifty thousand.
Eighty thousand.

392
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,191
Thank you, sir.

393
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,481
Three hundred thousand.
Three-twenty.

394
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,321
Three-forty thousand.

395
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,906
No more on 340,000'?

396
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,039
Sold once. Twice.

397
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,915
Sold.

398
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,204
And finally, lot number 17.

399
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,298
Thought to be lost in the war,
and again last night.

400
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,306
The da Vinci Sforza,
the jewel of the sale.

401
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,841
Fantastic.

402
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,851
Is looking like
a constipated warthog...

403
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,684
<i>...a</i> prerequisite for getting a job
in the art world?

404
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,397
--Doctoressa Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?

405
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,529
Some of us warthogs are
more constipated than others.

406
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,633
Oh, shit.

407
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,931
Perfection.

408
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,060
The Vatican extends its jealousy
to the lucky bidder.

409
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,846
Thank you, doctor.

410
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:47,485
We'll begin the bidding
at $20 million. To you, sir.

411
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,817
- Twenty-point-five
- Waldo!

412
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,324
One hundred million clams.

413
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:59,205
That's $100 million
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

414
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:07,046
One hundred million and one, Waldo.

415
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,047
Fantastic.

416
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,585
One hundred million dollars
and one.

417
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,173
Outbid by mine own wench.

418
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,588
Quelle bummer.

419
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,974
Don't hate me, baby.

420
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,470
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

421
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,480
Any other bids?

422
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,186
Going once.

423
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:40,121
Going twice.

424
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,622
Gone.

425
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,684
My God. That was bold of you.

426
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,941
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's nothing.

427
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,476
Anybody would have
done the same thing.

428
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,236
No, I mean, you didn't
have to tackle me and rip my dress.

429
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,647
Oh.

430
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,488
Oh, I'm just kidding.
Thanks for saving me, tough guy.

431
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,947
Why was that guard
chasing you?

432
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,737
Because danger, doc,
is my middle--

433
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,593
Couldn't just play along,
could you, Eddie?

434
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,511
You gotta admit, Eddie. Classy way
of covering our tracks, huh?

435
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,601
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at La Guardia any minute now.

436
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,601
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

437
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,622
Get the fuck out of here.

438
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,326
You stupid ass!

439
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,132
- Ew, menthol.
- Hey!

440
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,349
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

441
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,262
Hey, mister. Are you gonna die?

442
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,022
Happy sailing, Hawk!

443
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,486
No! Oh, no!

444
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,775
How am I driving?

445
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,411
1-800-I'm-gonna-fucking-die!

446
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,623
Toll booth?!

447
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,254
Exact change?!

448
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,097
Make him roadkill.

449
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,607
Up yours, Cesar.

450
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,688
Yeah, run him down.

451
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,623
Cesar! Antony!

452
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,037
Are you okay?

453
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,778
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

454
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,780
The name's Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.

455
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,865
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

456
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,664
Well, it's better
than when we first started out.

457
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,495
Our code names were diseases.

458
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,002
Do you know what it's like
being called Chlamydia for a year?

459
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,958
Oops, forgot.

460
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,097
- My's Butterfinger.
- No shit.

461
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,900
Do you like
the company's new look?

462
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,236
I call them the "MTV-IA."

463
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,524
George, you promised.

464
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,695
No old-CIA/new-CIA jokes

465
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,786
Punks. They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

466
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,623
...and the Cold War has something
to do with penguins.

467
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,002
Don't I know you?

468
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,711
The last time you saw me, I was bald
with a beard and no mustache...

469
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,841
...and I had a different nose.

470
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,799
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

471
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,181
My high school science teacher?

472
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,098
I'm the guy who tricked you into
robbing the government installation...

473
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,479
...and then had you
sent to prison for it.

474
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,435
George Kaplan.

475
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,316
I'm not the type
to hold a grudge, George.

476
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,319
I used you as a diversion.

477
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,734
I guess down deep,
I was just jealous.

478
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,074
You were one hell of a thief.

479
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,956
To what do I owe
the dishonor of this reunion, Georgie?

480
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,210
I wanna make it up to you, kid.
That's why I got you this gig.

481
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,917
And to quote the late, great
Karen Carpenter:

482
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,922
"We have only just begun."

483
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,049
Three minutes, four seconds.

484
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,926
Well you know, George, you're a little late.

485
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,304
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

486
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,012
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

487
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,804
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

488
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,898
Good God, what's that?

489
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,857
Now George, you don't expect me
to fall for that old gag, do you?

490
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,567
Shucks, I guess not.

491
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,071
NOW?

492
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,906
Yes, now.

493
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,802
No way.

494
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,679
Welcome to Rome, sir.

495
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:41,120
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

496
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,628
Why did you duck
at the auction house, asshole?

497
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,711
What can I tell you. I'm the villain.

498
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,922
Initially, it was a priority to keep
a lot of buffers between you and me.

499
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,884
But since most of them are dead now,
I thought, what the heck?

500
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,391
Hawkie, you come
highly recommended.

501
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,726
I hired Kaplan and the Mario brothers
to find me a cat burglar.

502
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,982
Hey. I want to be in business
with you.

503
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,452
♪ I've got the power ♪

504
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,698
♪ I've got the power ♪

505
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,414
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
and Minerva...

506
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,505
...let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

507
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,097
Minerva.

508
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,632
Minerva!

509
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:44,347
Hello. Bunny, ball-ball.

510
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,638
So, Hawkmeister...

511
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,648
...we got you clothes, great hotel...

512
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,686
...and a 250,000-lire per diem.

513
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,024
That's $200 a day.

514
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,110
So he can get a hooker
and some tequila?

515
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,649
Veto, Darwin.

516
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,321
I guess we see who wears
the penis in this family, huh?

517
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,912
For God's sake,
somebody chain this convict.

518
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,997
Listen, Hawkie.

519
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,960
This might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular joe.

520
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,134
I just want to be happy.

521
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,510
And happiness comes...

522
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,512
...from the achieving of goals.

523
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,436
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

524
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,393
...it's hard to keep
coming up with new ones.

525
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:32,152
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal:

526
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,022
World domination!

527
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,499
Shut up!

528
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,707
- Bunny, quit that.
- Bunny, ball-ball.

529
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,917
I think Bunny's got
today's ball-balls.

530
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,084
- Bad Bunny.
- Bunny, you weren't that bad.

531
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,345
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

532
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:03,259
But seriously, folks, Concorde me
back home, put me in jail. I don't care.

533
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,474
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

534
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,768
You'll have a Guinea barkeep
cellmate to keep you company.

535
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,528
You're young enough to still enjoy
shanking child molesters...

536
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,112
...for a pack of smokes.

537
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,276
But Tommy Five-Tone...

538
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,865
...will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

539
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,952
...will be to attend
his own funeral.

540
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,038
Depressing?

541
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,006
I wouldn't waste a dime
for the phone call.

542
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,091
You don't have any proof.

543
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,552
The magic word.

544
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,470
It's "véjà du," Hawkhead:
Something you wish never did happen.

545
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,640
Kaplan and his CIA candy bars shot
the entire operation with hidden cameras.

546
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,653
They put the fake horse in the safe
while you clowns were running from the guards.

547
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,525
Yikes.

548
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,194
Damn Fotomat assholes.

549
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,657
That's a good shot of you, Minerva.

550
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,245
My man, you're going
to hit a church.

551
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,910
We want you to steal
da Vinci's sketchbook...

552
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,626
...the Codex.

553
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,790
The Vatican.

554
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,801
I'm robbing
the freaking Vatican.

555
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,463
The nuns at St. Agnes...

556
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,348
...predicted this.

557
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,679
What do they call you guys,
Igg and Ook?

558
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,253
- Hey, man.
- Buon giorno

559
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,587
Yeah, buon giorno.

560
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,093
I'm being blackmailed
into robbing the Vatican...

561
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,095
...by a psychotic
American corporation and the CIA.

562
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,848
I don't...

563
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,977
That's okay, colonel.
Just keep an eye on all the art.

564
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,281
Courtney, stop it.

565
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,238
You're embarrassing
your country.

566
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,666
Though Leonardo
is best known as a painter...

567
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,957
...it was his gift as an inventor...

568
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,593
...who drew together
science and art...

569
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,130
...that is most incredible.

570
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,011
Tough guy.

571
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,101
What are you doing here?

572
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,858
You know, every time I get around you,
my heart starts beating really fast.

573
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,444
As you know,
the Da Vinci Codex...

574
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,782
...has lived in the Vatican for centuries,
and will continue to live here for centuries more.

575
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,945
That's what you think.

576
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,082
- Question, sir?
- Yeah, what time do you get done?

577
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,084
His untiring pen
predicted the airplane...

578
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,746
...the submarine, the bicycle...

579
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,416
...the helicopter
and even the tank.

580
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,801
These more dangerous designs
inspired him--

581
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,336
Pokey!

582
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,564
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Quickly, come with me.

583
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,604
Pokey, come back!

584
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,030
Is that smoke bad for you?

585
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,782
- This way.
- Where are we going?

586
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,288
Through here.

587
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,753
Are you gonna tell me why you did that back there,
or are you gonna blame it on Dumbo?

588
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,292
You mean Pokey?

589
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,052
You believe that
kooky little elephant?

590
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,841
- What in the world is this?
- It's a postal subway.

591
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,227
- Can I get to Times Square from here?
- No.

592
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,104
The pope takes his mail seriously.

593
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,106
Christmas cards, Easter Seals.

594
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,393
Delivers up to 10 at night.

595
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,607
I see.

596
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,272
Well, actually, I don't see.
I'm very confused.

597
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,657
How do you know all this stuff?
What do you do?

598
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,285
Well, I do <i>a</i> lot of things.

599
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,071
But I don't steal stuffed elephants
from little girls.

600
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,456
My life's pretty boring.

601
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,585
Yeah, mine too.

602
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,500
You have dinner
with me tonight?

603
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,336
Nice, dull, boring dinner?

604
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,594
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

605
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,346
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

606
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,596
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

607
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,230
There's a place around the corner.

608
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,734
- Enzo's. Say 10:30?
- Ten-thirty.

609
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,146
Hey, thanks.

610
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,123
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

611
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,954
Report upstairs at once.

612
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,584
Yes, sir.

613
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,631
Did he mention the Mayﬂowers?

614
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,971
No, your eminence. He's definitely
going to steal the Codex. I can feel it.

615
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,683
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal, you mean.

616
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,223
The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk.

617
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,314
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

618
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,573
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

619
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:40,205
And must you ﬂirt with him
so effectively?

620
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,161
That's the only way.

621
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:46,294
As an agent of our organization,
you are put in awkward situations.

622
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,673
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

623
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,146
Yes. Hello, operator.
I'd like to make a collect call...

624
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,657
...overseas, to a New York number.

625
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,989
What? No, no, don't put me--

626
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,283
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you for calling AT&T.

627
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,042
What number
are you calling, please?

628
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,832
Thank God. 212-555-1989.

629
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:42,760
Pick up the phone, you
reindeer-goat-cheese-eating bastard.

630
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,598
Pick it up. Pick it up.

631
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,355
Pick it up, Tommy.

632
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,643
The black thing. On the desk.

633
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,188
Come on, Tommy.

634
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,790
Want a little more, Jumbo?

635
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,206
Kick your big, flabby ass.

636
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,295
Hawk.

637
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,588
Hawk, Hawk.

638
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,223
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

639
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,349
Yes.

640
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,308
I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Roma.

641
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,817
I did my first
bare-handed strangulation here.

642
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,693
Communist politician.

643
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,399
Why, George, you big softy.

644
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,487
God, I miss Communism.

645
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,617
The Red threat.

646
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,247
People were scared...

647
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:52,538
...the agency had some respect,
and I got laid every night.

648
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,501
Brief him, Snickers.

649
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,006
Good news, Hawk.

650
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,042
Mayﬂowers have
moved up the timetable.

651
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,462
- You're hitting the Vatican tonight.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

652
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,505
The timing's off,
the schedule's not right...

653
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,015
...I'm underequipped,
and besides that, I got a date.

654
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,767
Grapple, biker's bottle...

655
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,553
...pocket fisherman, olive oil...

656
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,936
<i>...100 stamps?</i>

657
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,144
Gee, stud, this gonna be some date.

658
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,649
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

659
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,311
Snickers, make that list happen.

660
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,904
Oh, it's one thing
to play hide-and-seek...

661
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,316
...with the Mayflowers'
pathetic staff...

662
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,484
...but we're sore losers.

663
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,619
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

664
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,281
You and your friend Tommy
would be nothing more than a...

665
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,324
A late-afternoon Triscuit.

666
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,868
Ciao.

667
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,836
Hey! Old man!

668
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,542
Yeah, you!

669
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,128
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

670
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,918
...and I'll kick your
centrally intelligent ass...

671
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,134
...up one side the piazza
and down the other!

672
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,731
"Beware the blue wire"?

673
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,773
Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.

674
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,529
Good, Yogi.

675
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:42,545
[speaking Italian]

676
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,773
Now, Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

677
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,838
[speaking Italian]

678
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,965
[speaking Italian]

679
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,681
Oh. I was afraid
you weren't gonna drop by.

680
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,641
Am I late?

681
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,733
You look very nice.

682
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,069
You really do.

683
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,950
- What?
- I am the waiter, sir.

684
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,783
Oh, very nice.

685
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,165
Fettuccine con funghi porcini.
Prego.

686
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,452
And bring me a bottle of ketchup
with that, will you?

687
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,211
You heard him.

688
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,498
Ketchup. Ketchup.

689
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,132
Stupid Americano!

690
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,794
[speaking Italian]

691
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,089
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

692
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,098
Steak burger.

693
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,601
French fries.

694
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,762
This is France.
You got to have french fries.

695
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,930
"Actually, it's Italy, Butterfinger,"
she said...

696
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,895
...as if it made a difference.

697
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,856
To be in Paris and in love.

698
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,072
[speaking Italian]

699
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,033
They had the worst ketchup
when I was in prison.

700
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,040
Prison?

701
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,997
I was a warden?

702
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,336
How long were you in?

703
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:53,671
Let's just say I never saw E.T.

704
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,507
Wow, you were in the joint...

705
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,264
...doing hard time.

706
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,178
It's funny, but that excites me.

707
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,847
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

708
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,732
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check, please.

709
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,894
Where did you get the Hawk?

710
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,484
Ossining, New York.

711
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,400
Where did you get the
Hudson Hawk?

712
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,695
Well, a "hawk" is a slang word...

713
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,240
...for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

714
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,659
I grew up in a town
called Hoboken, New Jersey...

715
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,078
...which is on the Hudson River.

716
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:34,715
- So Hudson River, Hudson Hawk.
- Hudson Hawk.

717
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,467
And where did you get these?

718
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,253
Had a little accident
around the house.

719
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,968
- What happened?
- I fell on some chickens.

720
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,882
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

721
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,017
Maybe I can make them
feel better.

722
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,350
Well, okay. See what you can do.

723
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,200
Don't. Don't tickle me.
Don't do it.

724
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,451
Don't do it because-

725
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,738
Because I gotta
tell you something.

726
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,156
What?

727
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,416
No, I better whisper it to you.

728
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,373
Come here.

729
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,831
I can't do this.

730
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,344
What's the matter?

731
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,096
It's been a long time for me.

732
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,474
Well, it's been a really long time
for me.

733
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,432
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday morning,
this has been a very slow decade.

734
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:34,730
I don't make love every 10 years,
I get a little cranky.

735
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,687
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

736
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,653
Not that I ever kiss guys.

737
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,958
[Italian alarm]

738
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,919
Catholic girls are scary.

739
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,081
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

740
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,347
This is not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

741
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,803
You went and did it.
You really did it.

742
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,095
In one day, in less than one day
of planning, and you did it.

743
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,138
You started the week
by stealing the Sforza...

744
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,057
-...and ended by swiping the Codex.
- Yeah, but--

745
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,817
What are your weekend plans?
Hoisting away the Colosseum?

746
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,855
- But you don't--
- Tell me, did the devil make you do it?

747
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,820
Or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayﬂower?

748
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,110
Can't we just go back
to the kissing part?

749
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,994
What's going on in there?

750
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,534
You want me to rape them?

751
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,664
Here, just read your book,
Butterfinger.

752
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,884
"Not in a boat, not on a train.

753
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,971
Not with a goat, not in the rain.

754
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,137
- I do not like green eggs and ham--"
- To yourself. To yourself!

755
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,931
It's more complicated
than that, Hudson.

756
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,647
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayﬂowers' peculiar interest...

757
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,106
...in the three da Vinci pieces.

758
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,770
The Sforza statue was a fake...

759
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,486
...but I was under orders
not to denounce it.

760
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,777
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

761
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,741
- You didn't know?
- No.

762
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,283
I'm just some guy
that's good at swiping stuff.

763
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,747
Who knew that would lead to this.

764
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,881
Christ, they even got
the CIA Involved now.

765
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,126
Here's looking at you, kid.

766
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,007
Hey. This doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

767
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,269
Oh, I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

768
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:40,810
Why didn't you say at the restaurant
that Hawk had hit the Vatican tonight?

769
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,603
My people will not be happy.

770
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,237
I want to see Kaplan.

771
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,166
Damn meddlesome
Vatican organization.

772
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,037
Hey! Way to go, Anna!

773
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,205
Hudson Hawk had
some interesting things to say...

774
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,374
...about you and the Mayﬂowers.

775
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,215
Basically, that you're all part
of the same car pool.

776
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,757
Anna, Anna, Anna,
if that were so...

777
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,516
...Almond Joy would've
handed you your heart...

778
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,053
...right after you handed her
the Codex.

779
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,096
No, now the trip is this:

780
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,732
Soon as the Mayﬂowers find out
we have the Codex...

781
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,268
...they're gonna want to make a deal.

782
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,062
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

783
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,072
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

784
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,075
Oh, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. He's...

785
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,202
He's gonna be in very good hands.

786
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,080
But you, you look really tired, kiddo.

787
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,116
Maybe you should go back
to Rome and get some sleep.

788
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:43,255
Kit Kat? Oh, there you are.

789
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,383
See that Miss Baragli
gets home safely.

790
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,087
Arrividerci, baby.

791
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,720
With all due respect
to that great dress...

792
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,601
...how come you didn't you let me
cut her heart out?

793
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,014
Close call, close call.

794
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:05,186
But she's the only way we have keeping tabs
on the damn mysterious Vatican organization.

795
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,025
Bunny Mayflower.

796
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,907
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

797
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,664
It's been 1200 hours
since my last confession.

798
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,871
Hit me with your best shot.

799
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,956
I betrayed a man.

800
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,918
A good man. An innocent man

801
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,297
A thief.

802
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,050
Anna, what are you trying to say?

803
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,133
Father, we've been
double-crossed by the CIA.

804
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,639
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

805
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,768
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

806
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,803
...and a legitimate
government procedure...

807
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,893
...but he knew right from wrong.

808
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,433
Oh, and we kind of messed around.

809
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,649
[speaking Italian]

810
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,860
Messed around? Messed around?!

811
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,787
Seventeen Hail Marys
and five minutes outside.

812
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:02,668
So, Sister, what you are saying
is that Hudson Hawk...

813
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,079
...is not willingly working
for the Mayﬂowers...

814
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,375
...but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are?

815
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,669
I thought we were using the CIA
to get to Mayﬂower...

816
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,055
...but the CIA is using me
to keep us away from Mayﬂower.

817
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,638
Oh, the pope warned me
never to trust the CIA.

818
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,974
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

819
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,606
...the world economy will be ruined.

820
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,142
Ay-yi-yi.

821
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,107
Lord help us.

822
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:33,649
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

823
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,032
I'm going to find out.

824
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,614
But you must remember, Sister...

825
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,326
...you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

826
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,708
Yes, Your Eminence.

827
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,210
Just say, "God go with me."

828
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,587
God go with you, Sister.

829
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,629
Ball!

830
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,339
Ball!

831
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,130
Ball!

832
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,220
Jolly good shot, sir.

833
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,557
Oh, Hudson Hawk.

834
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,848
You cease to amaze me, convict.

835
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,233
You are a terrible cat burglar.

836
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,485
Haven't you ever seen,
like, David Niven?

837
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,317
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

838
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,573
Like a cat, one would say.

839
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,110
I could take it back.

840
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,029
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

841
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,635
Oh, you two! There's nothing
I hate more than failure.

842
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,671
All you had to do
was follow the Hawk.

843
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,683
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

844
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,764
I suppose we're just going to
have to kill them.

845
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,603
God, Minerva, I was just joking.

846
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,961
- Get away from there, convict.
- Just browsing.

847
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,715
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

848
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,126
Oh, really?

849
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,886
Don't hurt him?

850
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,593
Even if he does this?

851
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,091
What about this?

852
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,145
Surely, this must offend!

853
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:32,105
Things are really heating up
at the Castle Vinci tonight!

854
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,894
Ooh, mamma mia, pizzeria!

855
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,107
May I call you Minnie?

856
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,319
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out

857
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,233
Come to think of it,
there is a part of your body...

858
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,325
...that you won't be needing
for your next job.

859
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,581
I always did wanna
sing like Frankie Valli.

860
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,290
Big boys don't cry.

861
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:56,342
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

862
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,879
Look, you Eddie Munster-looking
motherfucker...

863
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,220
...somebody better tell me what's going on,
or I ain't gonna move another muscle.

864
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,760
- I wanna be treated like an adult.
- That's fair.

865
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,896
Now go to your room.

866
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,729
What?

867
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,113
So, Captain Hawk,
in one of your paws...

868
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,154
...you've got a gold bar
worth about eight thou.

869
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,915
In the autre, you've got lead
that won't get you gelato.

870
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,328
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

871
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,667
That's one down. Kitty Carlisle.

872
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,206
Cool, isn't it?

873
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:40,219
Weight, feel, malleability.
They're all but identical.

874
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,177
On the periodic chart of elements
they're but one proton apart.

875
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,311
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

876
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,516
Alchemy?

877
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,181
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s, my man.

878
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:57,103
Minerva read it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.

879
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,693
I dumped some lire into research
and, shazam!

880
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,483
We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

881
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,745
...detailing Ia macchina d'oro--

882
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,031
"The gold machine,"
for the hoes at home.

883
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,575
--And the rest is
about to become history.

884
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,414
Money isn't everything.

885
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,169
Gold is.

886
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,420
Fuck T-bills!

887
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,922
Fuck blue-chip stocks!

888
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,298
Fuck junk bonds!

889
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,255
We've got the real deal.

890
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,261
Money will always be paper...

891
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,924
...but gold will always be gold.

892
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,888
After a couple of years
of steady production...

893
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,597
...we'll ﬂood the market
with so much gold...

894
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,639
<i>...that</i> gold itself,
the foundation of all finance...

895
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,273
...will lose its meaning.

896
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,106
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

897
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,068
...will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

898
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,277
Sounds like a party.

899
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,238
Markets will crash-crash.

900
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,370
Financial empires
will crumble-crumble.

901
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,496
Except yours-yours.

902
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,329
In 1992, baby...

903
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,164
...the European superpowers
are coming together...

904
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,670
...to form one business superpower.

905
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,924
And that's one party
we're gonna love to poop.

906
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,208
Well, that's set.

907
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,881
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

908
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,767
On display for three days only
at the Louvre, in Paris.

909
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,518
As opposed to the Louvre
in Wisconsin?

910
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,520
Shut up.
You'll make me lose my place.

911
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,181
You're gonna have
to go in at night.

912
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,600
_ The security will be overwhelming.
- Twelve guards--

913
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,111
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Okay, time out.

914
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,069
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

915
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,278
Put me in jail. Put me and--

916
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,909
Jail, you asshole?!

917
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,071
Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

918
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,910
Bunny? Ball-ball.

919
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,872
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

920
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,756
I'll kill your friends, your family
and the bitch you took to the prom.

921
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,508
Betty Jo Biarsky?
I can get you an address on that, if you want.

922
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,509
You have a dilemma, tiger.

923
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,968
And I think I know what's gonna
help you solve it.

924
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,808
I'll kill you all!

925
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,565
I swear to God. I'll kill that butler.
I'll kill that little yappy dog.

926
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,570
I'm sick of this!

927
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:11,828
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

928
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,159
"Keep off the grass"?

929
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,165
Let's play soccer.

930
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:19,203
The only law I cared for
was friendship.

931
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,714
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

932
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,713
I just don't think that it's such a smoking-hot
idea to leave them in there alone.

933
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,925
Relax, George.

934
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,932
That's why we hired the
pasta-slurping Guinea to begin with...

935
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,263
...to keep Hawk in line.

936
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,520
This Gates-Mario brothers-
CIA-Mayﬂower-da Vinci thing...

937
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,729
<i>...l</i> mean, it seemed like
a sweet deal.

938
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,939
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

939
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,446
I don't know, Eddie,
I thought you'd get into it.

940
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:51,405
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A.s at the bar.

941
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,321
But I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

942
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,367
Them using me to use you.

943
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:02,504
I'm sorry, Eddie...

944
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,041
...but there's only
one way out of this...

945
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,928
...and it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

946
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,051
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

947
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,515
You've got to love male bonding.

948
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,820
You fucked my freedom
for a lousy job?

949
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,284
Come on!

950
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,083
- You know something, Eddie?
- What?

951
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,795
- You hit like a girl!
- Oh, really?

952
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,172
I was only kidding.

953
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,929
[gunshot]

954
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,512
Tommy! No!

955
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,601
Tommy!

956
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,706
Plan B, George.

957
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,456
Plan B?

958
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,112
No sweat, Tommy. You just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

959
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,527
Don't act like you never
committed a crime before.

960
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,822
- I know I made a bad call.
- What was your per diem?

961
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,036
- Thank God you're dead.
- It was so beautiful.

962
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,829
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

963
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,462
- Ketchup. You can't beat Heinz 57.
- Five-Tone.

964
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,592
- What?
- You fucked my freedom for a job?

965
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,379
- You don't understand.
- I said I was sorry.

966
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,344
You better be glad I don't hit women,
assuming you are a woman,

967
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:20,304
because from now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

968
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,763
- Hey, look, Eddie, I'm sorry.
- Hudson, I'm sorry.

969
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,554
I work for a covert Vatican
humanitarian organization...

970
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,394
...and the CIA
made a fool out of me.

971
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,853
- What's more...
- Hey, man...

972
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,019
-...I care for you.
-...l love you.

973
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,233
- Then what's this?
- Where did you get that?

974
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,773
The da Vinci castle.

975
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,488
You know, the place where you
gave the bad guys the Codex.

976
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,744
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

977
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,495
So they really were that
close to making it work.

978
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,533
But now that they lost the services
of the world's greatest cat burglar...

979
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,871
...and his dead partner...

980
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,127
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

981
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,460
And we get to go home.

982
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,000
- Five-Tone, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

983
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,920
Why do they leave all these rocks
and shit laying out in the backyard?

984
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,554
They're called ruins, Eddie.

985
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,431
- Ruins, huh?
- Yeah, ruins.

986
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,592
Good name.

987
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:12,228
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

988
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,771
I never saw a look on a face like this
when he got caught.

989
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,235
I swear to God,
he was so embarrassed.

990
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,446
You know,
speaking of being caught...

991
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,078
...isn't the CIA gonna think
to check out this place?

992
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,863
No, they fell for the fake death.

993
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,658
They think Hawk's been arrested.

994
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,203
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
by my sources boarding a plane out of Rome.

995
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,121
- Hudson.
- Where to?

996
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,006
Five-Tone, will you quit
worrying about it, man.

997
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,759
I'm not worried, alright,
I'm just being cautious.

998
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,013
Okay, guys.
On that note, it's time for bed.

999
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,173
- I couldn't agree more.
- Okay.

1000
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,021
Tommy, you're gonna sleep here.

1001
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:51,308
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

1002
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,691
Oh, yeah. Good night.

1003
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,397
I'll get you some sheets.

1004
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,483
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

1005
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,696
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

1006
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,784
- Is.
- Was.

1007
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,075
There's some things
you don't know about me.

1008
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,164
But there's some things
I do know about you...

1009
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,206
...and about me,
and about that bed.

1010
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,716
This is not the time, Hudson.

1011
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,963
Look, can't we just have
a late-night cappuccino?

1012
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:25,178
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

1013
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,689
- Oh, yeah. I remember.
- Good night.

1014
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,690
Good night.

1015
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,654
Don't even think about it.

1016
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,363
Don't say another word.

1017
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,496
It's a very special night

1018
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,248
Very funny. Very funny, Tommy.

1019
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,055
Good morning.

1020
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,317
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

1021
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,193
I'm losing respect for you guys.

1022
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,152
You were that close
to getting away with this crap.

1023
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,783
- Get up.
- Now, where's Anna?

1024
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,534
You know, George,
it's nice of you guys to drop by...

1025
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,037
...but next time,
you might want to phone ahead.

1026
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,697
Why don't you come back in a half-hour.

1027
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,458
Grab ourselves a shower,
pick up some croissants and shit.

1028
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:37,088
I really wish I could come up with this
glib repartee, the way you guys can.

1029
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,796
But I can't.
So I'll just paralyze you. A.J.?

1030
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,174
Curare darts.

1031
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,839
When it comes
to instantaneous loss...

1032
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,882
...of all physical control
below the neck...

1033
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:51,053
-...I highly recommend them.
- Eddie, I can't move!

1034
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,596
I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

1035
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,232
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitches!

1036
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,690
Come here!
My head against yours.

1037
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,069
Fair fight!

1038
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,777
This is how I go out.
Like <i>a</i> hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

1039
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,863
Like a Gumby in the store?

1040
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,073
What the fuck are you la--?
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

1041
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,612
You made it come out of my nose.

1042
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:10,826
Keep that shit up!

1043
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,912
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

1044
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,544
The Louvre'?

1045
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,833
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

1046
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,218
Or should I say this morning's?

1047
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,345
I admit we displayed
a lack of nuance.

1048
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:29,007
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

1049
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,143
Well, we weren't being judged
for neatness...

1050
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,053
...only results.

1051
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,314
Goddamn it. Yanks lose again.

1052
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,067
- How did the Mets do?
- Can you turn to section B.

1053
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,986
You guys may be
the fairest cat burglars of them all...

1054
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,116
...but if you weren't
such snobs...

1055
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,826
...a lot of those guards at the Louvre
might still be alive.

1056
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,957
But that's irrelevant now.

1057
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,093
You're irrelevant now.

1058
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,175
Because tonight...

1059
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,840
...at the Castle da Vinci...

1060
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,384
...we make gold!

1061
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,552
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

1062
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,187
Ah, more babes for the party.

1063
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,813
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Anna.

1064
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:21,146
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

1065
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,060
Anna Baragli...

1066
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,525
Came to play!

1067
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,656
Anna-banana-fo-fanna.

1068
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,034
You're not gonna shoot
little old me, are you?

1069
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,115
You're not gonna
shoot little old anybody.

1070
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,121
- Pull the trigger. Shoot.
- Shoot, Anna.

1071
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,657
I read your dossier...

1072
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,201
-...Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

1073
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,997
Why did she call you Sister?

1074
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,337
I'm sorry, Hudson,
I meant to tell you.

1075
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,922
- He didn't know.
- He didn't know!

1076
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,132
Know what?

1077
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,389
Hawk likes a nun!

1078
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,639
Those better be tears
you're crying, Tommy.

1079
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,478
They are.

1080
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,108
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

1081
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,066
Oh, no. You love me. It's your job!

1082
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,447
You probably love
Butterfingers over there.

1083
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:09,653
Well, yeah.

1084
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,989
In <i>a</i> weird sort of Catholic way, I do.

1085

You...

1087
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,914
Well, Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

1088
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,129
- And <i>as</i> for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

1089
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,510
A souvenir.

1090
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,299
Ciao.

1091
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,020
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

1092
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,441
Guys, we got some good news
and some bad news.

1093
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,444
The good news is you'll be
completely unparalyzed in about two minutes.

1094
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,154
The bad news is that leaves you only
five seconds to defuse the bombs.

1095
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,863
- Bombs?
- Bombs?

1096
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,663
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

1097
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:04,295
I'll just shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

1098
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,922
Almond Joy! More paralysis!

1099
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,301
- You can move?
- Yeah.

1100
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,095
This is what I get
for darting <i>a</i> nun!

1101
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,764
Get this fucking thing off my head!

1102
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:28,277
- Tommy, look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a bad migraine.

1103
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,688
Maybe it was a dud.

1104
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,881
I don't know. It must be the curare.

1105
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,292
It's been known to have
certain side effects.

1106
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,132
Oh, really, George?

1107
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,141
I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

1108
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,724
Listen, Anna. The apprentice's diary
contains a code...

1109
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:06,187
...that explains how the three
pieces of crystal fit together.

1110
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,941
If you could do us the honor...

1111
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,025
...and decipher how the code works,
we would be eternally grateful.

1112
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,862
What does the color blue
taste like?

1113
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,197
Bobo knows.

1114
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,205
I must speak with the dolphins now.

1116
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,044
Just shoot her. Anybody?

1117
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:34,802
Darwin, this is supposed to
be torture, not therapy.

1118
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,260
- Eddie, the old man said turn left at the fork.
- He said turn right.

1119
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,096
If you wanna save Anna,
you gotta find the castle first.

1120
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,058
- Quit pushing.
- I'm not pushing.

1121
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,652
- Count of three?
- Why not just go now?

1122
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,029
- Okay. Hey, Tommy.
- What?

1123
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,282
- Who are you, Bob Hope for Texaco?
- What the hell are you talking about?

1124
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,238
- What are you doing with that golf bag?
- I got a plan.

1125
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,778
- Is it a great plan?
- A great big plan.

1126
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,636
- Tommy, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

1127
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:24,098
- How do I look?
- You look great. What, are you kidding?

1128
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,807
No. I want you to tell me.
Come on.

1129

off a castle in the middle of Italy...

01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,270
...and you're asking me
how you look?

Okay, okay. You don't gotta get--

1133

You look gorgeous.

- Well, I didn't know.

I'll take that, sir.

1202
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,561
Hey, coach. Looks bad.

1203
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,352
I think those Mayﬂowers
set us up.

1204
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:51,527
Jumbo, we hardly knew you.

1205
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,328
Since you're not gonna tell us
what we want to know...

1206
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:02,167
then I think it's time for you to report
to the head office in heaven, Sis.

1207
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:06,209
If you see the big guy,
tell him he's a loser.

1208
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,843
That's it.

1209
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,061
- That didn't hurt.
- No?

1210
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,897
Try this.

1211
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,743
What do you say now,
you centrally intelligent scumsicle?

1212
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:42,957
Getting old, George?

1213
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:56,100
Tommy, you New York-Italian-father-
made-20-bucks-a-week son of a bitch!

1214
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,760
You were hired as bait...

1215
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,975
...and on this simple task,
you have betrayed me.

1216
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:04,187
- Do you have an answer why?
- I got five of them.

1217
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,361
One! Two!

1218
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,818
Three! Four!

1219
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:13,700
Just one more. Five!

1220
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:23,744
That didn't-- Hurt.

1221
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,797
How do I stop this?

1222
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,056
My hat.

1223
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,016
I guess you never fucked
with nobody from Hoboken before.

1224
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:48,151
- Hudson!
- Anna...

1225
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,233
...we're supposed
to be saving you.

1226
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,773
I'm sorry.
I got bored, so I saved myself.

1227
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,612
We still gotta get
them crystal pieces, don't we?

1228
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,072
Got them right here, cowboy.

1229
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,736
"Got them right here, cowboy."

1230
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,076
- Eddie!
- Sounds like Tommy.

1231
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,496
Tommy!

1232
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,629
Alfred, I won't be needing
the car any more.

1233
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,211
Ta-ta!

1234
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:15,553
Tommy!

1235
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,846
Eddie!

1236
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,058
Eddie!

1237
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,690
MY Pension!

1238
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,785
- Friend of yours?
- Dead!

1239
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,928
Hudson, look--

1240
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,259
Out.

1241
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,615
- Minerva.
- Anna! Hawkmeister!

1242
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,278
You're probably wondering
why you're still alive.

1243
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:25,120
We're still having a little problem
putting this damn crystal together.

1244
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:28,582
Alfie and I have
been at it all night.

1245
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,418
Well? What are you waiting for?

1246
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:44,722
- Don't do it, Hudson.
- Relax.

1247
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:49,015
Besides, we don't
have much choice, do we?

1248
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:20,346
Oh, Hawk, don't ever change.

1249
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,387
Nice Hawk.

1250
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,553
Nice Hawk.

1251
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,806
Bad Hawk!

1252
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,412
Why is the world jam-packed
with such idiots?

1253
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:50,580
Every schmo has the fantasy that
the planet revolves around them.

1254
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,541
It rains. A car crash stops traffic.

1255
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,081
You say, "How can
this happen to me?"

1256
01:28:56,248 --> 01:29:00,424
But for us, this isn't a fantasy.

1257
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,337
<i>N</i> is a reality.

1258
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,474
Oh, yes. If da Vinci
was alive today...

1259
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,976
...he'd be eating
microwave sushi, naked...

1260
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,978
...in the back of a Cadillac
with the both of us.

1261
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,980
The project of his life...

1262
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,858
<i>...is</i> now the toy of mine.

1263
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:20,773
History, tradition, culture
are not concepts.

1264
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,864
These are trophies I keep in my den
as paperweights.

1265
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,155
The chaos we will cause the world
with this machine...

1266
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:31,746
...will be our final masterpiece.

1267
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,206
Go, team, go!

1268
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,960
Go, team, go!

1269
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,791
Go, team, go!

1270
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,465
Yes!

1271
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,230
NOW!

1272
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:10,868
Eureka, motherfucker!

1273
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,126
Well, you should feel very good
about yourself.

1274
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:16,378
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1275
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,255
What would happen if I didn't put
that crystal together exactly right?

1276
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,461
What do you mean?

1277
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:24,094
Well, let's just say, for example,
I left out...

1278
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,471
...this little piece of mirror here.

1279
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:30,555
- Would that be bad?
- Real bad.

1280
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,889
Good.

1281
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,901
Minerva! Minerva!

1282
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,535
Alfred!

1283
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,089
- Your turn.
- My turn?

1284
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:12,225
How'd it get to be my turn?
I just killed Darwin and Minerva!

1285
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,683
- Definitely your tum.
- Shit.

1286
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,942
All right. Just stay over here
and try to stay out of the way, alright?

1287
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,943
- Hudson.
- What?

1288
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,369
<i>Okay-</i>

1289
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,260
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

1290
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,671
Sorry!

1291
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,358
Stop helping me!

1292
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,575
Hey, Alfred...

1293
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,531
...you won't be attending
that hat convention in July.

1294
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,419
- My turn?
- Yeah.

1295
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,670
With this dog, now?

1296
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:35,596
Oh, Bunny.

1297
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,016
Ball-ball.

1298
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,603
Come on, puppy chow, gotta go.

1299
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,832
Here we go.

1300
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,497
Move your hand! Take it away!

1301
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,565
Just hang on.

1302
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,496
Oh, Leonardo.

1303
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:42,493
Go, Leonardo!

1304
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,752
Oh, baby!

1305
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,713
Hi, kids.

1306
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,437
- Anna?
- Yes, Hudson?

1307
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:07,896
Can I ask you something?

1308
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,608
Sure.

1309
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:13,865
Will you play Nintendo with me?

1310
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,199
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather play Nintendo with.

1311
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,131
Wait a minute.

1312
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,258
- What about your boss?
- What boss?

1313
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,010
You know.

1314
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:36,592
Oh, I think he wants me
to keep an eye on you.

1315
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:39,678
You know, I think he wants you
to keep an eye on me too.

1316
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:42,185
Because I got criminal tendencies.

1317
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,721
- Can I buy you a cappuccino?
- Yes.

1318
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:47,391
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes.

1319
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,898
I just wish Tommy were here.

1320
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,526
No way.

1321
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,906
That's not very nice.

1322
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,408
No way!

1323
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:59,410
Yes way!

1324
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,365
Did I miss anything?

1325
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,624
Did you miss anything?

1326
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,751
You're supposed to be all crashed up
at the bottom of the hill.

1327
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:10,585
Air bags.
Can you fucking believe it?

1328
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,000
You're supposed to be blown up
into fiery chunks of flesh.

1329
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,168
Sprinkler system
set up in the back.

1330
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:18,839
Can you fucking believe it?!

1331
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:21,178
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

1332
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:23,139
Drink your cappuccino.

1333
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:26,521
Hey. Drink your coffee.

1334
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:41,862
With the world saved and
the secrets of da Vinci protected...

1335
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:44,827
