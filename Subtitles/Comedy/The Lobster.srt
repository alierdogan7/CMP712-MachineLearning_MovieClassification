- Why a lobster?

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,940
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,

174
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,

175
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,079
so I used to give a little bit
to each of them.

176
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,919
One day, I decided to enter the enclosure

177
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,639
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.

178
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,759
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

179
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,220
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,

180
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,239
all but two, who stood motionless.

181
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,439
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,319
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.

183
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,060
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,

184
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,479
which is also my defining characteristic.

185
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,319
My wife died six days ago.

186
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,159
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.

187
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,199
She had a limp too.

The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

348
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,020
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

349
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,740
I think I saw a woman with a limp.

350
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,759
It's just a sprained ankle.

351
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,860
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.

352
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,919
That's a shame.

353
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,180
That is a shame indeed.

354
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,599
(ALARM BLARES)

355
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
WOMAN: One night on the coach, he sat
next to the woman who liked butter biscuits.

356
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,020
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,

357
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
just trying to avoid talking to her.

358
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,439
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.

359
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,559
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

360
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,980
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.

361
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,460
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.

362
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,900
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

363
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,919
And that was a really good one.

364
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,940
These biscuits are for Bob.

365
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,180
I want you to give them to him

366
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,260
whenever you want to reward him
for something.

367
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,420
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.

368
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,839
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?

369
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.

370
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,020
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

371
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,380
if that's your thing.

372
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,820
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.

373
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,580
But let's not talk about him.

374
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,679
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.

375
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,140
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.

376
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,399
I haven't caught any the last few nights.

377
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
Hope you catch lots too.

378
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,079
Thank you very much.

379
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,020
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,

380
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,559
I'm gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms.

381
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
Out of the window.

382
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
I want you to know that.

383
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,300
My room is on the first floor.

384
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,439
WOMAN: "I hope I catch
some loners today," she said.

385
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,460
"And I hope you catch lots too."

386
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,020
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,

387
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,959
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,

388
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,220
320, maybe, or one higher up.

389
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,319
480, that would be even better.

390
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,519
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.

391
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,580
He then looked out at the woods

392
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,239
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.

393
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,199
Not bad. Bit higher.

394
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?

395
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,399
A lobster.

396
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,039
(GUNSHOT)

397
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,319
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

398
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,260
Why don't you become parrots too?

399
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,820
And then we'll all be together.

400
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,660
You're a complete idiot,

401
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,460
picking one of the few animals
that can talk

402
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,940
when you have a speech impediment.

403
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,540
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

404
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,500
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

405
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,380
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,

406
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,540
and they'll suck out what little flesh
you have with their mouths.

407
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
You're pathetic, both of you.

408
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,940
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.

409
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,660
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,

410
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,620
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.

411
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,639
Or when we're on one of our trips.

412
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,540
(CRIES OUT)

413
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,020
Friends.

414
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,959
I'm not afraid.

415
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,239
Room 187, please.

416
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,599
It's no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples.

417
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,559
Hello.

418
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,020
- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.

419
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
- Thank,
- (PAUSE)

420
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,559
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

421
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,660
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

422
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,220
I like all strokes equally.

423
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
You know, I love breaststroke.

424
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,300
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,

425
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,340
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."

426
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,300
And then they laugh.

427
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,799
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.

428
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,039
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,

429
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,620
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.

430
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,860
- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.

431
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,479
Really?

432
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,199
Ah, no.

433
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,319
This happens to me all the time.

434
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,999
It's really, really annoying.

435
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,799
I know. I have a nosebleed problem too.

436
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,119
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

437
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,359
I saw what you did. It must have hurt.

438
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,799
Is it coming out?

439
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,519
No.

440
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,340
- Yes.
- Can I use a tissue?

441
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,879
Yes.

442
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,039
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.

443
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,700
What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,

444
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,060
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal

445
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,999
or to have a nosebleed from time to time?

446
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,220
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.

447
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,180
- Exactly.
- Mm.

448
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,759
- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.

449
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,719
I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.

450
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,500
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.

451
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,759
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.

452
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,300
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room

453
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,700
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.

454
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,060
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,

455
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,420
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.

456
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,999
We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.

457
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,940
- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.

458
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,460
Congratulations.

459
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,660
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely

460
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,580
by our staff and by me personally.

461
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,740
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,

462
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,060
that you cannot resolve yourselves,
you will be assigned children.

463
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
That usually helps, a lot.

(WHISTLING AND CHEERING)

Seven days left.

(SOUNDS OF BIRDSONG AND RUNNING WATER)

469
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,959
You have really nice hair.

470
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,140
I know.

471
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,799
Look.

472
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,359
How do you like mine?

473
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,999
Well, I think you have quite dry hair.

474
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,660
The colour is OK, though.

475
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,439
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

476
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,719
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.

477
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,399
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.

478
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,220
And even if someday I lose my hair, there
are things I can do to get my hair back.

479
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,860
I can have a hair transplant.

480
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,660
- You can always tell when someone's
had a hair transplant. - I know.

481
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,620
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.

482
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,919
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.

483
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,399
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?

484
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,439
I'm still thinking about it.

485
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
Morning, ladies.

486
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,940
So today is your last day.

487
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,940
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.

488
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,860
What I always say in these situations is,

489
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,860
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...

490
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for example,
read a work of classic literature

491
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,020
or sing a song you really like.

492
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,980
It would be silly to choose

493
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,500
for example a walk in the grounds,

494
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,780
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

495
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,399
because those are things
you can do as an animal.

496
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,300
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,

497
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,319
which is really very touching.

498
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,980
"We always sat together at school.

499
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,220
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

500
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,479
because you always gave the best advice.

501
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,020
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,

502
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,020
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.

503
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,239
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

504
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,980
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,

505
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,900
because you're an admirable person,

506
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,559
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.

507
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,780
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.

508
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,199
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.

509
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,620
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.

510
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,220
I'll miss you.

511
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,020
And however many new girlfriends I make
in a few days when I move back into the city,

512
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,279
I don't think I'll find another as true."

513
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,380
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,

527
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,980
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend

528
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,220
that you do have feelings when you don't

529
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,959
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.

530
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,439
He also thought that he liked her accent,

531
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,879
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.

532
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
So he decided that she was the one.

533
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,140
During the hunt, he would follow her,

534
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,919
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,

535
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,540
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones.

536
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,159
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"

537
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,719
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,

538
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,319
"I hope he dies right away."

We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,

and we forced them to kiss each other.

we're going to disappear

into dogs or canaries or something.

when I get into the city
is buy a bathrobe.

The three of us coming here instead of

We'll see.

1205
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,199
Good afternoon.

1206
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,860
How are you?

1207
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,279
Fine.

1208
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,079
I'm hungry.

1209
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,079
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days.

1210
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,319
Or things for me to touch and guess.

1211
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,940
I've got good news.

1212
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,959
I've had a great idea.

1213
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,559
Have you a minute?

1214
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,239
What kind of idea?

1215
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,679
I raise my left foot,

1216
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,038
I bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice.

1217
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,900
I bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times.

1218
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,159
I lie face down, I kneel down.

1219
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,700
I touch my left cheek

1220
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,439
and then lie face up.

1221
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,199
Are you sure you're prepared to do that?

1222
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,479
Yes, of course I'm sure.

1223
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,079
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.

1224
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,239
When?

1225
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,039
Tomorrow.

1226
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,759

We should speed up a little.

1234
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,020
I can't go much faster.

1235
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,279
The trousers are too tight. I'm sorry.

1236
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,500
It was dark and I couldn't see clearly.

1237
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,519
And I didn't have time to try them on.

1238
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,439
I'm sorry.

1239
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,079
Never mind.

1240
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,359
There's a bus coming.

1241
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,919
It was the hotel coach.

1242
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,599
They didn't see us.

1243

Would you like me to show you my belly?

1247
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,919
No.

1248
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,479
I... I remember your belly very well.

01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,980
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.

1251
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,359
Certainly.

1252
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,679
Thank you.

1253
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,479
I'm going to do it with a knife.

1254
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,900
Do you want me to come with you?

1255
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,919
I'd rather you didn't.

1256

Don't worry.

1257
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,799
It's strange at first,
but then you get used to it.

1258
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,820
And your other senses are heightened...
