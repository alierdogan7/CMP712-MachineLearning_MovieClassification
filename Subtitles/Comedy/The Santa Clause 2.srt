00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,795
There was a first clause,
but also a second clause.

177
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,353
Get on with it!

178
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,192
When the last Santa fell off your roof
and you put on his coat, you found this.

179
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,477
Right. ''He who wears the coat

180
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,794
takes on the responsibilities
of Santa Claus.''

181
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,876
And the rest
would be history, right?

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,879
But it seems our number two elf,
the keeper of the handbook,

183
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,873
overlooked the single
most important detail

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,877
in the history of Christmas!

185
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,392
Wow! One mistake in 900 years.

186
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,072
Look.

187
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,996
- l can't see that.
- Better now?

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,349
- Or now?
- Well...

189
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,791
- Better now?
- lt's gettin' there.

190
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,275
- Or now?
- l can't see anything.

191
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,075
l see. Good, good, good.
l see it. OK.

192
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,189
''The card holder acknowledges
a woman of his choosing...''

193
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,552
''True love... Not valid
in the state of Utah...''

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,268
''Holy...

195
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,833
matrimony?!''

196
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,349
- l gotta get married!
- Yes.

197
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,108
lt's... the Mrs clause.

198
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,714
[they sing
''Here Comes The Bride'']

199
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,350
What if l don't want
to get married?

200
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,478
Oh, dear. The de-Santification
process has begun!

201
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,034
The de-Santification?

202
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,199
Are you telling me that clause
says if l don't get married...

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,796
l don't get to be
Santa any more?

204
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,153
Wh-... what about the kids?

205
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,917
What about the elves?

206
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,518
- What about you guys?
- lt's not completely hopeless.

207
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,835
You still have time
to find a wife.

208
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,395
- How much time do l have?
- 28 days.

209
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,950
28 days? So l've gotta...
find a wife by Christmas.

210
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,954
Actually, Christmas Eve.

211
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,070
- l guess it's over.
- No! You can't think that way!

212
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,430
Please, don't give up hope.

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,391
Cos if you do, then we have to.

214
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,834
- [delighted cries]
- Whoa!

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,468
Christmas is getting
very complicated.

216
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,152
[faintly] Santa?

217
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,475
Santa?

218
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,756
- Are you with us?
- l'm sorry, yes. Yes, l am.

219
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,034
Well, on behalf of Father Time and
the Council of Legendary Figures,

220
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,839
l'd like to thank you for being
such a gracious host.

221
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,235
- Hear, hear.
- What a lovely place.

222
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,678
Without further ado, let us
convene the year-end conference.

223
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,553
- Tooth Fairy.
- Thank you, Mother Nature.

224
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,238
Fellow Council members,

225
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,828
l'd like to again propose
a new name for myself.

226
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,791
- Oh, please!
- Good heavens!

227
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,597
ln the past, you have rejected
Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.

228
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,951
- Because they stunk.
- Today, l'd like to submit...

229
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,513
- Captain Floss.
- Nice!

230
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,834
- Plaque Man.
- [snorts]

231
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,270
- And Roy.
- [laughs] Roy! No.

232
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,517
No kid's gonna put a tooth under
a pillow for a man named Roy.

233
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,313
This from someone in a diaper
who shoots people's butts!

234
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,396
Wait a minute. l got it.
l got it. l got it.

235
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,750
Now, how about this?
The Molarnator.

236
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,440
The Molarnator! l like it.

237
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,949
Thank you, Santa. Can we
vote now on the Molarnator?

238
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,038
All in favour of a name change
for Tooth Fairy?

239
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,838
All right. And all opposed?

240
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,512
Easter Bunny?

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,596
- Sandman?
- [snores] Wha-...?

242
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,075
What happened?
Was l asleep again?

243
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,793
Name change for the Tooth Fairy.
Yes or no?

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,752
No. l'm sorry.

245
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,877
All right. Next item on the
agenda. Santa? Status report.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,959
OK. First, welcome to the North
Pole. Great to have you here.

247
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,958
This is our big time of year,
so things are busy as usual.

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,152
There's a little speed bump
in the road this year.

249
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,158
- You all know Charlie.
- l love Charlie!

250
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,793
- Great kid.
- Good boy.

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,558
- Sweet kid.
- Good teeth.

252
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,070
Well, Charlie...
got himself on the naughty list.

253
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,799
- What?!
- Oh, my!

254
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,514
l'm struggling with the timing,
cos it's...

255
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,712
l gotta be up here and l've also
got to take care of Charlie...

256
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,956
That's every parent's dilemma:

257
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,555
how to balance
work and children.

258
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,991
Most people lose sleep over that.

259
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,910
Tell me about it! l have 33,000
offspring. All in private school.

260
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,079
Well, to top it off... l have to get
married by Christmas Eve.

261
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,794
- What?!
- Otherwise l stop being Santa.

262
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,194
- What?!
- No!

263
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,788
The de-Santification process
has already begun.

264
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,672
Wait a minute.

265
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,678
You do look thinner, and...

266
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,872
- Your beard is shorter! Right?
- [others] You're right!

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,673
Apparently,
it's called the Mrs clause.

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,036
Don't mess with me, Santa.
l'm pre-El Nino.

269
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,675
No, l'm not messing with
anybody. What l'm saying is...

270
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,313
l have to find a wife in...

271
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,592
27 days, 20 hours
and 1 7 minutes.

272
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,518
- Wow!
- lt's what l do.

273
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,550
[chuckles]

274
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,148
Wait a minute. Cupid!
Cupid, come over here.

275
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,316
- What do you need?
- Shoot me with a dart.

276
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,591
- Then l'll fall in love.
- First of all, they're arrows.

277
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,278
Second of all, no can do.

278
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,670
- Why not?
- Arrows have no effect on us.

279
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,076
lf they did, l would have shot
myself, met a nice girl,

280
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,872
left the business years ago.

281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,798
- Enough with the questions.
- You can't stop being Santa.

282
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,239
l don't want to.

283
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,158
Kids are 86 per cent happier
since you've taken the job.

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,271
- He's right.
- This is all l want to do.

285
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,590
But what am l gonna do?

286
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,552
Well, you...

287
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,555
You can't be two places at once.

288
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,189
Maybe you can be.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,276
OK, everyone, can l get the
room for a minute? Thank you.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,960
Can l just...? One minute.
Take a cocoa break.

291
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,548
Have a nice long break.
Relax, everyone.

292
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,389
l want to show Santa some improvements
on the pantograph. Thanks.

293
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,548
Walk with me. l've tripled the RAM
and reconfigured the circuitry.

294
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,513
l see you've externalised
the power source

295
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,108
to make better use of
the electromagnetic energy.

296
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,595
No, it's just there
cos it looks really cool.

297
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,438
Yeah, it does. [chuckles]

298
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,155
Wait a minute.
You tripled the RAM.

299
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,872
l see where this is going. l am
not getting in that machine.

300
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,874
Besides, creating a copy of
Santa won't solve our problems.

301
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,754
- The elves'll know.
- But this would be a special toy!

302
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,350
- How's that, Curtis?
- l added a fuzzy logic circuit.

303
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,675
The duplicate will look
and think just like you.

304
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,270
When you're with your family, dealing
with Charlie, looking for a wife...

305
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,392
The toy will be up here melting
in front of my fireplace.

306
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,318
No, the toy Santa will be
dealing with business up here.

307
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,396
l can deal with
business up here.

308
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,512
Santa, if the elves find out
we've made a switch... Aaggh!

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,949
No! No!
This machine is not the answer.

310
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,878
[clattering and squeaking]

311
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,276
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You! You! Shoo!

312
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,598
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

313
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,436
[engine powers down]

314
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,036
[squeaking]

315
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,709
Look, you can't get
much better than that.

316
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,430
And l promise -
it won't hurt a bit.

317
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,593
- l'm goin' in.
- l can't watch this!

318
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,796
[humming and whirring]

319
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,476
Ow! Ow!

320
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,513
lt's perfect!

321
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,514
That's because it's me,
Einstein.

322
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,039
- Santa, are you all right?
- Yeah, l got a shock in there.

323
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,957
ls there supposed to be a shock?

324
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,798
Aagghh!

325
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,078
[all] lt's naked!

326
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,558
Throw something over it.

327
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,672
- lt's incredible!
- Yes, it is.

328
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,839
[Santa chuckles]

329
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,637
Can he talk?

330
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,273
Hello?

331
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,118
[gabbles]

332
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,318
Hello?

333
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,313
Hello?

334
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,997
Ho, ho, ho!

335
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,150
Ho, ho... ho!

336
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,750
- Not bad.
- Not bad yourself.

337
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,753
l can't put my finger on it,

338
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,836
but there's something
about you that l like.

339
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,428
There's something
about you that l like!

340
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,552
- Watch him. l'll be right back.
- He's coming right back.

341
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,795
Ha-ha-ha!

342
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
- Bernard, l need your help.
- What do you mean?

343
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,038
What l mean is
l gotta go see Charlie

344
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,549
and l want you to
convince the elves...

345
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,989
that... toy Santa is me.

346
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,192
- Hm. Have you seen that thing?
- l've seen it.

347
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,231
Keep the elves
at a distance and say

348
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,555
that l've changed my look,
it'll work.

349
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,194
Santa, we're in
way over our heads here.

350
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,675
lf anybody can do this,
it's you, number one.

351
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,156
l... l'm not gonna lie to all the elves.

352
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,033
l myself think he looks
absolutely terrific!

353
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,311
Better and fresher somehow
than he has in years.

354
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,433
There's now a more supple
veneer to his skin

355
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,869
and an added lustre
to the thickness of his hair.

356
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,195
You could almost say
there's a...

357
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,558
a toy-like quality to him.

358
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,238
Most importantly, he's very
happy with his new look,

359
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,432
and l would caution you all
not to point or stare

360
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,598
or use the word ''plastic''.

361
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,273
OK? OK.

362
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,994
Thank you. That's all.
Back to work, please.

363
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,676
[irritable grumbling]

364
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,834
Comet, because l don't
want to take Prancer.

365
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,396
l want to take a trip with you.
When's the last time we had a cruise?

366
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,158
l love you, buddy.

367
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,949
Besides, Prancer had too many
apples. We know what that means.

368
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,355
Before you go,
take a look at your watch.

369
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,550
Hey! Can't go anywhere
without that.

370
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,990
- l've done some work on it.
- lt's beautiful. lt really is.

371
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,635
- You like it?
- The workmanship's fabulous.

372
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,877
lt has a power reserve that measures
how much magic you have left.

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,718
- lt's at ten.
- That should be enough.

374
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,549
But if you use up any magic
for any reason the level drops.

375
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,155
Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't
be able to return to the Pole.

376
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,032
Uh-oh.

377
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,750
Then let's not let it get to zero!

378
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,077
- Now, look at me.
- Mm-hm?

379
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,355
What's the most important thing?

380
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,678
For you not to touch Santa?

381
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,311
For you to come back!

382
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,629
[Comet grumbles]

383
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,279
Thank you.

384
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,955
Comet, please just
chill out a little bit, OK?

385
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,073
Come on! lt's not like we're
pullin' the sleigh. Right?

386
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,270
There's no packages.
lt's one stop.

387
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,676
And l think l might have forgot
we're gonna go see Charlie.

388
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,149
[school bell]

389
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,869
Scott! Hey!
You trimmed your beard.

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,319
Yeah.

391
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,756
Come here, big guy.

392
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,231
Whoa! Lost some
weight there, huh?

393
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,316
- Slim-Fast?
- You don't know how fast.

394
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,237
- We should get going.
- Oh, OK.

395
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,476
How do you always know
when there's a problem?

396
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,433
l see you when you're sleepin'.
l know when you're awake.

397
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,518
Which is a pretty frightening
concept when you think about it.

398
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,915
We're really worried
about Charlie.

399
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,316
He keeps upping the ante. This
time he defaced school property.

400
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,318
- lt's classic acting out.
- l'm blaming myself for this.

401
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,954
- We're both his parents.
- Where is he?

402
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,873
He's waiting for us
in Principal Newman's office.

403
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,595
Something about her makes me
want to deface public property.

404
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,756
Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.

405
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,475
- Miss Newman.
- Principal Newman.

406
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,719
Haven't seen you since the last
time Charlie was in trouble.

407
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,876
l've been travelling for work.

408
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,152
lf you spent more time with your
son there'd be fewer problems.

409
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,316
Then l wouldn't spend
so much time with you,

410
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,317
which is always
such a pleasure.

411
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,876
A battle of wits. lt's a shame
you come unarmed. Excuse me.

412
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,793
Ouch!

413
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,838
Good morning, Principal Newman.

414
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,475
Mr Picardo, l want you to look into
my eyes. What do you see?

415
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,350
lt's dark. And it's cold.

416
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,949
lt's your future, Mr Picardo -
keep this up

417
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,310
and you will spend
your life stabbing trash.

418
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,237
- Do l make myself clear?
- Yes.

419
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,511
- So what are you gonna do?
- l'm going to geometry.

420
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,596
Have a nice trip.

421
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,835
lt's an affront to authority and
blatant disrespect for property.

422
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,838
lf this continues l'll have no
other recourse than to suspend..

423
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,873
Excuse me. ls there a rest stop between
here and the end of the lecture?

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,753
l'm more interested in why this
happened in the first place.

425
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,872
So am l. Charlie, we're all
worried about you.

426
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,029
lt feels like you're trying to
get someone's attention.

427
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,156
What's bothering you?

428
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,473
- Dr Miller?
- Neil.

429
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,229
- Neil, any theories?
- Well, frankly l have several.

430
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
Here we go.
Let's just order a pizza.

431
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,718
Scott, you're not helping.

432
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,231
l was listening to a tape series
on child development last night.

433
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,473
You know what the problem is?
Excuse me, Neil.

434
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,755
lt's four weeks until Christmas.

435
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,315
- That's a holiday in December.
- Oh.

436
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,916
Have you noticed the hallways?
Not a decoration, not a twinkle light,

437
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,999
not an expression of the joy
kids are supposed to be feeling.

438
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,312
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.

439
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,036
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.

440
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,238
Spending any of that money
on holiday decorations

441
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,635
would take away from
the things that truly matter.

442
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,320
Forgive me, but l think
holiday cheer really matters.

443
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,476
What are we going to do?
We are worried...

444
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,070
Let me handle this. You know
what you did is wrong. Right?

445
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,918
- l guess so.
- There's no guessing.

446
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,235
Guessing is gone.
lt was wrong what you did.

447
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,033
And you're not gonna
do it again. Promise me.

448
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,639
- OK.
- There you go.

449
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,588
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.

450
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,995
lt most certainly is not!
Charlie...

451
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,236
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.

452
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,954
Why don't you
buy yourself a wreath?

453
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,993
l am Santa Claus.

454
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,075
Boo!

455
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,068
Yeah. No, no,
l think that this is gonna work.

456
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,350
Good... Good job, Curtis.

457
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,192
Would it kill you to give
a wholehearted compliment?

458
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,275
Ho, ho, ho.

459
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,832
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?

460
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,432
- l need you to look at this.
- All right!

461
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,679
Nice!

462
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,438
No. l mean,
l need you to read it.

463
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,233
Well, let's try to be
specific, shall we?

464
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,315
Ha-ha!

465
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,035
l'll take a look at it
over at my desk.

466
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,879
- How does he know where it is?
- l programmed him that way.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,116
He has most of Santa's memories.

468
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,469
OK, we need you to study
everything that's in that book

469
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,995
because it is the key
to being Santa.

470
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,152
Right! l'll memorise
everything in the book.

471
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,714
l'll follow all the rules.

472
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,478
Cos rules are very important!

473
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,350
- l like this guy.
- l can barely read this.

474
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,435
Hi, Santa.

475
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,835
Uh...

476
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,033
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...

477
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,799
Like he got
a good night's sleep.

478
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,194
Like you got a very
good night's sleep.

479
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,872
How about a nice
chocolatey cocoa?

480
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,518
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.

481
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,434
Aagh!

482
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,635
Whoo!

483
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,990
That's delicious! l like cocoa!

484
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,879
Cocoa's superior refreshment!
[laughs]

485
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,036
Get me some more cocoa!

486
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,156
Whoo!

487
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,508
Right away, Santa.

488
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,755
Ho, whoa!

489
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,234
l think Santa feels
a little buzz!

490
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,955
Whoooo!

491
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,639
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?

492
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,309
And you only have 27 days
to find a wife or you're out?

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,673
Yeah.

494
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,109
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years

495
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,356
before you got up
the courage to propose.

496
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,597
That's a pretty serious
commitment issue, isn't it?

497
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,393
Yes, Sigmund. l was afraid
l'd mess up the first time.

498
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,750
- l'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.

499
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,757
There's never been
a better Santa.

500
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,598
l appreciate that.

501
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,154
lt's for the best. lf l
had spent more time with you,

502
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,669
you'd spend less time in
the spray paint industry.

503
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,189
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.

504
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,880
And being Santa has made you
an even better man.

505
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,036
l'm gonna go out
on an emotional limb.

506
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,912
Don't try to make me cry.

507
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,510
Believe it or not, you have
a great capacity for love.

508
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,557
l know you can
find someone wonderful

509
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,591
to spend the rest of
your life with.

510
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,076
Don't let the facts that you
have no time, no prospects

511
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,112
and a paralysing fear of
intimacy get you down.

512
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,195
Hm.

513
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,751
Have you ever
helped anyone? Ever?

514
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,077
You know what l'm gonna do? l am
gonna look through my phone book

515
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,714
and see who's still single out
there and not too bitter.

516
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,037
There's divorced moms at school
who'll go out with anybody.

517
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,516
As promising as this sounds,
l don't need help with this area.

518
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,916
Your old man was a high-school
legend. A double letterman.

519
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,678
l had a Mustang.

520
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,552
So as far as dating goes,

521
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,389
l think if anybody can stir up
the old mojo it would be moi.

522
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,234
Come on! l don't think
there's a woman out there

523
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,316
that doesn't want
a piece of this.

524
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,352
- Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!

525
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,713
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?

526
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,437
Ohh! l haven't seen you in a long time.

527
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,996
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- l learned to swim underwater.

528
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,634
- And l'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!

529
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,751
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall
and... get some ice cream.

530
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,993
- Plenty of women at the mall.
- Charlie...!

531
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,312
Santa, look forward and
put on a smiley face.

532
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,716
- Say hello to your elves.
- Ho, ho, ho!

533
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,195
You're doing a wonderful job!

534
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,556
Santa, when you said the bigger
wheels, is this what you meant?

535
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,635
Ho, ho, ho!

536
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,716
You're doing a wonderful job!

537
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,120
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,

538
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,037
but otherwise you're gold.

539
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,235
Ho, ho ho!

540
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,630
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

541
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,795
Why don't you just say it? ''You
were right, Curtis. l was wrong.''

542
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,069
OK, OK, l admit it.

543
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,710
They're happy.
They're working hard.

544
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,717
Everything's going to be fine.

545
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,717
This book is very
interesting reading.

546
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,434
There's a lot of rules
they're not following.

547
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,551
That's what l've been
saying all along.

548
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,831
Things have gotten
a little too sloppy around here.

549
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,112
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!

550
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,076
l might have to
make some changes here.

551
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,953
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.

552
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,270
There's many things.
Look here...

553
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,837
Neil, are you sure you don't have
any other clothes l can borrow?

554
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,110
l mean, the idea tonight
is to attract a woman.

555
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,277
- What are you talking about?
- l look like a limesicle.

556
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,277
l think it makes you look hot.

557
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,148
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think?

558
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,077
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?

559
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,078
l think it's what's inside
that really counts.

560
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,555
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.

561
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,398
l'm off.
l may need to borrow a car.

562
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,956
l'm parked behind Neil. The
minivan - l just had it washed.

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,518
The minivan.

564
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,517
OK, then. Well, wish me luck.

565
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,072
l got a needlepoint sweater,
and a minivan...

566
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,716
See ya in about eight minutes.

567
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,638
Scott? Hey.

568
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,069
- Tracy!
- Yes!

569
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,873
- lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

570
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,954
- Here, why don't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

571
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,036
Thank you very much.

572
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,831
So, l'm so glad
we finally got to do this.

573
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,235
- l'm pretty nervous.
- Oh, are you?

574
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,352
Laura says
we have a lot in common.

575
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,596
l hear that you love
this time of year also?

576
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,280
lt's my favourite time of year
and my busiest time of year.

577
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,789
- Whoa, look at the sweater!
- Yeah!

578
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,196
Some sweater.
Like l should talk!

579
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,315
l also have my Christmas
charm bracelet.

580
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,149
- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.

581
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,635
l wear it all year long
just to keep the spirit alive.

582
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,550
That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear
and packages. That's very nice.

583
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,712
- So what work do you do?
- l'm in the toy business.

584
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,796
- No way!
- Way!

585
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,634
- That sounds so creative.
- l love it.

586
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,876
- l love creative people.
- Yeah?

587
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,713
Yeah.

588
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,439
So what do you do?

589
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,358
l'm hoping someday to break
into the music business.

590
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,357
- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!

591
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,833
Way!

592
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,108
- What's your favourite music?
- Country-western.

593
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,878
- [enthusiastically] Ohh!
- Yeah.

594
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,195
- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!

595
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,993
* The best thing about
singing at Christmas

596
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,998
* ls the cocoa,
carolling and fun

597
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,315
- You know that one?
- l know that song.

598
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,192
* Go totally yuletide

599
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,391
- * Takin' a sleigh ride
- You're good.

600
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,636
* Santa shirts, reindeer skirts

601
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,319
* Whoah-oh-oh!
- Hey!

602
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,475
* [off-key] Watchin' the windows
fog, drinkin' some eggnog

603
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,636
- That's good.
- * Whoah-oh-oh!

604
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,872
* Fill up a stocking

605
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,991
* Spray on some flocking

606
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,475
[shouts] Put up a tree!
Sports on TV!

607
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,557
[nasally] * Uh, whoah-oh-oh

608
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,038
* l want to be free, yeah
to feel the way l feel

609
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,998
* Ah, ah, ah, ah

610
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,314
Man!

611
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,158
* l feel like some Christmas

612
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,189
* Oh-oh, wow wow wow! *

613
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,478
[whistles]

614
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,396
Whew!

615
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,198
You hated it?

616
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,675
lt kind of scared me
a little bit.

617
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,112
No, l just. l...

618
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,751
l just... l wasn't prepared
for a performance, so if l...

619
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,190
l put myself out and that was
not an easy thing to do.

620
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,630
lf you can't support
a woman's ambition,

621
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,718
then l don't think there's any
reason to continue this date.

622
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,438
[knock on door]

623
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,839
- Dad?
- Hey, sport.

624
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,518
How'd it go?

625
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,113
Well...

626
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,795
Let's just say
l'm not bookin' a church yet.

627
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,199
Boy, l'll tell ya,
women are hard to figure out.

628
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,392
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?

629
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,837
Well, there's this one girl.

630
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,719
We just used to be friends and
hang out at the mall and stuff.

631
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,558
Then one day l looked at her

632
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,194
and l got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

633
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,515
l started worrying about
what to wear

634
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,676
and what my hair
looked like...

635
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,476
And then l wanted to kiss her.

636
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,116
How did she do that?

637
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,515
l don't know.
But they all can do that.

638
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,753
Oh, look at that.
The snow globe!

639
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,791
This is so beautiful. l remember
when Bernard gave this to you.

640
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,388
He said all l have to do
to see you is shake it.

641
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,475
Uh-huh.

642
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,833
Now, all you have to do
is yell down the hall.

643
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,030
And l'm there
whenever you need me.

644
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,513
Yeah.

645
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,675
l'm a little tired, Dad.
l'll see you in the morning.

646
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,279
OK.

647
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,038
- Good night.
- Night.

648
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,436
Can you turn
the light off, please?

649
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,279
Yeah, cos it's
such a big reach for you!

650
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,516
[grumbling]

651
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,435
What do you mean
it's not straight?

652
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,675
[gabbles]

653
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,556
- Sure it's straight.
- Uh-uh.

654
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,153
- Maybe your head's crooked.
- [gabbles]

655
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,071
- Prancer's not this picky.
- [Comet] Yes, he is.

656
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,197
- Hi, Comet.
- Hi!

657
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,917
l've got something for you.

658
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,356
Hey, Lucy,
what have you got there?

659
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,953
Careful with the sweets.
He tends to overeat.

660
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,275
Uncle Scott,
are you Santa Claus?

661
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,915
What? Why would you ask me
something like that?

662
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,634
Cos you have a reindeer,
and only Santa has reindeer.

663
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,035
Nonsense.
A lot of people have reindeer.

664
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,116
Name five.

665
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,557
Well... most of them
live in Finland.

666
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,956
l can't pronounce their names.

667
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,670
Besides, reindeer are too stupid
to make good pets.

668
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,832
Well, l think you're very smart.

669
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,994
Well, l think he's learning
at an excellent rate.

670
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,430
Oh, really? This morning
he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.

671
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,913
Wait a minute.

672
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,558
l need the
naughty-and-nice list.

673
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,874
No.

674
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,031
lt says l'm supposed to
check it twice.

675
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
- Santa already checked it.
- No, l didn't.

676
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,196
- The real Santa.
- l am the real Santa!

677
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,197
- l'm sorry?
- l'm in charge here.

678
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,231
- What?
- l check the list twice.

679
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,157
That's the rule.
l like the rules.

680
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,874
- You know how l feel.
- You're misunderstanding.

681
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,356
No, l'm the rule-maker. l like
the rules. Santa likes rules.

682
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,789
l've got a good idea.
How about we have some fun?

683
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,875
Huh?

684
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,196
- lt's good to have fun.
- Right.

685
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,073
Santa, look over there.
See those elves?

686
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Go ahead.
Go play some tinsel football.

687
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,473
Break!

688
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,755
- What's the object of tinsel football?
- Come on down.

689
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,475
lf you don't have the ball,
get it.

690
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,637
lf you have the ball,
run to the end zone.

691
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,875
OK, l'll go get the football.

692
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,519
Ready, hike!

693
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,356
[bloodcurdling cry]

694
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,678
l've got the ball. What are you
gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?

695
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,074
Come on!

696
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,509
This is a lot of fun!

697
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,511
Oh, so sorry!

698
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,558
[plasticky squeaking]

699
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,630
Come here! Stop! Slow down
when l'm talking to you!

700
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,796
Come here, you! Come on.

701
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,959
He's headed east
toward the main entrance!

702
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,916
Hello, Charlie.

703
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,638
Hello, Principal Newman.

704
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,715
[school bell]

705
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,353
Are Laura and Neil
on their way?

706
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,198
No, l volunteered to go solo.

707
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,833
Oh. You look...

708
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,471
You've lost weight.
Feeling all right?

709
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,556
l was until l got
this phone call.

710
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,117
Charlie, you promised you
weren't gonna do this again.

711
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,993
What's the matter with you?
l'm gonna have to punish ya.

712
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,156
l'll ground him for...
two months.

713
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,669
- l thought you were on my side!
- l'll go one better.

714
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,597
- You're suspended.
- But... Dad!

715
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,109
l'm as upset about
this as you, but isn't there

716
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,959
a punishment that doesn't mean
takin' him out of school?

717
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,548
- What did you have in mind?
- We could...

718
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,318
Uh... ah...

719
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,396
Community service?

720
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,235
Huh.

721
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,836
That's not a bad idea.

722
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,075
OK, Charlie. l want you to
start by cleaning up this wall.

723
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,760
l want everything
off of there by tonight.

724
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,714
And then clean off every mark
off every locker in this hallway.

725
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,229
- Every one?!
- Do as she says, Charlie.

726
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,271
But l have homework,
tests to study for.

727
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,836
Not my problem. l have a
detention group on Saturday.

728
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,030
So we will all get together
at the rec centre

729
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,151
and scrape off graffiti at 8am.

730
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,430
- See you both there.
- You say both of us?

731
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,836
No, l... l'm very busy. l do a
lot of other community service.

732
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,838
That's good. You just got
yourself elected parent rep.

733
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,839
And, Charlie...
We'll talk about the suspension.

734
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,715
Curtis, what is he doing
in the naughty-and-nice centre?

735
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,796
- What's going on?
- l'm checking the naughty-nice list.

736
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,718
- l'm checking it twice.
- l already told you!

737
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,078
lt's been checked. Don't worry.

738
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,997
l do worry.
There's a lot of mistakes.

739
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,031
l'll give you
a big fat for instance!

740
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,197
ln Denmark, there's a guy
named Sven Halstrom right here.

741
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,869
He's a Dane. He was wiping
his nose on his sister's shirt.

742
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,993
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet he's on the nice list.

743
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,317
We try to cut most children
slack this time of year.

744
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,353
l don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.

745
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,914
They're running with scissors.
They're sticky.

746
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,600
''l'm not gonna stop this car!''
''No, we're not there yet!''

747
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,109
''Brush your teeth!''
''Pick up those clothes!''

748
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,196
lt goes on and on.

749
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,869
But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.

750
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,434
But according to
The Santa Handbook,

751
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,111
naughty kids get lumps of coal
in their stockings. Right?

752
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,231
We will make stockings.

753
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,239
ln my opinion, they should all
get coal in their stockings.

754
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,234
- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!

755
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,033
Get me the naughty-nice list.
Get me every list!

756
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,436
[shouts] Get me
[more softly] everything.

You in charge of the gangbangers?

They're students,

761
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,552
Keep 'em away from the car.
lt's new.

762
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,114
l don't need some delinquent
kids scratchin' it up.

763
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,676
They're not delinquents.
And don't worry about your car.

764
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,360
l'd worry about your legs
in those shorts.

765
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,596

shaved their legs!

766
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,358
Whoa, good one!

767
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,879
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

768
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,195
- Brought you coffee.
- Thank you.

769
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,950
- So you have a nice-guy side.
- l'm a man of many sides.

00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,438
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- lt's not supposed to come off.

773
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,755
Hence you've got to be
careful where you put it.

774
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,350
Hence tagging is serious.
Hence your presence here.

775
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,872

- ls she a neighbour?
- No.

00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,190
Oh, the... necklace,

you? You're highly decorated.

And look at that face.
There you go.

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,870
There's a face
only a mom would like.

801
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,958
l don't have a mom,
so l wouldn't know about that.

802

Now, it's time
for the big event.

Or pie?

820
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,435
But l don't want to
keep you from your date, so...

821
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,632
Oh, it's not a date. lt's the
faculty Christmas party.

822
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,794
ls that your idea of
a night on the town?

823
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,957
Noodles and pie? [giggles]

824
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,953
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.

825
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,638
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.

826
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,318
Good! Movie?

827
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,068
Two For The Road.
Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.

828
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,192
Movie's OK, but the car
was the star. '53 MGTD.

l'm impressed. That is
a great car. My favourite car.

831
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,837
Didn't like driving 'em
in the rain.

832
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,276
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that it's perfect.

833
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,956
lt's perfect, though.

834
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,633
- l could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.

835
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,991
Except for, eventually,
l'm going to have to get home.

836
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,112
Well, l... l could pick you up.

837
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,710
So you're going to drop me off,
then come back and pick me up?

838
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,592
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?

839
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,393
- All right, l'll stay.
- l'll get my coat.

what are you driving?

00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,512
You know...
l think you're gonna like it.

842
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,798

844
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,517
Mind if l ask you
something personal?

845
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,073
Please.

846
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,668
- You look really different.
- The weight.

847
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,554
lt's lndian teas and it's a lot
of salves and stuff. lt's...

848
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,716
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Uh, yes.

849
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,709
Cocoa.
You have thought of everything.

850
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,991
Well, this time of year,
l... l really shine.

851
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,590
Yeah, l can't wait
till it's over, though.

852
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,836
Streets are crowded,
the malls are jammed,

853
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,872
people max out their credit cards...
lt's noisy.

854
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,958
When did you become
such a cynic?

855
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,469
Oh. l don't know.

856
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,516
l used to love Christmas, too.

857
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,831
lt was the only day
that my parents didn't fight.

858
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,195
- Oh.
- Oh.

859
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,356
They were at each other
all the time.

860
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,155
But on Christmas, they tried
to make the holiday special.

861
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,716
My dad went through this charade
so l'd believe in Santa Claus.

862
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,276
He put a cot by the fireplace
so Santa could take a nap...

863
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,197
Like he has time to take a nap!

864
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,596
Consider the amount of gifts
he would have to... deliver.

865
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,393
Why would he nap? He
would probably need some coffee.

866
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,796
Yeah. And there was
cocoa and cookies.

867
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,516
And carrots for the reindeer.

868
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,508
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.

869
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,790
And the thought is
important to them, too.

870
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,596
Yeah. And l'd wake up and the cocoa
and cookies would be gone

871
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,951
and the cot would be mussed
and the carrots gnawed.

872
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,629
They swallow them. lf they're
fresh they'll eat 'em like that.

873
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,716
They love red bell peppers, too.

874
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,717
You know the stories.
lf you read...

875
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,269
And there would be incredible
presents under the tree.

876
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,030
One year was a rocking horse,
and l named it Harvey.

877
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,068
And the next year was
a little red wagon,

878
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,919
which l made a lemonade stand,
which was great.

879
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,678
And the last year was...

880
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,117
lt was just... a Baby Doll. She was
pink and soft and beautiful.

881
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,949
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

882
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,354
l believed in Santa so much
l'd get in fights at school

883
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,869
with kids who tried to tell me
that he didn't exist.

884
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,673
And one day
l came home with a bloody nose.

885
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,992
That's when my parents
decided to tell me to...

886
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,997
grow up.

887
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,191
l was devastated, and...

888
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,110
Good, Carol! This is great
sleigh-riding conversation!

889
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,915
- l'm a terrible sleigh con-..
- lt's fine conversation.

890
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,350
A person just wants something
to believe in, you know?

891
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,835
Yes, l know. Yes, l know.

892
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,157
OK, we have cocoa.

893
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,714
We have a blanket.
We have a horse-drawn sleigh.

894
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,558

895
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,793

896
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,399
- lt's snowing.
- Oh.

897
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,353

898

that it should be snowing!

Your attention, please!

There we go. Hi. l'm Scott Calvin and
l just thought l'd step up here and...

916
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,150
and say the word that we've all
been longing to hear.

917
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,758
Fire!

918
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,591
OK. What l think, folks, is
that a lot of you have forgotten

919
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,359
what the true spirit
of Christmas is all about.

920
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,435
Mm?

921
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,989
lf you're not willing
to dance or laugh or flirt

922
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,396
or risk the buffet, l don't
think we have much choice.

923
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,717
So before the choir gets out
here l say we rock this house

924
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,308
with a secret Santa! Huh?

925
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,232
Carol - happy, happy Christmas!

926
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,830
l think they're just
decorations for the carollers.

927
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,958
She's afraid these are
decorations for the carolling.

928
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,799
l think Carol is right
about the carolling!

929
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,310
l'm talking about the packages
that [whispers] are backstage.

930
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,510
There aren't any
packages backstage.

931
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,596
Ohh! There's none back there.

932
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,395
[sighs] So l was mistaken
when l saw this bag of gifts.

933
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,478
Maybe l'm wrong, but it sure
looks like a bag of gifts.

934
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,636
Ohh! lt's heavy
like a bag of gifts.

935
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,908
Look at this! What's in here?

936
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,756

A beautiful, high-quality
yet low-sulphur variety of coal!

1013
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,078
[uproar]

1014
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,554
Quiet!

1015
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,432
We have to focus,
all of us, on the goals ahead.

1016
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,192
And just to make sure
that that happens...

1017
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,918
Thank you, sweetie.

1018
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,719
l... l hate to blow my own horn.

1019
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,636
[horn sounds]

1020
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,277
Stay where you are!
Don't be afraid!

1021
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,314
Back! Back!

1022
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,434
l was up late, couldn't sleep.

1023
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,676
Milk wouldn't do it,
cocoa is a little sweet,

1024
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,712
so l decided to make
an army of toy soldiers.

1025
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,839
They don't have
a good sense of humour like me.

1026
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,509
l would do what they ask you.
Which is what l'm going to tell you!

1027
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,393
Don't listen to him!
This guy's not Santa!

1028
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,477
- He's not Santa?
- He's a toy!

1029
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,154
He has a rubber face
and a plastic tushy!

1030
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,758
[plasticky squeaking]

1031
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,994
Trust me!
Don't let him ruin Christmas!

1032
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,880
Thank you for
those kind words, Bernard!

1033
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,719
Well, now that we all
have an understanding,

1034
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,555
have a joyous and
merry Christmas!

1035
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,591
Merry Christmas!

1036
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,789
[screaming]

1037
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,319
OK, ready? Go!

1038
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,795
This is what l call
community service!

1039
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,876
Here she comes. Duck down!

1040
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,349
Hey!

1041
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,675
Attention you hooligans
behind that snow bank!

1042
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,995
You have snowballed
the wrong house.

1043
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,669
Drop the snowballs, kick them
away from the snow suits

1044
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,950
and keep the mittens
where l can see them.

1045
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,719
Your dad is hanging with
Principal Newman?

1046
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,319
- ls he dating her?
- No.

1047
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,392
Go to your homes.
Uh... pelt the ones you love.

1048
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,195
- And a merry Christmas!
- [Carol laughs]

1049
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,993
- That is really gross, man.
- Shut up.

1050
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,071
There are things about me you
should know. Personal things.

1051
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,555
We don't need to
rush things, Scott.

1052
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,349
l think you need to
know these things.

1053
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,435
OK.

1054
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,073
Um...

1055
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,995
Remember the mistletoe,
how it just showed up?

1056
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,872
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.

1057
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,877
- How magical that was?
- Yes.

1058
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,031
Secret Santa Claus?

1059
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,356
- That was me.
- Yeah?

1060
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,596
l'm not this size much. l'm
usually much bigger than this.

1061
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,358
So am l sometimes.

1062
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,550
l have a big white beard
that's beautiful.

1063
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,114
- l don't.
- l work a long way from home.

1064
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,595
When l get back home,
l sleep for a long time.

1065
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,280
See? OK.
lt's not so bad so far.

1066
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,948
You work far away from home
and you sleep a lot.

1067
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,470
You've never been to prison
and you don't wear socks with sandals.

1068
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,715
Well...

1069
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,918
l'm Santa Claus.

1070
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,634
What?

1071
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,590
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.

1072
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,077
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.

1073
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,992
- l exist.
- That's not funny.

1074
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,473
- lt's magical.
- Cut it out.

1075
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,999
l'm telling the truth.

1076
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,270
l told you something personal
from my childhood

1077
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,949
and now you're making a joke
out of it and it's not funny. lt hurts.

1078
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,790
l know how hard this is to
believe, but connect the dots.

1079
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,434
- Think what's happened.
- l know what's going on.

1080
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,597
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.

1081
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,757
Now you're acting like a mental
patient because you're scared.

1082
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,316
- l deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- lncredible.

1083
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,716
l go down chimneys with burning
logs and l still deliver gifts.

1084
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,751
l'm not scared.
That's not what this is.

1085
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,110
lf you're trying to
push me away, it's working.

1086
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,958
Carol, don't make me leave.

1087
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,396
Please.

1088
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,911
- How could you pick her?
- l didn't.

1089
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,359
You don't care any more.

1090
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,516
l care more about you
than anybody.

1091
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,358
But it's a two-way street.

1092
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,871
- You won't confide in me.
- You want it? Here it is.

1093
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,914
- What? Talk to me.
- l don't live a normal life.

1094
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,474
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!

1095
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,398
My friends get to go around
saying, ''My dad's a plumber.''

1096
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,398
''My dad's a pilot.'' ''My dad's
a dentist.'' You know what?

1097
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,910
My dad is the best thing of all
and l can't tell anyone.

1098
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,759
You have no idea how hard it is,
walking around with that secret.

1099
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,952
And now you're going out
with Principal Newman!

1100
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,196
And you don't even
tell me about it.

1101
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,551
My whole life has become
about secrets, and l hate it!

1102
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,636
l'm sorry.

1103
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,795
Forget about
Principal Newman, all right?

1104
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,911
And forget about Santa.
l'm done.

1105
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,112
My time's up.

1106
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,915
Who cares any more?

1107
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,355
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1108
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,075
- What are you doing?
- Just shovelling.

1109
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,155
Oh.

1110
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,034
Charlie, is Uncle Scott
Santa Claus?

1111
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,552
No.
Why would you think that?

1112
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,511
l don't know.

1113
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,594
- How come Uncle Scott was sad?
- What makes you think that?

1114
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,631
l asked him to stick
a straw in his nose

1115
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,591
and blow bubbles
in his milk.

1116
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,995
- And he said no.
- Whatever.

1117
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,593
- Can you talk to him?
- l don't think so, Lucy.

1118
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,756
- Did you have a fight?
- Sort of.

1119
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,632
- Are you gonna make up?
- l don't know!

1120
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,751
- Are you gonna be mad forever?
- Lucy!

1121
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,950
- What?
- These are hard questions.

1122
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,718
No, they're not. They're easy.

1123
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,195
And you can't be mad
at him forever, Charlie.

1124
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,356
He's your daddy
and you love him.

1125
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,119
* ln a strip-mining machine

1126
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,719
* Flatten the hills we go

1127
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,479
Come on!

1128
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,194
Put a smile on that face,
little troll!

1129
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,273
Wait a minute. l got a joke.
This'll cheer you up.

1130
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,038
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

1131
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,115
[laughs]

1132
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,558
- Aren't you?
- Aren't you who?

1133
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,750
Aren't you supposed to
get back to work?!

1134
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,633
All of ya! You little idiots!
Back to work!

1135
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,476
Got any twos?

1136
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,993
Hm.

1137
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,196
Go fish.

1138
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,433
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1139
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,796
Whooaahh!

1140
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,756
- What was that?
- l don't know.

1141
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,751
- Want some more hot chocolate?
- Mm-hm.

1142
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,233
OK.

1143
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,238
[door bell]

1144
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,669
- Would you get that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.

1145
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,396
ls S... Scott here?

1146
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,717
- Who are you?
- Uh...

1147
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,796
Curtis, a friend from...
Buffalo.

1148
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,516
- Are you an elf?
- Of course not!

1149
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,751
Why would you ask
such a silly question?

1150
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,632
How come you have pointy ears?

1151
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,556
lt's... because l never
ate my green vegetables.

1152
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,512
Do you eat
your green vegetables?

1153
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,031
Uncle Scott!

1154
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,675
Yeah, l'm right here.
What's wrong?

1155
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,276
Oh... Curtis! What are you doin' here?

1156
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,356
There's a little
trouble at the...

1157
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,913
plant.

1158
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,592
lt's OK.
Curtis is a very old friend.

1159
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,359
We have a large, uh... firm.
We work together in...

1160
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,038
- [whispers] Buffalo.
- Buffalo?

1161
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,509
We work together in Buffalo.
So... we're gonna talk business.

1162
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,552
- What business?
- lt's none of your business.

1163
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,638
Soon l'm gonna be seven.
And then l can know things.

1164
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,557
- Good night, Curtis.
- Good night, Lucy.

1165
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,318
Good night, Lucy.

1166
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,954
- What's up?
- Toy Santa's out of control.

1167
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,548
He's locked up the elves,
shut down the workshop,

1168
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,752
he thinks everybody's naughty
and he's gonna give everyone coal!

1169
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,633
- Why didn't Bernard tell me?
- He's under house arrest.

1170
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,749
Bernard?!

1171
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,917
Fly back with me to the North
Pole to save Christmas!

1172
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,634
l can't. l have no magic left.
l'm out of magic. Look.

1173
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,079
Grrrr!

1174
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,469
- l thought you had Comet.
- Yeah, we...

1175
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,398
Yes! Come on!

1176
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,316
Hey, Comet. We just...

1177
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,475
[groans]

1178
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,958
Comet?

1179
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,318
Comet?

1180
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,953
Look at me.

1181
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,071
- Comet...!
- [groans]

1182
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,352
What are ya doin'?

1183
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,313
- Eating sugar is bad for you.
- [gabbles]

1184
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,155
What do you mean,
you didn't eat this?

1185
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,072
Who did?

1186
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,278
A squirrel?!

1187
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,353
Get this. You gotta fly both
of us back to the North Pole.

1188
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,437
- Yeah, tonight.
- [groans]

1189
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,477
OK. l'll help you up.

1190
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,319
All right? Ready? You've got to
help me a little here.

1191
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,395
[groans]

1192
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,393
Pull.

1193
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,515
Ai! Gah!

1194
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,318
Good. OK, we almost got it.

1195
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,919
That's OK.

1196
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,595
OK, now, help me.
Can ya move anything?

1197
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,152
[long groan]

1198
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,555
Fire in the hole! Get away!

1199
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,836
[farts]

1200
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,355
Whoa!

1201
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,757
Eat some roughage, will you?

1202
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,072
- Oh, what about the jet pack?
- lt burned up on reentry.

1203
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,432
What am l supposed to do?
Grow wings?

1204
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,791
l hope he doesn't have
too many stops to make tonight.

1205
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,148
You and me both, pal.
OK. Let's just get it over with.

1206
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,235
OK.

1207
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,278
One, two...

1208
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,229
Three!

1209
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,718
- What's going on down there?
- Are you sure about this?

1210
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,717
What? The old toaster trick?

1211
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,390
When we were kids we used to do
this to get a little extra cash.

1212
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,114
- Works every time!
- l can't watch this.

1213
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,433
- You ready, buddy?
- All right. Let her rip.

1214
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,835
One,

1215
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,955
two,

1216
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,199
three!

1217
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,355
Ow!

1218
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,596
[groans]

1219
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,233
Oh, Scott!

1220
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,756
- Scott, are you all right?
- Mom!

1221
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,797
- Yes?
- l lost another tooth.

1222
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,116
Should l put it
under my pillow?

1223
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,879
Yes!

1224
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,915
By cuspids!

1225
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,755
Shhh.

1226
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,512
This way. Come on.

1227
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,313
Curtis, get the door.
lt's a Tooth Fairy ambush.

1228
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,591
What do you people want?
l only carry $20 in change.

1229
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,597
Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.

1230
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,830
l've lost the weight
and the beard, but it's me.

1231
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,758
l know Santa. Santa is a friend.
And you, sir, are no Santa.

1232
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,995
l am too.

1233
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,749
How did l know l could capture
you by holdin' on to a wing?

1234
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,838
You wanted to change your name
to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.

1235
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,518
Or, as l recall, Roy.

1236
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,712
And it was Santa's idea
to call you the Molarnator.

1237
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,558
- Who's the kid?
- One of my elves. He's an elf.

1238
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,235
Ow.

1239
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,718
Santa!

1240
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,558
The Molarnator at your service!

1241
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,315
- A little altitude, please!
- What?

1242
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,989
Could you possibly
fly a little higher?

1243
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,075
Oof!

1244
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,357
- What?
- Never mind!

1245
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,432
Principal Newman?

1246
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,271
What is it, Charlie?

1247
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,596
You keep asking me if there's
something bothering me.

1248
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,676
Well, there is. l...

1249
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,669
l couldn't talk
about it before, but...

1250
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,910
l want to talk about it now.

1251
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,551
OK. Go ahead.

1252
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,192
- My dad is Santa.
- Oh, please. Not you too.

1253
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,878
Hold on.

1254
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,118
lf you have no feelings
for my dad, then fine.

1255
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,470
But if the only reason
for not being with him is

1256
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,512
that you don't believe in him,
you're making a big mistake.

1257
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,073
Oh, Charlie...

1258
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,878
Here.

1259
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,518
l want you to take this.
Look into this and...

1260
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,439
try to remember what it was like
when you were little

1261
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,949
and you still
believed in Christmas.

1262
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,512
Seeing isn't believing.
Believing is seeing.

1263
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,150
You haven't seen anything yet!

1264
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,837
- Curtis?
- What? [thump] Ow!

1265
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,838
- What do l do?
- Slow down.

1266
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,915
OK.

1267
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,350
Piece of cake. Attaboy.
There you go.

1268
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,118
Why can't you fly higher?

1269
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,032
Tooth Fairy, l want to thank
you. l'll never forget this.

1270
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,832
l wish l could do more,
but l gotta go.

1271
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,190
Denver just started
a new pee-wee hockey league.

1272
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,356
Before you go,
l want you to know that nobody,

1273
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,948
nobody was
braver than you were today.

1274
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,275
You should be
proud of your wings.

1275
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,831
- They're not too girly?
- Not on you.

1276
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,108
[chuckles]

1277
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,189
Wouldn't it be easier
to go through the workshop?

1278
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,278
No. That way Santa and his
soldiers would be expecting us.

1279
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,710
Sound military strategy involves
taking your enemy by surprise.

1280
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,796
lt's good strategy.

1281
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,878
Sometimes being a despot
is a tough business.

1282
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,955
[laughs]

1283
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,515
Come on.

1284
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,516
[hums]

1285
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,871
lt's Scott, isn't it?

1286
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,071
Yeah. What are you
supposed to be?

1287
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,431
A better, stronger version
of what you used to be -

1288
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,076
with a flawless complexion,
l might add.

1289
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,556
- Look, it just glistens.
- Listen to me. l'm back now.

1290
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,672
So untie us. Let the elves go
and give me back the coat.

1291
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,278
[mumbles]

1292
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,156
No can do! lt's Christmas Eve!
l have coal to deliver!

1293
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,919
And l don't want those
naughty kids to suffer! [laughs]

1294
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,600
Boys! One, two, three!

1295
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,271
And... one, two!

1296
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,675
Try to keep up!
Let's go. Move it on!

1297
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,476
Try to...
This is just too tight.

1298
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,075
[sighs]

1299
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,317
This is all my fault.

1300
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,869
l thought l could
create another Santa.

1301
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,992
My elfin pride
blinded me to all reason.

1302
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,076
There's only one Santa.

1303
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,397
Well, l've done
a pretty rotten job.

1304
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,192
l didn't check the list twice.

1305
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,675
My kid thinks l betrayed him.

1306
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,672
l hurt the woman l love.

1307
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,796
l ruined Christmas.

1308
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,515
Charlie!

1309
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,076
How'd you get up here?

1310
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,675
Scott!

1311
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,395
l got to fly in
with the Tooth Fairy.

1312
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,551
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1313
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,478
Brush between meals
and don't forget the floss.

1314
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,034
And if anybody cares,
l'm exhausted.

1315
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,995
And she...
has a beautiful smile.

1316
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,274
- Thank you for everything.
- No. Thank you.

1317
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,590
l am... [laughs] the Molarnator!

1318
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,275
Whoo!

1319
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,799
Come on!

1320
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,518
Hyah!

1321
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,796
[whistles]

1322
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,392
Get out of the way!

1323
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,994
What are you doing?

1324
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,793
- You gotta save Christmas.
- How am supposed to save...?

1325
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,315
[crash]

1326
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,315
- No, no, no.
- Please. Don't worry.

1327
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,712
[elves] Whoa!

1328
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,792
Slow down.

1329
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,433
Stay.

1330
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,629
[elves] Whoah!

1331
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,551
[Chet] Oh, Chet...

1332
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,715
Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!

1333
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,556
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.

1334
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,752
OK. Chet, this is it.
You ready to rock and roll?

1335
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,874
- Chet?
- Yeah. He's still in training.

1336
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,635
- Has he had much flight time?
- About a minute and a half.

1337
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,194
- He's had a lot of crash time!
- Curtis...!

1338
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,880
- He's just a baby.
- All right.

1339
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,996
Let's see what this baby can do.

1340
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,759
- [Chet hums]
- Oh, boy.

1341
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,674
Ready to go, buddy?
You know what we gotta do.

1342
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,358
Hyah!

1343
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,315
Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chet, Chet.

1344
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,276
[Chet cackles wildly]

1345
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,151
You gotta focus, Chet.

1346
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,831
OK, everybody! Outside, now!

1347
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,596
Almost there, boys. Let's go!

1348
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,309
[laughs]

1349
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,196
- Chet, whoa!

OK, elves...

Let's get 'em!

Whoa, whoa! Not so far!

Faster!

1367

The lead.
The one in the front, Chet!

1368
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,995

[Scott] Hey, guys, back up. l've
got a special place for him.

1399
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,715
You idiot! Wait a minute,
something's shocking me.

1400
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,751
- You were great.
- Sounds like you were too.

1401
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,871
- We've got ten minutes.
- Where is Carol?

1402
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,799
- Carol! Are you all right?
- Yes!

1403
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,037
- Where are you going?
- l gotta deliver gifts.

1404
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,912
Aren't you forgetting something?

1405
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,917
- No.
- You gotta get married.

1406
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,996
Excuse me?

1407
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,033
Carol, l...

1408
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,475
l cannot continue being Santa...
unless l find a Mrs Claus.

1409
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,190
Oh. So that's what the whole
noodles and pie thing...

1410
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,880
- You just needed a wife.
- No.

1411
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,834
No?

1412
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,998
- Yes.
- Yes?

1413
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,597
Yes, l was looking for a wife.

1414
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,876
No, l didn't figure on
falling... in love.

1415
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,592
You love me?

1416
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,754
- This is all happening so fast.
- Well, there's no pressure.

1417
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,034
Good.

1418
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,232
l mean, if l don't get married
l just won't deliver the gifts

1419
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,272
and children everywhere
will stop believing,

1420
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,154
the elves will lose their jobs,
the North Pole will disappear

1421
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,236
and Christmas will be gone.

1422
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,998
- Get down on one knee.
- Hm?

1423
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,351
Do it. Now.

1424
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,116
Say ''Carol.''

1425
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,512
- Carol.
- Uh-huh?

1426
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,074
Yeah?

1427
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,873
You say this is happening
all so fast.

1428
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,354
You say this is happening
all so fast.

1429
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,755
But you've known me
your whole life.

1430
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,951
But you've known me
your whole life.

1431
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,196
When you were
little and alone...

1432
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,389
[Scott repeats]

1433
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,273
- [both] Santa...
- l can take it from here.

1434
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,231
..Santa was always
there for you.

1435
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,830
And l will be, as long as you
continue to believe in me.

1436
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,594
l know l'm asking you
to leave everything at home,

1437
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,154
but l can guarantee you
that this is worth it.

1438
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,838
This place...

1439
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,877
This place is all about magic

1440
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,274
and love... and wonder.

1441
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,994
And occasionally
a thin-crust pizza

1442
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,829
and a movie and
a long winter night.

1443
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,716
ls there a school here?

1444
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,074
Yeah, we have one, a school, but
the elves need a new principal.

1445
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,909
Cos as of late some of the elves
have been acting a bit impish.

1446
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,236
Carol...

1447
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,636
- l love you.
- You do?

1448
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,955
Would you be my wife?

1449
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,159
[whispers] l will.

1450
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,999
[whispers] Thank you.
l've got it from here.

1451
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,518
l will.

1452
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,478
By the powers vested in me
by me,

1453
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,358
l now pronounce you Santa

1454
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,799
and Mrs Claus.

1455
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,509
Well, go on now. Kiss her!

1456
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,835
Awwww!

1457
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,756
[gurgling]

1458
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,717
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Walk me to my sleigh.

1459
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,669
We gotta go! When we get back,
we start making some more toys.

1460
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,279
All right. Well, Mrs Claus,
you might want to get some rest.

1461
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,837
You see, tomorrow begins
vacation season for me,

1462
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,396
which means a three-month
honeymoon for us.

1463
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,596
Nothing tropical. You do not
want to see this in a Speedo.

1464
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,992
Don't be home too late.

1465
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,712
And so it begins.

1466
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,314
Boys, we've got
some toys to deliver!

1467
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,193
Hyah!

1468
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,673
[whispers] Lucy?

1469
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,993
What, Charlie?

1470
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,439
Come downstairs.
l want you to see something.

1471
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,518
[whispers] Lucy.

1472
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,271
Watch this.

1473
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,358
Uncle Scott?!

1474
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,959
- Do you have any twos?
- Go fish!

1475
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,834
You are Santa!
l knew it was you all along.

1476
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,394
- And you were right.
- Uncle Scott...

1477
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,953
You look all rosy.
Are you feeling better?

1478
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,436
l'm feeling much, much better.

1479
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,074
ls there anything else
l should know about?

1480
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,113
l don't know. But Charlie has
something he wants to tell you.

1481
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,719
OK.

1482
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,711
You know, l was exactly your age
when l found out my dad was Santa.

1483
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,116
- But l couldn't tell anybody.
- l can't tell anybody either?

1484
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,073
No. But knowing it
isn't a burden.

1485
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,719
lt's a gift.

1486
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,277
Most kids stop believing in
Santa when they grow up.

1487
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,550
But l get to
believe in him forever.

1488
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,399
l love you, Charlie. Thank you.

1489
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,918
But do we still get toys?

1490
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,118
lf you ever get to bed and go to
sleep like the other kids.

1491
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,037
Oh... OK!

1492
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:22,277

01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,912
Look, if we're gonna dance...

1523
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,478
dance like this.
All of us!

1524
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,756
Everybody, you idiots!

1525
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,553
Hey, lady!

1526
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,519
Watch this!

1527
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,676
Ever seen a toy do this?

1529
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,751
