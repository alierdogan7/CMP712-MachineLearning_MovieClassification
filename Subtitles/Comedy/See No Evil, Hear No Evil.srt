1
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,140
Are you fucking deaf? Move!

2
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,985
Are you deaf? Look behind you!

3
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,629
Get out of the way! You're blocking traffic.

4
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:03,938
Get off the street!

5
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,668
What do you want me to do about it?
Tell him!

6
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,183
You dumb idiot!

7
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm turning here, you dumb idiot!
Where you from, Oshkosh?

8
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:27,777
-Watch your step.
-You're a dumb idiot.

9
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:29,868
You talking to me?

10
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,866
-You talking to me, asshole?
-Wally, don't start anything!

11
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,378
-Let the man talk.
-Up yours!

12
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:42,344
I heard that before, dickhead.
You got anything to get off your chest?

13
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,147
Who are you talking to?

14
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:47,426
Say one more word.
Just one more fucking word.

15
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,784
-Come on!
-You dumb asshole!

16
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,417
Come on!

17
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,700
-You don't show me shit.
-Who are you fighting this time?

18
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,467
Stop it! Come on.

19
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:04,701
-Step up.
-Fuck you!

20
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,508
We're going down.

21
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,667
Why try to pass for someone with
20/20 vision when you're blind as a bat?

22
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,629
-I don't feel I have to pass.
-Yes, you do.

23
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,378
It's a sickness in your brain,
just like trying to pass for white.

24
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:31,868
I'm not white?

25
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,064
-Sit down.
-This is a scandal!

26
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,987
What do you mean, I'm not white?

27
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,185
Why didn't you tell me this before?

28
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,578
-My own sister!
-Sit down.

29
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,940
Goodness gracious!
A lot of adjustments have to be made.

30
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,339
I have to cancel the swimming lessons.

31
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:50,227
What will the guys at the club say?
I'm not white!

32
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,587
It feels like it.

33
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,825
Goodness gracious, you're right!

34
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,908
-Lord, help me.
-Does Dad know?

35
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,989
$20 across-the-board on Centipede.

36
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,539
Thank you very much. Just a minute.

37
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,946
You said that was all.

38
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,820
-I know, but I want my $50.
-You already owe that bookie!

39
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:17,939
-I don't want a lecture, give me my money.
-This is the last $50 to your name.

40
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,905
-I know, but $50, please.
-Three minutes to post time.

41
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,744
And $50 to win on Centipede.

42
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,702
Come on Centipede. You can do it.

43
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,708
Come on, you bitch!

44
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,423
-Who won?
-It wasn't Centipede.

45
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:58,341
Shit! Damn!

46
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,739
You shouldn't have quit your job.

47
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,140
The man treated me like I was blind.

48
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,188
So try someone else!
You can't go on like this. Get another job.

49
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,983
Mr. Lyons!

50
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,427
What's the matter with me?

51
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,502
The fire inspector...

52
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,708
...wants you to pick up papers.

53
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,059
Much dangerous.

54
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,742
Big fire.

55
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,824
You must please sweep up
before you close the shop.

56
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:42,978
Mr. Huddleston...

57
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,459
...there's a vicious rumour
going around this building that I'm deaf.

58
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,302
I don't know how it started,
but I don't like it.

59
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,660
So let's try and put a stop to it.

60
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,341
I feel like such a fool.

61
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,784
Don't worry about the fire inspector.

62
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,781
He's always coming around here
trying to get bribes.

63
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,858
You don't have to read lips?
They said you had to read lips.

64
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,947
I feel like such an ass.

65
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,589
Especially on the last Thursday
of the month.

66
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,659
I can't turn left. I'll go around the block
and park across the street.

67
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,499
No, you're not parking anywhere.
Just pull over here by the curb.

68
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,781
What are you talking about?

69
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,383
I'm not a baby. I don't need a baby-sitter.

70
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,066
Just point me in the right direction.

71
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,218
Point you?

72
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:47,581
Are you crazy? Take your cane
or you won't make it across the street.

73
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,024
No. Put the cane down.

74
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,542
I can hear, can't l?

75
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,308
All I need is Big Mo.

76
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:58,427
I want to see this.

77
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,708
Here.

78
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:02,944
Thank you.

79
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,061
Good luck with thejob.

80
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,338
Excuse me, sir. Nice day, isn't it?

81
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,542
So far, so good.

82
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,023
I'll pick you up in front of the building.

83
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:35,498
Remember, wait for the beeps.

84
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,822
Wait for the beeps. Wait for the beep.

85
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:41,101
I will. Thank you.

86
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,701
Would you help me across?

87
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:46,221
Yes, take my arm.

88
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:53,987
Here we go.

89
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,906
Sis, how am I doing?

90
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,424
Great. Just great.

91
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,828
Thank you very much.

92
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,661
You don't have to thank me.

93
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:22,297
After all, this to me, is just fun.

94
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,026
It's like a walk in the park.

95
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,186
Here you are, safe and sound.
You have any trouble, just call.

96
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:34,457
Can I help you?

97
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:36,819
I'm here about the ad in the paper:

98
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:39,543
"Salesman wanted.
Must have sense of humour."

99
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,660
Are you the owner of the shop?

100
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,580
Who are you talking to?

101
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,299
There you are! Damn. Look at that.

102
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,346
Contacts again. You see that?

103
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,020
I'm looking for a Mr. David Lyons.

104
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,428
I'm David Lyons.

105
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,341
Pleased to meet you, David.

106
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,701
I read your ad in the paper
about an lvy League type.

107
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,381
Tall, dark, handsome.

108
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,266
Three out of four ain't bad.

109
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,021
I'm kind of nervous.

110
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,748
I really want the job.

111
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:08,626
I am a damned good salesman.

112
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,899
I'm David. How can I help you?

113
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,779
Are we caught in a time warp here?

114
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,337
Twilight Zone?

115
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,627
Any Martians here
want to speak to Mr. David Lyons?

116
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,588
You're a fun guy.

117
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,979
I really like that ad you put in the paper.

118
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,266
"Must have sense of humour."
Not many people would do that.

119
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,341
I'm your guy. If you want me, here I am.

120
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,540
Would you tell me what you want?

121
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,857
$350.

122
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:41,585
What are you talking about?

123
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,667
$300, but that's it.

124
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,217
-Are you talking to me?
-$225!

125
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,549
$225 a week!

126
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,789
Okay, $200. I can't live on less than that!

127
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,667
Who are you talking to?

128
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,865
I'm talking to you, you prick!

129
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,546
Look me in the eye and say that!

130
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,178
I would if I could, but I can't. I'm blind.

131
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:06,218
You're blind?

132
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,226
Yes. Now can I have the job?

133
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,659
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

134
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:13,504
Now you know. Can I get the job?

135
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,468
You're really blind?

136
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,143
I'm really blind.
What are you, fucking deaf?

137
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,618
Yes!

138
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm fucking deaf!

139
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,345
-You're deaf?
-Yes, I'm deaf.

140
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,859
-You really deaf?
-I'm really deaf.

141
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,621
How do you know what I'm saying?

142
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,701
I'm reading your lips.
Now do you want the job or not?

143
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,026
Because I'm blind?
Shove it up your ass, pal!

144
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,299
I don't want no favours
from a deaf asshole!

145
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,586
Then go home! Get out of here!
Give me some peace of mind.

146
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,388
To hell with blind people!
Just turn around and walk out!

147
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:48,382
That's better. Now,
I believe we agreed on $300.

148
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,699
What are we talking about?

149
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:53,144
Just a minute. Wait. Stop the music.

150
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,942
-Do you like Harvey Wallbangers?
-Harvey who?

151
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:00,426
Wallbangers, a friend of mine.
I'll introduce you later.

152
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:03,017
'Cause tonight, my friend, we celebrate!

153
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,979
-Did I hit the board?
-No, the wall. It's a lot better.

154
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,067
Three Wallbangers, Wally.

155
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,028
Drink time!

156
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:17,859
-Where's your friend?
-He should be here real soon.

157
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:21,188
You'll like him.
This is to you, Sally. Sally?

158
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,467
And especially to you, Leslie,
for buying the drinks.

159
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,698
My pleasure.

160
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,627
What does your friend look like?

161
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,223
I've never seen him,
but he smells real good.

162
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,301
I think he's by the door.

163
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,665
-Over here!
-I'm here.

164
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:54,624
I want you to meet two good friends
of mine. This is Sally.

165
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,059
And this lovely lady to my left....

166
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,657
-This is Lisa.
-Leslie.

167
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,942
And this is my good friend, David Lyons.

168
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,698
Wally says you're in business together.

169
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,343
-Congratulations.
-Wally says what?

170
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,144
We don't have to talk about that now.
Let's talk about Harvey Wallbangers.

171
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,504
That's who I'm going to meet tonight?

172
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,782
-Hey, asshole.
-Sorry?

173
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,188
Who do you think you are?

174
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,581
David Lyons. You must be Harvey.
Wally's said lots of nice things about you.

175
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:30,137
A real comedian. Get off my jacket!

176
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:34,541
Listen, asswipe. You better watch yourself
or you'll be going home real early.

177
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:38,542
-I didn't know I was on your jacket.
-What are you? The local constable?

178
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,507
Who's your girlfriend?

179
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,865
I think I heard my mating call.

180
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,179
-Stand up.
-I am standing.

181
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,698
Wait a minute. My friend is--

182
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:49,461
Is a killer! That's what I am.

183
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,948
A trained killer!

184
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,587
Special Forces.

185
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,142
When I was in the Corps...

186
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:59,301
...we used to eat you Green Beret pussies
for breakfast.

187
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,664
-Eat this!
-This guy's tough.

188
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,583
-If I can hear him, I can hit him.
-He could put a hole in your head.

189
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:09,027
You ain't talking now?

190
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,299
Come on, big mouth, say something.

191
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:16,024
Let's get down.
Last night I was out with your sister.

192
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,061
Okay, butthead.

193
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:22,861
You're all right, champ. He's coming.

194
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:24,980
I'll give you the first hit.

195
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,537
He's coming, Wally. He's coming.

196
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,308
Lower. He's a few inches shorter than you.

197
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:31,868
Aim for 12:00.

198
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,542
11:00!

199
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:43,427
Circle right.

200
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:46,384
Left.

201
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:49,704
And right!

202
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,458
Circle left!

203
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:53,664
Stand still!

204
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,145
Get ready. 1:00!

205
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:58,021
Good. 12:00!

206
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:01,139
Five to three. I got mixed up!

207
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,021
Circle left.

208
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,818
-Shut up and let him fight.
-Move right.

209
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,658
Get ready! 11:00!

210
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,738
-What?
-Read my lips, asshole!

211
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,908
I got that.

212
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,104
1:00!

213
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,222
Son of a bitch!

214
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,097
You had enough?

215
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,977
-How you doing?
-I'm doing great!

216
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,777
We should hang out like this more often.

217
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,983
It's nice to unwind after work.

218
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,140
Does that mean I get the job?

219
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,068
Depends...

220
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,739
...on how this fight comes out.

221
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,339
I bought this big bottle of champagne.

222
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,746
Must've cost $45.

223
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:10,503
I had my sister drop me off at Jones Beach.

224
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,507
I sat down in the sand
and started drinking...

225
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:19,179
...and sneaking peeks to see
if people were watching me cry.

226
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:23,901
Then I realised it didn't matter if they were
'cause I couldn't see them anyway.

227
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,220
That's when I made a decision.

228
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,427
I wasn't going to piss my life away
because of anger.

229
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:33,905
That's when I decided, blind or not blind...

230
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,465
...l was going to be the same
loveable asshole I've always been.

231
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:45,105
You haven't made that decision yet,
have you?

232
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,417
No.

233
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,383
How'd you become an actor if you're deaf?

234
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,828
I wasn't born deaf.

235
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,905
I got scarlet fever in high school.

236
00:16:56,989 --> 00:17:00,106
I didn't lose all my hearing
until eight years ago.

237
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:02,627
So why'd you stop acting?

238
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,747
I started missing cues
when the other actors would...

239
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,503
...turn around and I couldn't see their lips.

240
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,668
They ever catch you?

241
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,666
No, I don't think anyone knew.

242
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:15,662
I just lost my nerve.

243
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,819
When's the last time you were laid?

244
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,900
You were eating. When's what?

245
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,101
Laid! The last time you were laid!

246
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,657
Too sad.

247
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,667
Next subject, please.

248
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,467
You don't want to know.

249
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:34,142
So where's your wife?

250
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,268
I think in Cleveland.
I haven't seen her for eight years.

251
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,543
Nice lady?

252
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:39,864
Very nice.

253
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:42,265
Wonderful, warm woman.

254
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:46,541
And then, one day...

255
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:50,782
...she turned into this amazing creature
who could sit on a broomstick...

256
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,344
...and take off into the air.

257
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,939
She could actually achieve flight.

258
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,740
I think I was married to that lady once.

259
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,944
Small world.

260
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,265
Funny thing is, this happened...

261
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,218
...the same time I went completely deaf.
Isn't that a coincidence?

262
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,300
Amazing. Who'd believe it?

263
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,221
What do you want out of life
before the show's over?

264
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,703
Just not to make a fool out of myself.

265
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,382
That's all you want?

266
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,865
I have this terrible fear...

267
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,666
...that I'll make a mistake...

268
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:28,219
...and everyone'll stand around...

269
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,462
...and stare at me.

270
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,301
Boy, damn!

271
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,859
I wish I had met you eight years ago.

272
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,509
I can fix your problems in ten seconds.

273
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:38,818
Ten seconds?

274
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,942
Ten seconds, if you trust me.
Do you trust me?

275
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,382
Sure.

276
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,147
You're a good-looking guy.

277
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,778
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

278
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,541
How's that feel? Good?

279
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:07,826
You look a little silly to me.

280
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:09,583
Kind of foolish.

281
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,427
You see, life ain't so complicated.

282
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,828
-When's the next one coming?
-Any second.

283
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,865
That might be the truck coming now.

284
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,019
I have to go get a damn screwdriver.

285
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:47,862
The blind guy around?

286
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,307
Where's the blind guy?

287
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,864
-Who do you want?
-Kerew. Wally Kerew.

288
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,584
I'm his bookie. I owe him some money.

289
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:09,068
He's waiting for a delivery.
He'll be back in a minute.

290
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:10,468
Is he out front?

291
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,308
I'll go find him.

292
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,539
I almost forgot. I need some....

293
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:26,227
-We're not officially open yet.
-I know. I need some of that stuff up there.

294
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:29,827
My tummy's all kaput.
What is that stuff up there?

295
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,107
-What, the antacid?
-Yes.

296
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,425
What's the difference between
Alka-Seltzer and the one next to it?

297
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,498
Di-Gel?

298
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,829
Do me a favour.
Can you read it to me, please?

299
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:45,108
-You want me to read out Di-Gel?
-Yeah, my eyes ain't too good.

300
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:47,824
Jesus.

301
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,543
"Di-Gel contains calcium carbonate,
an effective antacid...."

302
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,418
Where you going?

303
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,945
Here, take it. Honestly,
I wasn't trying to pull anything.

304
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:05,261
You were told to deliver this
right from the airport.

305
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,738
I thought I was being tailed by the cops.

306
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,218
I didn't want to bring them
near Mr. Sutherland.

307
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,708
You gotta tell him that.

308
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,667
You tell him that.
I have a car waiting out front.

309
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,827
I'm dead if I go with you.

310
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,224
You're dead if you don't go with me.

311
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,748
"Bubbles of gas, trapped in the stomach,
can cause heartburn...

312
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,821
"...acid indigestion
and that full, bloated feeling.

313
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,066
"And unlike plain antacids...

314
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,904
"...the simethicone breaks up
gas bubbles rapidly...

315
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:44,257
"...to relieve fullness and pressure."
I feel like a commercial.

316
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,580
What the hell was that?

317
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:02,378
Wait a minute.

318
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,585
Wait my ass! I thought I heard....

319
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,346
What is this? Hide-and-seek?

320
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,908
-This guy is dead.
-Wally, there's a gun here.

321
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:28,897
Don't touch it!

322
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,538
Freeze!

323
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,461
Drop it! I said drop it!

324
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:35,779
-What is he saying?
-Are you holding a weapon?

325
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:36,904
Yes, I am.

326
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,940
Throw it away! Get rid of it!

327
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:41,468
-Stay there!
-Freeze!

328
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,188
-Don't shoot!
-Don't move or we'll blow your brains out.

329
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,497
-Wait!
-Shut up!

330
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,542
Please, be gentle.

331
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:49,784
Let's go.

332
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,544
-I had nothing to do with this.
-Let's go!

333
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,063
Officer, he came for Alka-Seltzer.

334
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,380
The man asked me to read him
a Di-Gel label, can you believe that?

335
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,425
We don't even know the man.

336
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:03,663
Wally, get the money from the cigar box.

337
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:09,503
Officer, excuse me. Honest to God,
isn't there a nice way we can settle this?

338
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:11,028
Can I at least get my coat?

339
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,986
Hang on. We'll get your coat.

340
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:17,780
Tell Mr. Huddleston to lock up for us.

341
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,902
Let's move out.

342
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:52,705
You can't say whether
this mystery woman fired the shot or not?

343
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,820
No, but if she was innocent...

344
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,821
...why did she leave
right after the shot was fired?

345
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,821
-That makes sense.
-Gatlin.

346
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,948
What's the story?
The Commissioner is crawling up my ass!

347
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:10,824
The whole thing sounds kind of shaky.

348
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,298
The deaf guy's not sure about the woman.

349
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:17,143
The blind guy heard the shot,
but can't make an identification.

350
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:19,823
You're feeling too damn sorry for them.

351
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:23,379
You're always feeling sorry for people,
that's your trouble.

352
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:25,107
I'll take care of this.

353
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:35,385
Now we're gonna quit fucking around here
and start talking serious.

354
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:37,778
Now you claim
there was a woman present.

355
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,780
Was there a woman present?

356
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,507
Was there a woman present?

357
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:48,341
I'm sorry. You talking to me?

358
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:51,466
You bet your ass I'm talking to you.
Was there or wasn't there?

359
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,380
Was there or wasn't there what?

360
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,061
A woman present.

361
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:58,266
I smelled a woman,
but I didn't see a woman.

362
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,498
What about you, wiseass?
Was there or wasn't there a woman?

363
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:09,467
What the hell do I have to do,
take you to a private room and ask you?

364
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:13,027
He's deaf. You have to be facing him.

365
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,221
No more bullshit!
Was there or wasn't there a woman?

366
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,661
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm goddamn serious.

367
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,025
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a woman?

368
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,421
What the hell is he talking about?

369
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:28,898
He reads lips. You're talking too fast.

370
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,780
Was there...

371
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:37,258
...a woman...

372
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:38,983
...present?

373
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,538
Yes.

374
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,105
There was...

375
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:46,939
...a woman...

376
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:49,586
...present.

377
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,861
Why is he talking like that?

378
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,588
Because he's deaf...

379
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,419
...not stupid.

380
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:04,862
Can you tell me one goddamn thing
about that woman?

381
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:08,659
She has the most magnificent legs
I've ever seen in my life.

382
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,389
Yeah, and she smells good, too.

383
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:15,866
Don't tell me you didn't hear anything,
'cause he heard it!

384
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,941
And you, don't tell me
you didn't see anything 'cause he saw it.

385
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,339
Between the two of you,
you saw and heard everything.

386
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:27,267
Some poor bastard's dead,
so start answering some questions here!

387
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:29,587
-Excuse me, Captain?
-What!

388
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,060
Professor Kasuda from uptown.
You'll be interested in his ballistics report.

389
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,457
What do you got?

390
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,906
I think I can prove to a judge
that both of these men had the mens rea.

391
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,900
What the hell is a mens rea?

392
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:45,623
It's a legal term the lawyers use.

393
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:48,627
It just means
the intention to commit a crime.

394
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,304
-Okay, come on, let's go.
-Mens rea?

395
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:52,617
Put the cuffs on them.

396
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,381
How could we have gotten mens rea?

397
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:56,425
-Don't worry.
-Come on, get up, will ya?

398
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:59,103
-Did we take blood?
-Get up, for crying out loud!

399
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,702
Please rise.

400
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:03,100
Can you do it without taking blood?

401
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:06,022
Stupid, he's deaf.
You have to be facing him!

402
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:08,907
The lab says that gun you were holding
was the death weapon.

403
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,219
We both use condoms.
How is this possible?

404
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,948
-I want to see a lawyer.
-That's not all Mr. Kerew.

405
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:15,747
-I want a doctor.
-We found something...

406
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:18,059
...in the apartment
of the deceased Mr. Scotto.

407
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:19,628
Joey Scotto!

408
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:23,947
We found your name
on a marker in Mr. Scotto's wallet.

409
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,226
"W. Kerew, $2,800, overdue."

410
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,777
-Because I owe him money?
-I feel sick.

411
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,863
You owe the guy $3,000
he comes to bust your head...

412
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,940
...and your boyfriend lets him have it.

413
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,906
He is not my boyfriend.

414
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,308
Mens rea!

415
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:43,025
My God! No!

416
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,144
Chequebook.

417
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:49,464
Knife.

418
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,142
Racing forms.

419
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,222
A pair of undershorts.

420
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,702
And a ticket...

421
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,459
...to EI Paso, Texas. It's not here!

422
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,297
No coin.

423
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:33,221
-I wish I hadn't killed him.
-If you had to, you had to.

424
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,262
We know he had it at the airport,
he must've made a switchover somewhere.

425
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,462
The man who owns the news-stand,
his name is David Lyons.

426
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,904
He was talking to Scotto when I arrived.

427
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:46,225
Would he be able to identify you?

428
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:49,899
No, he never saw me. Also, he's deaf.

429
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:51,937
Deaf?

430
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,824
And the other one is blind.

431
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,539
Blind? Deaf? What is this, a joke?

432
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,303
No joke.

433
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,701
-I spoke with the building superintendent.
-Let's pay them a visit, shall we?

434
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,588
They're in jail now.

435
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,145
Then let's bail them out.

436
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,498
All right, Mr. Lyons,
I need a nice full face shot first.

437
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:20,417
Then we'll get our side shots later.

438
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:21,538
You ready?

439
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,541
We're here because you owed
that sleazeball $2,800?

440
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,381
Face forward, please.

441
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:30,667
I thought the Knicks would beat Boston,
and they came damn close.

442
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:33,423
Tell your friend to face the front, please.

443
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,624
Face front.

444
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,023
-What do you need a bookie for?
-Credit.

445
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:41,147
-Face front, please.
-No one else would give me credit.

446
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,938
-Face front.
-Will you tell him to hold still, please?

447
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:46,868
Hold still.

448
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,583
What's he doing?

449
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:53,297
Holding still.

450
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:56,704
Not looking at you, looking at me!

451
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,702
Face the camera.

452
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,780
Perfect. Tell him not to move.

453
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,622
-What?
-Don't move.

454
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm getting fed up with her.

455
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,901
Why is he doing this to me?

456
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:14,259
I just want him to face the camera!

457
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:16,778
-He's not facing the camera?
-No!

458
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:18,907
It's news to me.

459
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,220
-What?
-Face the camera.

460
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:25,058
That's better. Hold it.

461
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,623
-She should make up her mind.
-Shit!

462
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:29,378
Shit!

463
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,588
Shit!

464
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:36,545
-Is she saying shit or ship?
-Shit.

465
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,983
Why would she say "ship"?

466
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,182
-It wouldn't make any sense.
-Get him out of here. I want him out, now!

467
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,301
You're finished.
I'll get you when you're sleeping.

468
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:56,379
We'll be all right. Once they find
that woman, they'll let us out.

469
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:59,108
What woman?
They're not looking for no woman.

470
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,578
They got their killers. Us. We're fucked!

471
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,182
Captain, honestly....

472
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:06,749
-You all right?
-What the hell's wrong with you?

473
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,423
Can't you walk?
What do we have to do, carry you?

474
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,067
You don't have to do shit for me.

475
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,344
He's blind and you have him handcuffed!

476
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,420
Come on, for crying out loud.

477
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:19,821
All right, take the cuffs off him
before he wrecks the goddamn joint.

478
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:21,747
Don't do me no favours.

479
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:24,100
Is everybody happy now?

480
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:27,745
Are we all friends again?
Come on now, let's go.

481
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:33,861
Joe, I got Lyons, David;
Kerew, Wallace, suspected homicide.

482
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:35,907
His lawyers are here, Captain.

483
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,059
-Whose?
-David Lyons.

484
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,907
My lawyers?

485
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,989
You want to check him for police brutality?

486
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:46,141
You got as long as it takes to print him.
Get in here.

487
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:50,980
-I know you don't know who we are.
-Your right hand, please.

488
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:54,300
Our law firm represents
the building you have your shop in.

489
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:57,342
We've been sent here
to try to arrange bail for you.

490
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:59,385
-Great.
-That's a nice surprise.

491
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,862
They can only hold you and Mr. Kerew
up to 72 hours before an arraignment.

492
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,948
With luck,
we'll have you out of here by 5:00.

493
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:10,625
We're pushing the blind and deaf angle.
We hope you don't mind.

494
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,665
No, we don't mind. Use it.

495
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,740
We'll see you both very soon.

496
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:17,498
Excuse me, miss, have we met before?

497
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:21,821
No, I don't think so.

498
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,218
Are you wearing Shalimar perfume?

499
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:27,901
Yes, I am.

500
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:30,980
You have a remarkable nose.

501
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:34,540
-Thank you.
-Good-bye.

502
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:39,019
I never knew anyone so beautiful.

503
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:41,942
The lady's got style. Muy peligrosa.

504
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:45,546
I'd love to go to sleep listening
to a voice like that.

505
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:50,377
Oh, my God.

506
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:52,901
-The legs.
-Yes, I can imagine.

507
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:54,820
-The legs!
-The legs, of course.

508
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,467
-It's her!
-The killer?

509
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,825
Captain, the lady in my shop
that I was talking about. That's her!

510
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,218
-That woman is your lawyer?
-She's not my lawyer.

511
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,777
Now she's not your lawyer!
That makes a lot of sense.

512
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,337
She's not my lawyer!
That's the lady you want!

513
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,897
How come you couldn't
describe her before?

514
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,662
Because I only saw her from the rear.

515
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:16,219
When she went around just now
and I saw her tush, I knew it was her.

516
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:21,306
That's the lady you want! Stop her!
Stop that lady!

517
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:25,225
With a little luck,
we'll have them to ourselves by 5:00.

518
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:28,182
-They seem nice.
-So was the chicken I ate last night.

519
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,985
Now, either the police get us for murder,
or we get bailed out by the killer.

520
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,821
At least my way we have a chance.

521
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:39,219
-Are you with me?
-All right, guys, let's go.

522
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:41,460
-Yes or no?
-Yes.

523
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:47,382
Come on, move these guys.
Let's move them!

524
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:50,108
Come on, let's go. We got to go. Sorry.

525
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:02,383
I bet these guys are going to
enjoy themselves on Riker's lsland.

526
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:06,348
I bet you learn to speak Spanish real quick.
Won't that be nice?

527
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:09,977
I hear that they make the greatest...

528
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,062
...kidney fricassee with pineapple Jell-O.
It's really special.

529
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:15,662
Party time.

530
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,581
Tell me when.

531
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:21,778
Now!

532
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:43,818
-What's going on?
-Protesters.

533
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:46,898
Demonstrators? Good. Go with the flow.

534
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,024
Mix in.

535
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:04,299
Excuse me, sir.
Could I have a word with you?

536
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:07,301
-Now you're released, how do you feel?
-Great.

537
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,704
Do you really think you can stop Khomeini?

538
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,668
Not if it's funny. "A good comedy,"
as you call it, is worth its weight in gold.

539
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:15,501
Have you ever read Norman Cousins?

540
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:19,025
-About the immune system?
-Baby, come on. Comedy.

541
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:23,786
When is this going to be on?
I want my sister to tape it.

542
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,623
Thank you.

543
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:34,066
As you can see,
this remains a complicated issue.

544
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,219
How could we lose a blind guy
and a deaf guy?

545
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,982
This is gonna look great on my record.
Son of a bitch!

546
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,468
I want these guys! Now!

547
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,898
Calm down. We'll get them.

548
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,100
We better get them. We better!

549
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,868
Careful.

550
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,223
Turn left.

551
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:55,383
Wait. Try the door. There's a hole here.

552
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:59,064
Put your fingers right in here. Pull.

553
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:03,102
There's an alley!

554
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:06,977
I'm right here. Step down once.
Follow me.

555
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,658
Careful. There's an alley right here.

556
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,899
Careful. Turn right.

557
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,661
Here's another door.

558
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,538
It's open. Go on in.

559
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:24,303
Kerew is blind. Repeat, blind.

560
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,382
Lyons, David. 5'10". Caucasian.

561
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:30,381
Blonde hair. Lyons is deaf. Repeat, deaf.

562
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:35,058
Form barricades. Sixth Avenue to Hudson,
Houston to West Fourth.

563
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,624
Every available cruiser, scramble now.

564
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:44,781
How does someone
so beautiful go and kill somebody?

565
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:49,141
Careful. The broken wood is
in front of you.

566
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,582
Wait a minute.

567
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,102
Hold my head.

568
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,068
Hold my head.

569
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:00,657
Hold my head.

570
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:03,303
Thank you.

571
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,498
Are you all right?

572
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:07,302
Thank you very much.

573
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:16,184
They said to call back in ten minutes.

574
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:20,182
The judge is just getting out of court.
We can have them in half an hour.

575
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:22,588
This way, Wally.

576
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,227
Don't guide me.

577
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,579
-Don't guide me!
-What?

578
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,507
They're looking for a blind guy
and a deaf guy.

579
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,181
We have to get away from here.

580
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:33,908
You won't make it.
You'll crack your head open.

581
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:35,547
Not if you stamp your feet.

582
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:39,542
-If I what?
-Stamp your feet. I'll follow the sound.

583
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,018
Like this?

584
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,907
Louder! I can hear the noise.
I'll follow you.

585
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:48,899
That's good! Now move out!

586
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,183
Jesus!

587
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,419
We have to find the subway.

588
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,545
-I feel ridiculous.
-You look fine to me!

589
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:00,987
I think we should kill them.
I think we have to.

590
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:05,700
-We don't want them around to identify us.
-It's not up to me, it's up to Sutherland.

591
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:08,257
If he wants us to kill them,
then we'll kill them.

592
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:12,183
Right now, let's just get them
out of there and get the coin.

593
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:20,781
Mr. Kerew? How did you get out of jail?

594
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,703
-Who is it?
-It's all right. It's us. Your lawyers.

595
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:26,463
Shalimar.

596
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,104
That's right. Shalimar.

597
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:32,580
What is Mr. Lyons doing?

598
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:35,348
He's got to go to the bathroom real bad.

599
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:39,819
And if you got to go, you gotta go! Go!

600
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,502
Don't worry about me!

601
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,103
You go on without me!
I'll catch up with you later!

602
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,623
When you gotta go, you gotta go!
You know?

603
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,139
Not everybody can stand around and wait!

604
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,027
Just go! Don't worry about me, okay?

605
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:56,538
I'll catch up with you! Do you hear me!

606
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,382
Sure, I hear you fine.

607
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:01,825
You snuck up on me. Damn you.

608
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,743
You're close enough now to read my lips.

609
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:07,348
Yes, I can.

610
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,465
-Guess who I ran into today?
-Who?

611
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,777
The kidders?

612
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:19,948
Where'd you learn to lip read?
Underwater?

613
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:23,746
The killers, Mr. Lyons.

614
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,820
May I have the coin, Mr. Kerew?

615
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,579
What coin are we talking about?

616
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:32,740
They may not know they have it.

617
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:37,103
Excuse me.

618
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:39,699
Let's see if I can find it.

619
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:45,662
I don't know what you're looking for,
but it's a little to the right.

620
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,825
-Here it is.
-Here what is?

621
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,619
It's a rare gold coin, Mr. Kerew.

622
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:58,659
Very valuable. Your friend, Mr. Scotto,
put it in your cigar box...

623
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,421
...before he passed away.

624
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:02,465
I've had it all the time?

625
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:05,622
-Now what?
-You know how I feel.

626
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:07,578
Can we go now?

627
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:11,102
I'll call our employer and find out.

628
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:18,701
-Say, my man--
-Mr. Kerew, not so fast.

629
00:40:19,629 --> 00:40:22,826
Do you make a lot of money
in this line of work?

630
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:26,897
Yes, Mr. Sutherland, we have them both.
And the coin.

631
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:36,462
What time do you land?

632
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:40,019
I'll return tomorrow morning
at approximately 8:37.

633
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,505
We'll go to Great Gorge
and wait for your call.

634
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:46,345
We have to leave the country tomorrow.

635
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:49,149
Don't worry, my dear.
Everything's arranged.

636
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:58,703
What's it to be?

637
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:03,097
-I'll wait in the car.
-No, meet me in the alley.

638
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:08,705
-Good-bye, Mr. Lyons.
-I hope I bump into you again sometime.

639
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,382
I don't think so.

640
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:15,219
See, I'll be leaving the country
and you'll be dead.

641
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,585
Dead? I thought you weren't gonna kill us.

642
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,307
-Afraid not. Good-bye.
-Wait a second.

643
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,780
Don't we get a last request?

644
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,468
What would you like?

645
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:33,819
Would you scratch my nose for me?

646
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,307
You're a very sick woman.

647
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,263
Thank you.

648
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:53,706
Mr. Kerew, what would you like?

649
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:56,223
I suppose a fuck is out of the question.

650
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:58,303
I'm afraid so.

651
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:01,708
Good-bye.

652
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:04,743
Let's go, gentlemen.

653
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:08,026
For God's sake,
we don't know nothing about no gold coin!

654
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:10,699
-Why must you kill us?
-You're both witnesses.

655
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,427
I don't understand this.

656
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,624
Why shoot us in an alley?
Why not just do it right here?

657
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:20,224
Why don't you just kill us right here?

658
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:22,985
-Fine.
-Big mouth.

659
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:27,146
Wait. We won't talk. I promise.

660
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,580
Please, don't do this.

661
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:32,419
Dave, stop the begging, man.

662
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:34,940
We got to go out with dignity.

663
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,387
All I want to know is what time is it?

664
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,307
Did you say what time is it?

665
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:44,462
-Yes, I did. What time is it?
-Your time is up, Mr. Kerew.

666
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,502
If I have to die, I want my friend...

667
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,343
...to tell me what time it is.

668
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:53,827
What time it is?

669
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:59,188
It's 3:00. Not yet.

670
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:02,619
It's 12:00. Wait. It's 10:00.

671
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,302
Wait! 12:00.

672
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:06,818
-Make up your mind!
-It's 12:00.

673
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:08,706
-No, it's 11:15.
-It's 12:00!

674
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:13,381
-It's about time!
-Quick. This way.

675
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,748
Careful. Narrow.

676
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,508
Other way!

677
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:23,417
Hurry, Wally! Come on, Wally!

678
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:36,539
-What's happening?
-Get behind this car. Watch your knees.

679
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:41,706
-What's up?
-Policemen. They've set up a barricade.

680
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,780
This is running. Anybody in it?

681
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,827
-This is a squad car.
-I know that. Is anyone in it?

682
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:49,264
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can. Come on.

683
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:52,864
-My hands are cuffed. I can't drive.
-Who said you were driving?

684
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:56,778
-We got to get out of the neighbourhood.
-We're not gonna get ten feet.

685
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,382
Yes, we can. Get in.

686
00:44:01,229 --> 00:44:03,345
Wally, you're gonna kill somebody.

687
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:06,266
I got the wheel, you take the pedals.

688
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,739
-Did you say something?
-I got the wheel, you take the pedals.

689
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:11,788
Forward! Go forward!

690
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:17,667
-How am I doing?
-Don't look at me, watch the road!

691
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,019
-If it'll make you feel better.
-Left!

692
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:29,188
Headquarters, this is barricade four!

693
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,465
I hate when that happens.

694
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:44,181
-What are you, stupid? You want to die?
-Police emergency. Out of the car.

695
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:47,339
-Show me your badge.
-This is my badge.

696
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:50,023
They crashed through the barricades
in one of our cars!

697
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,146
-Who the hell was driving?
-I think it's the blind guy!

698
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:56,779
Get in the car. Open that up!

699
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:00,024
Get me down Seventh Avenue right away.

700
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:04,108
Turn right! Stop!

701
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,624
Turn right! No, straight ahead.
Left! Right!

702
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:09,827
Straight! Left! Left!

703
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:21,307
We're going the wrong way
on a one-way street! A little right!

704
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,021
Little right. Little left.

705
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:33,268
Where are you going?

706
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:36,620
These streets are bumpy.

707
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,187
You're driving on the sidewalk!

708
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:47,261
What the fuck was that?

709
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:56,386
Go on home.
Your mother's looking for you.

710
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,585
-Get me close.
-I'm trying.

711
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:03,024
Left. I said left. I said left!

712
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:08,260
Turn right. Right!

713
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:10,505
Cows!

714
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:21,265
We're in a warehouse
and you've just hit a cow.

715
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,865
I think you better back up.

716
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,268
And stop!

717
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,300
And go slowly left.

718
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,659
Try to stay off the sidewalk.

719
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:50,426
I just ripped my good pants.

720
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,178
I can take the wheel now. Slide over me.

721
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,740
I can't see.

722
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:11,745
-I can't see.
-I can't see either.

723
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:15,139
I can't drive if you don't
push the seat back.

724
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:20,384
Find the lever and push the seat back.

725
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:22,662
I've got it!

726
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:29,707
-What happened?
-We had a very close call.

727
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:33,739
-Thank you.
-Wally, I can't see.

728
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:38,585
Get your hands away, I can't see!

729
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:42,704
I'll get that son of a bitch now!

730
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:48,387
Is somebody shooting at us?

731
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,027
I didn't hear anything.

732
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,387
You're mashing my nuts!

733
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,539
Brakes! Put on the brakes!

734
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,098
Where are we?

735
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:36,904
-I think we're floating towards New Jersey.
-No shit!

736
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:40,340
-I got relatives in Jersey.
-How nice for you.

737
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:42,981
You could read her lips.

738
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:44,858
Yes, I could.

739
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:48,339
-What did she say?
-"I'll give it to you tomorrow.

740
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:52,104
"We'll go to Grace George in the morning
and wait for your call."

741
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:56,304
Then she said,
"We have to leave the country tomorrow."

742
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:01,418
We have to find this Grace George lady
and wait for them to show up.

743
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,102
Are you with me?

744
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:06,065
Am I with you? Of course.

745
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:08,667
You've earned my trust.

746
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:12,019
You're always watching out for me.

747
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,539
You never get me into trouble.

748
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:18,306
Sometimes life is a little boring with you...

749
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:23,537
...but that's a small price to pay
for such a wonderful friendship.

750
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,863
That's a sweet thing you just said.

751
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:30,339
Do you mean everything you just said?

752
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:34,378
I'll tell you exactly how I feel
in just a minute or two.

753
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:40,063
Right now I'm a little overwhelmed...

754
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:45,900
...by the stink of the 7,000 tons
of garbage...

755
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:47,945
...that you drove me into!

756
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:50,141
Is that what it is?

757
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:52,187
I thought you let one go.

758
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:54,943
That's why I didn't say nothing.

759
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:58,618
That was kind of you. Thank you.

760
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:02,147
2286, this is Dispatch.
What is your location?

761
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:05,180
2286, please respond. Over.

762
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:09,822
Will you please hurry?
We have to bury the car.

763
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,226
Jesus, be careful!

764
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:19,059
Take it easy. I'm doing damn good
for a blind man.

765
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,058
-What did you say?
-I said, I'm doing damn good for a--

766
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:26,228
You know what?
I'm getting tired of this deaf shit.

767
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:30,461
You mean you can't hear anything I say
even if I scream in your ear?

768
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,585
I don't know. I've never tried it.

769
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,018
Really?

770
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:40,303
It seems crazy after all these years,
but I've never done that before.

771
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:43,859
I would like you to. Go ahead, Wally.
I want you to.

772
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,667
Let's give it a try.

773
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:53,145
I want you to listen to me.

774
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:57,580
I'm going to try.
Open up them pores, okay?

775
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:01,585
Be responsive to what I'm going to say.

776
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:05,817
I want you to hear me, okay?

777
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,382
Shazam!

778
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,381
Can you hear me!

779
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,178
What?

780
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:19,258
Jesus!

781
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:22,705
I heard something! I heard your voice!

782
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,507
You heard me?

783
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:28,181
-I heard your voice!
-You can hear me, Dave!

784
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:30,339
-What?
-You can hear me!

785
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,941
No, schmuck!

786
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,022
I'm deaf!

787
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,020
Now do you get it!

788
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:46,226
I'm not a cry-baby.

789
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,622
-You are a cry-baby.
-Guess what you are?

790
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:54,346
A blind, egotistical,
asshole who denies he can't see shit.

791
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:57,103
Denies? You're the one who denies!

792
00:51:57,189 --> 00:51:59,339
This is you: "I'm not deaf.

793
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,906
"I can read lips.
Don't call me a deaf person."

794
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:05,947
Well, fuck it, I'm blind. You hear me?

795
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:09,659
Some asshole drunk drove me
into a fire hydrant...

796
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:14,177
...and I'm blind for life.
He gets six months suspended sentence.

797
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:17,343
But I say fuck it.
I'm not going to worry about him.

798
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,498
Fuck him.

799
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:20,381
You swear an awful lot.

800
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:22,705
-You're fucking-A right!
-Fucking-A.

801
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:24,547
Something bothers you, fuck it.

802
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:28,258
Your wife leaves you, fuck her.
Boss fires you? Fuck him.

803
00:52:28,389 --> 00:52:32,064
-Fuck it, fuck them.
-You're fucking right.

804
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:35,380
It's a blessing to be able to do that.

805
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:38,228
I can't do it. You're a lucky guy.

806
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:40,580
Well, fucking change.

807
00:52:43,389 --> 00:52:45,220
Easy for you to say.

808
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,662
It's not easy for me to say. I'm blind.

809
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:53,098
Yes, but when you walk down the street,
people will touch you.

810
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:56,865
When you're deaf, people won't
because they might catch something.

811
00:52:56,949 --> 00:53:00,419
-Like you're some kind of leper.
-We're being a little bitter, aren't we?

812
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:02,739
I just want to accept
what I can and can't do.

813
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:06,139
I don't think running around
catching vicious scum killers...

814
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:10,222
...is something you and I are the best
equipped people in the world at doing.

815
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:12,061
Bullshit! You're an actor.

816
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,068
If you don't say you're deaf or I'm blind,
we can do anything.

817
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,663
-I guarantee it.
-You guarantee it?

818
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:22,298
That's right. And if you won't help me,
I'll do it fucking alone.

819
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:25,218
I don't need you or anyone else!

820
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:29,101
Okay. Now I get the point.

821
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,144
Excusez-moi, Monsieur Hot Shit.

822
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,788
I'll just go have a nice hot bath
and a little cocktail before dinner.

823
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:40,027
Wait. We ought to cool out a little bit.

824
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:41,623
Have a nice day.

825
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:46,745
I figure me and you, we know a lot....

826
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:49,462
Goddamn it!

827
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,267
How the fuck do you expect me
to get out of this shit?

828
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:57,867
This shit's cold!

829
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:00,781
Come back! We have to bury the car!

830
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:05,903
There are steps coming up, Wally.
Three steps.

831
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,940
Back, Wally. Back.

832
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:19,142
And turn. One, two, three and turn.

833
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,228
Very good. That's lovely. And, go.

834
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:33,265
Collect call from lrvin Johnson.
Will you accept the charges?

835
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:35,588
Hi. Guess who?

836
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,747
Just tell me you're all right.

837
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,459
I'm great. Wish you were here
with your car.

838
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:46,180
You could bring lots of money
a couple beers ifpossible, probably cold.

839
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:49,149
And I need a racing form
and some binoculars.

840
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:50,259
Where are you?

841
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:52,624
A little motel on the interstate...

842
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:55,827
...about five miles west
of the George Washington.

843
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:15,539
Headquarters, this is Steely. Over.

844
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:23,298
She's going into room 18.

845
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:30,983
Now.

846
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,659
That's a hell of a place to park.

847
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:16,660
-She checked into room 18.
-Where's that?

848
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,068
Over here.

849
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:21,061
Let me have that.

850
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:23,941
This is the police.

851
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,385
You are surrounded.

852
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:31,020
All right, you jokers. You got ten seconds
to come out with your hands up.

853
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:34,144
Ten, nine...

854
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,338
...eight, seven...

855
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:40,778
...six...

856
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:43,988
She said she was 18.

857
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:50,348
-...four, three...
-The county's really cracking down.

858
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:53,297
...two, one.

859
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,222
All right, let's go!

860
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:23,704
-Goddamn them.
-Take it easy, captain. We'll find them.

861
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:27,699
Search the entire area.
They must be around here someplace.

862
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:30,138
For chrissakes, how far could they get?

863
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:32,260
An all cars alert!

864
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:39,622
Damn those guys.

865
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,385
I'm going to get them.

866
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:57,184
Dave, this is my sister, Adele.

867
00:57:57,509 --> 00:58:00,228
Adele, this is my dear friend, David Lyons.

868
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:01,703
How do you do?

869
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:11,823
There she is. Careful of your knees.

870
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:19,462
First, we need to find a phone book.
Look up this lady, Grace George.

871
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,508
Then we get the coin,
they come looking for us...

872
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:24,580
...then we wait with the police.

873
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,177
There can't be many Grace Georges
in the phonebook.

874
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:31,023
-You mean the resort?
-No, the person they've giving the coin to.

875
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:34,820
Great Gorge is a big resort
in Vernon Valley.

876
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:37,787
-How do you know that?
-I almost got married there.

877
00:58:38,229 --> 00:58:40,789
I think David got things mixed up.

878
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:45,304
-What did she say?
-She said she thinks you're an asshole.

879
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:57,739
-I'm sorry, sir, we're fully booked.
-You must have something.

880
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,907
I'm sorry. We're booked.

881
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:03,345
I'm so sorry, but everything is taken
by the medical convention.

882
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:06,387
We have people coming here
from all over the world.

883
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:08,937
-We don't have anything.
-What about cancellations?

884
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,145
-She said there are no rooms?
-Yes.

885
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:13,545
I can't take my wife to a motel.

886
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:17,017
We're supposed to hold these
until midnight.

887
00:59:18,269 --> 00:59:20,180
I have a couple from London...

888
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:24,542
...a doctor from Sweden and one
from Germany who still haven't arrived.

889
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:30,584
I'll tell you what.
If none of these people show up by 10:00...

890
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:34,059
...l'll let their rooms go.
But you have to wait until 10:00.

891
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,628
-Can we go to the bar?
-Yes, of course.

892
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:46,267
Hi, I'm blind.

893
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:49,068
Could you direct me to the ladies' room?

894
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:50,862
It's right over....

895
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:55,023
I'll show you. Give me your hand.

896
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:57,504
No, wait. The other one.

897
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:09,103
You're Dr. Johannson from Sweden.

898
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:10,867
Johannson from Sweden.

899
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:14,223
I'm from Sweden.

900
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:18,106
-Can I help you gentlemen?
-I'm from Sweden.

901
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,861
You must be Dr. Johannson.

902
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:24,584
Johannson from Sweden.
I'm a Swede and you're a sweetie.

903
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:27,942
Thank you.

904
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:30,907
-You must be...?
-I'm Dr. Kesselbaum.

905
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:33,860
You mean Kesselring?

906
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:37,026
I forget my own name next.

907
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:41,898
You are one of the most beautiful women
I've ever seen.

908
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:46,059
There you are.
You move so fast, like a hummingbird.

909
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:51,459
You're a little sneaker, aren't you?
I bet you've got wings like Mercury.

910
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:52,982
You're such a nice little--

911
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:56,061
There he is again!
You're gonna rub it off, aren't you?

912
01:00:56,149 --> 01:00:58,140
Little lunch you had leftover.

913
01:00:58,629 --> 01:00:59,778
Here you are.

914
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:04,263
Dr. Kesselring, we thought
you might not make it.

915
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:06,863
It says you had some trouble
with your visa.

916
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:10,664
Then they suddenly accepted
American Express. Go figure.

917
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:13,025
We don't go home without it.

918
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:19,143
Why don't you fill these out?

919
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,703
There you are, Doctor.

920
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:25,666
I got mine and you got yours.

921
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:30,500
We're out of double rooms.
I saved you a suite with two queens.

922
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:33,547
Get them fellas out of there!
We wanna get some sleep.

923
01:01:37,549 --> 01:01:38,868
Here's your key.

924
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:43,701
Come, Doctor. We have to get some sleep.
Make some Z's.

925
01:01:44,189 --> 01:01:47,181
I hope you don't snore,
or I'm sending you back to Germany.

926
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:49,260
That's better than Philadelphia.

927
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:58,019
I'm glad the girl remembered the sister.

928
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:00,577
Put out an APB on that convertible.

929
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,987
Where the hell can they be?

930
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:06,818
-They couldn't have gotten very far.
-Who knows with these guys?

931
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:10,627
These guys are beginning
to get to me, Gatlin.

932
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:12,906
Take it easy, Emile.

933
01:02:13,149 --> 01:02:15,583
Don't those state cops have anything?

934
01:02:16,749 --> 01:02:20,662
I have 28 years on the force, a wife and
five kids, and a blind guy and a deaf guy...

935
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,467
...are making me look like an asshole.

936
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:23,902
That's the truth.

937
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:25,538
Sam-1, over.

938
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:30,862
I think it's them.

939
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:33,224
Nuts!

940
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:36,739
They just went behind some trees.

941
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:38,938
There!

942
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:42,181
Yes, it's them.
They're going into the building.

943
01:02:59,629 --> 01:03:01,824
Tell him to hurry. This isn't easy!

944
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:05,025
Hold it steady. This isn't easy.

945
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:24,981
I know where the coin is,
but he's in the room.

946
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:27,788
I'll get him out of there.
You just get the coin.

947
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:32,458
Wait, I need some money!
I might have to buy lunch.

948
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:36,178
You all right, Dave?

949
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:45,738
Trouble.

950
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,061
Give me room 49, please.

951
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:53,738
What?

952
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:58,500
I told him I had enough trouble
with two-wheel drive. I hate this.

953
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,025
It's not the end of the world,
it's just an accident.

954
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:05,545
You're damaged, I'm damaged.
Just remove your car from my bumper--

955
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:07,540
No, he'll kill me.

956
01:04:07,709 --> 01:04:10,781
My husband is an insurance man.
I have to file a claim.

957
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:13,064
That's not my problem. I'm in a hurry.

958
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:17,825
Wait a minute. I got my card here.
Don't get excited. I know I have it.

959
01:04:24,229 --> 01:04:28,017
-Thank you for helping me.
-That's okay. That's why we're here.

960
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:33,666
I must have left my keys
on the dining room table.

961
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:35,223
Shall I wait?

962
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:39,500
I've got to go to bed.
I had a huge breakfast. It made me tired.

963
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,820
I got three postcards
and I registered for bingo.

964
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:44,627
That's a lot for one day.

965
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:47,781
-Take care of yourself.
-You, too, Marilyn. Bye-bye.

966
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:53,302
I'm right here.

967
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:57,109
-Warn me if anyone comes.
-I'll yell my damn head off.

968
01:04:57,189 --> 01:04:59,498
No one will come. Just get the coin.

969
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:21,221
You sure you put him in 357?
Maybe he switched rooms.

970
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:26,539
It's not possible.
There are no other rooms, Dr. Cornfeld.

971
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:29,229
There's nothing to switch to. There he is!

972
01:05:30,229 --> 01:05:31,423
Dr. Johannson!

973
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:36,669
Where have you been, Doctor?
I came to pick you up.

974
01:05:36,749 --> 01:05:38,899
I'm a little bit too heavy for that.

975
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,660
Did you get lost, Dr. Johannson?

976
01:05:41,949 --> 01:05:44,099
It's "Yohannson." How soon we forget.

977
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:46,499
We must hurry. The seminar starts soon.

978
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:48,625
We can't start without the main performer.

979
01:05:48,709 --> 01:05:51,667
I'll wait for him.
When he comes, I'll be down.

980
01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:55,180
Always joking.
I had no idea you were this much fun.

981
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,987
I'd like to introduce our panel...

982
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:24,629
...four eminent specialists in their field.

983
01:07:25,149 --> 01:07:27,504
Dr. Saul Jenner, Cardiology.

984
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,304
Dr. Harold Orlow, Pathology.

985
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:33,658
Dr. Rita Bennett, Opthamology.

986
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:39,420
And in his first visit to the U.S.,
the eminent Swedish gynaecologist...

987
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,939
...Dr. Conrad Johannson.

988
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:02,708
Hold it right there.

989
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:06,901
Get away from that table
or I'll blow your brains out.

990
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:09,378
Move!

991
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:16,018
Get 'em up.

992
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:20,545
Come on. Hands over your head.

993
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:24,147
Both! Both of them!

994
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,344
You're good.

995
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:49,981
You're real good.

996
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:07,618
This is the best relationship
I've had with a woman in eight years.

997
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:25,508
So long, sweetheart.

998
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:29,026
Another time, another place,
we might've had a chance.

999
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:32,220
You will write, won't you?

1000
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:37,544
Dr. Johannson, my question is for you.

1001
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:41,738
In your paper on multiple orgasms
in geriatric women...

1002
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:45,468
...you attribute increased sexual appetite...

1003
01:09:45,869 --> 01:09:47,905
...to a lactose-restricted diet.

1004
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:52,664
Now I know you're modest,
but I insist on pinning you down.

1005
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:57,459
Which exercise would you find
most beneficial...

1006
01:09:57,549 --> 01:09:59,426
...to geriatric sexuality?

1007
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:03,143
Oh, boy.

1008
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:06,939
Some of my patients prefer walking...

1009
01:10:07,509 --> 01:10:09,386
...some prefer bicycling.

1010
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:11,740
But for your best results...

1011
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:14,338
...to guarantee satisfaction...

1012
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:16,780
...most of them like fucking.

1013
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:20,343
You know, poonta-poonta-poonta.

1014
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,540
I like it myself.

1015
01:10:22,909 --> 01:10:25,298
One in the morning and late at night.

1016
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:28,103
Just put everything back
in your purse and--

1017
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:32,503
But if he leaves me,
what will happen to me and the twins?

1018
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:36,738
I don't know anybody.
People never treat me as nicely as you do.

1019
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:39,059
-I've been extremely rude.
-You're right.

1020
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:40,946
I'm going to leave you now.

1021
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:44,306
You must move your vehicle.
It's against my car.

1022
01:10:45,469 --> 01:10:47,061
Where the hell were you?

1023
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:51,943
I'm sorry. There was an accident.
This woman rammed into our Spider.

1024
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,741
It was all very simple
till she made it complicated.

1025
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:09,057
Why can't you give me numbers?
Why are you being so evasive?

1026
01:11:15,389 --> 01:11:18,506
Shooting pains in my head. My eyes.

1027
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:20,461
Oh, boy, it's a bummer.

1028
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:23,621
I can't see. Someone take me to my room.

1029
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:27,062
-Let me have a look.
-At what? Don't look!

1030
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,581
Get your hands off me!

1031
01:11:30,269 --> 01:11:33,466
Stop acting like a baby. I'm a doctor.
Let me have a peek.

1032
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:36,900
Don't touch that head.

1033
01:11:37,469 --> 01:11:40,029
Whatever you do don't you touch it.

1034
01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:43,179
-Who are you?
-Fine, thank you.

1035
01:11:43,269 --> 01:11:46,625
Just relax. Everything will be all right.
I'm right here.

1036
01:11:46,989 --> 01:11:50,584
-I thought you'd never come!
-Do you know what's happened to him?

1037
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:55,299
Of course I know what's happened.
This is called "Blindness Hystericus."

1038
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:59,382
Sometimes it comes, just like that.

1039
01:11:59,469 --> 01:12:01,027
How do you treat it?

1040
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,306
The left brain and the right brain
are fighting with each other...

1041
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:06,425
...and you have to distract them.

1042
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:08,427
Now, Dr. Johannson...

1043
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:12,938
...how many fingers am I holding up
in front of your eyes right now?

1044
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,257
Three!

1045
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:18,101
That's pretty good considering he's blind.

1046
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:20,940
I want you to just relax.

1047
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:25,945
Take it easy. Tell me the first thing
that pops into your brain.

1048
01:12:27,069 --> 01:12:28,184
Pussy.

1049
01:12:28,989 --> 01:12:32,106
Its amazing! This man is cured.
Come on, Doctor.

1050
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:34,498
Let's take a little walk,
get the heart pumping.

1051
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:36,386
Then you'll be brand new.

1052
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:42,667
-Where's Adele?
-I don't know. She's not in the room.

1053
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:46,381
If he gets too excited, it comes right back.

1054
01:12:46,669 --> 01:12:50,059
Gently. Take it easy, Doctor.
This guy's blind as a bat.

1055
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:53,621
Watch your step.
What's the matter with you?

1056
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:01,261
-You got a Lyons and Kerew registered?
-I'll check, sir.

1057
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:02,948
I'm sorry, no.

1058
01:13:03,029 --> 01:13:06,499
-One's blind, one's deaf. You sure?
-I'm sure, sir. I just checked.

1059
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:09,945
I'm with the police. If I brought pictures,
could you identify them?

1060
01:13:10,029 --> 01:13:10,939
I'll try.

1061
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:13,748
-Is there a security officer here?
-Right behind you.

1062
01:13:14,549 --> 01:13:16,062
Single file.

1063
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,339
Okay, take it easy.

1064
01:13:21,989 --> 01:13:25,982
-Excuse me. Where's the little red Alfa?
-They just took off.

1065
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:28,380
-Who?
-Three of them.

1066
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:32,897
A lady with great legs, an English guy,
and a black woman.

1067
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:35,940
My God! My sister.

1068
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:44,620
The man asked me to give this to you.

1069
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:56,300
"If you want the girl, bring the coin to the
house with 1,000 windows. Route 104."

1070
01:13:56,789 --> 01:14:00,145
-Is this a joke?
-No, that's the Sutherland estate.

1071
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:02,381
I hope you have an invitation.

1072
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:04,824
He's got some pretty mean dogs there.

1073
01:14:05,589 --> 01:14:08,865
-Dobermans. They're killers.
-Do you have our keys?

1074
01:14:11,469 --> 01:14:13,266
-Do me a favour?
-Sure.

1075
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:16,667
If we're not back in 30 minutes,
call the police.

1076
01:14:17,029 --> 01:14:20,066
New York Police, ask for Captain Braddock.

1077
01:14:23,549 --> 01:14:27,098
Tell him Lyons and Kerew
are at the Sutherland estate.

1078
01:14:29,589 --> 01:14:32,661
The house is all glass,
and it's on huge rocks.

1079
01:14:34,789 --> 01:14:36,939
-My sister?
-Nothing yet.

1080
01:14:41,029 --> 01:14:43,099
There's a lot of land here.

1081
01:14:46,509 --> 01:14:47,703
There!

1082
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:50,424
It's a greenhouse. There she is.

1083
01:14:50,509 --> 01:14:52,625
-Is she all right?
-I think so.

1084
01:14:55,509 --> 01:14:58,342
And there are the dogs. Three of them.

1085
01:14:58,629 --> 01:15:00,108
Now they're leaving.

1086
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:04,386
They're going.
Looks like they're locking the door.

1087
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,899
They're going back to the main house.

1088
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:12,103
She'll be all alone in about two minutes.

1089
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:15,387
You all clear on the plan?

1090
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,743
Clear as a bell.

1091
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:19,707
I'm going to go water the plants
if you don't mind.

1092
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,188
-You sure there's only three dogs?
-I'll take a look.

1093
01:15:29,589 --> 01:15:32,023
The parking brake has been released.

1094
01:15:32,749 --> 01:15:35,866
Just three. I don't see
what could go wrong.

1095
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:42,098
You hear that?
You better check the brake!

1096
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,498
-Wally, I'm in trouble!
-Pull up!

1097
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:16,023
Speak to me!

1098
01:16:20,269 --> 01:16:22,225
Dave! Talk to me!

1099
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:24,227
Talk to me!

1100
01:16:24,309 --> 01:16:26,777
I can hear the car, but I can't hear you!

1101
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:29,102
I can't see you, Dave!

1102
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:40,019
My God, what have I done this time?

1103
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:44,104
Shit!

1104
01:16:46,909 --> 01:16:48,467
My God, Dave!

1105
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,747
Did you say something?

1106
01:16:56,869 --> 01:16:58,461
I can't see your lips.

1107
01:16:58,749 --> 01:17:00,307
What are you saying?

1108
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:02,907
Can you see them now?

1109
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:06,708
There you are.

1110
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,422
What are you saying?

1111
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:11,981
I'm saying...

1112
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:14,540
...l think it's over.

1113
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:18,539
I just didn't fuck up my life today...

1114
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:21,584
...l dragged my sister into this shit.

1115
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:24,105
I damn near got her killed.

1116
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:27,347
And I hurt you.

1117
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:31,025
I just want to say I'm sorry.

1118
01:17:31,749 --> 01:17:33,262
Don't back out on me.

1119
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:36,746
I've been running on fumes most of my life.

1120
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:41,702
And today I realised for the first time,
I'm full of shit.

1121
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:43,948
That's true...

1122
01:17:44,909 --> 01:17:48,424
...but this morning,
I threatened to shoot a naked woman...

1123
01:17:48,509 --> 01:17:49,988
...with my erection.

1124
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:52,783
Now that doesn't happen every day.

1125
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:54,782
That's true.

1126
01:17:55,389 --> 01:17:56,902
The man's got a point.

1127
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:59,346
We'll get her out.

1128
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:03,425
I think we're in over our heads.

1129
01:18:03,709 --> 01:18:06,462
No one thought we would get this far.

1130
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,187
Don't back out on me now.

1131
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,341
-I can't.
-You can.

1132
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:18,581
We can. I promise.

1133
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,182
What if we can't?

1134
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:28,538
Fuck it.

1135
01:18:30,309 --> 01:18:33,301
Damn you. I created a monster.

1136
01:18:36,349 --> 01:18:37,828
Where's the girl?

1137
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:40,628
She's in the greenhouse
where they can see her.

1138
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:45,186
And when can we expect
our two distinguished guests?

1139
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:47,578
They should be arriving at any moment.

1140
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:50,058
Do they have the coin?

1141
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:54,306
Yes, they have the coin.

1142
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:55,748
Wonderful.

1143
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:05,064
-What do you think of that thing?
-Lot of trouble over a piece of gold.

1144
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:07,538
I don't know what this is,
but this isn't gold.

1145
01:19:07,629 --> 01:19:09,824
Gold doesn't chip and peel like this.

1146
01:19:10,069 --> 01:19:13,027
Doesn't matter to me,
as long as they want it real bad.

1147
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:15,498
Keep it, in case anything happens to me.

1148
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:19,981
-Nothing's going to happen to you.
-Good. Glad to find that out. Ready?

1149
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:29,702
Start counting.

1150
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:33,741
One, two...

1151
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:37,825
...three, four, five...

1152
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,867
...sixteen, seventeen....

1153
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:33,789
There's a dog! There's a dog!

1154
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,267
No! There's an alarm.

1155
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:07,067
So far, so good.

1156
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:22,424
Now what's all the fuss about?

1157
01:21:23,789 --> 01:21:27,907
I was going to mention the alarm,
but something else came up.

1158
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,264
Who is it?

1159
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:43,778
I was so hoping you'd show up.

1160
01:21:44,909 --> 01:21:46,547
Sorry about the flowers.

1161
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:48,267
You like roses?

1162
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:52,458
That's enough, Herman. It's all right.

1163
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:56,662
Just keep your gun pointed on him.
I'll see if he has the coin.

1164
01:21:57,069 --> 01:21:59,947
Hands over your head, Mr. Lyons.
Remember?

1165
01:22:00,589 --> 01:22:02,261
Turn around.

1166
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:06,621
Careful.
Remember what happened last time.

1167
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:26,577
Hit her!

1168
01:22:27,069 --> 01:22:28,218
Smack her!

1169
01:22:35,229 --> 01:22:37,299
I grew up with brothers. Let's go.

1170
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:43,702
-Back up. You have to run up that log.
-I don't have that many brothers.

1171
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:54,424
-Get out of here!
-I don't want to leave you.

1172
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:58,338
Wally's just on top of that hill. Go on!

1173
01:22:58,429 --> 01:23:00,306
Get out of here. Get out!

1174
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:04,665
Jump! Get the police!

1175
01:23:16,509 --> 01:23:18,181
Here's the blind one.

1176
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:21,940
Come in, Mr. Kerew.
I'm delighted to see you.

1177
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:24,346
I'm delighted to see you, too.

1178
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:26,897
So you're the fat fuck who runs this show.

1179
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,539
Beautifully put, Mr. Kerew.

1180
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:33,345
You're obviously a poet.
A man after my own heart.

1181
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:36,419
-Did he have the coin?
-It's in my pocket.

1182
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,067
May I have it, please?

1183
01:23:38,749 --> 01:23:41,263
What do you bother
with that phoney coin for?

1184
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,738
You're quite right. It is a phoney.

1185
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:46,020
A magnificent phoney.

1186
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:48,222
May I have it, please?

1187
01:23:48,309 --> 01:23:52,427
Would you mind telling me what I've been
running around risking my life for?

1188
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,866
A superconductor.

1189
01:23:55,349 --> 01:23:57,863
A room temperature superconductor.

1190
01:23:58,509 --> 01:24:02,138
And I dare say, it may be
the most valuable material in this world.

1191
01:24:02,509 --> 01:24:07,139
Imagine electric cable the size of that coin
that could light up an entire city.

1192
01:24:07,549 --> 01:24:09,505
You told me it was a gold coin.

1193
01:24:09,589 --> 01:24:13,377
Making it look like a coin was just
a handy way to get it out of Washington...

1194
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:16,779
...after I'd arranged
to borrow a small sample.

1195
01:24:18,669 --> 01:24:21,467
I'm currently pointing a gun at your head.

1196
01:24:21,709 --> 01:24:25,702
I think that under the circumstances,
we should renegotiate our contract.

1197
01:24:27,309 --> 01:24:30,824
Yes, I do. I agree with you completely.

1198
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:33,739
What would you say to...

1199
01:24:34,749 --> 01:24:37,582
...one-third of $8 million?

1200
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:40,467
Would you say that's fair?

1201
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:42,819
Yes, I'd say that that's extremely--

1202
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:54,941
What the hell happened?

1203
01:24:55,629 --> 01:24:58,587
I turned out the lights, just for a moment.

1204
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:01,624
Just long enough to gain the advantage.

1205
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:07,508
How come I got the feeling
I'm not the only blind person in this room?

1206
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:10,303
Because you have great intuition,
Mr. Kerew.

1207
01:25:10,909 --> 01:25:14,060
I also suspect you have excellent hearing,
like myself.

1208
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:18,698
A few sounds were all I needed
to lock in on poor Mr. Kirgo.

1209
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:21,744
It's too bad. I liked him.

1210
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:24,108
He was a gentleman.

1211
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:26,783
I can't see your face,
but I bet you're not crying.

1212
01:25:26,869 --> 01:25:29,303
Nor can I see your face, Mr. Kerew...

1213
01:25:30,469 --> 01:25:33,859
...yet I can hear you stooping down
to find Kirgo's pistol.

1214
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:36,507
Am I right, sir?

1215
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:39,787
Or must I put a bullet through your head
to prove it?

1216
01:25:39,869 --> 01:25:41,939
No. You're a gentleman.

1217
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:44,783
One murder a day is enough for you.

1218
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:32,780
Did I hear something drop?

1219
01:26:44,269 --> 01:26:45,384
Perfect timing. Come in.

1220
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,585
-I've brought the other one.
-Excellent.

1221
01:26:51,069 --> 01:26:52,707
Are you all right?

1222
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,945
You're very quiet, Mr. Kerew.

1223
01:26:56,349 --> 01:26:58,658
Suddenly gone shy, have we?

1224
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:03,141
Adele got away. The police'll be here soon.

1225
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:08,668
You'd better tell me
what happened to Mr. Kirgo.

1226
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:11,622
Surely, my dear.

1227
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:15,584
Mr. Kirgo decided at the last minute
to renegotiate his contract...

1228
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:17,739
...and he put a pistol to my head.

1229
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:20,829
Eve, we've been associated for five years.

1230
01:27:20,989 --> 01:27:24,265
I want you to know
I have no intention of killing you.

1231
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:26,700
So don't be frightened, my dear.

1232
01:27:27,069 --> 01:27:29,503
Please, don't do anything rash.

1233
01:27:30,669 --> 01:27:33,979
No, I wouldn't do that.
You know I trust you, Mr. Sutherland.

1234
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:37,020
But what are your intentions?

1235
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:40,939
To leave the country as soon
as Raul sends my helicopter down.

1236
01:27:41,349 --> 01:27:43,226
I invite you to come along.

1237
01:27:43,629 --> 01:27:46,348
Rio can be captivating this time of year.

1238
01:27:47,269 --> 01:27:52,218
Just pick up the gold coin
I believe is on the floor in front of you.

1239
01:27:57,509 --> 01:27:58,703
I don't see it.

1240
01:27:59,549 --> 01:28:03,588
Look in Mr. Kirgo's left hand.
I think he may be holding it.

1241
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:12,387
Did you find it, my dear?

1242
01:28:14,949 --> 01:28:16,177
I found it.

1243
01:28:17,349 --> 01:28:19,658
Would you hand it to me, please?

1244
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:24,539
May I ask what my share might be?

1245
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:27,418
One...

1246
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:29,703
...half...

1247
01:28:30,429 --> 01:28:31,748
...of $8 million.

1248
01:28:32,589 --> 01:28:34,341
Would you say that's fair?

1249
01:28:36,949 --> 01:28:39,258
Yes, I think that's very fair.

1250
01:28:47,509 --> 01:28:48,783
What's going on?

1251
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:02,347
What just happened?

1252
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:05,463
Mr. Sutherland is no longer with us.

1253
01:29:08,789 --> 01:29:10,427
I'm right here, Wally.

1254
01:29:11,629 --> 01:29:14,826
I hear the sirens.
The police will be here soon.

1255
01:29:15,429 --> 01:29:19,104
Drop that pistol now and you'll make
license plates and play volleyball...

1256
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:21,305
...every afternoon for a few years.

1257
01:29:21,949 --> 01:29:23,541
I'll even wait for you.

1258
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:25,663
Thanks.

1259
01:29:26,109 --> 01:29:27,861
That's real sweet.

1260
01:29:28,349 --> 01:29:32,740
But you see,
you're the ones they're looking for.

1261
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:35,263
Not me.

1262
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:39,868
If I get on that helicopter with the coin,
I get out of here squeaky clean.

1263
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:43,465
You're too tall for me anyway.

1264
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,097
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to lock you in.

1265
01:29:47,909 --> 01:29:49,137
Sorry.

1266
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,381
Damn, she smells good.

1267
01:29:55,709 --> 01:29:58,860
I hear jail ain't so bad,
if you like it up the butt.

1268
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:02,783
-I'm over here, Wally.
-Over where, Dave?

1269
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:10,782
Who am I talking to if he can't hear me?

1270
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:25,822
-She's running to the helicopter.
-Nice air conditioning she made.

1271
01:30:28,309 --> 01:30:31,938
-Did you ever want to be in the circus?
-No. I'm afraid of heights.

1272
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:35,024
-Give me your jacket, please.
-What for?

1273
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:38,145
There we go. This should be fun. Ready?

1274
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:42,188
-We're not high up, are we?
-No. We're just a few feet off the ground.

1275
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,505
-Ready and go!
-I'm ready!

1276
01:30:50,309 --> 01:30:53,381
I just knocked over a tree!
You said we weren't up high!

1277
01:30:54,509 --> 01:30:56,022
I'll kill you, you fuck!

1278
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,179
You're telling me we're not up in the air!
What do you mean?

1279
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:06,668
Get ready. Bomb bay doors opening.

1280
01:31:08,549 --> 01:31:10,460
Get ready to fire one!

1281
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:13,507
And fire one!

1282
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:17,582
Fire two!

1283
01:31:41,349 --> 01:31:43,226
What the hell are you doing!

1284
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:46,699
I don't know. I'm blind.
I learnt this at the Braille lnstitute.

1285
01:31:46,789 --> 01:31:49,781
They told us to feel around
and see what's happening.

1286
01:31:58,029 --> 01:31:59,462
Hold it right there!

1287
01:31:59,549 --> 01:32:01,858
I said hold it or I'll throw your brains out!

1288
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,258
I'll throw this knife through your brain!

1289
01:32:04,349 --> 01:32:05,338
Freeze!

1290
01:32:06,749 --> 01:32:09,547
-Do what I say or you're a dead man.
-Turn around.

1291
01:32:11,589 --> 01:32:12,658
Face front.

1292
01:32:16,549 --> 01:32:19,302
That's better.
Now put your hands over your head.

1293
01:32:20,829 --> 01:32:22,785
-Come on.
-Get your hands up!

1294
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:26,138
You do speak English. Come over here.

1295
01:32:28,269 --> 01:32:29,861
Get your ass over here.

1296
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:31,464
Quickly.

1297
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:32,948
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

1298
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:38,508
Come on.

1299
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:41,787
Not now, Wally, I'm busy.

1300
01:32:43,069 --> 01:32:46,459
Keep coming, you funny little turd.

1301
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,859
Tarzan, turn around and take a look.

1302
01:32:58,109 --> 01:33:01,784
-When did you guys get here?
-I sure was worried about you two.

1303
01:33:09,229 --> 01:33:10,947
Good-bye, Captain Braddock.

1304
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:15,464
Captain Braddock, you're a dickhead.

1305
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:17,702
You son of a bitch.

1306
01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:21,628
-I got a surprise for you.
-You can't do that.

1307
01:33:21,989 --> 01:33:24,298
I know the law. Now I get to shoot them!

1308
01:33:24,389 --> 01:33:26,425
-You can't.
-What do you mean I can't?

1309
01:33:26,509 --> 01:33:28,739
Captain, we got the real killer.

1310
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:33,698
-You telling me that I can't shoot them?
-No, sir, you can't.

1311
01:33:34,549 --> 01:33:38,781
We went to all this trouble to catch them
and now I can't shoot them?

1312
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:41,221
It's time to go.

1313
01:33:41,589 --> 01:33:43,466
But I want to shoot them.

1314
01:33:46,309 --> 01:33:48,140
We'll get some hot chocolate.

1315
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:50,586
Why can't I shoot them?

1316
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:56,628
-We had a damn good time, didn't we?
-Yeah.

1317
01:33:57,789 --> 01:33:59,427
A lot of nice memories.

1318
01:34:03,629 --> 01:34:07,747
Wally, there's something I've been
wanting to do since the day I met you.

1319
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,748
-That was two days ago.
-That's right.

1320
01:34:12,469 --> 01:34:14,858
There's something I want to give you.

1321
01:34:15,069 --> 01:34:17,378
You don't have to give me anything.

1322
01:34:18,189 --> 01:34:19,781
You're a real nice guy.

1323
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:21,946
But I want to give it to you.

1324
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:26,985
-Listen to me. I have a lot of love for you.
-Thank you.

1325
01:34:32,109 --> 01:34:36,148
Tell me, how's it feel to be handicapped?
I always wanted to ask you that.

1326
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:39,257
I'm not handicapped. I have you.

1327
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:57,580
