TV ANNOUNCER:
It's that time of year again.

11
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,139
Are you a New England dirtbag
who wants to run with bulls,

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,508
but thinks Spain is gay?

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,643
Then don't miss
the Seriously Wicked Bull Run

14
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,512
in South Attleboro, Mass!

15
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,014
You and your friends can run
from a bunch of live bulls,

16
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,850
and lots of times, there's
a chick whose boob comes out!

17
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,752
Order your tickets
before it's too late!

18
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,655
(bull bellows)

19
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,990
Toilets limited.

20
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,558
Wow, that seems
pretty cool.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,859
(groans)
I don't know.

22
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,994
Seems pretty lame to me.

23
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,062
Yeah, waste of time.

24
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,196
I agree.

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,531
Hey, Joe,
isn't this your round?

26
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,066
Sure, I'll wheel
over to the bar

27
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,835
and bring back your beers
one-by-one in my lap.

28
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,171
You guys, we are
so doing that bull run!

29
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,672
Buying the tickets as we speak!

30
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,007
But we can't tell Joe.

31
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,675
Of course not,
he'll be dead weight.

32
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,744
You can't do a bull run
with a guy in a wheelchair.

33
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,246
Yeah, this is for athletes.

34
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,887
Just the regular wash, please.

35
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,924
And, uh, I'm supposed to mention
that I saw you on LivingSocial?

36
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,092
Was that worth it?

37
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,194
Was that worth the
one dollar you saved?

38
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,596
I'm sorry, we're not doing
that promotion anymore.

39
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,697
Oh-ho!

40
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,101
All the humiliation,
none of the reward.

41
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,540
You know, some people are okay
with the drive-through car wash.

42
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,909
Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.

43
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,077
Hi, I'm Brian.

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,745
Yes, I like to have fun
with language.

45
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,747
(laughs)
You're so funny.

46
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,049
I'm Tori.

47
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,417
I got hit by a car
in high school,

48
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,785
so I don't have to work.

49
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,087
Cool. Hey, so what's
your afternoon like?

50
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,388
I don't have plans.

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,125
Maybe we could grab lunch
and then see what happens.

52
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,293
(groans)
This will not end well.

53
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,295
Like eating an artichoke.

54
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,597
Good Lord!

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,833
I ate nothing and I'm
soaking wet for some reason.

56
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,439
So, you guys all pumped
to run with the bulls?

57
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,441
You bet, this is gonna be
my first exercise

58
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,443
since I chased that balloon.

59
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,644
Hey, what's going on?

60
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,812
Hey, Joe.

61
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,947
We are competing...

62
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,484
in the international Chef
Boyardee look-alike contest.

63
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,486
Oh, well,
where's your chef hat?

64
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,921
You guys are gonna lose.

65
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,322
Especially Cleveland.

66
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,790
He's in the Cream of Wheat
competition,

67
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,259
which is down the street.

68
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,827
We-we got to go now.
We're very late.

69
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,163
Well, this is funny, because...

70
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,831
guess where I'm going.

71
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,299
And I got the hat.

72
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,667
You guys are dead!

73
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,669
(sighs)
Look, Joe.

74
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,604
We didn't want to tell
you, but we're going

75
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,273
to the Seriously
Wicked Bull Run.

76
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,142
We didn't invite you because we
didn't think you could keep up.

77
00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:00,012
Yeah, we thought it seemed
too dangerous for, uh,

78
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,649
incapacitated, half-man,
shrivel-legged gimps.

79
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,517
And we didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,953
Come on, my handicap
has never held me back.

81
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,488
I'm coming with you guys.

82
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,957
Joe, you peed in your bag
while you said that.

83
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,159
Can you honestly say
that you didn't pee

84
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,995
just now while you
were talking?

85
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,231
Okay, you can come.

86
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,971
Wow, that was amazing.

87
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,139
Hey, uh, uh,
just to be clear,

88
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,707
I don't really
think you're a whore.

89
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,843
I-I just need to say that
to, you know, to finish.

90
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,845
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

91
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,048
And obviously, I don't think
you're my Uncle Dale.

92
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,316
Good, good, same page.

93
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,483
(car engine humming outside)

94
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,352
Oh, crap,
my husband's home early.

95
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,653
Wait a minute,
you're married?!

96
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,821
And he's here?
Now?!

97
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,889
(car door closes)

98
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,990
Yeah, that's him.

99
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,325
You've got to get out of here.

100
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,693
He's really jealous.

101
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,394
I think he's bitter
because he never got

102
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,231
the credit he deserved
for killing Osama bin Laden.

103
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,099
Your husband's a Navy SEAL?!

104
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,569
What the hell
is going on here?!

105
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,971
What is this?

106
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,407
Ruff!

107
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,409
You got a dog?

108
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,844
Uh... yeah!

109
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,080
I rescued him
from the pound.

110
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,881
(barking)

111
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,683
Well, hey there, buddy.

112
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,418
Wow, his nose is super wet!

113
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,920
He must be healthy.

114
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,856
Uh, and somebody's been
rooting in a sardine can.

115
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,925
Well, I'm gonna
grab a shower.

116
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,027
Great, honey.

117
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,929
Oh. Oh, my God,
that was close.

118
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,897
Yeah, but think about it.

119
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,899
As long as he thinks
you're our new pet,

120
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,102
we can keep fooling
around behind his back.

121
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,237
Huh, you're right.

122
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,939
Wow, this could be
an even better scam

123
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,508
than that claw machine
at the arcade.

124
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,378
Damn it, this game is so stupid!

125
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,748
It's impossible to do anything
with a dumb, crappy claw!

126
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
Hey, that's mean,
and it's not even true!

127
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,918
I'm leaving!

128
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,987
Dang it!

129
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,092
You need a little help?

130
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,161
No!

131
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,166
If you could angle up the ring,
then I could kind of hook it.

132
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,738
How do you drive?

133
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,473
Bad!

134
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,542
(crowd clamoring)

135
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,013
(snorting, bellows)

136
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,286
We clearly overdressed.

137
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,322
They have the type
of fat white woman here

138
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,991
that not even
I am interested in.

139
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,159
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies, gentlemen,

140
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,994

get ready to run for your lives!

142
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,497
(beeping)

143
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,467
(air horn blares)

144
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,868
(crowd clamoring)

145
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,173
Aah! I shouldn't
have worn high heels!

146
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,641
Oh, stop it!
You look great.

147
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,577
Oh, well, I didn't want
all<i> this</i> attention.

148
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,180
CLEVELAND:
<i>Cleveland, why do you let them</i>

149
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,781
<i>talk you into these things?</i>

150
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>This is how</i>
<i>people pleasers die!</i>

151
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,186
Hey, guys, after this,
let's beat alligators

152
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,354
with sticks or something.

153
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,788
You read my mind!

154
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,057
<i>We just talked about this!</i>

155
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,461
(whoops)
This is amazing!

156
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,596
I told you guys I could do it!

157
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,718
Look... out...

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,122
Joe...!

159
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,965
(wheels screeching)

160
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,736
(distorted screaming)

161
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,655
(grunting)

162
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,125
(screaming)

163
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,897
Joe, oh, my God!

164
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,365
You all right?!

165
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,867
I can't feel anything
below my neck!

166
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,103
I can't move a muscle, guys!

167
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,271
Oh, my God!

168
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,773
Joe's completely
paralyzed!

169
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,608
("Walk Like a Man"
by the Four Seasons playing)

170
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,709
Oop, that's me.

171
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,944
That's unfortunate.

172
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,379
That's Lois, hold on.

173
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,580
Hey, babe.

174
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,614
Uh, good.

175
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,949
Little hiccup, but fun.

176
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,727
You guys!

177
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,096
I've been trying to keep
my birthday a secret.

178
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,466
No, Dr. Hartman, we're not
here for your birthday.

179
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,633
We're here for Joe.

180
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,801
Don't sugarcoat it, Doc.

181
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,303
Just give it to me straight.

182
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,572
Well, Mr. Swanson, I did
an exploratory procedure,

183
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,740
which revealed extensive damage.

184
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,810
Please, just tell me--
am I completely paralyzed?

185
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,945
I'm afraid...

186
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,446
of ghosts.

187
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,647
And yes.

188
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,949
Mr. Swanson has
lost all movement,

189
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,984
and will require
around-the-clock care.

190
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,819
Most of it disgusting.

191
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,322
Oh, my God, Bonnie,
I'm so sorry.

192
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,957
If there's anything
I can do...

193
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,325
There actually is.

194
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,460
Could you collect
my mail forever?

195
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,596
I'm leaving Joe
and moving to Europe.

196
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,664
I didn't sign up for this.

197
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,800
Bonnie, wait!
God, this is awful.

198
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,668
What am I gonna do?

199
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,837
Well, seems like you folks
have this all taken care of.

200
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,838
(door opens)

201
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,839
PEOPLE:
Surprise!

202
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,108
HARTMAN:
Oh, you guys!

203
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,610
Hey, don't go in
that room back there.

204
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,845
It's, like,
super sad.

205
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,820
Coming up, quintuplets
born at Quahog General.

206
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,688
What?
That's...

207
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,290
Oh, that's supposed
to be "burn"?

208
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:49,261
Oh, coming up, quintuplets
burn at Quahog General.

209
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,031
Hey, honey, get in here.

210
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,367
Check this out--
the way he's sitting,

211
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,636
it looks like the dog's
watching the news.

212
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,305
You like watching the
news, you dumb dog?

213
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,208
Well, I'm off to do what
former Navy SEALs do--

214
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,810
sell lawn mowers.

215
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,812
Wow, he really
has no idea.

216
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,048
Hey, want to take
a shower with me?

217
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,716
Sure.

218
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,318
Man, this is a pretty sweet gig.

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,654
Like being a member
of Daft Punk.

220
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,822
(French accent):
Look at this old Casio keyboard

221
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,058
from the 1980s
that I have found.

222
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,661
Watch what happens
when I push this demo button.

223
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,064
♪ ♪

224
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,666
Hello, Daft Punk?

225
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,734
Great song.
Here's a Grammy.

226
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,202
Oh-ho-ho!

227
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,404
(French accent):
You know, is funny.

228
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,440
Until you spoke, I did
not know we were French!

229
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,212
There you go, Joe.
All settled.

230
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,081
Now, which wall
would you like to look at

231
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,215
for the rest of your life?

232
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,518
I don't know,
maybe that one.

233
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,587
I-I have no idea
what you're pointing at, Joe.

234
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,888
You got to meet us halfway.

235
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,856
Look, guys, I don't want
to be a burden to anyone.

236
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,758
You go ahead
and live your lives.

237
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,226
I'll be fine.

238
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,861
We can't just
leave you, Joe.

239
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,698
So before we go, I'm gonna
put the remote in your mouth.

240
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,766
Here's a can of chili.

241
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,936
And the opener we'll put...
in your mouth.

242
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,938
And here's a magazine I thought
you might like to read.

243
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,573
I'm gonna put it
in your mouth.

244
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,874
(grunts)

245
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,876
(muffled):
You're a good friend, Peter.

246
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,712
Joe, I just wish
we could do more,

247
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,214
but obviously your
mouth is full.

248
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,083
And you probably don't want
any reminders of Bonnie

249
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,619
around the house, so I cleared
out all of her underwear.

250
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,420
Okay, don't be a stranger.

251
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,623
Yeah, 'cause we're not
supposed to talk to those.

252
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,892
I don't know, I'm not sure
I feel right about leaving Joe.

253
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,962
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be
able to take care of himself.

254
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,964
Yeah, we're-we're kind
of all he has now.

255
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,065
What-- Joe?

256
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,133
What're you talking about?

257
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,569
He's fine.

258
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,138
Look, he's already watching
<i>The Price Is Right</i> in there.

259
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,574
Oop, he's biting
too hard on the volume.

260
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,643
<i>(The Price Is Right</i>
theme song playing)

261
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,247
Okay, you can play over there
in the sandbox, honey.

262
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,483
Mommy's just gonna
read her book.

263
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,418
Okay, I'm just gonna
walk 30 feet away,

264
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,954
and then panic
because I can't see you.

265
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,922
Can you fit me in
at 10:00 tomorrow?

266
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,658
It's getting a little
long on the sides.

267
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,793
Brian? What are you
doing on a leash?

268
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,161
And who's that?

269
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,329
(shushes)
Be cool.

270
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,764
This is the guy whose
wife I'm banging.

271
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,499
Oh, what a romantic way
to put it.

272
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,633
Yeah, it's great.

273
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,001
I just pretend
to be their dog,

274
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,670
and then when he leaves
for work,

275
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,173
I get to go to the<i> pound,</i>
if you know what I mean.

276
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,808
God, Brian,
you are such a scumbag.

277
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,176
I can't believe you--

278
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,278
Mommy! Mommy!
Where's my mommy?!

279
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,013
I have no one and nothing!

280
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,515
LOIS:
I'm right here, honey.

281
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,849
Oh, thank God.

282
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,686
She's such a gross hog.

283
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,358
Joe, you can't
just sit here.

284
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,126
You need intellectual
stimulation.

285
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,128
So I brought something
to read to you.

286
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,031
It's the word search
from the<i> Sunday Circular.</i>

287
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,533
"Kangaroo."

288
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,968
Let's see if we
can find that one.

289
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,203
"Outback."

290
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,138
I think it's an
Australian theme.

291
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,373
"Koala."

292
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,974
It definitely is.

293
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,509
Can't make out this one.

294
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,712
"Abor... Aborgine...

295
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,213
Aborgina"?

296
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,348
That's what they call
eggplant down there.

297
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,983
You know what?
Forget this.

298
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,152
I'll just read
to you from<i> Jet.</i>

299
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,388
Look, this whole page is
all the Wayans brothers

300
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,390
sitting in different
positions.

301
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,992
How you suppose they come up
with all them positions?

302
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,561
You could give me
a million years.

303
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,563
I just ain't
wired that way.

304
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,864
Marlon's like
a rubber man.

305
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,499
He can sit in
any kind of way.

306
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,235
Here's Keenan telling the
younger ones how to sit.

307
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,570
(scoffs) Like they
gonna listen.

308
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,071
Damon's doing
his own thing.

309
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,239
No surprise there.

310
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,507
That's Damon.

311
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,008
You enjoying
all this, Joe?

312
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,844
I'm honestly
just glad it seems

313
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,979
like you have
something you like.

314
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,519
Hey, my laptop's
out of battery.

315
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,887
You want to have sex?

316
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,823
Sure, I've almost finished
my sandwich, anyway.

317
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,027
Oh, come on, I don't want
to have to watch this.

318
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,596
VIC:
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,866
I was the only one
who didn't get to meet Biden.

320
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,100
(groans)
You know what?

321
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,469
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

322
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,108
Ha! Skewered.

323
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,777
VIC:
Hey!

324
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,944
Where do you think you're going?

325
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,079
You're my dog.

326
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,881
You're not going anywhere.

327
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,115
Besides, I need you, boy.

328
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,917
Now more than ever.

329
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,453
I think my wife
is cheating on me.

330
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,222
Hey, Tori, it's Brian.

331
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,891
I'm getting
the Chinese food for us.

332
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,426
I think I'm gonna order
some Me Like Bang Ho.

333
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,796
(laughs)
That's-that's not a real thing,

334
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,264
I'm talking about sex.

335
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,399
All right,
I'll be there in five.

336
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,401
Man, when I find
that son of a bitch,

337
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,703
I'm gonna rip
his head off.

338
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,807
God, what a nightmare.

339
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,810
That guy's even scarier
than a thesaurus-asaurus.

340
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,579
Tread, stomp, trudge.

341
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,081
Growl, roar, ululate.

342
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,450
Antonym-- whisper.

343
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,618
What's wrong with him?

344
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,653
He's on the spectrum.

345
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,787
"Spectrum"?

346
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,155
In my day we'd
throw him in the army

347
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,191
and have him
play the bugle.

348
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,996
Peter, this just isn't working.

349
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,932
We can't take
proper care of Joe.

350
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,333
It's a huge amount of work

351
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,501
and we don't have
any idea what we're doing.

352
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,669
Quagmire's right.

353
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,837
It's too much.

354
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,171
I just think he'd
be better off

355
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,174
under the care of grumpy,
Filipino nurses.

356
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,943
Yeah, that's why
I looked into it,

357
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,344
and we've reserved
a place for him

358
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,113
at the State Home for
Mentals and Bastards.

359
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,951
Oh, my God, sometimes
they whip them with hoses...

360
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,587
outside?!
This is perfect!

361
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,964
Hi, I work here.

362
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,366
I don't think
this guy works here.

363
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,500
Hi, can I help you?

364
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,202
Yeah, this is Joe Swanson.

365
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,538
We arranged for a 9:15 dump-off?

366
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,139
Go on, guys, get out of here.

367
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,708
I'll be fine.

368
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,709
Bye, Joe.

369
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,710
Take care, man.

370
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,778
See ya, Joe.

371
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,982
Hold on, guys.

372
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,051
There's one last thing
I got to say to my friend.

373
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,721
Hey, Joe, you know
that movie you told me to watch

374
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,823
that you said was
your favorite movie of all time,

375
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,991
and you said
I had to watch it?

376
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,893
<i>Backdraft--</i> you
finally watched it?

377
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,327
Yeah.
Wasn't it great?

378
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,495
I thought it was stupid.

379
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,796
Take care, Joe.

380
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,173
You know, tha-that state home we
left Joe in didn't seem so bad.

381
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,341
Yeah, it's got
to be good.

382
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,210
I mean, Napoleon Bonaparte
was there.

383
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,245
Would the French people
let their boss walk around

384
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,914
in stained underwear,
trying to stab people

385
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,749
if the place wasn't nice?

386
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,217
Yeah, no, no,
y-you're right, you're right.

387
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,518
Joe will get
much better care there.

388
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,253
I still feel bad.

389
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,055
Come on, you guys.
Joe's gonna be fine.

390
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,256
He'll fit in great there.

391
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,425
Not like
when I went to Hogwarts.

392
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,661
Slytherin.

393
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,431
Hufflepuff.

394
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:38,102
Housing for registered
sex offenders!

395
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,338
Aw.

396
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,446
Oh, Tori, thank God.

397
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,580
Listen, you got
to unchain me.

398
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,782
Look what Vic did.

399
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,883
Tell me about it.

400
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,451
He's lost his mind.

401
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,553
That's why I'm gonna go stay
with my mother in Baltimore

402
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,088
and work at her wife's bar.

403
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,556
Wait, what?!

404
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,791
Tori, come back!

405
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,892
Damn it!

406
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,460
Wow, shocker.

407
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,896
Your gross hookup
from the car wash ended poorly?

408
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:05,930
Stewie, thank God!

409
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,065
How'd you find me?

410
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,566
Well, you remember
when the vet knocked you out

411
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,134
to take out that rotten tooth?

412
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,936
He also put a tracking chip
in your neck.

413
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,238
What?! That's a total
violation of my rights!

414
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,574
Heh, I like how you're
chained up in a yard

415
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,309
and still trying
to pretend you're a guy.

416
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,978
Look, you got to help me.

417
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,946
Her husband's a maniac and the
only reason he hasn't killed me

418
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,614
is because he thinks
I'm just his pet dog.

419
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,917
Hmm, he's got
a padlock on here.

420
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,585
But don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

421
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,321
Well, hurry, 'cause I'm trapped
like a baseball announcer.

422
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,090
ANNOUNCER:
And the count is two and two.

423
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,492
Garcia steps
off the mound again,

424
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,294
virtually guaranteeing
that my wife

425
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,096
will be asleep when I get home.

426
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,598
The big right-hander kicks
a little dirt and tosses

427
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,134
the rosin bag as my children
grow up without me.

428
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,436
Okay, and now a fan in the
stands is giving me the finger.

429
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,671
I agree.

430
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,006
Hey, I don't know
if you can hear it,

431
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,875
but I'm peeing
in my coffee cup right now.

432
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,014
There you are.

433
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,482
Where the hell have you been?

434
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,118
I got arrested for huckin'
a TV/VCR combo off the dam.

435
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,020
Off the damn what?

436
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,454
Off the damn overpass.

437
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,123
(laughs):
Oh...

438
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,157
God, I love you, Lois.

439
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,625
That was like great sex.

440
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,327
But seriously,
it-it was bad.

441
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,461
It hit a school bus.

442
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,696
Oh, my God!

443
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,331
Well-well, can you
go talk to Joe?

444
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,867
Maybe he can put in a word for
you down at the police station.

445
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,836
Yeah, yeah, Joe, yeah, may--
yeah, maybe, maybe.

446
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,872
Do you, uh, you-you
want a back rub?

447
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,840
Peter, what's going on?

448
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,308
Uh, what do you mean?

449
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,877
Whenever you offer
me a back rub,

450
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,812
it means you're
hiding something.

451
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,981
(gunfire)

452
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,050
(chickens clucking)

453
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,387
You, hey, you-you
want a back rub?

454
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,223
We may or may not
have put Joe

455
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,392
in a smelly home
for the goofy.

456
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,162
What?! Peter, those places
are a horror show!

457
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,329
Joe's your friend!

458
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,898
How could you treat
him like that?

459
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,833
We just couldn't handle him
being fully paralyzed.

460
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,401
We didn't know what else to do.

461
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,736
But you're right.

462
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,237
We got to get him out of there.

463
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,906
You most certainly do.

464
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,041
All right, how about
that back rub now?

465
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,477
What are you, nuts?

466
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,583
What the hell do you want?

467
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,884
Oh, hello, sir.

468
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,553
I'm afraid there's
been a mistake.

469
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:12,256
I believe you found our dog,
and we need to take him home.

470
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,724
No way!
Get lost, kid.

471
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,359
He's my dog now.

472
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,528
Well, we figured
you'd say no to us,

473
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,198
but not to Vice President
Joe Biden!

474
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,732
Oh, my God!

475
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,034
Mr. Vice President!

476
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,702
First, I want
to thank you, Vic,

477
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,605
for shooting the guy
we said was Osama bin Laden.

478
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,441
Second, give these kids
their dog back.

479
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,211
Of course, sir,
I'm so sorry!

480
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,612
Here, take him!

481
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,947
Thank you.

482
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,882
You're a great American.

483
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,283
Thanks, Mr. Biden!

484
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,551
No problem.

485
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,220
Hey, you guys watch<i> Veep?</i>

486
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,221
No.

487
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,722
Yeah, it's all fake.

488
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,524
Yeah, we said no.

489
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,397
Hi, uh, we're here
to pick up Joe Swanson.

490
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,632
Are you from the news?

491
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,300
You have to tell us
if you're from the news.

492
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,069
No, we're his friends.

493
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,303
What are you guys
doing here?

494
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,638
We came to bring
you home, Joe.

495
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,241
We're all really sorry
we abandoned you.

496
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,144
Yeah, we just kind of got
overwhelmed and all freaked out.

497
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,945
But we're your
friends, Joe.

498
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,248
And we'll always be there
for you no matter what.

499
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,782
Thanks, guys.

500
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,485
I'd say let's get my stuff,
but it's all been stolen.

501
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,486
That's okay.

502
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,288
Come on, let's go home.

503
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,756
Sorry, no one
gets out of here

504
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,458
without a release
from their doctor.

505
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,661
All right, we'll just
call him right now.

506
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,730
(phone ringing)

507
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,534
What's that ringing?

508
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,640
Joe, that ringing--
it's coming from your back!

509
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,774
It is?

510
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,176
Holy crap!

511
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,311
Dr. Hartman must have
dropped his phone in Joe

512
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,779
when he was looking
at his spine!

513
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,847
Oh, thank God.

514
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,782
I've been hearing
that ringing all week.

515
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,284
I just thought
I was losing my mind

516
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,686
from lunatics
screaming in my face.

517
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,821
Your mother's a whore!

518
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,258
I told you that
in confidence, Gary.

519
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,298
Ah, it's so great
to have you back, Joe.

520
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,832
You seem good as new.

521
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,801
Yeah, it turns out Dr.
Hartman's cell phone

522
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,703
was pressing on
my spinal cord,

523
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,372
and that's what was causing
my total paralysis.

524
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,541
Yeah, sorry we dropped
the ball for a while,

525
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,144
which is the way we agreed we'd
describe what we did to you,

526
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,879
which hopefully
makes it seem less heinous.

527
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,314
It's all right, guys.

528
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,049
I'm just glad to be
back on my feet.

529
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,818
Well, you know
what I mean.

530
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,487
(laughter)

531
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,324
PETER:
<i>I never saw much</i>
<i>of Joe after that.</i>

532
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,992
<i>And while he's been gone</i>
<i>for many years,</i>

533
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,894
<i>I've never forgotten his face</i>

534
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,430
<i>or his laughter.</i>

535
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,733
Come on, are we
going to the beach?

536
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,368
We've been waiting forever.

537
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,903
Yeah, be right there,
champ.

538
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,339
He said that the first
two times we asked.

539
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:45,943
I know, he spaces out
when he's at the computer.

540
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,586
<i>These aren't my kids.</i>

541
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,188
<i>And also, this isn't</i>
<i>play wrestling.</i>

542
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,257
<i>We're actually fighting.</i>
