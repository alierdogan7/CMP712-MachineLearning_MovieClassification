1
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,351
Daddy, it's 7.30!

2
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,836
Daddy, it's 7.30!

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,872
Daddy, wake up!

4
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,152
Morning, Daddy. Come on, wake up!

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,236
Wake up! Come on, wake up.

6
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,357
- There's your coffee right there.
- Where am I?

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,670
Here, I want you to drink this.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,917
Then take a shower and get dressed.
Your clothes are there.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,510
Then I want you to see the woman
about the job. Today. You promised.

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,757
I know. What would I do without
you nagging me all the time?

11
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,916
You really want me to answer that?

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,038
Yeah, I've been gettin' in kinda late
lately. We haven't had a chance to talk.

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,993
Don't worry about it.
There hasn't been a lot to say.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,918
- Is everything all right with you?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,999
- Is school good?
- No, but it never is.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,113
- Have you been asked to the prom?
- No. Not yet.

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,833
When was the last time
I told you how beautiful you are?

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,916
About yesterday.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,078
- Turn around.
- What?

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,475
You know what. Let me see this outfit.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,876
- Is this your latest creation?
- This is it.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,275
My God, what did that cost you?

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,393
About $15 for the shoes, second-hand,
and I made the rest.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,476
Unbelievable.

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,555
I was thinking maybe that
you could do something with this.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,114
- Maybe put some ruffles here...
- Come on, get up!

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,913
Really, I mean it.
This means a lot to me.

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,429
I am perfectly happy
with what I'm doing.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,994
Perfectly happy with part-time work?

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,159
- No. That's why I'm getting up.
- OK. I'll make you some breakfast.

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,710
I'm up.

32
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,270
- Hi, Blane.
- Hi, Kate. How you doin'?

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,152
- Fine. How are you?
- Good.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,673
Morning! Welcome to another day
of higher education.

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,588
- Hi, Duckie. How are you?
- Not bad, considering I'm in this dump.

36
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,757
This is a really volcanic
ensemble you're wearing.

37
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,075
- Volcanic?
- You know, hot, dangerous...

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,715
- Are you going to class today?
- I don't know if I'm emotionally ready.

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,876
Go for it. It's virtually painless.

40
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,590
- I gotta go. I'll see you at lunch.
- OK.

41
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,190
I'll call the cafeteria and make
a reservation - two by the window.

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,036
Sure.

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,072
No, you don't like to sit in the sun.
OK, something else.

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,475
Listen, may I admire you again today?

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,754
Ladies. I may be able
to work out a deal

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,271
where either one or the both of you
could be pregnant by the holidays.

47
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,597
Some argue that the New Deal
saved the capitalist system.

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,473
There's evidence that
the Roosevelt administration

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,991
was trying to avoid
excessive governmental power,

50
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,031
rather than implant socialism.

51
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,957
In his first act as president,

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,231
Mr Roosevelt enacted
the Emergency Banking Act,

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,238
and he refused
to consider nationalisation.

54
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,315
Where'd you get your clothes?
Five-and-dime store? Attractive!

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,590
Is there a problem, ladies?

56
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,278
- No.
- No.

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,275
Andie, is there something going on
between you and these ladies?

58
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,356
No, not that I'm aware of.

59
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,149
I'd like to apologise on behalf
of Miss Strombley and Miss Henson.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,236
They will be thinking of you tonight

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,591
as they write a summary of the
chapters that we've just covered.

62
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,596
Great!

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,550
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

64
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,194
There's nothing wrong with me. I'm fine.
Can you just forget about the chapter?

65
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,549
- Yes?
- We'll take the chapter.

66
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,476
Fine. Let's go on.

67
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,276
The Emergency Banking Act.

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,596
I'll see you guys later.

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Andie, you look ravishing.

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,832
So we graduate in a month.

71
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,918
When are you and I gonna
get together and do something?

72
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,393
Try never.

73
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,671
- I'm talking about more than sex here.
- No, you're not.

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,037
I've liked you for four years
and you treat me like shit.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,549
I don't understand that.
What's your problem?

76
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,194
Can you get off of my car?

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,553
I've been out with a lot
of girls at this school.

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,717
- What makes you so different?
- I have some taste.

79
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,596
You're a bitch.

80
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,438
You oughta see a doctor. That condition
of yours could get a lot worse.

81
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,236
Applause, applause, applause.

82
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,470
This is beautiful. It's so...

83
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,511
modern.

84
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,710
I mean, is this fab or what?

85
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,190
It's great.

86
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,551
- I'm very, very good at this.
- I know.

87
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,958
It's such a waste that I own
a lowly little retail outfit.

88
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,473
- No, not if you're good at it.
- I'm good in bed. Should I be a whore?

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,996
It's great.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,709
- Did you say you went to your prom?
- Yeah, sure.

91
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,638
- Was it terrible?
- It was the worst.

92
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,797
But it's supposed to be.
But you have to go, right?

93
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
You don't have to.
I mean, it's not a requirement.

94
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,317
A girlfriend of mine didn't go to hers.

95
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,194
Once in a while she gets a terrible
feeling, like something is missing.

96
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,313
She checks her purse and her keys,
she counts her kids, she goes crazy.

97
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,954
And then she realises that...

98
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,275
nothing is missing.

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,392
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,398
I don't know. Part of me says
just go and get it over with,

101
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,195
and this other part says it's a stupid
tradition and what's the point?

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,117
Well, you know...

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,109
You could say that life itself
is a stupid tradition.

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,433
Don't analyse it. Just go.

105
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Put that back!

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,839
- You missed my eye by an inch!
- Half an inch.

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,513
This ain't the public library, lightfingers!

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,956
I'll get it!

109
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,635
Trax. What do you want?

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,036
Tyrone, you blow.

111
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,356
Yeah, I'm workin'. Leave me alone.

112
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,795
That's thrilling!

113
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,718
I cook for you, I do your laundry,
I sleep with you,

114
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,796
now you want a ride to work?

115
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,196
Grow up!

116
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,116
Take the bus...

117
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,879
How you doin'?

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,592
- Fine.
- Good.

119
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,950
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,914
- Can I get your opinion on something?
- Maybe.

121
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,276
Maybe.

122
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,599
This any good?

123
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,197
It's hot. White hot.

124
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,876
Good, I'll take it.

125
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,359
OK. That'd be cash or charge?

126
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,834
American Express
Platinum Card, maybe?

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,113
Cash.

128
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,268
You know, every time you go
to the john, you lose IQ points.

129
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,035
It's Walter Mondale.

130
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,029
- Just 7.50. There's your change.
- Thanks.

131
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,549
- I don't need a bag.
- No?

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,832
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it.

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,712
Bondage has no place in my life.
Since when?

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,629
Since I spent the night tied up
in the back seat of your car!

135
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,712
- Jena.
- Yeah?

136
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,753
Would you ever consider going out
with somebody that had money?

137
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,318
I don't think it makes
a difference. I mean...

138
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,509
It's material.

139
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,476
Simon! Simon!

140
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,640
What would you do if your father
came home a rich man?

141
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,274
- Kiss his ass.
- See?

142
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,595
- See what?
- What Simon just said.

143
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,594
What...

144
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,678
What are you gettin' at?
Are you goin' out with a rich guy?

145
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,598
- I gotta go.
- Hey, you didn't answer my question.

146
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,153
- No.
- Good.

147
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,236
Simon, it's been stimulating.

148
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,637
- How long have I been coming here?
- I dunno. A couple of years.

149
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,036
- OK, so we're buddies, we're close.
- Yeah. Very pally.

150
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,594
OK! So how many times
have you let me in?

151
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,992
- I never let you in. You know that.
- You see what I'm sayin'?

152
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,272
- I dunno. What are you sayin'?
- My girlfriend is in there and I'm here...

153
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,631
Well, she's a girl and she's my friend,
so she's a girl friend.

154
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,117
But she's in there and I'm out here!
You're a sensitive, sexually potent guy.

155
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,028
- You gotta know how that hurts!
- Let me ask you a question, seriously.

156
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,358
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?

157
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,836
- Think about it.
- I don't know.

158
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,833
Anyway, my advice to you is...

159
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,758
dump her, lose her.
You don't need that.

160
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,510
You see what I'm sayin'?
You see the point I'm tryin' to make?

161
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,638
Love's a bitch, Duck. Love's a bitch.

162
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,588
- Ain't it the truth?
- It's the truth.

163
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,995
- High five.
- All right!

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,156
Wanna try a cigarette?

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,276
Let me ask you a personal question.

166
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,597
If you worship the Duck, why not
hang out somewhere he could get in?

167
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,793
Nice Dice Man! Say hello to the wife
and kids. You know what I'm sayin'?

168
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,151
He's dyslexic. He gets everything
backwards. He meant to say...

169
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,191
- It's OK, Duckie.
- OK. You're sure?

170
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,675
I could clean up this parking lot
with his butt.

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,075
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
- OK.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,033
- Were you here long?
- No, no. Three, four hours.

173
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,832
You have a good time?

174
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,428
- Good. That's good. What now?
- Bed.

175
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,516
Yours or mine?

176
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,472
- Ours?
- Nice try.

177
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,596
OK. Can you at least
give me a ride home?

178
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,676
Yeah. Get in.

179
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,472
Can I put my head in your lap?

180
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,433
Can I rest my head
on your shoulder and let you steer?

181
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,516
- Get in, Duckie.
- OK.

182
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,155
These houses are amazing, Duck.

183
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,636
The first million I make,
I'll buy you one. I hate this song.

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,514
- They're so beautiful.
- You want beauty, look in the mirror.

185
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,076
This whole tape is horrible.

186
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,357
It must be, like, a hormone thing.
Every song is making me sick.

187
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,392
I mean, why can't I find
a decent song here?

188
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,910
- That was my favourite.
- Are you deaf?

189
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,315
The house!

190
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,796
Yeah. That's a nice little crib.

191
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,950
I wonder what it's like inside.

192
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,196
Well, what difference does it make?

193
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,076
You know what the really sad thing is?

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,193
I bet the people that live there don't
think it's half as pretty as I do.

195
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,197
You know, Andie, I'm just...

196
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,869
They just don't write love songs
like they used to. I...

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,869
I'm angry about this now. My evening's
shot. Just drive me home, now.

198
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,232
The reason I came over, other than I'd
been planning to come and say hello,

199
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,716
- I wanted to talk to you about Andie.
- Yeah?

200
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,434
She's an incredible individual.
You know that.

201
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,518
I mean, I'm there for her.
Whenever, however, I'm there.

202
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,676
You can rest assured
that she's covered.

203
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,155
I don't want you to worry,
because my only plans

204
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,589
are to make sure
that she's taken care of.

205
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,950
That's nice of you, Phil.

206
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,230
And I'd like to marry her.

207
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,309
Well, not today. But eventually, I figure.

208
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,113
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?

209
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,276
No confirmation on that just yet.
I'm layin' the groundwork.

210
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,358
I'm thinkin' in terms of
housing, food, basic needs.

211
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,392
But I'm picking my moment.

212
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,159
- I mean, you understand, right?
- Sure.

213
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,397
I felt the same way about
somebody myself.

214
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,791
A girl?

215
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,876
A girl.

216
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,353
I loved her and I married her.

217
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,516
And one day she just split.

218
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,796
Wait, this was Andie's mom?

219
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,396
Yeah.

220
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,833
So I haven't seen her in three years,
you know, and...

221
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,557
But I still love her
just as much as I ever did, you know?

222
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,076
You can love Andie, but that doesn't
mean she'll love you back.

223
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,914
It doesn't mean she won't, but...

224
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,191
What I'm trying to say is
you can't make it happen.

225
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,550
It either will or it won't.

226
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,639
- It's all in the heart.
- Yeah, sure. Cardiovascular.

227
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,228
Yeah. I understand.
I've been to school.

228
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,429
Well, I got an appointment with
a vacuum cleaner. Gotta go.

229
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,710
You're on a whole
home-improvement jag.

230
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,469
- Yeah. Turning the old life around.
- More power to ya.

231
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,558
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it too.

232
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,358
Thanks for taking your time.
I really... I appreciate it.

233
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,040
- My pleasure.
- I'm off like a dirty shirt.

234
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,036
Tina Turner.

235
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,231
Hiya.

236
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,552
We just got these glasses in.
They're really...

237
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,955
I didn't like that album
I got the other day.

238
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,275
What?

239
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,879
- The record.
- The record.

240
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,956
I thought it was a little too...

241
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,036
Too hip, maybe.

242
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,555
- Yeah, a little too hip.
- Well...

243
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,753
Think you can recommend something
else? A little less political?

244
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,310
- Lionel Richie?
- Nah.

245
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,437
Well...

246
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,475
- Teena Marie? Madonna?
- Madonna? That's awfully deep.

247
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,558
Yeah, very deep.
But she's got such great style.

248
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,310
Listen...

249
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,117
That's the alarm. Can you
hold on a second? I'll be right back.

250
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,512
Here. Read this. It's really good.

251
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,156
What is this?

252
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,756
Hi! How was your day?

253
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,508
Bet it pumps out about
300 decibels, huh?

254
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,675
- Did you do this?
- I'm not sure.

255
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,031
I was just using your powder room
and I decided not to disturb you,

256
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,516
so I was gonna go out the back door,
but I must have touched somethin'.

257
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,596
- How'd you get in here?
- Are you mad?

258
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,439
Yes, I'm mad! There are
public bathrooms everywhere!

259
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,516
I'm not nine, Andie. I know that.

260
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,712
It's the end of the month.
They're out of toilet-seat covers.

261
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,795
- Blane, what are you doing?
- Hey, buddy. Nothin'. Hangin' out.

262
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,629
- What are you shopping for? Records?
- I guess.

263
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,320
- Find anything?
- No, not really.

264
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,796
Are we gonna shoot some trap or
what? If we are, we gotta shake it.

265
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,396
I don't have any place to go. I like
coming here. Excuse me very much.

266
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,479
OK. I'm sorry for getting mad at you.
I gotta get back. See you later.

267
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,754
This is a shitty alarm system! I opened
the door five times before it rang.

268
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,714
That's it! I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna stay here. No! No way!

269
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,357
Hi. It's 6.05. Duckie Dale. Give me a call.

270
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,189
6.15. Duckie Dale again. Call me, OK?

271
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,791
Andie, where are you? This is the Duck.
Give me a call, OK?

272
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,997
It's 6.28...

273
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,998
Please call. Please, please, please.

274
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,519
This is Duckie. Are you really home
and not picking up?

275
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,756
Cos if so, I feel like
a giant asshole here.

276
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,836
It's 6.31. Give me a call, OK?

277
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,679
Duckie, I'll talk to you
in the morning. Bye.

278
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,511
- Why are you up? I didn't wake you yet.
- I'm fixing you breakfast.

279
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
One egg over medium,
and I fed the dog.

280
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,834
- Did Daddy feed you, hm?
- Your egg, madame.

281
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,349
I don't eat eggs, Daddy.
Why don't you eat it?

282
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,313
- I'll bring you your coffee and juice.
- OK.

283
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,508
- Since when don't you like eggs?
- Since about birth. Don't worry about it.

284
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,837
- You never told me why you were up.
- It's morning.

285
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,360
You mean why didn't you
have to drag my ass out of bed?

286
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,435
OK.

287
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,710
Well, I got a job.

288
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,957
- No?
- Yeah.

289
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,039
- Where?
- Well, I'll tell you after I start.

290
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,353
- When's that?
- Soon.

291
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,790
- I'm so proud of you. You got the job.
- No big deal.

292
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,957
Yes, it is a big deal.
It's a very big deal.

293
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,514
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for school.

294
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,394
- Tell me all about it tonight.
- All right. It'll be real good.

295
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,631
Hi, guys.

296
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,078
- How you doin'?
- Fine. You?

297
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,589
I'm OK. And you?

298
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,598
- Well, I just said I was fine.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

299
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,399
- So, is this your first time out here?
- Yeah.

300
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,520
I don't think I'm very popular
out here either.

301
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,359
I dunno. You're just fine inside.

302
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,916
I don't know. I'm not really
into all this shit, you know?

303
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,190
Yeah.

304
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,152
Yeah.

305
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,555
I really liked your computer trick.

306
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,070
- Clever, huh?
- Terribly clever, yeah. Terribly.

307
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
- Are you late for something?
- Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

308
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,756
But it's no big deal.

309
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,354
Listen, do you wanna go out Friday?

310
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,277
Yeah.

311
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,197
- Yeah?
- Sure.

312
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,878
Yeah? OK!

313
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,560
- Seven o'clock OK?
- Yeah, that's fine.

314
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,240
Great. Where do you live?
I'll pick you up.

315
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,113
- Where do you live?
- No, I'm sorry.

316
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,198
I'll be working on Friday,
so just pick me up at the mall.

317
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,275
- OK.
- OK.

318
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,356
- Bye.
- See you.

319
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,240
Hey, Blane. How you doin'?

320
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,316
Hey, buddy. What's up?

321
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,749
- What are you up to?
- Not much, going to class.

322
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,757
Well, I saw you outside.

323
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,917
- So?
- So, what were you doing?

324
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,669
What are you? My mother?
Come on, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

325
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,677
- Blane, what's goin' on?
- Nothing.

326
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,032
Well, not nothing. I saw you talking
to that chick, what's her name, Eddie?

327
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,633
- So what do you care?
- My best friend is talking to a mutant.

328
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,832
I'm curious.
That's no reason to get defensive.

329
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,077
I'm not defensive.
I just happen to like her, all right?

330
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,829
Listen, all right. It's your life.
It's none of my business.

331
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,554
You really don't think
she's got something?

332
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,116
No. I really don't. I'm sorry.

333
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,836
You're gonna be late, buddy.

334
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,599
The Warsaw Pact was a treaty
signed by the Soviet Union

335
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,075
and seven East European satellites.

336
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,475
What it did was it...

337
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,319
it established a mutual
defence organisation as...

338
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,429
Duckie!

339
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,394
What? What, what? Well, what'd I put?

340
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,752
You wrote "The Warsaw Pact is the
pact that was named after Warsaw. "

341
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,710
The teacher'll know you're bullshitting.

342
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,308
OK, OK. What about the rest of it?

343
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,193
The Russian Revolution
did not take place in Germany.

344
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,795
- What was Karl Marx, then?
- He was a German.

345
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,674
- Well, there you go.
- Yes, but his being German

346
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,315
has nothing to do with where
the Russian Revolution occurred!

347
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,112
OK, OK.

348
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,469
OK, can I propose something to you
without you getting upset or angry?

349
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,955
- That depends.
- On what?

350
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,878
I dunno. I just said that. Go ahead.

351
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,432
You're deliberately flunking your
courses so you can stay in high school.

352
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,835
Get out of here! Why would I do that?

353
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,238
- I dunno. You tell me.
- Well, I'm not, so there's nothing to tell.

354
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,319
- You're not always one to face things.
- What am I not facing?

355
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,475
The future.

356
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,115
Whether or not you face the future,
it happens, right?

357
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,277
- You run yourself down. Why?
- I am not running myself down!

358
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,709
You think I am? I don't think I am.

359
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,991
Why? Because of the way I dress?
Cos I can laugh at myself?

360
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,193
That's called a sense of humour.
You should get one, they're nice.

361
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,710
- What are we gonna do next year?
- You think I'll still be in school.

362
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,718
I'm serious! Not a day
has passed in eight years

363
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,956
when I didn't talk to you
at least 20 times!

364
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,275
Well, that's devotion.

365
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,349
I know. Even if I sometimes get angry,
you know that I secretly love it.

366
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,119
You see, I knew that.

367
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,437
I hope I'm not the only one
that knows how incredible you are.

368
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,870
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.

369
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,158
I'm gonna get something to drink,
and then we work, OK?

370
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,589
- You bet.
- OK. What do you want?

371
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,792
- Beer, Scotch, juice box. Whatever.
- OK.

372
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,596
Oh, God.

373
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,550
I love this woman.

374
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,433
I love this woman and I have to tell her,

375
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,793
and if she laughs, she laughs.

376
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,310
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me,

377
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,954
but if I don't find out...

378
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,436
I love her too much!

379
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,070
Love is real.

380
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,273
Thank you, thank you.

381
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,356
Real is love.

382
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,869
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.

383
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,956
Love is living

384
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,030
You're fabulous. I do love you.
You're gorgeous, I love your hair.

385
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,197
Love is feeling

386
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,317
Feeling love

387
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,238
Love is wanting

388
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,110
She's gonna laugh. Would I blame her?

389
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,672
- There you go.
- Thanks, but I'm gonna split.

390
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,156
- Why? What about your paper?
- That's what I'm gonna do.

391
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,193
If you help me, thanks a lot, but
it won't be my work, it'll be bogus.

392
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,356
And I guess I'll see you in the a. m.

393
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,075
Drinking and driving don't mix.
That's why I ride a bike.

394
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,956
So, are you going out this weekend?

395
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,275
I dunno. I'm not sure yet.

396
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,311
- What are you gonna do?
- Stay at home.

397
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,319
- Yeah? Are you gonna study again?
- Probably. Would you put that out?

398
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,955
Why do you study so much? It makes
me ill. I just don't see the point.

399
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,719
No? I don't wanna work
in a record store my whole life.

400
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,513
What do you wanna be? A doctor?

401
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,154
Oh, God.

402
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,753
OK, let's go, everybody.
Get in your lines, please! Thank you.

403
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,189
- Vormeister!
- Here!

404
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,276
Bassett!

405
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,754
- Bassano
- Yeah!

406
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,031
- Look. Watch out.
- Do we smell bad or something?

407
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,479
Benny.

408
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,355
I hope they shrivel up and fall off, OK?

409
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,956
What was that, Miss Homan?

410
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,235
I said "I hope they shrivel up
and fall off".

411
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,275
You hope what shrivels up
and falls off?

412
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,916
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

413
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,598
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

414
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,636
You are outta here, Homan.

415
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,113
Right.

416
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,559
Bye-bye.

417
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,159
Bye, girls.

418
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,472
So, do you share
your partner's attitude?

419
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,911
No, I don't.

420
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,752
Eat shit.

421
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,753
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

422
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,030
You've only got a couple of months left.

423
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,674
You're doing extremely well
in your courses,

424
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,429
and I think your chances of
getting a scholarship are excellent.

425
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,870
- I know this, Mr Donnelly.
- Why are you in here now?

426
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,753
I don't know. I guess
I just got a little fed up.

427
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,792
- With what?
- The way that we get treated.

428
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,832
Look, you're getting
a topnotch education here

429
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,918
and I just don't want
to see you throw it away.

430
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,755
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve.

431
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,634
I'm lucky, the good people of this
community allow me to attend here.

432
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,435
- Again, you are misunderstanding me.
- No, I understand everything.

433
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,950
I don't need to have it
explained to me. I live it.

434
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,755
It's just, sometimes, I get
a little upset and I lose my temper.

435
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,476
I don't like to see my friends getting
punished for defending themselves.

436
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,510
Well, we'll just forget
about this whole thing, OK?

437
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,516
OK.

438
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,236
What about Jena?

439
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,477
- She's off too.
- Thank you.

440
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,875
Andie,

441
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,276
if you put out signals
that you don't wanna belong,

442
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,960
people are gonna
make sure that you don't.

443
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,036
That's a beautiful theory.

444
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,993
Andie! Andie!

445
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,749
I heard what happened and I came
as best I could. I cut out of Home Ec.

446
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,836
- Was it really bad?
- No, it was nothing.

447
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,279
- Are you upset?
- No.

448
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,233
Yes, yes, you are, I can tell.
Your eyes get all squinty.

449
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,874
- I know how to make you feel better.
- I feel fine!

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,231
I wanna take you away
this weekend. Do you fish?

451
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,870
- OK, we can go right now.
- I have class!

452
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,436
- Tonight. I won't take no for an answer.
- Try, please.

453
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,109
This woman is suffering inside.
That's all there is to it.

454
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,718
Yo, man. Next time, I'll kick your ass.
That'll be that.

455
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,796
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

456
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,030
How about that stock market?

457
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,628
My broker is EF Hutton,
and EF Hutton says...

458
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,389
You see, it never works.
I've never seen it work.

459
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,596
Shit!

460
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,236
So this is what it looks like!

461
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,198
This is great!
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

462
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,278
You got doors on the stalls.
They're not stuck.

463
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,439
Wait a minute! We don't have
none of this stuff in the boys' room!

464
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,790
We don't have doors on the stalls...

465
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,275
What is this?
We don't have a candy machine.

466
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,960
- None of that.
- Who is that screaming?

467
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,436
I'm sorry. I want the Principal
here this instant. Now.

468
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,154
This instant. I'll wait. Thank you.

469
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,919
Shit! Why can't I do this?

470
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,749
What have you done?
This... You have to subtotal first.

471
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,599
I tell you this every time.
You never listen.

472
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,118
One more tune, then it's off
to enjoy a terrible relationship.

473
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,028
The guy next door loves this.

474
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,428
Evening, young ladies.
This is a very good tune.

475
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,869
My mother used to sing this. I love Otis.

476
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,433
We're closed.

477
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,313
- Know what older women do for me?
- Change your diapers?

478
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,715
Touche. You're a very
smoky alternative,

479
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,354
but this is the Duck Man's love in life.

480
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,516
- Shall we?
- Ever had one of these?

481
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,637
I don't think so.

482
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
Come on! Let's plough!

483
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,991
Do I offend?

484
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,116
Andie, hon!

485
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,791
Listen. It's after seven.
Don't waste good lip gloss.

486
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,992
- I know, lona.
- I don't mean to be a bitch or anything,

487
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,510
but I don't think
Mr Wonderful's gonna happen tonight.

488
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,831
I don't know what I'm doing.

489
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,916
Wishful make-upping.

490
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,079
Wait. You babes are talking
a sign language

491
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,873
that the old Ducker here
just does not understand.

492
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,639
Would you mind filling me in?
I'm a little confused.

493
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,716
She got stood up, twerp!

494
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,910
Stood up? How so? Wait, I'm here!

495
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,875
Is this one of those feminine
mystique deals or something?

496
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,916
He showed.

497
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,192
Andie.

498
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,916
I'll get that.

499
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,437
- Duckie, I'm really sorry.
- Is this...

500
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,155
You're gonna go out with this guy?
Is this, like, a date?

501
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,510
Yeah. I mean, you'd like him.

502
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,279
He's not like the other guys.
Seriously.

503
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,356
No. No way. Andie!

504
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,679
You've really pissed me off cos they
shit all over everybody, including you.

505
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,272
- I can't believe you'd be this stupid.
- I'm not gonna let anybody shit on me.

506
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,354
He's gonna use your ass and throw you
away. God, I would have died for you!

507
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,994
So what am I supposed to do?
He asked me out and I like him.

508
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,357
If I hate him because he's got money,

509
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,189
that's the same thing as them hating us
because we don't. Understand?

510
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,073
You can't do this and respect yourself.

511
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,112
- You can't.
- I'll make that decision, all right?

512
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,117
Sure, you can do what you want!

513
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,073
You're saying that
just because I'm going out with Blane.

514
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,997
Blane? His name is Blane?

515
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,200
That's a major appliance!
That's not a name!

516
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,949
Just because I'm going out with Blane
doesn't mean I can't be your friend.

517
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,470
- It doesn't change how I feel about you.
- That's very nice.

518
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,636
I'm glad. Here's the point, Andie.

519
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,275
I'm not particularly concerned
with whether or not you like me.

520
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,790
Cos I live to like you,
and I can't like you any more.

521
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,473
So when you get your heart splattered
all over hell and you feel low, and dirty,

522
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,036
don't look to me to help
pump you back up cos...

523
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,914
cos maybe for the first time
in your life, I won't be there.

524
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,600
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.

525
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,075
Well, I guess that's just tough shit.

526
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,796
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

527
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,759
- That guy in the store...
- He was a friend of mine.

528
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,196
I've known him since I was a kid.
He's a really nice guy.

529
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,276
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like him a lot.

530
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,316
So, you wanna go home and change?

531
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,515
I already did.

532
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,596
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

533
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,113
So, where are we going?

534
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,270
You up for a party?

535
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,550
Yeah? No? Maybe?

536
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,636
No, I don't think so.

537
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,277
- Why?
- Why?

538
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,834
- They're my friends. It's OK.
- Your friends.

539
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,394
I wouldn't go
if I didn't think they'd accept you.

540
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,431
Can't we go somewhere else?

541
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,518
Andie, I like you. I think you like me.

542
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,791
We know a lot of bullshit goes on,
but if you're above it, I am.

543
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,879
If we want to make anything out of this,
we gotta deal with it, right?

544
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,594
- Yeah.
- Come on, I got as much to lose as you.

545
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,554
We can go out with your friends if you
want. We could go crawl under a rock.

546
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,638
Anything you want. The choice is yours.

547
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,957
- We could go hang-gliding.
- I've never been hang-gliding.

548
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,833
Well, there's a first for everything.

549
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,473
If it's a bad time, we leave.

550
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,551
- Hi, Blane.
- Hey, Eddie.

551
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,116
Aren't you the girl in my art class?

552
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,276
Nice pearls.
This isn't a dinner party, honey.

553
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,355
Watch it.

554
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,472
- Hey, Blane. How you doin'?
- Hey, Kev, what's up?

555
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,633
I can't believe I actually
associate with these people.

556
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,955
I can't believe that I'm actually here.

557
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,311
- Pretty bad, yeah?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

558
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,192
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,276
Let's go upstairs, huh?

560
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,079
Come on.

561
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,431
I didn't come here to get you off.
That was not my idea.

562
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,598
That's not what I meant.
I haven't even tried to kiss you, have I?

563
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,234
Look, it's quieter up there, OK?

564
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,353
Come on. These hands will remain
in these pockets, I swear to God.

565
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,869
Look at me here. Come on.
I'm utterly defenceless.

566
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,956
And utterly foolish. Come on.

567
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,790
- What do you think of these carpets?
- They're fab.

568
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,396
This is gonna be great.

569
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,590
- Hey, Blane.
- Steff.

570
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,472
- How you doin'?
- All right.

571
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,835
- I'll get another room.
- No, come on in.

572
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,155
I'm just watching some 'toons here.

573
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,116
Who you got with you here, Blane?

574
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,280
Andie, this is Steff. Steff, Andie.

575
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,752
It's very nice to meet you, Andie.

576
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,550
Listen, you wanna come sit down?
Or you want the bed?

577
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,875
No! No, we're fine.

578
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,434
Come and have a drink.
Can I get you something?

579
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,870
This is my last serious party
of my high school career.

580
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,436
Hope you guys are gonna tough it out
until Sunday when my folks get home.

581
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,599
I think this one may just finally
kill the old son of a bitch, Blane.

582
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,190
Another giant step away from virginity.

583
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,880
You're a slut, aren't you, Benny?

584
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,316
Oh, my God.

585
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,430
- Am I having a nightmare?
- We got guests.

586
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,109
I know you. You're in my calculus class.

587
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,515
- Gym.
- Your name's Jim?

588
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,279
You are worthless, aren't you?

589
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,676
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.
