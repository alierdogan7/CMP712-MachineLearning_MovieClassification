Season 5, episode 2
#56 - Unlike A Virgin

2
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,480
<i>Turtle:
are we seriously not
going out tonight?</i>

3
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,916
- we seriously are not.
- come on, Vin.

4
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:11,185
- we need to go
find some girls.
- I got reading to do.

5
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,986
You've been reading all day.
Look at your fingertips.

6
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:15,089
They're all sunburned from
holding scripts over your face.

7
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,324
Give me a break, Turtle.
There's still plenty to go.

8
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,793
Sorry.
Drama!

9
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,028
You want to go
find some ass?

10
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,796
( silent )

11
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,098
( sighs )

12
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,568
- hi, jaq.
- hey, Turtle.

13
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,070
- bye, Turtle.
- bye, jaq.

14
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:32,206
He's touchy.

15
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:33,774
( sighs )

16
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,976
( moaning )

17
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,045
Sorry again.

18
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:40,047
30 awful scripts to
get to one good one.

19
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,648
- yeah?
- it's strong.

20
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,318
- put it on the pile.
- nice.  I like the new
work ethic, Vince.

21
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:45,619
I don't.

22
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,389
Oh, I do love those tits.

23
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:49,757
You want to roll
to the villa tonight, e?

24
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,725
Who, just me and you?

25
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,460
Yeah, you're right.

26
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,064
I'll just catch a beat.

27
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,199
What?
Not out here.

28
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,304
Drama:
we're heading into
Ari's office right now.

29
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:06,607
We'll be here for about 15
minutes then we'll go to lunch,

30
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:08,976
Probably urth caffe,
and then the gym.

31
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,578
Sportsclub, not gold's,
cause I did my lats yesterday.

32
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,415
I'll do a steam,
maybe a protein shake

33
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,550
And then I'll race home
just in time to tuck you in.

34
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,519
Don't you worry, babe.

35
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:20,721
Oh, I miss you.

36
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,825
Okay.
Tweet.

37
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,326
Bye.

38
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,862
What, do you tell her every
detail of your day, Drama?

39
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,331
Yup.  Jaqueline's
the real jealous type.

40
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,434
So I got to make sure all
my time is accounted for,

41
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,669
Otherwise
it's nag nag nag.

42
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,938
Sounds like
a good relationship.

43
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:40,307
You've had
a relationship, Turtle?

44
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,176
<i>Ari:
look at this.</i>

45
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,544
Like the good old days, huh?

46
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,412
Not quite.
I've read scripts.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,182
<i>- Eric: a lot of scripts.
- you boys are maturing
so nicely.</i>

48
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,883
- Lloyd.
- thank you, Lloyd.

49
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,086
So, Vinnie, I need to
formally apologize

50
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,787
Face to face for this
"danger beach" thing.

51
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,522
- Ari, don't.
- I thought it was real.

52
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,725
- we both did.
- I don't care about that.

53
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,561
I'm here to move forward.
I'll do any one of
these scripts.

54
00:04:02,197 --> 00:04:03,831
So he doesn't even have
to talk anymore?

55
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:06,200
- no, I'm gonna mime.
- ( laughs )

56
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,935
Look at this.
What have we got?

57
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:10,270
"jarvik," about the guy who
invented the artificial heart.

58
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,439
I sent it to you
when you were in colombia.

59
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,174
<i>- never heard back from you.
- we were working.</i>

60
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,776
So were they on
getting a lead actor.

61
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:17,845
And they got one,
toby maguire.

62
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:20,114
Leo's doing "the merchant
of venice beach."

63
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,750
Wahlberg's doing "milk bar."
"nine brave souls"--

64
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,284
Maser and baird.
I don't know what this is.

65
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,320
- I've never
heard of these guys.
- I found that one.

66
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,588
Did you jerk it out
of Turtle's cock?

67
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:30,324
Come on, Ari, it's cool.
Take a look.

68
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:35,496
"dear Vincent Chase's
manager.

69
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:38,298
After three years
of turmoil we have completed

70
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:41,235
What we think you'll find
to be a complex and riveting
tale of men

71
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,838
On a journey to save
themselves from a literalo "

72
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:46,373
Jesus Christ.

73
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:48,942
<i>Have we learned nothing
from our past mistakes?</i>

74
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,046
We need a go
film here, boys.
A studio film.

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,581
It's a great character piece.
It's about nine firefighters

76
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,583
On the night before the biggest
fire they ever fought.

77
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,723
No indies, e!

78
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,025
Think of it like
the holocaust.

79
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,394
Never again, all right?

80
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,930
That is what got us here
in the first place.

81
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,666
Vinnie, for the love of god,
this is not for us.

82
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,001
All right,
well what is for us?

83
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:19,340
- right now there is nothing.
- nothing?

84
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,709
Nothing.
You're in movie jail.

85
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,010
How do I get out?
What do I have to do?

86
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,378
You just do what
you've been doing.

87
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,381
- you just sit tight.
You wait.
- wait for what?

88
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,751
<i>- for the stench from
"medellin" to disappear.
- how long's that gonna take?</i>

89
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,087
How long did it take
for the air to clear
from fucking chernobyl?

90
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:35,122
What do you want us to do?
You want us to sit around
and do nothing?

91
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,124
I thought you
weren't gonna talk.
But since you are, yes.

92
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,692
You should sit around
and do nothing.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,061
Or maybe go
to Vinnie's supersecret
hideaway in Mexico

94
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,064
And come back
when you're tan or tall,
whichever comes first.

95
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:46,734
- Ari.
- Vinnie, listen to me.

96
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,236
Listen.

97
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:51,105
We need to rebuild you.

98
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,607
All right?  We've got to
start over from scratch.

99
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:55,576
I will decide when
the moment is right.

100
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,179
And then we will pounce
on a greenlit studio picture

101
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:02,616
With an a-list director,
'cause that is what we need.

102
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,853
Listen, this is what I do.
Let me be heard this time.

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,556
I swear to god you will
come back stronger than ever.

104
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,625
Like lance armstrong,

105
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,560
But with two balls.

106
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,232
Hard to believe this
is where I'm at, huh?

107
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,434
Hard to believe
we're gonna sit around on
our asses and do nothing.

108
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:23,671
There are other things
an actor can do besides
waiting around for his agent.

109
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,839
Like what, Drama?
Somebody's got to hire
him to act.

110
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,676
Nobody hired Drama when he
was doing those scenes on
the 3rd street promenade.

111
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:31,111
I didn't do scenes
on the promenade, jerkoff.

112
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,347
The santa monica pier once,
and I got paid for that.

113
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,115
So what do you think
I can do, Johnny?

114
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,784
Well, you can work on
your body for one.

115
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:38,485
My body?
What's wrong
with my body?

116
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,187
Don't get sensitive, bro.

117
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:43,290
Let's face it,
you'd have a tough time
landing the lead in "300."

118
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:44,992
What do you think
of this, Turtle?

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,528
- I liked "300."
- you don't like
my body either?

120
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,430
Vin, your body is just fine.

121
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:52,299
But I have often thought
if we put your face on
russell crowe's body

122
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,501
We'd have the terminator
of acting.

123
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,237
You've thought about Vince's
face on russell crowe's body?
That's disturbing.

124
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,306
I'm actually feeling
insecure now.

125
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,175
<i>- I wanted to talk to
you about that script.
- you heard Ari.</i>

126
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:03,844
We need a studio movie.
We're gonna listen
to him this time.

127
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm talking about the writers.
I'm thinking maybe I should
sign them.

128
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,981
Yeah, give you three out-
of-work clients to work with.

129
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:10,517
Sorry, Vin.
I'm really just making fun
of his other clients.

130
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,486
I actually think
it's a good idea.
Worst case,

131
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,621
- we'll have a nice management
business to feed us.
- exactly.

132
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,758
Don't look now,
but it's justine chapin.

133
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,994
Oh, maybe we can
get her to feed us.

134
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,298
- justine!
- Vince.

135
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,500
Hi!

136
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,469
How have you been?
How's life?

137
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,503
Life's amazing.
You?

138
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,705
( laughs )
sorry.

139
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,207
God, you look incredible.

140
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:34,775
You too.
What are you doing in town?

141
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,643
Shooting a video
for my new album.

142
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,879
New album.
That's awesome.

143
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,048
- can't wait to hear it.
- don't make fun.

144
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:44,251
I know my music
isn't really your thing.
But this is way different.

145
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,186
- it's very sophisticated.
- I'm sure.

146
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,822
I've grown up.
I'm doing duets
with tony bennett.

147
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,859
- I love tony bennett.
- he's amazing.

148
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,927
We're finishing the video
today and having a wrap party.

149
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,863
- you guys should come.
- I got a girlfriend.

150
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,532
You should come, Vince.

151
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,335
Well, I'm off today,
so why not?

152
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:03,170
Okay, I'll text you
the address.

153
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,471
- great.
- see you.

154
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,807
- yeah, bye.
- see you.

155
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,209
Fuck the gym.
My body's fine.

156
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,480
- aw, fuck!  What the--
- that's all right.

157
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:15,149
What's the matter
with you today, buddy?

158
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,117
Focus is off.

159
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,319
What's the problem?
You got marital woes?

160
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,021
No, client trouble.

161
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,290
You need me to hunt down
some commissions for you?

162
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:25,059
It's Vinnie Chase.
There are no commissions.

163
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,593
Oh, man.

164
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,196
Screened "medellin" last night.
Fell asleep halfway through.

165
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,700
Don't worry about Vinnie, Ari.
It's all good.

166
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,503
I'm making so much money
you're gonna be all right,
buddy.

167
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,810
Jesus, come on.
That's a nice shot.

168
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,378
I'm going again.

169
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,914
Hit until you're happy.
It's your club.

170
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,652
You know what?
I love this kid
the way I love you.

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,721
He comes into my office today,
he's got four scripts

172
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,322
That he wants to do,
none of which he can get.

173
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,757
I don't know what
to say to him.

174
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,225
You were always good
at lying off the cuff.

175
00:08:58,293 --> 00:08:59,927
What are you talking about?
I never lied to you.

176
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,762
What about when
you told me you liked
"the truth about charlie"?

177
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,465
- what is "the truth
about charlie"?
- exactly.

178
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,700
- hit e ball, please.
- look where we are now, baby.

179
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,736
What about Vinnie?
Think he's gonna be all right?

180
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,839
50-50.

181
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:16,610
Fucking rusty cunt bucket!

182
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,078
- fuck!
- I wasn't laughing.

183
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,347
- fuck!
- ( laughing )

184
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,316
- ( phone ringing )
- ( gunshots )

185
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,886
Bullets and bitches,
l.B. Here.

186
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,421
I'm looking for
nick or lawrence.

187
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:30,424
L.B. Stands for
lawrence, hot dog.
Is there a problem?

188
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,060
No, my name is Eric murphy.
I'm a talent manager
from los angeles.

189
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:34,895
<i>I represent Vincent Chase.</i>

190
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:37,164
You guys sent me your script.
I'd love to talk to you
about it.

191
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:39,667
Please don't tell me this
is one of them prank shows.
We got guns here.

192
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,669
No prank, l.B.
I loved your script.

193
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,270
<i>Holy fuck!
I'm freakin'!</i>

194
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:46,040
I'm fuh-fuckin' freakin'.
Are you serious?

195
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:48,809
Oh, damn.
Vincent Chase wants
to do our movie.

196
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:51,779
No, actually I wanted
to talk to you guys about
representation.

197
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,382
I'd better get nick.

198
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,151
Look, how about I come out
there and see you guys?

199
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,619
All right.
Yeah, I guess.

200
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,821
I guess
that'd be all right.

201
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,724
How do you know she's not
a virgin anymore, Turtle?

202
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,493
It's been all over the papers.
Why do you think her last
few albums haven't sold?

203
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,429
I should not
be here right now.

204
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,097
You know I had a thing
for this girl back
in the day.

205
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,700
- but you never closed.
- I wasn't gonna be her first.

206
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,169
I know your motto,
never be the first,
never be the last.

207
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,370
Could you guys
just take me home?

208
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:17,705
- no.
- shut up.

209
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,940
- maybe I'll call a cab.
- what is the problem?

210
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,609
The problem is when I gave
jaq my itinerary

211
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:25,179
I didn't account on time
being spent with non-virgins.

212
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,915
It's almost 10:00 in France.
I'm supposed to be home

213
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:29,483
So I can tuck her in
on the computer.

214
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,385
If not, she's gonna freak.

215
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:33,887
Johnny, why do you want
to be in a relationship
with someone this crazy?

216
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,390
Obsession is a huge
turn on to me, bro.

217
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:39,760
<i>( soft music playing )</i>

218
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,938
( singing )

219
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,784
You are so gonna
bang this girl.

220
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,987
She can be real trouble
for me, I'm telling you.

221
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,390
If you and Drama both
have girlfriends, I'm gonna
shoot myself.

222
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:11,792
I hope I have a girlfriend
after tonight.

223
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,594
I'm gonna go call her.

224
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:16,096
<i>( justine singing )</i>

225
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:29,143
( phone ringing )

226
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,944
- hello.
- hey, babe.

227
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:34,248
Hello, Johnny.
Are you ready to video?

228
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,417
No, my stupid
internet's down.

229
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:38,118
Modern technology sucks.

230
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,087
Did you try
resetting the modem?

231
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:41,789
<i>Yeah, like three times.
No go.</i>

232
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,658
I'm sorry if I let you
down tonight.

233
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,727
You didn't let me down.

234
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,796
But I do like to see you.

235
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,864
I like to see
you too, baby.

236
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,400
Are you listening
to tony bennett?

237
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,937
Uh, yeah.

238
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,806
I was just playing some cds.

239
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,275
I love tony bennett.

240
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,743
Oh yeah?
So do I.

241
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,611
I didn't know you
loved tony bennett.

242
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,514
I guess we still have
some things left to uncover
about each other, huh?

243
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:12,786
Yeah, I guess so.

244
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,171
So let me try to
understand something.

245
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,774
You represent Vincent Chase,
you want to represent us,

246
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:37,511
We want Vincent Chase but you
can't get us Vincent Chase.

247
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:40,414
- well, Vince is looking to do
a studio movie right now.
- oh, he is?

248
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,050
- so what can you get us?
- I think I can get you
a job writing.

249
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:46,520
Why do we need a job when
we spent three years of our
lives writing the script?

250
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:48,489
Well, maybe if it's
a real writing job--

251
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:50,124
Yeah, l.B., wait.
Hold on for a second.

252
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:51,792
L.B. Gets a little excited
by the appearance

253
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,161
Of a fancy car
and nice clothes.
No offense.

254
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:56,397
This script has our life's
blood dripped into it.

255
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:58,399
As your manager, nick--

256
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,401
As the manager
of Vincent Chase

257
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,269
Who can't get us
Vincent Chase,

258
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,172
Who do you manage
that you can get for us?

259
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,307
You got shia labeouf?

260
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,811
Listen, managers don't
necessarily get you stars
for your movies, nick.

261
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,746
<i>What I can do,
what I will do,</i>

262
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,615
Is passionately sell you
guys to the town

263
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,817
So that people will
pay you lots of money

264
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,752
To do what you did
so well on this script.

265
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,055
I mean, let me do that.
Come on, guys.

266
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,657
What do I have to do to
prove to you that I'm the one
that can change your lives?

267
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,993
Sell the script--
"nine brave souls."

268
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,295
That's what you can do.

269
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,901
- ( party music playing )
- ( people chatting )

270
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:44,878
- just calm down.
- I can't calm down, Turtle.

271
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,747
I never should have
lied to her.

272
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:48,515
Jaq knows me too well.

273
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,984
It's like the tone of my voice
is her own truth serum.

274
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,854
Drama, you're not
doing anything wrong
so stop worrying about it.

275
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:57,358
I appreciate the advice,
Turtle, but you don't
understand crazy broads

276
00:13:57,425 --> 00:14:00,194
'cause nobody's ever
been attracted enough
to you to act psycho.

277
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:05,332
I'm gonna call her back
and try and gauge her
temperature.

278
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,867
Good luck with that.

279
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:09,203
You guys have
an amazing chemistry.

280
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,573
Wow, this is like a mutual
admiration society.

281
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,608
- loved "aquaman."
- thank you.

282
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:17,144
I haven't got a chance
to see the suel yet.

283
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:19,446
Don't worry, I'm not in it.
Jake gyllenhaal is.

284
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,281
Well, I guess
you had your reasons.

285
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,250
Anyway, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

286
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,918
- thank you very much.
- thank you.

287
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:27,454
And, sweetheart,
I'll see you in a bit.

288
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:29,089
Okay.

289
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,893
- isn't he awesome?
- yeah, he is.

290
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,396
- I have someone else
I would like you to meet.
- oh yeah?

291
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,931
Yes.  See the pink
dress over there with
the incredible legs?

292
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:41,301
<i>- yeah.
- she's so in love with you
and she's amazing.</i>

293
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,970
- yeah?
- yeah.

294
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,538
I'm gonna go get her.
Be right back.

295
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,642
What's going on?

296
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,512
I'm t sure,
but I think I'm being
pawned off.

297
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,281
- get out of here.
- something very off
about today.

298
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,217
She's not answering.
I'm freaking out.
She must be pissed.

299
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,819
She must be sleeping.

300
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,854
I just talked to her
10 minutes agojurtle.

301
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:03,190
Baby jaq don't
fall asleep that fast.

302
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:05,325
Maybe she's on the can
taking a shit.

303
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:08,462
Yeah, let's hope so.

304
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:10,330
I'll call her back in 10.

305
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,168
Vince, michella.
Michella, Vince.

306
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,704
- y.
- hi.

307
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:22,076
So, justine, you have
any other spare friends
lying around for me?

308
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,882
E's on the phone.

309
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,384
Why?

310
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:32,920
I don't know,
but he sounds enthusiastic.

311
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,358
- what?
- jesus, be less friendly.

312
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,626
If you have business
to discuss, start talking, e.

313
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,395
I want to talk to you about
that script I found.

314
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:42,796
<i>What did I tell you
this morning?</i>

315
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:44,898
Relax, Ari.
I'm not calling about Vince.

316
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,101
- I want to sign the writers.
- why would I care?

317
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,670
Because I want to sell
their script.  I need an agent
to help me do that.

318
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,638
Try the yellow pages.

319
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,241
Come on, Ari.
I'm calling you as a friend,
all right?

320
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,311
I need your help.
It's a really good script.
Can you help me?

321
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,413
Yes I can, e.
Lloyd.

322
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:01,515
Get the number
for ucla extension

323
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,019
<i>So Eric can take
a course to finally learn
how the movie business works.</i>

324
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,788
- you won't help me, Ari?
- we share one client, e.

325
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,556
We're never gonna
share two.

326
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,660
Here you go.

327
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:16,296
So how long have you
been a dancer?

328
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:19,099
Since I was three.
So like 19 years.

329
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,268
I thought you said
you were 27.

330
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:23,237
So?

331
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,172
Still no answer.
I don't know what to do.

332
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,408
- keep trying.
- who's not answering?

333
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,643
My girlfriend.
She's pissed at me.

334
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,745
- why, what did you do?
- I lied to her.

335
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,947
I said I was home
when I was at a party.

336
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,150
But she has no way
of knowing that he lied.

337
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,152
But it's night in paris
and she's not answering

338
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:39,586
Her phone
so he's freaking out.

339
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,622
This is unreal.
And it's her fault.

340
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,024
Because if she wasn't
so fucking possessive
I wouldn't have to lie to her.

341
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,527
- maybe she's sleeping.
- that's what I said.

342
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:49,063
Well, you're both wrong
'cause the ring would have
woke her up.

343
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,131
So either she's pissed
and not answering

344
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:52,933
Or she's being held captive.

345
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,435
There's a third choice.

346
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,170
- what's that?
- she's out.

347
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:59,239
- out where?
- maybe a party.
You are.

348
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,241
You think my girl
would lie to me?

349
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,311
I told my boyfriend I was
at an audition today.

350
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,913
He gets really upset
when I'm out.

351
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,749
I'm calling her back.

352
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,818
( sighs )

353
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,587
So with all that dancing,

354
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:16,290
Can you do any crazy shit
like put your legs behind
you head?

355
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:18,292
I told you
I have a boyfriend.

356
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,061
You did.
But you also said
you lie to him.

357
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,997
So maybe you could tell him
that we didn't fuck today.

358
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:31,739
Baby, it's me again.

359
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,574
I'd like to think
you're sleeping,

360
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,509
But nobody could
sleep through this.

361
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,778
( yelling )
where the fuck are you?!

362
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:39,847
Pick up the fucking phone!

363
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:43,450
Didn't his mother ever tell
him not to speak like that?

364
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,520
I remember the first time
you and justine went out.

365
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:49,656
- I was still living in ohio
and I was so jealous.
- oh yeah?

366
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:52,726
I've had a crush on you
since you did that
mentos commercial.

367
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,195
Oh, wow, that was
a long time ago, huh?

368
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,864
I should get
some extra credit

369
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:58,932
For liking you even before
you were a giant movie star.

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,368
Yes, you should.

371
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:04,972
Uh, listen, michelle,

372
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,273
Would you excuse me
for a second?

373
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:07,608
I just have to make
a quick phone call.

374
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:09,643
- yeah, sure.
But, Vince.
- yeah?

375
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:11,578
- it's michella.
- oh.

376
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,847
But you can call me michelle
if you like that better.

377
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,549
I'll be right back.

378
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,788
Hey, Lloyd, is Ari there?
I need to talk to him.

379
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,923
Ari's in a screening right now.
Is everything okay?

380
00:18:22,991 --> 00:18:26,093
Actually, no it's not.
Can you get him out?

381
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:29,363
Tell him I'll be
there in 10 minutes.
I really need to talk.

382
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,737
<i>( asian music playing
onscreen )</i>

383
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,648
( whispering )
Vince is gonna be here
in 10 minutes.

384
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,083
Jesus!

385
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:51,385
What do you want to do?

386
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,822
I can't walk out of here
'cause the director is
sitting right behind me.

387
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,157
So what should I do?

388
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,864
Pull the plug
on the projector.

389
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,833
- are you serious?
- yeah, go.

390
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,875
<i>( music stops )</i>

391
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:20,080
What the hell?

392
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,050
Can we fix this fucking
projector already?

393
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,085
I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

394
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm gonna hit
the bathroom real quick.

395
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:30,257
Could someone fix
the fucking projector?

396
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,860
- so what did he say
the problem is?
- he didn't.

397
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,396
But if I had to guess
I'd say you didn't make
him very happy this morning.

398
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,964
Like it's my fault.

399
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,566
( phone ringing )

400
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:44,905
<i>- you calling to apologize?
- I'm calling to tell you</i>

401
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,107
<i>That I blame you
for every bad thing that's
ever happened to Vince,</i>

402
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:50,177
And every bad thing
that ever could happen to him
for the rest of his life.

403
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:53,013
You're the unfucking
lucky charm.  You hear me?

404
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,282
<i>You should never utter
the words "I've found
a good script"</i>

405
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:57,851
'cause you have no idea
what a good fucking script
looks like.

406
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,386
Live with that.

407
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:04,024
Mr. Murphy,
miss daniels will see you now.

408
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:08,495
Thank you.

409
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,567
Well, this is a surprise.

410
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:16,503
How could you
do this to me?

411
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,772
Six months I've been
nothing but faithful.

412
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,276
Do you have any idea
how much pussy is thrown
at me day and night?

413
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:25,079
And I pass on all of it.
For what?

414
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:27,448
So you could run around
fucking every french faggot

415
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:28,949
That pays you a compliment?

416
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,684
<i>- Johnny?
- baby?</i>

417
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,286
Where the fuck
have you been?

418
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,489
I was at the hospital.
My friend had a car accident.

419
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:37,558
- what friend?
- lily.

420
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,959
Hi, Johnny.

421
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,862
Oh, hey, lily.

422
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,498
<i>- how are you doing?
- I've been better.  You?</i>

423
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,966
<i>I'm okay.
I'm okay.</i>

424
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,402
Jaq, are you okay?

425
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:51,538
No, Johnny,
I'm not okay.

426
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,974
I knew you were a little
crazy when you said

427
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,510
We needed to get on
the computer every night,

428
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:59,747
But I had to call the police
on my last boyfriend.

429
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:02,149
<i>- look, baby--
- I don't want to have
to call the police on you.</i>

430
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,851
<i>- goodbye, Johnny.
- wait wait wait wait!</i>

431
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,386
Wait, jaq!
Jaq!

432
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,623
Baby.

433
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:15,362
So why aren't you keeping
this for Vince?

434
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,731
Ari only wants Vince
to do a go studio movie.

435
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,566
- do you agree?
- yeah.

436
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:21,635
I mean, if he can get one.
What do you think?

437
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,271
I think we don't work
together anymore, Eric.

438
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:26,774
But if this script is
as good as you say it is

439
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:28,776
Seems like Vince
could use it.

440
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:32,246
On the other hand,
you are one more bad choice
away from ruining his career.

441
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:33,814
Thanks.

442
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:35,549
So did Ari read it?

443
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,884
Nope.

444
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,819
So what makes you
think I will?

445
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,754
You have a better work ethic.

446
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,556
Look at that.
See?  You almost smiled.

447
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,125
<i>Now look,
it's really good.</i>

448
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,394
I promise you I wouldn't waste
your time if it wasn't.

449
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,030
Just read 10 pages
of it and you'll be
hooked, guaranteed.

450
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,599
- please.
- leave it, I'll read five.

451
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,713
He's here.  He's here.
Vince is here.

452
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,581
What, are you speedballing
fairy dust?

453
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,683
<i>Go out there
and greet him like a man.</i>

454
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:15,255
Vinnie.  There he is.
How you doing, baby?

455
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:17,725
To be honest, Ari,
not great.

456
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,694
I haven't said that
very many times in my life.

457
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:22,730
- what's wrong?
- I don't know.

458
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:25,599
I came back from Mexico
motivated, ready to work

459
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,969
And correct me if I'm wrong,
you basically said that I can't.

460
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:31,405
- no no no, what I said was--
- I know what you said.

461
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,774
I just want to know
what it means.

462
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:36,110
Do you really have
a plan, Ari?  Really?

463
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,746
You always said you were
going to be the guy to give
it to me straight, so come on.

464
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:41,181
Give it to me straight.
Am I gonna be okay?

465
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:43,450
I don't know.

466
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:48,956
I mean, one bad movie
and this is what happens?

467
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,291
I mean, was I really
that awful?

468
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:56,497
Straight up, Vinnie,
the movie was awful.

469
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:58,565
And yes,
you were awful in it.

470
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:01,268
<i>But you know what?
One bad movie can be overcome.</i>

471
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,804
Look at colin farrell.
He's overcome dozens of them

472
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:06,807
Because the perception of him
is he's a movie star.

473
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:09,443
- and what's
the perception of me?
- that you don't give a fuck.

474
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:13,080
You refuse to play the game.
You refuse to be a part
of the process.

475
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,816
Look, the great ones,
even if they don't care,

476
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,518
They pretend they do.

477
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,022
Do you think
I'm a good actor, Ari?

478
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:26,226
I did not sign you
in the first place 'cause
I thought you could act.

479
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,629
I signed you because I thought
you were a movie star.

480
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:32,032
And you haven't acted
like one in a long time.

481
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,668
I'm ready to play
the game, Ari.

482
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:36,337
Whatever you say.

483
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,439
- that's a good start.
- but I'm not willing to wait.

484
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:40,474
I want you to send me
in to every person

485
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,543
In this town who's
willing to meet me.

486
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:43,877
I don't care
if it wastes my time,

487
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:45,913
I will charm the fuck
out of every last one of them.

488
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:47,815
<i>Filmmakers,
studio execs</i>

489
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,783
All of them,
I will change the perception.

490
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,652
I like the fire.

491
00:23:57,926 --> 00:24:00,027
You don't believe
I'm a good actor?

492
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:02,396
It remains to be seen.

493
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:04,965
But, Vin, I'm starting
to believe

494
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,467
That you're
a movie star again.

495
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,502
And you know what?

496
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,137
This town loves a comeback.

497
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,072
And since britney
fucked hers up,

498
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,208
It's all you!

499
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,114
<i>Thanks, bud.</i>

500
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:24,485
<i>Photographer:
hey, Vinnie, over here.</i>

501
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:27,521
- yo, Vin, we're leaving.
- give me two minutes.

502
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:29,390
I'll be right back.

503
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:34,762
Where did you go?
I've been waiting.

504
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:36,697
I'm sorri'll be right b.

505
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:41,568
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

506
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,771
<i>- where are you going?
- Vince, what?</i>

507
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:47,241
Why did you invite me here
if you were just going to
pawn me off on your friend?

508
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,810
- I thought you'd like her.
- I like you.

509
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:53,180
Vince, if I fuck you

510
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:55,015
Then I'll want to be
your girlfriend.

511
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,217
And I don't want to be in
a relationship right now.

512
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:59,820
So last time I saw you,
you were too innocent.
Now you're too slutty?

513
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:02,122
- now I'm having fun.
- so we'll have fun.

514
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,892
Keep it casual.
Get serious in the future.

515
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,894
And if we fuck up any chance
of having a future?

516
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:08,962
I'll risk it if you will.

517
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:13,133
How long are we just gonna
sit here for?

518
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,802
Till Vince comes out.

519
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,770
Well, I'm getting
really bored

520
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:18,539
And it's giving me
time to think.

521
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:20,274
It's not a good thing
for you.

522
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:23,911
I understand.
And try not to take
this as an insult,

523
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:26,747
But as gorgeous as you are,
I'd never ditch Vince for you.

524
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:29,750
Well, I like your loyalty.

525
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:31,585
Yeah?
How much?

526
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:36,757
Jesus Christ, Drama.
Where the hell have you been?

527
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,960
I've been drinking.

528
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,762
You okay?

529
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,098
( groans )

530
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,367
Do I look okay?

531
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:51,038
- there's Vince.
- well, look at this.

532
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,010
Let's roll.

533
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,611
<i>( car starts )</i>

534
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,513
- hey, Johnny.
- hey.

535
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:06,320
You guys really kind of
like each other, huh?

536
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,522
Uh, maybe.

537
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,624
That's great.

538
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:13,027
That's just fucking great.
