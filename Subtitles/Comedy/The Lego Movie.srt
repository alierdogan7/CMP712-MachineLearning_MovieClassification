to locate the fugitive...

529
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,990

every other face in our database.

530

00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,999
Okay, have Bad Cop meet
me in my office...

532
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,841
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.

are through the roof, sir.

Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher!

Perfect. Whoo!

run a little bit...

Don't be so serious.

561
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,762
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

562
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,663
Have I ever shown you
my relic collection?

563
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,936
Nope. I don't think you have.

564

Nobody knows where
this stuff comes from.

This one...

566
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,611
is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

567
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,337
I hear it's super
painful to take off.

568

- Well, um...

569

can ruin my plans.

577

(CHUCKLING) The one thing that
I asked you to take care of.

578
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,967
That's super frustrating.

579
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,928
It makes me just wanna
pick up whoever...

580
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,968
is standing closest to me...

581
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,932

found the Piece of Resistance.

what's around you...

- Great.

in your mind, my liege.

00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,046
See? He can't do it. He will
never be a MasterBuilder.

732
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,586
Of course not. Not if you
keep telling him he can't.

733
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,334

of activity here.

original thought. In his life.

744

Ha, ha. That's not true.

745
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,912
For instance, one time
I wanted to have...

746
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,122
a bunch of my friends
over to watch TV...

747
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,790
Not unlike this TV that
just showed up magically.

748
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,878
And not everybody can
fit on my one couch...

749
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,202
and I thought to myself:

750
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,294
"What if there was such a
thing as a bunk bed...

751
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,542
but as a couch?"

double-decker couch.

together and be buddies!

00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,088
That is literally the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

755
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,644
Please, Wyldstyle,
let me handle this.

756
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,730
That idea is just the worst.

757
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,691
There must be something
around here...

758
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,105
that proves his potential.

759
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,774
If The Man Upstairs chose
him to be The Special...

760
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,146
there must be a reason.

761
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,797
- EMMET: Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

762
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,549
He doesn't even know
about The Man Upstairs.

763
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,027
EMMET: Does he have, like,
super-gross hands...

764
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,386

out of big pink sausages?

I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.

771
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,375
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

772
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,673
Emmet, you had a vision.

I did?

774
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,430

training themselves to clear
their minds enough...

776
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,970
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

777
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,894
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

778
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,144
that there is nothing in it to
clear away in the first place.

With proper training...

780
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,147

00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,272
The walls are crying!

1222
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,609
We're coming apart at the seams!

00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,315

1226
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,522
Emmet!

1227
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,615
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!

Deep breath, everybod...!

1230
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,433
Micro-managers, what's
going on down there?

1231
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,264
MICRO-MANAGER:
Scanning submarine wreckage.

1232
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,439
No survivors detected.

1233
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,684
Scuba cops, dredge the
entire ocean if you have to.

1234
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,856
We have got to find that Piece.

1235
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,070
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...

1236
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,565
and give him the good news.

1237
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,533
The Special is no more.

1238
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,202
BUSINESS: Hello, everybody!

1239
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,327
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.

1240
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,873
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

1241
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,962
Greetings, all!

1242
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,458
Welcome to my Think Tank.

1243
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,797
MASTERBUILDERS: Help us!

1244
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,152
All the MasterBuilders you've
captured over the years...

1245
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,279
you've brought them here.

1246
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,929
You're a very perceptive
person, Superman.

1247
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,474
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.

1248
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,720
Robots!

1249
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,268
No! No! Grr!

(SCREAMING)

1251
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,062
Can't get much worse than this.

1252
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,485
- GREEN LANTERN: Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.

1253
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,653
It's Green Lantern.

1254
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,994
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?

1255
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,864
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?

1256
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where is The Special?

1257
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,625
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.

1258
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,622
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?

1259
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,502
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.

1260
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,722
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.

1261
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,434
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.

1262
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,970
Wait, hold on.

1263
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,096
A double-decker couch?

1264
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:04,892
Yes, sir.

1265
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,064
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?

1266
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,526
That's weird.

1267
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,289
If you're sitting in
the top middle...

1268
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,797
how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

1269
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,276
<i>If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...</i>

1270
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:20,154
<i>are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?</i>

1271
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,156
<i>Who's gonna want to
sit on the bottom?</i>

1272
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,658
<i>It is literally...</i>

1273
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,912
<i>the most useless idea
I have ever heard.</i>

1274
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,669
(BENNY CHUCKLES)

1275
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,133
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!

1276
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,548
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1277
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,512
It wasn't totally
pointless after all.

1278
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,598
It's the one thing
that stayed together.

1279
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,592
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1280
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,641
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

1281
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,106
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

1282
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,224
I mean, it's not like a
big gigantic ship...

1283
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,852
is gonna come out of
nowhere and save us...

1284
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,193
My gosh!

1285
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,366
Avast, mateys!

1286
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,331
Metal Beard, I thought you
said we were a lost cause!

1287
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:09,578
Ye are!

1288
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,705
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1289
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,175
circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?

1290
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,761
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

1291
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,425
So why did you come back?

1292
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,049
This be-doubled land couch.

1293
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,975
I watched Lord Business'
forces completely overlook it.

1294
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,349
Which means we need
more ideas like it!

1295
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,269
Oh, thank you.

1296
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,439
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1297
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,564
that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.

1298
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,407
Oh. Thank you.

1299
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,198
VITRUVIUS:
So, Special, what do we do?

1300
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,282
Uh...

1301
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,541
Well...

1302
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,917
what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?

1303
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,883
Build a spaceship?

1304
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,639
Kill a chicken?

1305
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,632
Marry a marshmallow.

1306
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,466
Why, this:

1307
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,212
<i>(SINGING) How you gonna
keep 'em down on the farm?</i>

1308
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,341
No! It's follow the instructions.

1309

(ALL GROAN)

1310
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,037
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.

1311
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,099
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1312
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,026
Guys, you're all so
talented and imaginative.

1313
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,605
But you can't work
together as a team.

1314
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,732
I'm just a construction worker.

1315
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,953
But when I had a plan and we
were all working together...

1316
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,743
I mean, we could
build a skyscraper.

1317
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,585
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1318
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,832
Just imagine what could
happen if you did that.

1319
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,213
You could save the universe.

1320
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,384
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1321
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:43,634
Really?

1322
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,179
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1323
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,801
Okay.

1324
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,764
Somebody get me some markers...

1325
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,601
some construction paper...

1326
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,439
and some glitter glue!

1327
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,193
I call this:

1328
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,537
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...

1329
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,429
put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...

1330
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,998
...and save the world."

1331
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,413
I've built a hundred just
like them back in the city.

1332
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,371
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.

1333
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,543
I can get us anywhere.

1334
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,005
How will we get inside?

1335
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,833
In a spaceship.

1336
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,677
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1337
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,048
No, they're expecting
us to show up...

1338
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:28,517
in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1339
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,034
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1340
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,183
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1341
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,103
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

1342
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,523
So not the special spaceship that I'm
building for all of you right now?

1343
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,146
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1344
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,274
Ooh, you're really letting the
oxygen out of my tank here.

1345
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,690
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions...

1346
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,320
this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1347
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,530
We don't have that part.

1348
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,656
Maybe we could find one!

1349
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,432
What do you think, a spaceship is
just gonna appear out of the blue?

1350
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,625
Are you kidding me?

1351
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,960
The same thing!

1352
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:01,508
- Chewie!
- Mm!

1353
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,128
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!

1354
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,051
This hyperdrive keeps
malfunctioning...

1355
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,094
<i>taking us to loser
systems like this.</i>

1356
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,887
Captain Solo, we must go.

1357
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,076
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.

1358
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,554
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1359
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,431
Now hold on, Han.

1360
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,104
This might be the right
galaxy after all.

1361
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,648
Because I see a heavenly body.

1362
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,398
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1363
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,991
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!

1364
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,156
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!

1365
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,450
If he's a cool dude like you.

1366
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,817
You're trying to bail on us!

1367
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,656
I'm not trying to bail!

1368
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,658
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!

1369
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,350
That thing is filled
with bon vivants.

1370
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,293
You speak French now?

1371
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,665
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...

1372
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,291
I need to feel free to party...

1373
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,483
with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.

1374
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,085
What?

1375
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,052
Babe!

1376
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,097
I will text you.

1377
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,559
LANDO: Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?

1378
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,812
It's party time!

1379
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:57,939
Babe?

1380
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,689
(CRYING)

1381
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,198
Wyldstyle, you're such
an amazing person.

1382
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,449
And, you know, if Batman can't
see that, then he's just...

1383
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:18,703
Well, he's just as
blind as a guy...

1384
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,835
whose eyes stopped working.

1385
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,628
And I'm gonna tell you something:

1386
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,219
Batman is the worst
person I've ever met.

1387
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,213
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.

1388
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,090
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.

1389
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,591
You really had me there!

1390
