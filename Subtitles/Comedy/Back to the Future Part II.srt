00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,838
Yeah, I have.

205
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,993
Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

- Clint who?
- Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

207

You have to wear the boots.

208
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,313
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

209
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,516
You shouldn't be wearing them
here in 1955.

MARTY: Hoverboard.
DOC: All right.

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,119
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

217
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,072
It's still the safest plan.

218
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,913
We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,195
...or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

220

Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

224
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,553
There's a small cave over there which will be
a good place to hide the time vehicle.

are warmed up.
