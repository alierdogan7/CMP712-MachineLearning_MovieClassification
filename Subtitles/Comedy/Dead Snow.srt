1
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:32,170
DEAD SNOW

2
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:05,302
Hey. Listen to this.

3
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,914
It says that a man was skiing in the mountain wilds.

4
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,840
It actually says "mountain wilds".

5
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,089
In the middle of two moutain tops, he starts
yelling for his dog.

6
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:20,392
- "Avalance!"
- Not very clever...

7
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:24,766
When he was found two days later he had dug
himself 6 meters... Downwards.

8
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,862
- What?
- That's pretty normal actually, -

9
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:33,794
- because if you're taken by an avalanche you get
so disoriented that you won't know which way is up.

10
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:36,848
So many starts digging the wrong way.

11
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,934
- I would easily find the right way.
- You should just spit!

12
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,894
Have no one been in the military?

13
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:48,697
If you're stuck under the snow after an avalance,
you should spit to find out which way to dig.

14
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,647
Just lie there and slobber on yourself?

15
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,150
- Slobber?
- It means drooling.

16
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,106
- Dribble.
- Dribble.

17
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,486
You owe me a coke.

18
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:02,816
The spit will run downwards, so you
just dig the opposite way.

19
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:08,050
- Gravity, as easy as that.
- Can you remember stuff from the military?

20
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,972
I can only remember my duty number...

21
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:12,083
69...

22
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:16,454
- Speaking of 69 Martin...
- No thanks. Not interested.

23
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,879
Oh, darn it.

24
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,328
- I mean of course Hanna's cousin.
- Kris?

25
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,501
- Yeah, is she single?
- She is very single. I don't know her, but...

26
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,412
Hanna says she is...

27
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,640
Very single.

28
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:35,166
Do you think there's any chance to slam it
in her number two?

29
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,809
If you spit first.

30
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:47,543
- Where do you think Sara is now?
- I don't know. She'll probably be there tonight or tomorrow.

31
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,490
I don't understand why she botheres taking the
trip over those mountains.

32
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,772
So, tell me about the boys that are coming.

33
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,771
Ok. Martin, which is the best looking one...

34
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:05,702
- Is mine.
- How did it turn out with him?

35
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:10,067
- Will he finish the studies?
- I'm not sure. Don't think he is either.

36
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,947
It's not exactly optimal to be a medical
student and still afraid of blood.

37
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:17,328
- Poor Martin.
- Martin is scared of blood, and wants to be a doctor?

38
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:19,553
- Seriously?
- Yes.

39
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:26,758
And then Vegard. He's the one who's with Sara.
And then there's Erlend.

40
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,267
The worlds biggest movie geek.

41
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:34,173
And Roy, the horniest boy north of the polar circle.

42
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,084
- He is single, you can get him.
- Thanks. Nice.

43
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,164
How does it feel to be on the loser team?

44
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:59,652
That overtaking earlier...

45
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:21,369
Ok. Just follow the scooter trail.
It will only take 45 minutes.

46
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:28,039
When you arrive, I will have unpacked most of
the luggage and heated the cabin.

47
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,183
- Is there cell phone reception there?
- No, we lost that half an hour ago.

48
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,185
Where am I then supposed to call and breathe
heavily in the mike?

49
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,705
The emergency number.

50
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,286
Take care.

51
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:51,275
Mile after mile, after mile!

52
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,438
Hold on a second.

53
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,592
I have a question. How many movies begins with a group
of friends going on a trip without cell phone reception?

54
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:34,934
- Friday the 13th.
- They don't have reception because they don't have cell phones.

55
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:39,250
- Evil Dead 1 and 2.
- Yes, sort of. Except that many counts the sequel -

56
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,502
- as a remake with higher budget.

57
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:48,062
- New rule. No movie talk for an hour.
- Good suggestion.

58
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:55,966
It's for your own good Erlend. If you want to dip
your balls this weekend, you should stop the nerd alert.

59
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:02,218
And then you have April Fool's Day from... 1984 I think.

60
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,597
Now that's a classic.

61
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:09,983
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

62
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,594
Let's go.

63
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:08,496
Damn, I'm so warm now.

64
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:12,131
It's beautiful here.

65
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:16,933
- So, what should we do?
- Watch a movie?

66
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:21,366
- We unpack and get acquainted.
- I have a better idea...

67
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,225
Left foot on green.

68
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,706
You already have it on green.

69
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,071
Why do we even play this game?

70
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:09,386
Because Hollywood told us that is
a great fun.

71
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:12,201
Right foot on red.

72
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:16,450
It has to be the most boring game...
That ever...

73
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,239
- No joking?
- Of course.

74
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:34,350
- One more time?
- Let me show you sedation from the Middle Ages. Lay down.

75
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:38,389
- What are you doing?
- Like that. Put your arms behind... There.

76
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,332
- You're sitting on my hands.
- It's how it works.

77
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,906
- Now close your eyes.
- No.

78
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,666
- Close your eyes.
- No, I'm not closing them.

79
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,950
Don't... Martin, Stop.
Quit it...

80
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:51,948
Just relax.

81
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:02,070
- Martin!
- Cut it out!

82
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,776
- I was only kidding.
- Why do you do that, I get claustrophobic.

83
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,530
I can't breathe.

84
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,611
- Sorry. Look now.
- No.

85
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,694
- How does that work?
- Get some beer.

86
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,487
- What?
- Beer. Beer, beer.

87
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:03,034
Beer, beer, beer.

88
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,412
Hello?

89
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,547
Hello?

90
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,407
- There's someone there.
- Hm?

91
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,403
- I saw someone.
- It's probably Sara.

92
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,768
- Not Sara...
- Are you sure it wasn't an elk?

93
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,847
I can damn well see the difference between a
human and an elk.

94
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:51,267
I don't see anything.

95
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,876
There's nothing here. Vegard was right, it
was probably just an animal.

96
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:02,591
Typical women. They get frightened
by everything.

97
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,930
Is it possible to get a cup of coffee here?

98
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:47,350
Who made the coffee?

99
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:52,350
Ecological...

100
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,575
- Didn't it taste good?
- No, it didn't.

101
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:22,516
- What are you nice kids doing at a place like this?
- Easter vacation.

102
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:26,900
- Is it your cabin?
- No, my girlfiend's.

103
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:33,658
- Ok. And who's the lucky one?
- She's not here right now, -

104
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:36,697
- she's skiing across Istind.
- Across Istind?

105
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:39,960
She's a bit more athletic than the rest of us.

106
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:48,041
Is the terrain dangerous?

107
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,829
The terrain is the least of your problems
up there, to put it that way.

108
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:03,111
I assume that you little spoiled shitheads didn't
bother to check out the local history -

109
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:07,621
- before you came waltzing in on that
bloddy snow tracor of yours.

110
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:12,979
Things have happened here.
Things that people don't like to talk about.

111
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:18,386
During World War II, Øksfjord was an important
location for the Germans. It was...

112
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:22,968
Almost like a middle station for
German destroyers.

113
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:28,261
It was an important link to stop
convois between Britain and Russia.

114
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,157
"Einsatz"

115
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,961
That was the name of the forces that
were stationed there.

116
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:44,464
In contrast to most places where...

117
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:50,190
The Germans got along with the civilians, that was
not the case here. It was under leadership by...

118
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:55,109
Colonel Herzog.

119
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,880
So it went to hell with the civilians.

120
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,016
The people were tortured, beaten and maltreated
every day.

121
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:06,801
Trust me when I tell you.

122
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,868
These were evil hellish bastards.

123
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,734
It was towards the end of the war when
they stepped over the line.

124
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,732
The Germans started to realize they were
beaten, and the Russians were on their way.

125
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:34,252
The Germans went into every house and stole all
gold, silver and shiny items they could find.

126
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:39,904
Those who protested got a bullet between
their eyes.

127
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:46,173
But it was after that they got one
hell of a surprise.

128
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,833
The citizens and secretly teamed up.

129
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,709
And decided that enough is enough.

130
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,646
All the anger and rage the 3,000 citizens had built up
during the last three years -

131
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,669
- needed to be unleashed.

132
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,274
So they had started gathering all the
weapons they could find.

133
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:11,729
That was basically scythes, axes, knives, shovels...

134
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,463
Everything that could break a skull.

135
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,888
So they ambushed the bastards in the
middle of the night.

136
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,634
The soldiers didn't have a chance, and they knew it.
Several got killed.

137
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:44,372
So, the devil himself...

138
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,625
Colonel Herzog and several of his men
managed to escape.

139
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,685
They ran up in the mountains.

140
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:55,460
And took with them lots of the stolen goods,
the greedy pigs that they were.

141
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,905
Several civilians followed them, but they lost the
tracks up in the mountains.

142
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:07,765
In these exact mountains...

143
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:11,064
Where they most likely froze to death.

144
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:20,717
Because of that people step lightly up here.

145
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,738
There's an evil presence here.

146
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,024
An evil you wouldn't want to wake.

147
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,264
Yeah. We have to be careful so we don't
wake up the evil.

148
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:52,334
I should get moving.

149
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:05,675
- Remember what I told you.
- We're actually medicine students all of us.

150
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:11,592
So I think we'll do fine. Unfortunately we haven't learnt
to basnish evil yet, but I think that's on next semester.

151
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:17,885
But what if you are holding your own intestines
in your hands, what do you do then?

152
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:21,891
Or if you get your arms and legs torn off.
What do you do then?

153
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,526
Have you learned that yet?

154
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,507
Thanks for the coffee.

155
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,133
Sara?

156
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,250
Sara? Sara?

157
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,659
Sara?

158
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,954
Sara?

159
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:07,496
Hello?

160
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,689
Is there anybody there?

161
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,192
Hello?

162
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:33,201
I have a weapon.

163
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:26,486
Are you sure we shouldn't wait til tomorrow?
She'll probably be here during the day.

164
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:33,362
- It's no problem.
- You're probably right. I just have a bad feeling.

165
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:38,680
- She'll probably be here soon.
- Listen. If I'm not back tomorrow...

166
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:45,908
Just listen. If I'm not back tomorrow, follow the scooter
trails back down to the car and get help.

167
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,821
- Ok.
- Ok.

168
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,990
I'll find her.

169
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:02,719
- See you later.
- Drive carefully.

170
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:21,588
Ok boys. We want a clean race. You'll
start at my signal, and no dirty tricks.

171
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:23,931
- Please, just one dirty trick.
- Not even one.

172
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:26,330
Are the drivers ready?

173
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:33,066
On your marks, get set, go!

174
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:27,448
Erlend!

175
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,042
Hello?

176
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,965
Hello?

177
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:45,630
Hello?

178
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:51,195
Hi.

179
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,654
Ah, fuck.

180
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,061
Calling doctor Hovden.
Doctor Hovden to the emergency room.

181
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:44,161
I see you're not exactly rid of that little problem of yours.
I assume there's not much action when Aunt Flow visits.

182
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,591
- God damn, you're so childish.
- How the hell are you going to manage -

183
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:51,144
- six years of medical studies, when
you almost vomit from a tiny cut.

184
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,729
You can be a baker, perhaps.

185
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,776
- Does anyone want a beer?
- Are you ok?

186
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,806
- Yeah...
- Sorry.

187
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,358
Cunt bag.

188
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:31,016
Check this out.

189
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:50,068
It says 1942.

190
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,325
- 1942?
- Hey, hey, it's mine.

191
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:56,902
Let's wait til Sara and Vegard returns.
We won't touch it before then.

192
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:58,503
- Nah.
- Ok?

193
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,932
Em, mkay.

194
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:15,339
SARA!

195
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,690
Sara!

196
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:11,307
We are two small pretty ladies.

197
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,752
Hey, hey. Let's not get crazy here.

198
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:22,223
- We don't know who it belongs to.
- That box has been here for 50 years.

199
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:27,147
We just take what we want, cash in, and pay
down our student loans.

200
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,874
It hasn't been there for 50 years without
anyone noticing it.

201
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,637
50 years? It's 100, I promise you that.

202
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,946
- People have seen it, and it's just flemflams.
- Huh? Fle...?

203
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:41,564
Flemsflams? Flemsflams..? Flemsflams!

204
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:47,437
- No, I'm going to take a shit.
- Godspeed.

205
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:50,329
Good luck. Name him after me.

206
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:02,627
Oh, god damn.

207
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:21,080
Ok. A joke...

208
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:24,821
This one is good. It contains both poo, pee and sperm.

209
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,578
Once upon a time there was a poo...

210
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:34,460
There are no good jokes that doesn't contain poo, pee or sperm.

211
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,318
Kris?

212
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,079
No, don't...

213
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,858
- And you think that is a joke?
- It's a good joke.

214
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:07,353
Erlend!

215
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,627
- You took some time.
- Did you see Kris?

216
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,727
Yes.

217
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,682
Fuck.

218
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:41,509
Erlend?

219
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:46,169
Erlend?

220
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,682
Er... Erlend, is that you?

221
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,914
Oh shit.

222
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,992
Erlend, stop that shit.

223
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,380
Erlend?

224
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:43,584
Help. He-elp!

225
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,705
Help. Help!

226
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:58,938
Quiet.

227
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,882
- What the hell? It's in the middle of the song.
- Shut up!

228
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:09,506
I thought I heard something.

229
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,294
Kris?

230
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,825
Kris!

231
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:33,665
Kris!

232
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:45,903
She's not answering. I've yelled several times,
she doesn't reply.

233
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:49,723
- She's probably fucking with you.
- Don't talk to me like I'm 5 years old, Martin.

234
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:55,899
Hanna. She's wasted, she probably fell asleep
at the john.

235
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,997
I can go look for her, ok?

236
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:10,109
Clever, we'll shoot her.

237
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:12,710
Take it with you.

238
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:17,170
It's that maniac from earlier.

239
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:23,623
We'll go look for her, ok?

240
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:33,119
Someone checks the outhouse, and someone checks
around the cabin...

241
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,620
Shotgun!

242
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:42,603
Martin, can't I try it? Let me hold it.

243
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:44,054
- No.
- Yes, come on.

244
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:45,882
- Not now.
- Come on, just let me hold it.

245
00:40:45,883 --> 00:40:47,498
No...

246
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:49,881
- Is it heavy?
- A little.

247
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,882
- Let me check it out.
- Later perhaps.

248
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:03,948
Can you see anything?

249
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:11,142
- I have a shotgun here. I have a shotgun!
- Sorry, sorry.

250
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,543
Martin?

251
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:16,953
Check this.

252
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:25,271
What a nice trip... Fantastic...

253
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,374
Kris? Are you taking a shit?

254
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,850
Have you dozed off?

255
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,022
- She wasn't theeeere.
- Stop it.

256
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:45,023
She wasn't there.

257
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,611
What does that mean?

258
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:49,513
She wasn't at the outhouse, and not anywhere
around the cabin.

259
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,069
We found this though.

260
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:55,017
- Let's see. Maybe she's inside it.
- Stop fucking around.

261
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,389
- It's Sara's.
- Sara's?

262
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:02,808
- Where did you find it?
- Just behind the cabin.

263
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:10,252
- I get a bad feeling from this.
- We have to go find her, she could freeze to death.

264
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:16,578
- Ok, we get dressed and go look for her.
- So we'll just trudge around in the forest?

265
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,345
Where did we just come from Martin?
We've just been outside.

266
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,197
Oh, thank God.

267
00:42:51,053 --> 00:42:52,822
I can't see anything.

268
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,537
Pull!

269
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,244
Pull!

270
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,391
F-fuck! Move the sofa in front of the door.

271
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:14,280
And stay away from the windows.

272
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,014
Get it out!

273
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,561
Come on and twist.

274
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:24,611
Leave the cushins!

275
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:30,190
Hanna!

276
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,025
Ok, stay calm. They can't get in here.

277
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:09,311
The table!

278
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,609
Martin! Martin!

279
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,583
Einsatz...

280
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:44,015
Zomb... Zombies...

281
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:50,700
Don't get bitten, ok? Don't get bitten!

282
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,818
Stop that rubbish, what the hell are we going to do?

283
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,418
We have to get to the car.

284
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,594
Help me!

285
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:41,107
I said we should go to Sunny Beach!

286
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:05,018
Martin...

287
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,990
Martin. Don't bite.

288
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:11,975
Now it's suddenly totally quiet.

289
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:16,501
Stay here and become lunch for the rest of...

290
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,927
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

291
00:47:21,928 --> 00:47:23,728
We can't just sit here.

292
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:28,213
We must try to find the car. We find
the road back and get help.

293
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:31,614
Only Vegard knows the way, and the tracks
are covered with snow.

294
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:36,047
I know...

295
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:41,443
We have to do something. We can't just
sit here and wait for...

296
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:43,885
Wait for it to fix itself. We have to do something.

297
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:56,371
What if we split up. Two looks for the car, while
two waits here for Vegard.

298
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:02,779
Those who eventually leaves will most
likely get those bloody bastards after them.

299
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:08,662
If two goes outside and makes sounds,
it will attract... Those creatures.

300
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:12,648
At the same time the two others run into the woods.

301
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:18,239
Then we'll just run towards the fjord. There are
people down by the fjord, we will have to get help.

302
00:48:19,094 --> 00:48:23,010
Who will get to be those lucky bastards acting
as bait?

303
00:48:35,305 --> 00:48:37,382
- Do something you too.
- Ok...

304
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:40,916
Where are you, you cowardly bastards?!

305
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,299
Are you afraid to come out in daylight?!

306
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,100
Fuck, was that too much?

307
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:47,323
Do you think they'll get pissed?

308
00:48:56,096 --> 00:48:57,650
Come.

309
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,535
Fuck...

310
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,261
Sara...

311
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:37,879
Come on!

312
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:40,125
Craven bastard.

313
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:21,424
Ok...

314
00:53:36,393 --> 00:53:39,294
Do you recognize and of this?

315
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:41,045
No chance.

316
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:43,305
Everything looks the same...

317
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:48,967
If both go downhill.

318
00:53:58,127 --> 00:54:00,629
- We have to split up.
- What?

319
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,498
One of us have to get down to the damn car
and get help.

320
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,616
- We go to that car together.
- Liv, siten to me.

321
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:10,386
We don't stand a chance on out own,
we have to go together.

322
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:15,394
- One of us have to get to the car...
- Please, we can't! I don't want to go by myself!

323
00:54:15,395 --> 00:54:17,716
Liv, listen to me!

324
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,359
You saw what happened to Erlend.

325
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:34,204
We don't have a chance on our own.

326
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:40,283
We have to go together...

327
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:44,503
Ok...

328
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:50,179
- We run together.
- We run together.

329
01:02:36,592 --> 01:02:41,886
- Are you sure that thing will work?
- Have you ever tasted moonshine from Finnmark?

330
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:48,194
Throw!

331
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,477
Hi. My name is Martin Hovden, and we're staying
at a cabin in Øksfjord... And...

332
01:03:12,478 --> 01:03:17,398
Just up in the mountains. We're under attack
by something that looks like...

333
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:20,550
German soldiers from WWII.

334
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:23,112
And now we managed to light the
cabin on fire, and... Hello?

335
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:24,541
Hello!

336
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:27,429
- That fucking cunt hung up on me!
- Of course she did, what you said sounds -

337
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,623
- insanely absurd!
- Then what the fuck should I say?

338
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:35,033
Say that we are under attack by terrorists! Say that
they have missiles. They will bring helicopters and all that shit.

339
01:03:35,034 --> 01:03:36,400
Brilliant.

340
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:39,262
Fucking cunt, it's out of battery!

341
01:03:40,035 --> 01:03:41,501
Come!

342
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:47,362
- We have to get over to that shack!
- The shack? What the hell are we doing there?

343
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,693
We don't have time for that now.

344
01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:05,815
- I can't see anyone.
- I'll look for some light.

345
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:21,029
You know what we have to do, right?

346
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:25,018
- Right?
- Yes.

347
01:09:38,702 --> 01:09:40,810
A little more.

348
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,812
Duck!

349
01:11:01,584 --> 01:11:05,728
- Where have you been?
- Where the hell did you get a machine gun?

350
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:11,579
I've kept myself busy.

351
01:11:16,256 --> 01:11:18,313
Where are the others?

352
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:24,032
Hanna and Liv are looking for the
car to get som help.

353
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:29,527
The others...

354
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:33,758
They...?

355
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:40,852
Behind you!

356
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:53,644
Martin.

357
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:04,545
Martin!

358
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:11,355
Martin!

359
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:55,326
No, no, no! No, no, no!

360
01:14:56,387 --> 01:15:00,588
- What is it?
- Do you remember what Erlend said. Do you?

361
01:15:01,688 --> 01:15:06,035
Don't get bitten. No matter what you do;
don't get bitten.

362
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,450
Then you turn into...

363
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:12,595
Isn't your grandfather half jewish? You don't
think they would recruit someone half jewish?

364
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,767
You'll get infected if you... You'll be like them.

365
01:15:16,591 --> 01:15:20,343
You saw what they did to Vegard. It didn't
exactly look like they wanted team mates.

366
01:15:20,344 --> 01:15:23,221
Do you think I'm willing to gamble on that?

367
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:36,257
- What are you doing?
- We had... We learned about amputation, remember?

368
01:15:39,927 --> 01:15:42,297
What the fuck are you doing?

369
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:01,525
No, no, no, no, no!

370
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:30,888
Let's sledge that fucker and get out of here.

371
01:19:22,528 --> 01:19:24,654
Run, for fuck's sale.

372
01:24:25,879 --> 01:24:28,135
Oh, fuck...
