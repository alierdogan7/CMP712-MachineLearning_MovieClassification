is your record since the war.

Bill!

177
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,756
Better get onboard, son.

178
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,176
All aboard!

Goodbye, darling!

185
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,653
Have your picture taken
the minute you get there

186
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,946
and send me one, all right?

187
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,656
Okay. Here, hurry.

188
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,116
Oh!

189
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,370
But your watch. You shouldn't.
You're gonna need this.

190
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,539
- It's all right. It doesn't work.
- Bill!

191

Do you feel all right, sir?

210
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,106
Oh...

211
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,525
I haven't flown for a long time.

212
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,578
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Oveur speaking.

213
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,163
- Here you go.
- We'll be cruising

214
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,540
- at 36,000 feet this evening.
- Stewardess?

215
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:39,128
Our arrival time in Chicago
will be 10:45 p.m. Central time.

216
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,214
The temperature there
is currently 62 degrees,

217
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,717
with a 20% chance of precipitation.

218
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,136
Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,015
- Would you like something to read?
- Do you have anything light?

220
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,188
How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?

221
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,898
Yes. Thank you.

222
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,903
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

223
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,530
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

224
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,741
- Oh, stewardess?
- Excuse me.

225
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,034
But...

226
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,965
No wonder you're upset.

227
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,675
She's lovely.

228
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,471
And a darling figure.

229
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,682
Supple, pouting breasts.

230
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,060
Firm thighs.

231
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,189
It's a shame you two don't get along.

232
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,191
Yes, I know.

233
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,236
Things used to be different.

234
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,615
I remember when we first met.

235
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,993
It was during the war.

236
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,746
I was in the Air Force,

237
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,916
stationed in Drambuie
off the Barbary Coast.

238
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,503
I used to hang out at the Magumba Bar.

239
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,965
It was a rough place,
the seediest dive on the wharf,

240
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,384
populated with every reject and cutthroat

241
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,719
from Bombay to Calcutta.

242
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,847
It was worse than Detroit.

243
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,360
The mood in the place
was downright ugly.

244
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,488
You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists.

245
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,284
You could count on a fight
breaking out almost every night.

00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,148
I didn't go there that
night to fall in love.

249
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,233
I just dropped in for
a couple of drinks.

250
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,360
But suddenly, there she was.

251
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,957
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

252
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,917
I had to ask the guy next to me
to pinch me

253
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,294
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

254
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,345
I was afraid to approach her.
But that night, fate was on my side.

Hell, I guess I still don't.

But enough about me.
I hope this hasn't been boring for you.

It's just that whenever
I start to talk about Elaine,

265

Yes. Joey will have the steak,
and my wife and I will have the fish.

When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

270

Joey, I think the pilots

271
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,562
are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

272
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,189
Oh, gee whiz.

273
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,482
I'll tell you what, Joey.

and see what I can arrange.

And that you don't really try
except during the playoffs.

345
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,099
The hell I don't!

346
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,436
Listen, kid.

347
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,105
I've been hearing that crap
ever since I was at UCLA.

348
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:50,484
I'm out there
busting my buns every night.

349
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,611
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

350
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,280
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

351
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,038
Joey?

352
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,333
You like movies about gladiators?

353
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,215
Elaine, just hear me out.

354
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:18,011
I know things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different.

355
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,722
Like it was in the beginning, remember?

356
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,724
I remember everything.

357
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,978
All I have are memories.

358
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,398
Mostly, I remember the nights
when we were together.

359
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,068
I remember how you used to hold me.

360
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,280
How I used to sit on your face
and wriggle,

361
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,117
and afterwards how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

362
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,870
When it did, it was almost like...

363
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:49,084
Like each new day
was created only for us.

364
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,087
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

365
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,797
But it won't be.

366
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,092
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past.

367
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,064
COMMANDER: You're too low, Ted.
You're too low.

368
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,031
NURSE: You mustn't believe everything
that you see.

369
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,868
The mind can play tricks on people.

370
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,786
Pain. Pain.

371
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,414
- He looks so happy today, doesn't he?
- Okay, I'll be back.

372
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,791
Thank you, thank you.
You look so happy today.

373
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,546
DOCTOR: Okay, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

374
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,964
NURSE: Give me a big smile.

375
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,717
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

376
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,385
Headquarters! What is it?

377
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,637
Well, it's a big building
where generals meet,

378
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,556
but that's not important right now.

379
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,891
They've cleared you of any blame

380
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,392
for what happened on that raid.

381
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,727
Isn't that good news?

382
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,812
Is it?

383
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,442
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

384
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,696
Seven, Lieutenant Zipp
died this morning.

385
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,948
But Dr. Sandier says
you'll be out in a week.

386
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,783
Isn't that wonderful?

387
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,913
I wish I could say the same
for George Zipp.

388
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,581
Be patient, Ted.

389
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,918
Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

390
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:16,254
MAN: Hey, Striker. How about a break?
I'm getting tired.

391
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,090
Yeah, all right. Take five.

392
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,135
Thanks.

393
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,014
I've found a wonderful apartment for us.

394
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,309
It has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

395
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,728
with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

396
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,397
PATIENT: Red Leader! Red Leader!
I'm going down.

398
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,276
He thinks he's a pilot,
still fighting the war.

399
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,153
GELINE: ...around here somewhere.

400
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,490
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

401
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,701
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,375
That's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

415
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,534
Would you like some coffee
before we serve dinner?

416
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,411
No. No, thank you.

417
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,581
Would either of you like
another cup of coffee?

418
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,333
I will, but Jim won't.

419
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,294
I think I will have another cup of coffee.

420
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,924
Jim never has
a second cup of coffee at home.

421
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,766
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

422
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,518
There's a little girl onboard, up front,

423
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,688
- who's ill and, well...
- Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

424
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,692
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

Oh, you have a guitar.

Mmm-hmm.

434
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,552
I thought maybe
you'd like to hear a song.

435
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,346
I'd love to.

436
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,639
Okay.

437
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,475
Let's see.

438
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,685
This is one of my favorites.

439
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,902
(SINGING) I traveled the banks
of the River of Jordan

440
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:48,406
To find where it flows to the sea

441
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,411
I looked in the eyes
of the cold and the hungry

442
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,999
And I saw that I was looking at me

443
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:04,130
And I wanted to know
if life had a purpose

444
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,550
And what it all means in the end

445
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:12,180
In the silence I listened
to voices inside me

446
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,976
And they told me again and again

447
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,773
There is only one river

448
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,110
There is only one sea

449
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:28,321
And it flows through you

450
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,533
And it flows through me

00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,786
There is only one people

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,081
We are one and the same

We are all one spirit

We are one

459
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,440
A little late tonight.
We've been waiting for you.

460
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,818
- Who wants to be first?
- Go ahead, Clarence. I got it.

461
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,736
- Okay.
- How's the weather?

462
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,906
Not so good.
We got some heavy stuff ahead of us.

463
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,325
It might get rough again
unless we can climb on top.

464
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,286
Yeah, after the war,

465
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,997
I just wanted to get
as far away from things as possible,

466
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,958
so Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps.

467
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,920
We were assigned to an isolated tribe.

468
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,505
The Molombos.

469
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,300

472
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,524
It was really a challenge
during the year,

473
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,444
introducing them to our Western culture.

474
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,326
At first they didn't know
what to think of us.

475
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,786
But soon, we gained their trust.

476
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,174
It'll help you better prepare storing foods

This 2-quart Seals-M-Rite container
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

481
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,819
You must understand,
these people had been

482
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,072
completely isolated from civilization.

483
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,492
No one had ever outlined
a physical fitness program for them,

484
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,661
and they had no athletic equipment.

485
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,537
I started them on simple calisthenics,

486
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,249
then gradually worked them up
to rudimentary game skills.

487
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,751
And finally,
advanced competitive theory.

488
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,213
I was patient with them,
and they were eager to learn.

489
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,173
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

490
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,385
It was probably due to the advanced
American teaching techniques

491
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,179
that we were able to bridge
the generations of isolation

492
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,807
and communicate so successfully
with the Molombos.

493
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,524
I think they're getting the hang of it.

I'll teach them baseball.

It was at that moment that I first realized

Elaine had doubts
about our relationship.

501
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,387
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,767
I tried a number of jobs.

00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,187
Well, I could go on for hours,
but I'd probably start to bore you.

505
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,189
You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,066

00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,062
It's unbelievable!

687
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,064
Just unbelievable!

688
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,858
How many times I've warned
those people about food inspection.

689
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,819
You'd think after all these years,
someone would listen to you.

690
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,947
Oh, well. Airport management,
the FAA and the airlines,

691
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,285
they're all cheats and liars!

692
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,788
All right, let's get out of here.

(THUNDER CRACKING)

695
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:44,129
I'm sorry to bother you.

696
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:47,508
I was just looking for someone
with flying experience.

697
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,345
When they built those roads,
they had no thought of drainage in mind.

698
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,224
So we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

699
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,851
In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep

700
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:02,106
since just the day before,
only one that we had broke down.

701
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,108
It had a bad axle.

702
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:05,651
Excuse me, sir.

703
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,277
There's been a little problem
in the cockpit...

704
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,279
The cockpit! What is it?

705
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,824
It's the little room in the front
of the plane where the pilots sit.

706
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,117
But that's not important right now.

707
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,785
You see, the first officer is ill,

708
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,830
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

709
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,916
Do you know anything about planes?

710
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,586
Well, I flew in the war,
but that was years ago.

711
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,296
I wouldn't know anything about it.

712
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,590
Well, would you go up? Please?

713
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,568
The stewardess said that...

714
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,238
Both pilots?

715
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,574
Can you fly this plane and land it?

716
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,118
Surely you can't be serious?

717
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,871
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.

718
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:03,792
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr. Striker's the only one.

719
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,794
What flying experience have you had?

720
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,963
Well, I flew single-engine fighters
in the Air Force,

721
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,007
but this plane has four engines.

722
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,759
It's an entirely different
kind of flying altogether.

723
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,305
It's an entirely different kind of flying.

724
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,643
Besides, I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

725
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,147
Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying,

726
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,357
but there's one thing I do know.

727
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,527
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

728
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,487
You're the only chance we've got.

729
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:15,906
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

730
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,658
No, that's what I said. You heard me.

731
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,743

and stand by.

00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:29,670
We'll need a pre-landing flight check.

Tell them I'm in the dispatch office,
and I want it here fast.

00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:55,904
No, we can't do that.
The risk of a flameout's too great.

is gonna land that plane.

Is that possible?

747
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,959
Possible. It's a 100-to-1 shot.

748
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:13,964

- Who is it?
- Name's Ted Striker.

751
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,094
I flew with him during the war.

752
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,638
And that won't make my job
any easier tonight.

Ted Striker was a crack flight leader
up to a point.

754
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,186
He was one of those men who...

755
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:31,648

Maybe you know the kind.

757
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:36,987
He went all to pieces
one particular mission.

758
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,949
Just hope that doesn't happen tonight.

759
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,333

trying to tell these people.

so I'll be very direct.

Everyone in this plane
is in a desperate situation.

Those are the flaps.

773
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,125
This is the thrust.

774
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,921

As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war.

Let me tell you something, Steve.

820
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,430
Ted Striker was
a top-notch squadron leader,

821
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,432
a long time ago.

00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:56,436
Look, Rex, I want you to get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

823
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,814
Now, you're gonna have to let him
get the feel of that airplane on the way.

824
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,358
Then you'll have to talk him
onto the approach.

825
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,903
So help me, you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground!

Yes, Captain Kramer.

All right.

854
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,446

than riding a bicycle.

Lost number four.

1031
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,131
What happened, Ted?
What went wrong?

1032
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,927
The oil pressure.
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

1033
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:39,222
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's gonna hit the fan.

1034
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,560
Watch that oil temperature.
What the hell's he doing up there?

1035
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:46,270
Striker, that plane can't land itself!

1036
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,730
It takes a pilot who can handle pressure!

1037
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,482
Ease off, Rex. He hasn't flown for years.

1038
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,567
It's not his fault.
Could happen to any pilot.

1039
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,069
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

1040
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,196
Can't push him too hard.
He might break.

1041
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,614
Gotta remember
who you're dealing with.

1042
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:59,700
Nick, Pete, Jared.
There's a fire in the barn!

1043
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,912
He's right.

1044
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,122
I can't take the pressure.

1045
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,166
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

1046
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:10,169
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

1047
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,381
I don't have what it takes.

1048
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:17,176
They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.

1049
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,522
Bad news. The fog is getting thicker.

1050

so save your breath.

1052
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,975
No. I don't have a thing to say.

You've done the best you could.

1054
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,731
You really have. The best you could.

1055
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,234
You can't expect to win them all.

1056
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,654
But I wanna tell you something

1057
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:21,741
I've kept to myself through these years.

1058
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,577
I was in the war myself, Medical Corps.

1059
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,163
Was on late duty one night

1060
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,914
when they brought in
a badly wounded pilot

1061
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,167
from one of the raids.

1062
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,336
He could barely talk.

1063
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,756
He looked up at me and, "Doc," he said,

1064
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,010
"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.

1065
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,970
"I'm glad.

1066
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:45,473
"Captain made the right decision."

1067
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,018
That pilot's name was George Zipp.

1068
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:53,272
George Zipp said that?

1069
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,527
The last thing he said to me,
"Doc," he said.

1070
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,820
"Sometime,

1071
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,366

"tell them to get out there
and give it all they've got.

1074
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:13,626
"And win just one for the Zipper.

1075
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,381
"I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"
he said.

1076
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:23,386
"And I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

1077

Excuse me, Doc.

Never, not one chance in a million.

I know, I know. But it's his ship now.
His command. He's in charge.

that we can save them

that plane down in time.
