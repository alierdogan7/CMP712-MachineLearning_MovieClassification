1
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:20,716
Oh, Cece. Are you two kids
back together?

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,396
- She wishes.
- No, plumbing's out-- severe clogging.

3
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,087
- I'm sorry I asked.
- This is what happens.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,212
Four models with
protein deficiencies,

5
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:28,829
sharing a shower.
(Laughs)

6
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,371
They shed like a... like
a four-dollar Christmas sweater.

7
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:33,968
Guys, guess what?

8
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,798
I just made a breakthrough
with a student.

9
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:39,036
Yeah, it's true.

10
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,607
(Humming)

11
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:42,841
- Don't, please.
- Uh, Jess?

12
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:47,275
You know we love you,
we all support you...

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,671
♪ I'm breaking through
with students. ♪

14
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,277
...but when you do things
like this, I'm sorry... bowl.

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,183
Okay.

16
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:58,972
It's just not satisfying.

17
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,139
- I think it is.
- Okay.

18
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,421
You said you had
a breakthrough.

19
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,671
It's just a whole new world
teaching adults.

20
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:05,200
This week, I gave
them an assignment.

21
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,937
I said write whatever you want

22
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,505
just load it up
with descriptive imagery.

23
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,039
MAN:
My fluffy pillow,

24
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:12,796
my yellowy fluffy pillow,

25
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:16,421
next to my dog, my hairy dog,
my beloved hairy dog,

26
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:18,437
while I diddle myself.
- Excellent.

27
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,587
He was a merman.

28
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:23,011
He was the last of his kind,

29
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:26,812
and he needed a mother
for his mer-child.

30
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:30,601
He was not a mer-gentleman.

31
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:34,392
Can't wait to hear more.

32
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:36,377
I just can't connect with them
and I don't know why.

33
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,759
Look, Jess, you can't teach
people how to write.

34
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,387
- Not true.
- I say that as a writer.

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,246
- Also not true.
- A writing class is for

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,305
somebody who doesn't think
lyrically in terms of,

37
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,752
like, poetic words
that just... are strung...

38
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,323
You said you had
a breakthrough.

39
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:51,908
So I have this student
whose name

40
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,053
is Edgar
and he was not getting it.

41
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,640
And then today he turned
in this amazing story.

42
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:58,153
Nick, actually,
you should read this.

43
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,295
Writers don't read--
we write.

44
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:02,386
Jessica Day calls it
"A must read."

45
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,943
Look at that font.

46
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,356
What is this amateur hour?

47
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,485
At least use Palatino.

48
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,260
WINSTON:
Good evening, everyone.

49
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,994
Or should I say morning?

50
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,025
Hey, Winston.

51
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,219
Do you guys have any agave?

52
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:16,324
We might have some
pressed lentil syrup

53
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:17,485
in the mixin's cabinet.

54
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,884
Thank you.

55
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,041
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay, uh...

56
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,207
- Okay, you know what?
- Hey, look...

57
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:29,042
I just felt the side, the side

58
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,958
- anyway, so it's...
- I didn't mean to...

59
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,437
CECE:
It's fine, it's...

60
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,960
Other way, now.

61
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,485
- I will fight you, Jack.
- No, not again.

62
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,924
Not... no!

63
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,421
- No!
- Jump out the way, Jessica?

64
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,008
What the hell is wrong
with you just waving

65
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:42,677

Guys, listen to this.

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,956
"By day, I'm a plumber.

71
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,426
By night, I'm a stalker."

72
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,528
You read it.

00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,888

wearing a gimp costume,
stalking my prey."

He's the first person I got

♪ I'm an amazing teacher.

77
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,726
- Very engaging, keep going.
- I'm hooked.

78
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,103
Okay, "My prey is a deer.

I love stabbing."

84
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,637
Sounds like he likes stabbing.

"After all the stabbing..."

Listen to that detail.

This man is psychotic.

90
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:33,800

You've seen me in one before.

94
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:41,128
I just don't think
you should be in a room

with this creep, twice a week.

96
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,320
It is not safe.

Miller?

Yeah, I'm a little worried
about you.

And if you won't do anything about it,
then I'm taking into my own hands.

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,308
I'm doing a little
investigation.

101
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,914
Investigating? Please.

102
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,134
You're just gonna
Google his name.

103
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,230
I am way beyond that.

104
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,107
You're typing his
name into Google.

105

We can all see the screen.
See the screen, dude.

106
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,040
This is a private investigation!

107
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,874
Are you... I wanted
to talk to you about the...

108
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,961
regrettable contact

109
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,537
between Cece's...

110
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,868
her-her down there

111
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,787
and my, uh...

112
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,152
my parts.

113
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,259
You practically
shish-kebabbed her.

114
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,075
Is this something
I should apologize for?

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,065
Just let it go, man.

116
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,967
You pogo'd her.

117
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,624
I'm sorry,
what did you say, "pogo"?

118
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:26,867
- I didn't, um...
- I heard

119
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,636
"Pogo" -- what is that?

120
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,802
(Sighs)

121
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,220
Look, Winston, fine.

122
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:34,629
It's what we call what you
did this morning, okay?

123
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,580
It's a short...
it's a shorthand.

124
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:37,736
Why do you have
a shorthand, Schmidt,

125
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:38,761
because it happens so often?

126
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,024
You pogo'd me once.

127
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,880
- You pogo'd Jess twice.
- Hey, it's not sexual.

128
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,730
Nick's never been
pogo'd directly.

129
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:45,669
You did get his pizza one
time... which, by the way,

130
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,697
is a whole nother debate--
how did you not feel that?

131
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,620
Let me get this straight--

132
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:49,881
you guys sit around
and talk about this?

133
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,531
Your penis actually
changed the channel,

134
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,405
uh, when we were watching
the Bears game once.

135
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,699
You don't think me, Nick and Jess
talk about you behind your back?

136
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:56,683
Because we do.

137
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,040
You have more pogos than anyone.

138
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,340
You are completely
misusing the word pogo.

139
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,200
You are the pogo king.

140
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:08,079
Pogo king. (Laughs)

141
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:09,870
Pogo king?

142
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,579
So I wanted to talk about your
creative imagery assignments.

143
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:13,906
Wow, guys.

144
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,615
I really felt like I was buried

145
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,586
under a giant, gleaming, powdery

146
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,532
avalanche of adjectives.

147
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,684
Don't mean to interrupt,
I just hear you're the best

148
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,145
- teacher of adults?
- Oh, no.

149
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,970
- I wonder if there's
room for one more? - No!

150
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,681
How you guys doing?
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

151
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,846
- Not now, okay?
- I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.

152
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,809
I'm here to learn how
to write short fiction.

153
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,497
Oh, okay, Julius, just...

154
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:37,698
take a seat and, um,

155
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:38,400
keep small.

156
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,863
I'm from Chicago.

157
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,750
Thin-crust pizza?
No, thank you.

158
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:42,869
I'm from Chicago.

159
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,500
So, for a fun follow-up...

160
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,929
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, problem, Edgar.

161
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,630
(Mouthing)
We're just going over our

162
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,050
- descriptive imagery.
- I'm sorry, dear,

163
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,650
I can't hear you.
Mr. Pepperwood?

164
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,022
I'm gonna move closer,
if you don't mind.

165
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,528
No, you don't have to go...
stay over there.

166
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:56,435
How you doing, pal?

167
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,093
- I'm Julius Pepperwood.
- Edgar.

168
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,736
What are you doing?
If you don't mind me asking,

169
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,500
why are you late today, Edgar?

170
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,069
Uh, traffic, it
really killed me.

171
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,887
- It killed you?
- Mr. Pepperwood.

172
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,630
Would you say that
it stabbed you?

173
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,714
- Say that again?
- How about glasses on or off?

174
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,948
Teach, if I keep them on,
am I a bad boy?

175
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:12,878
Hey.

176
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,907
All right, honey,
I'll take them off.

177
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:19,177
Whoa, that's a whole different
lens to see that blue dress.

178
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:20,900
No.

179
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,495
Okay, let's refocus.

180
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,092
Um, let's talk about the, um,

181
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:27,314
four classifications
of conflict.

182
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,345
We talked about it last week.
It's in the workbook, um...

183
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,792
Anybody want to help me?

184
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,448
Four classifications
of conflict?

185
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,392
Anybody?
Anybody...

186
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,278
So, no one has signed up for
office hours and I just want

187
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:42,907
you to know that you can talk
to me about anything.

188
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,114
<i>- Adios.</i>
- Anything at all.

189
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:47,749
What are you doing?

190
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,205
Nothing, man, you look
good in your Dockers.

191
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:53,195
What? Nothing happened.
I'm Julius Pepperwood.

192
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:54,438
Let it go.

193
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:57,649
Whoops.

194
00:06:57,673 --> 00:06:59,423
- Why did you do that?
- The wind.

195
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,739
(Quietly): No, no,
no, no, no, no.

196
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,732
Is everything all right?

197
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,763
- Yeah, everything's good.
- Oh, everything's fine, bro.

198
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:13,268
- What's happening right now?
- Sorry, Edgar, um, I really

199
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:15,265
loved your story.

200
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:17,434
Um, I wanted to give you
some notes-- is there any time

201
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,234
you could come in...
to office hours?

202
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,443
Yeah, that be really cool.

203
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,624
I'm really excited.

204
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,512
Um, I'm available anytime, so...

205
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,200
- I'll check my calendar.
- Yup.

206
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,839
Can't get service around here.

207
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,569
Wednesday I got to go
to the bird store.

208
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:34,857
Uh, what about
Wednesday afternoon?

209
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:36,733
He's my uncle.

210
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,316
Hey, Winston,
I'm glad you're home.

211
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,188
I know what my pogo is.

212
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,261
It's that I dance kind
of like a sea snake.

213
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:49,450
(Hissing quietly)

214
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,717
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.

215
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,240
What are you talk...
I know this it, man.

216
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:56,196
Is it that I barge
into people's showers?

217
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:58,955
It's my caterpillar
eyebrows-- well, look.

218
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,652
(Whooshes)
(Screams)

219
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,927
They're gone.

220
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,761
Nick, you've gone way too far!
Way too far.

221
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,811
Well, if you're here for Edgar's
notebook, you're too late.

222
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,347
Where's the notebook?

223
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,265
Nick!

224
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,452
What's my one rule?

225
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,041
It's to not steal your yarn.

226
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,798
Don't steal my yarn, man.

227
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,191
It's my one thing.

228
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:19,260
But look at what was
inside of his notebook.

229
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:20,949
Okay, he was doodling
in class, Nick.

230
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,556
Weapons, dripping with blood?

231
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:23,988
That is not a doodle.

232
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,580
What are you, the doodle police?

233
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,321
(Snickers)

234
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,399
- There's no doodle police, are there?
- Really?

235
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,239
I can't believe you
still don't believe me.

236
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,116
Jessica...

237
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,561
Exhibit D.

238
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,397
He did this.

239
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm going to Edgar's house,
I'm looking for more proof.

240
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,571
No, Nick, you're not spying
on the one student

241
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:41,630
that I have a connection with.

242
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,249
- I have the address right here.
- No.

243
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,316
- Give me the...
- No!

244
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,969
- I have the address memorized.
- Fine, then I'm coming, too.

245
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:50,805
To bail you out of jail when you
get arrested for trespassing.

246
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:53,564
- Fine, then you'll see
that I was right. - Fine!

247
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:56,504
And you'll also see
who gets there first.

248
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,549
Maybe we should take one car.

249
00:08:58,574 --> 00:08:59,762
Just, like, for the environment.

250
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,266
Yeah, that makes sense--
we can drive together.

251
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,971
- Fine!
- Fine!

252
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:07,978
It's my mole, isn't it?

253
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,146
Well, consider it gone.

254
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,732
Game, set, pogo.

255
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,179
Chill out, man,
it's not your mole.

256
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,484
Just tell me,
this is the worst.

257
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:15,310
This is not the worst,
Schmidt-- the worst

258
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:16,582
is actually knowing.

259
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,938
Knowing that your friends
sit around every single night

260
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,701
talking about your pogo.

261
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,634
What's a pogo?

262
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:24,801
Those brows don't freak you out?

263
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,055
Nah, I've seen worse.

264
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,569
A pogo is what your friends talk
about when you leave the room.

265
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:30,606
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?

266
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,325
Uh... sh...

267
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,513
You guys talk about my toenails?

268
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,575
(Laughs) Never...

269
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,792
talk about
your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.

270
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:46,388
I know my toenails
are a little rugged.

271
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:47,812
Woodsy.

272
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,878
I mean, I have never wondered

273
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,548
if you could shimmy up
a palm tree.

274
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:54,335
But it's because I have a
keratin surplus, I mean...

275
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,553
They're not that bad,
look at these things.

276
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,835
- Aah! Schmidt!
- Ew!

277
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,503
It looks like an open
Swiss Army knife.

278
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,427
Most of them are hard, but one
of them is really, really soft.

279
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,196
I know, I know, I know-- we'll
just talk about what my pogo is.

280
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,565
What's my pogo?

281
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,154
Is it the way I say "pan"?

282
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,407
Pan, pan, pan.

283
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:11,581
Look, Cece, this is more
of just a loft thing.

284
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,246
Just thank your lucky stars
that you don't have

285
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,915
calcified mongrel toes!

286
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,232
(Toenails clicking on floor)

287
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,578
Things sound like
a dang ol' crab.

288
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,814
NICK:
There it is.

289
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,855
If anything's gonna go down,
we need a safe word.

290
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,257
Nothing's gonna go down
unless we make it go down.

291
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,728
- If Pepperwood taught me anything--
- There's no Pepperwood.

292
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,072
Never get caught
without a safe word.

293
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:33,816
We're gonna go with "apricot."

294
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,422
That's way too normal.
We need to, like,

295
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:37,697
go with something weird,
like "dragon slippers."

296
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:40,250
- What?
- I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.

297
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,445
Why do you use
"apricot" so much?

298
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,625
What am I supposed to call
them-- "sweet tangy balls"?

299
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,911
Don't call them "sweet
tangy balls," Jessica.

300
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,675
Well, that's why
we can't use...

301
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:52,855
Nick... Nick...

302
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,613
Nick, oh!

303
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:57,421
(Whispering):
Shh! Come on...

304
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,633
- Nick..
- Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.

305
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,509
You look ridiculous.

306
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:02,953
If we're hiding from people,

307
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,020
- why does it matter what I call you?
- I got my eyes

308
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,850
- and you get my six.
- No, no, what does this mean?

309
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,963
- I'm pretty sure this...
- This means "right turn bicycle."

310
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,818
- No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...
- " It means "right turn."

311
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,732
Nick, seriously--
use your words.

312
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:16,055
- Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.
- Okay, these are my words.

313
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:17,027
(Door opens)
NICK: Oh!

314
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,254
Apricot, apricot, apricot.

315
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:20,870
Close your mouth,
close your eyes.

316
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,848
- Edgar lives with his mother.
- So?

317
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,720
- Of course he does. - A lot of normal
people live with their mothers.

318
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,072
Like my Uncle Randy.

319
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:32,910
- He can't go near parks.
- He was cleared.

320
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,942
You've got to...
(Vehicle approaches)

321
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,362
(Shrieks) Apricot! Apricot!

322
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,288
Get over here now!

323
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,467
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

324
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,289
What's in that duffel bag?

325
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,763
He's the plumber
from the story.

326
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,987
- How did I not see this before?
- What was I saying?

327
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,800
- Oh, my God, you were right.
- Yes, say that again,

328
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,643
- say that again. You were right, you
were right, you were right about everything.

329
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,161
- Don't ever forget you're saying it!
- Oh, my God,

330
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,334
- I can't believe you were right.
- I was a right about everything!

331
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,380
What the hell is in
that duffel bag?

332
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:11,276
- I don't know.
- No, Nick.

333
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:13,021
- Nick, you're gonna get us killed.
- Let's get down.

334
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,499
Nick... Nick...

335
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,345
Shh.

336
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:20,287
(Ringtone):
♪ I'm so excited...

337
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,468
Oh, my... Jessica,
turn it off.

338
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,455
- Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.
- What do I do?

339
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,741
You turn it... Here.

340
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:28,962
- Turn it off. I don't know
how to do this. - Okay.

341
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,365
(Ringtone stops, door opens)

342
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,658
Oh, my God. Get the
hell out of here.

343
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,204
Jess, what are you doing?

344
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:42,593
That is ridiculous.
There was plenty of room.

345
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,558
It seemed like a good idea.

346
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,952
Why would you go under a van?

347
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,528
Let's leave.

348
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,215
WINSTON:- Keep still...
- You will not believe what just happened.

349
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,009
- Nick was right.
- I was right.

350
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:54,813
Oh, my God, what happened
to your eyebrows?

351
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:56,032
You look like Audrey Hepburn.

352
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,611
Don't we own an
industrial-size paper cutter?

353
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:59,363
- Ugh! (Gasps)
- Oh, whatever.

354
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,201
- What the hell is that?
- So close to the eating area!

355
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:03,782
Winston told me that you guys
make fun of my gremlin toenails.

356
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,936
That you call them "clickety-
clacks" or "centaur boots."

357
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,255
What is wrong
with you, Winston?

358
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:12,055
What <i>is</i> wrong with me?
Besides my pogo.

359
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,544
I told him.
It just kind of popped out.

360
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,087
You understand what
that's like, right, Winston?

361
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,190
Okay, you know what?
Don't act like

362
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,927
we don't talk about you two
behind your backs.

363
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:21,296
Because we do. You both have
pogos, my friends.

364
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:24,135
Okay, let's take a deep breath
and ask ourselves

365
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:28,421
if this conversation is worth
ruining our friendships over.

366
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,724
Tell me my pogo.

367
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,181
I need to know my pogo.

368
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:34,983
You guys need to tell me.
I can take it. Lay it on me!

369
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,595
You know, it's kind of a loft thing.
Is it my pies?

370
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:38,539
Are they too tart?

371
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,050
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?

372
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,961
My koala claws,
now that's a pogo!

373
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,533
At least you can hide
your pogo in a shoe.

374
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,965
They make shoes for your penis--
they're called pants!

375
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,472
- Tell me my pogo.
- Jessica, no.

376
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,943
- Tell me my pogo!
- You're a know-it-all!

377
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,301
- Huge know-it-all.
- The worst.

378
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,994
Oh, I'm the worst
know-it-all in the world?

379
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:58,098
Please. Hate hyperbolic
speak. Please.

380
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:01,111
Now you know your pogo,
you truly know it all.

381
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,708
There I go
being a smart-ass again.

382
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,484
I mean, that, that
could be my pogo.

383
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,933
And then there was one.

384
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,003
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure
that you guys have stuff

385
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,911
you laugh at me behind my back.

386
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,563
We don't laugh about
your pogo, Nick.

387
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:13,699
Yeah. We're worried about you.

388
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,875
You're worried about me?

389
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,386
We're worried that you're
not gonna make it.

390
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,294
- Make it to what?
- Just in general.

391
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,586
'Cause you don't take
care of yourself.

392
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:22,019
Sometimes I'll crumple up vitamins
and I'll put them in your food.

393
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:24,554
We all take turns sneaking
money into your pants pockets

394
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,896
before we put them
in the dryer.

395
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,275
Yeah? Well,
I hope you're happy.

396
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,820
The pogos are out.

397
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:33,688
The loft dynamic is ruined.

398
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,702
(High voice): But what
if I talk like a baby?

399
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,347
You're still hot. That's all
we're gonna talk about.

400
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,720
A tiny little baby!

401
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:42,510
Cut into these, please.

402

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,166
- I am in his shed right now

on the wall of you,

415

and bloody weapons

416
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:39,941
and googly eyes.

417
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,430
Googly eyes are actually kind of
sexy, but that's beside...

418
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:45,486
Jess, I will not let you be in
a room alone with this guy.

I'll just say it like...
Apricots! Apricots!

00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,403
Good. Yeah, yeah, that's what
you say if you see Edgar.

Apricots! Really, apricots!

No, no, no, no.

434
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,826

- Yeah?

00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:41,050
It's pretty risky. I'm not sure

444
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:54,082
to base my characters
on people from my own life?

445
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:56,325
Well, I based one on you.

446
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:58,288
- So flattered.
- And then I realized

447
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,733
that there was only one way
for the story to end.

448
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,178

You listened?

498
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,765
Well, of course I listened.
You were a good teacher.

499
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:10,813
Until you thought I was a murderer
and you broke into my shed.

500
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,724
Aw! You were my favorite
student until

501
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,530

515
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,760
Are you putting butter on bacon?

516
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,344
I don't want it
to stick to the pan.

517
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:52,275
Okay, did you...?

518
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:55,071
Great.

519
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,389
It's just what bacon needs,

520
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,445
more fat.

521
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,170
And salt.

522
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,067
- What's this?
- Don't read that. I'm not finished...

523
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:06,337
"Julius Pepperwood:
Zombie Detective"?

524
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:08,150
All his murder victims
are already dead,

525
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:11,251
so they obviously don't need
a detective. I'm working on it.

526
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,354
- "The night was inky hot."
- Don't do this.

527
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:17,272
"She strode into his office with
a sense of purpose, place,

528
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,183
another word here,
question mark."

529
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,574
I'm looking for another
"P" word there.

530
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,092
"She had zombie legs
that went on for miles.

531
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,863
"They were the kind of legs
you could sink your teeth into.

532
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,733
"Pepperwood had two friends--
one, if you count his hat.

533
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,617
The other was his gal Friday,
Jessica Night."

534
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:35,706
It's not you, Jess.

535
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,113
"She was small in stature,
but not in spunk.

536
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:41,607
And a super annoying
know-it-all."

537
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,407
Good evening.

538
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,622
Hello.

539
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,057
Oh, bacon.

540
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,238
Where the hell
did you come from?

541
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:51,174
I came from my room.

542
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:53,563
No, I didn't hear the pitter-
patter of your disgusting feet.

543
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,830
I cut my toenails.
Yeah, the soaking really worked.

544
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,633
Look at that.
They're gorgeous now.

545
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,560
- Went down a full shoe size.
- Guys! Fire!

546
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,917
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

547
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:02,519
Everybody relax!
Call a fireman!

548
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,381
- You call the fireman!
- I'm the fireman.

549
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,766
You can't put out a grease fire
with water!

550
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:08,946
You have to smother it!

551
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,189
Why didn't you say
that before?!

552
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:11,910
I don't want
to be a know-it-all!

553
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,746
- You're so stupid!
- Shut up!

554
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,548
- Whoo! Oh!
- Nice!

555
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:16,241
Yes!

556
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:18,535
Amazing, my man! Whoa.
Whoa.

557
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,391
Honestly, I didn't know you were
gonna put your arm around me.

558
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,257
I'm so sorry.

559
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,390
Oh, you put up your pup tent
in front of the fire.

560
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,728
WINSTON:
It's involuntary.

561
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:29,507
It is a combination
of adrenaline

562
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:32,273
and great circulation.

563
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:34,248
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't just hug me randomly!

564
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,785
That's weird and...!

565
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,847
(Schmidt laughs)

566
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,836
You ever notice...
when Winston runs,

567
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:43,448
- that he kinda farts while
he's running? - Yes!

568
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:44,412
(laughs)

569
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:45,903
- Sounds like a jalopy.
- New pogo.

570
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,696
Oh, we got a great new pogo!

571
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:51,096
He farts when he runs!
(Jess makes farting sounds)

572
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:57,283
