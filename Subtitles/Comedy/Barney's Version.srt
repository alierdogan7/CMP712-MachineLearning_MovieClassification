in the first place?

any less of you if you don't.

this is not the first time
she tried to kill herself.

No, no, no. When she was 12 years old,

262

she used to tear hair out in clumps,
right out of her head, yeah.

She said that we're not her parents,
we should be so lucky.

00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,025
She said she's not Jewish.

265

"Tell me who my real parents are." And
until we told her, she wouldn't eat.

00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,554

But, you know, was she grateful?

277
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:12,102
No, she would yell in front of everybody
at the hospital,

278
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,897
"Dr Kupner, you felt up my tits."

279

you can imagine.

280
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,572
And then she would come home.
You know what she did for a thank you?

she cut open her wrists,

and I'm standing in
Reuben's Butcher Shop on St Viateur.

00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:18,240
And I have this long pigtail
and it has a ribbon in it,

from Saks, in New York City.

He was such a card.

won't be involved with you in any way.
