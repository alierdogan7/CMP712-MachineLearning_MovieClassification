351
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,299
It's actually been banned
in Saudi Arabia for being too safe.

352
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,795
You know, (SIGHS)
this is totally depressing.

353
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,463
Listen, just show me another one.

354
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,299
You know, honestly, I don't even want
to show you anything anymore'

355
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,305
Don't be like that.

356
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,811
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

357
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,230
I don't want to be tortured.

358
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,557
You're just, like,
taking all the fun out of it!

359
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,812
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

360
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,819
So either you want the truth
or you want compliments. Decide!

361
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,399
It'd be nice if I got just a little bit
of positive feedback about my tools.

362
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,366
What else you got'?
I'm gonna love the next thing!

363
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,568
I will be supportive.

364
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,161
All right.

365
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,039
Just this. This pours hot fire out on you.

Oh, the Fallujah Firehose!

367
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,035
Someone's got a friend in Syria!

368
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,586
I am pretty proud of it.

369
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,208
There is a new model, you know.

371
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,799
I've got one that works by Bluetooth.

Screw it. Screw it! Screw it!

373
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,050
I'm going to enjoy this now.

Come on! Why won't this catch?

Yo! Average American shopper!

I do not have any money on me,

00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,192
but if you give me your clothes

388
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,397
I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

Hey, hey, oh, oh! Aladeen has got to go!

391
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,287
Hello. I am Admiral General Aladeen

392
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,589
I am here to deliver my speech
to the United Nations.

393
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,507
Look, Admiral, it's too hot for crazy.

394
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,796
How dare you?

- Listen, Tamir is coming right now.
- (SIRENS WAILING)

You're going to be in big trouble.
Here he is.

Tamir! Tamir!

398

Tamir, it was you, you snake!

He's not the legitimate leader!

00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,499
TAMIR: You have rehearsed the speech
I prepared for you?

403
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,579
Yes. But when is
the General coming'?

404
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,000
He's feeling ill.

405
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,340
Does he have worms in his shilshul?

406
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,587
Very possibly.

407
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,670
Admiral General Aladeen preparing

408
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,847
to address the General Assembly
of the United Nations.

409
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,923
An historic moment.

410
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,679
He's approaching the podium.

411
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,261
And he's walked right past the podium.

412
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,474
What is he doing?

413
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
You are making a fool out of me!

414
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,183
Let's bring in Denise,
our U.N. correspondent.

415
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,483
What do you make of that?

416
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,191
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

417
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,693
Every eye in the room
is on him right now.

418
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,196
MIKE: And he's returning to the podium.

419
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,861
And he's fallen off the stage.

420
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,618
What do you make of that, Denise?

421
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,539
You know, he's clearly implying
that the U.N. must fall before him.

422
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,455
MIKE: Drinking from
the pitcher of water directly,

423
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,086
as opposed to
the glass that I'm sure must be up there.

424
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,212
What do you think that means?

425
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,339
DENISE: Again,
it's another attempt to say,

426
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,637
"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules. "

427
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,385
And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.

428
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,100
MIKE: I believe he just urinated
in the pitcher.

429
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,802
- (CROWD GASPS IN DISGUST)
- Oh!

430
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,558
He is now drinking his urine.

431
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,477
DENISE: It looks to be his own urine.

432
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,266
Sorry. You want?

on the Israeli delegation.

434
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,857
That might be the ambassador.

435
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,945
He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.

436
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,443
Oh, that's a good one.

437
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,120
Okay, he's returning to the podium.

438
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:54,039
Much has been made
of the hostility between our countries.

439
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,879
With the help of the U.M.,

440
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,546
I will draft a new constitution for Wadiya

441
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,880
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day.

442
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,214

you found is good.

He is almost as dumb as the real guy.

So, Wadiya will become a democracy.

to sell Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

use B.P.'s drilling rigs.

have the lease on our shale reserves.

in densely populated areas.

Then unpopulate them.

which I know you people eat a lot of.

00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,682
Oh, I hope that didn't come off
like a cultural stereotype.

518
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,230
Because I'm, like,
the furthest thing from a racist.

a white boyfriend since high school.

Well, the darker races are less choosy.

521
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,855

Thank you.

Anyway, let me give you the grand tour.

524

we have this amazing organic garden...

Oh, wait. I got it. Humor. Right?

527
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,289
I took a feminist clown workshop once.

528
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,586

I wasn't the best student, but...

531

We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

532
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,760
where we do water birth.
Have you ever seen a water birth?

533
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,395
Not a water birth,
but I've seen a water death.

534

Wow, Was it moving?

535
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,190
There was actually very little movement.

536
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,311
A little wriggling, then two bubbles,
and then a big bloop

537
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,694
and the wallet floats up.

538

00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,087
which is scheduled to be signed

699
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,261
at the Lancaster Penthouse Ballroom
in three days.

700
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,009
Thank you. No further questions.

701
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,601
(CROWD CHEERING)

702
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,484
There is no way we're going to
get anywhere near this hotel

703
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,941
without a security pass.
This is ridiculous.

704
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,364
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

705
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,611
Hiding from that lesbian hobbit.

706
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,204
That woman, you know her?

707
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,415
I cannot begin to tell you
what an honor it is

708
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,367
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

709
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,747
Well, of course.

710
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,124
And the mafroom for this signing.

711
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,876
You just paid this month's rent!

712
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,003
ALADEEN: She offered me a job.

713
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,835
Can you imagine that? Me? Working?

714
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,381
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the only
thing that'll get you past security.

715
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,430
Okay, thanks.

716
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,974
Wait a minute.

717
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,180
Wait, her company is catering the event.
She has a security pass!

718
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,560
That is the answer. This is the plan.

719
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,142
Okay? You will take that job
and you will work for her.

720
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,319
I will get you
an identical beard and costume.

721
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,817
And then on the day of the event,

722
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,992
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

723
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,068
You will find the double, switch with him

724
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,621
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

725
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,291
Me? Work for that hairy titted yeti?

WHO cares?

729
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,520
I've come here to apologize

730
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,191
about some of the comments
I may have made about

731
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,321

732
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,274
Great!

733
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,903
And I accept your job offer
as general manager.

734
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,033
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

735
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,489
Well, I can if I killed you.

736

737
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,243
I think I'm starting to get you.

738
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,455
All right, then... I will get you.

739
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,045
Great! Let's get you to work!

740
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,133
Yeah? Hold on one second.

741
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,004
Hey, my man! Excuse me. Hairnet!

742
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,129
Yeah.

743
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,141
I need a little of
the quinoa salad, please,

744
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,140
and throw a couple of
extra cranny-b's on top, if you could,

745
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,143
and I kind of need you to hurry up, chief.
Chop-chop.

746
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Next!

747
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,151
Whoa, whoa! Occupied!

748
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,528
Out. I have to clean.
Come on, out you go, out you go.

- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

750
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,404
Hey, Allison,
can you take out the garbage? Thanks.

751
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,498
Look! One of the customers left a tip of

752
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,006
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it'?

753
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,092
Stop that.

754

Hey, buddy, I saw that.

757
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,461
That is very disrespectful to your leader.

758
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,753
Whatever, dude. Who are you,

Osama bin Laden's best friend?

760
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,006
No, he is not my best friend!

761
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,882
Though he has been staying
in my guest house

762
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,055
ever since they shot his double last year.

763
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,966
Now the guy won't leave.

764
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,269
I know why this guy's
the most hated man in the world.

765
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,345
You just have to go
to the bathroom after him.

766
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,394
You go to the bathroom after Osama,

767
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,226
you will realize
the true meaning of terrorism.

Here is the plan.

We're going to take this helicopter tour

771
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,092
and fly over the Lancaster
to spot its weaknesses.

Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

773

looking at the sights.

Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan, pointy.

Don't do anything
to arouse any suspicions.

Yes, you do,
because you gave them to yourself!

Aladeen Jones and the Temple of Doom

You are a terrible actor.

I urge you, right now,
keep your performance small and real.

Why?

00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,168
Because I think my guy
would be wearing a cloak.

00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,473
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

791
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,549
I need the sheriff's badge.

792

at the old Bull & Bush Pub

and be prepared

- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,252
Okay. So, when we go to fly...

808
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,004
Don't do that with your eyes!

809
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,756
You can't be a Chinese person
on this thing, okay?

No, but you cannot hold your eyes!

Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

813
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,639
because you hold your eyes like that!

00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,183
It's racist, what you are doing!

815
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,807
Do you know it's a fact
that they cannot pronounce their R's?

816
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,058
They pronounce them as L's.

817
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,014
So instead you know
what "rabbit" is in Chinese?

818

I don't know how to speak Chinese.

819
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,526
- It's "labbit."
- It's not "labbit"!

get on this helicopter

to play black then.

will bathe in their own blood!

1386
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,413
(LAUGHS)

1387
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,043
That's your beard?

1388
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,166
No, no, no! It's not my beard.

1389
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,294
My friend chopped the head
off Morgan Freeman.

1390
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,046
It's a hilarious story.
I'll tell you later, okay?

1391
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,884
You are out of your mind. You're insane!

1392
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,970
Well, you download songs
illegally from the Internet.

1393
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,055
So let's not throw stones, okay?

1394
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,145
You're a murderer!

1395
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,518
No, no, no! Zoey, Zoey, Zoey! No.

1396
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,851
You were just using me
to get access to that hotel!

1397
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,151
No!

1398
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,822
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

1399
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,316
Oh, my God!

1400
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,199
I'm canceling that contract tomorrow!

1401
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,906
No, Zoey! What have I ever done wrong?

1402
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,157
You lied to me!

1403
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,664
And you're wanted for war crimes!

1404
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,336
That stuff never sticks.

1405
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,630
You need to leave now.

1406
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,135
You have broken my heart
into Aladeen pieces.

1407

(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

ANCHORMAN: With the signing of
the constitution tomorrow morning,

1409
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,696
democracy in Wadiya is just hours away,

1410
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,123
and people are in the streets celebrating.

1411
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

REPORTER: What do you think of
Admiral General Aladeen?

1415
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,674
We hate him. We hate him.

1416
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,297
You know, when we think of him, we...
(MIMICS VOMITING)

1417
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,975
We vomit, and we spit
and we don't want him.

1418
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,303
What would you say to General
Aladeen if he were watching this?

1419
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,183
I have a message for Aladeen.

1420
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,896
Suevel.

1421
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,646
ALL: (CHANTING) Suevel. Suevel.

1422
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,254
- Good-bye!
- NADAL: Stop, stop, wait!

1423
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,330
What are you doing?

1424
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:21,666
How did you find me?

1425
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,343
You texted me, like, seven times.

1426
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,926
I am executing myself!

1427
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,598
What? Why?

1428
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,304
Because no one has ever loved me!

1429
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,724
Your father would be ashamed of you!

1430
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,431
No, I've realized
I don't want to be like my father!

1431
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,063
In fact,
I don't want to be a dictator anymore!

1432
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,313
What's that now?

1433
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,317
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.

1434
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,236
Have you gone insane?

1435
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,530
I now know that on the outside,

1436
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,986
I am a bit of a cocksucker.

1437
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:53,156
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1438
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,750
- Not really.
- Yes, lam! I'm like mafroom.

1439
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,161
Hard and spiky on the outside,

1440
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,338
but soft and really mushy on the in.

1441
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,883
You're not like mafroom at all.
You're like an onion.

1442
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,134
An outer layer of cocksucker,

1443
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,632
and when you peel it away,

1444
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:10,431
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

1445
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,893
You are such a schmuck!

1446
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,725
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

1447
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,315
What do you mean, "I picked it up"?
Who picks up Yiddish?

1448
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,562
I'm in New York!

1449
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,894
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1450
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,071
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

1451
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,820
their words really sound like
what they're meant to be.

1452
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,742
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get the Evite
to your bar mitzvah?

1453
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:31,990
Oh, my God!

1454
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,117
You've got real chutzpah saying that!

1455
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,415
Look, where has being
a nice guy gotten you, huh?

1456
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,918
Standing on the edge of a bridge
about to commit suicide?

1457
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,085
Still wearing Crocs?

1458
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,167
What's wrong with Crocs?

1459
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,250
They are the universal symbol
of a man who has given up hope!

1460
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,343
You might as well put sweatpants on

1461
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,342
and go to Applebee's
for the rest of your life!

1462
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,348
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

1463
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:57,270
Yes! Listen, if you won't
come down from there for yourself,

1464
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,596
do it for your country.

1465
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,515
If this constitution is signed,

1466
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,818
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1467
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:05,110
What are "civil rights"?

1468
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,647
I'll tell you later. They're hilarious.

1469
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,617
Look, you alone can stop
these terrible things from happening.

1470
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,495
You are the last great dictator!

1471
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,077
All of the others are gone! Qaddafi,

1472
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,784
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1473
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,295
You are right, Nadal.

1474
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,840
I will become the greatest dictator of all,

01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,718
Yes, Supreme Leader!

01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,173
From the mountaintops of North Korea
to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1478
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,510
let every child laborer
and sweatshop factory worker sing,

01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,267
"Oppressed at last! Oppressed at last!

01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:43,437
"Thank Aladeen, I am oppressed at last!"

1481
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,688
Yes! Whoa!

1482
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,064
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1483
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,520
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1484
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,277
Just do like a pull-up.
You know how you do pull-ups'?

1485
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,573
I invented the pull-up.

we are at the Lancaster Hotel,

where in about 20 minutes,

1488
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,670
General Aladeen will be signing
the new Wadiyan constitution.

1489
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,588
Dignitaries from around the world

1490
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:09,588
are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy

1491
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,466
that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape

1492
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,263
of the entire region.

1493
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:17,509

you pee on me.

1496
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,193
Whatever.

1497
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,521
And tell Viggo Mortensen
he is on my radar'

1498
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,360
How do you say, "Fly is in the soup"?

1499
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,285
Ah, gentlemen, Tamir.

1500
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,781
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1501
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,745
Mrs. Lao, it is my very great pleasure.

1502
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,998
No, no, no, no.
She does not speak English.

1503
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,294
- Oh.
- Watch this.

1504
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,623
You ugly horse! (LAUGHS)

1505
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,337
She doesn't know.

1506
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:55,134
"Ohhh." See'?
She goes "Ohhh" all the time. Watch.

1507
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,344
Shaved ape.

1508
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,970
"Ohhh."

1509
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,483
Wait. That is how you intend to get me
across to the Lancaster?

1510
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,825
Absolutely.

1511
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,244
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

1512
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,905
When I was going to assassinate you.

1513
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,414
You mean my double.

1514
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,454
Um...

1515
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,452
Sure. Yeah.

- Here's what you do.
- Okay'

1521
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,387
Zipline across, kill the double,

1522
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,064
and then rip up the constitution
in front of the world's media.

1523
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,140
Piece of cake.

(SCREAMING)

1525

Hello, Lancaster!

1526
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,046
I don't understand what has happened.

1527
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,219
My calculations were very precise.

1528
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,846
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1529
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,640
Do you have anything in your pockets?

1530
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,388
Uh, let me check.

1531
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,562
What is that?

1532
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:28,935
It's Vita Coco water.

1533
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,058
Why do you have Vita Coco water?

1534
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,815
Because it has
as much potassium as three bananas.

1535
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,487
The line is still too heavy.

1536
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,985
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

1537
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,828
Oh, you're kidding. So then
why did you bring three bananas?

1538
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,533
Because I don't trust the advertising.
I'm naturally suspicious.

1539
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,660
Is there anything else you're carrying?
You're still too heavy.

1540
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,869
Just this.

1541
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,831
What is that, a brick?

1542
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,337
All this time you've had a brick?
Why do you have that?

1543
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,340
Well, to balance out the weight
from the other one.

1544
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,671
You have two bricks?

1545
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:00,800
Yes!

1546
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,381
Throw them down immediately!

1547
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,841
Ow'

1548
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,396
Oh, my God!
There's a little goat eating the wire!

1549
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,276
You need to lose weight immediately!

1550
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,229
My pockets are empty. I could poo.

1551
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,197
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1552
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,822
Yes, it will. I haven't gone since Wadiya.

1553
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,528
Losing power

1727
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,192
Do you want me to say this
in front of his widow?

1728
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,318
I was his lover.

1729
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,899
No. That is not true.

1730
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,318
I saw him perform with the Globetrotters.

1731
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:50,904
I thought he was outstanding.
I befriended him.

1732
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,115
No, it's a different person.

1733
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,543
His message of don't worry
and being happy

1734
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:57,790
was so powerful.

1735
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,122
No, this is Bobby McFerrin.
I told you this outside.

1736
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,458
Whatever the scandal you went through,

1737
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,383
you're still the best golfer in the world.

1738
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,631
Let's go.

That's some good head!

(LAUGHS)

1750
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,199
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

1751
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,579
How did it feel for you?
How did it feel for you?

1752
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,457
I prefer it with goats.

1753
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,708
Where is the Supreme Leader?

1754
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,789
No, no.

1755
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:45,295
Now that is called payback!

Don't touch it.

1759
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,103
You don't have to touch it.

1760
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,225
Sorry. I was...

1761
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,147
Just give us... We don't...

1762
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:03,147
Just give me
a couple of millimeters to myself.
