[UP-TEMPOED REMIX OF BING CROSBY'S
"WHITE CHRISTMAS" PLAYING]

2
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:52,899
Hi.

3
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:54,494
Hi.

4
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,073
My name is Kent. What's your name?

5
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,173
- Daphne.
- Daphne? That's a really beautiful name.

6
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,208
It sounds like the name of a flower.

7
00:01:02,378 --> 00:01:05,108
I know it's not a flower,
but it sounds like it could be.

8
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,381
I like flowers.

9
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,385
Smelling them, or sending them
to people and stuff. It's good.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,759
Where you from?

11
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:21,129
- Connecticut.
- Oh, really? I'm a big fan of Connecticut.

12
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,855
I'm a big... Who isn't, right?

13
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:26,126
You're close enough to the city
that you can really enjoy it...

14
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,361
...but far enough away
for a small-town feel.

15
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,302
- Did you go to school out there?
- Yeah. I went to Wesleyan.

16
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,032
Perfect. That's a great school.

17
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,336
- What did you major in?
- Psychology.

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,638
That's great.

19
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,407
Those are really beautiful earrings,
by the way.

20
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,516
They do a nice job
of complementing your...

21
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,745
I'm gonna stop you right there.
On paper, you've done everything right.

22
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:50,256
You took an interest in my personal history,
complimented my accessories...

23
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,894
...blah, blah, blah.

24
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,355
If we'd met in college, we probably
would have had a relationship...

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,864
...which I'd come to regret...

26
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,595
...because I'd have found out that you're
as boring and polite in the bedroom...

27
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,433
...as you have been during
this god-awful conversation.

28
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,768
- Okay, Daphne...
- lf I wanted an asexual pen pal...

29
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:08,433
...you'd be at the top of my list.

30
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,442
We could just iChat all night long.

31
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,581
"LOL." Giggles.

32
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,445
But, unfortunately,
that's not what I'm looking for.

33
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:18,781
I want a man whose hand doesn't shake
when he puts it up my shirt.

34
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,388
You know what I'm saying?

35
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:26,020
- Okay, Daphne, if I could interject for a...
- Save it, Kent. I'm not looking for a BFF.

36
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:27,595
Daphne, please.

37
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,522
Bitch, I'm talking to you.

38
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,235
- What did you call me?
- I didn't stutter.

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,999
Oh, you sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut...

40
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,698
...but can you deliver the goodies?

41
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,408
I don't give a damn about Connecticut.

42
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,043
I hate those cheap earrings.

43
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,945
I'm from North Dakota...

44
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:51,917
...and this is how we handle our business
in the Bison State, mama.

45
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,513
Get your hands off me right now...

46
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,387
...or I'll take you to your knees
in front of this entire bar.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,925
Promise?

48
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,338
GIRL:
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

49
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,605
BRAD: Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing! Get on there.

50
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,078
Here we come! Watch out.

51
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,195
BRAD:
What a beautiful view.

52
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,005
So this is where you live?

53
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:49,368
This is where you live too, honey.
Come on.

54
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:57,375
KATE: What'd you think about Daphne?
- I really liked Daphne.

55
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,577
KATE: You did?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:58,755 --> 00:03:59,779
Definitely naughty.

57
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,192
- She was a lot naughty, but in a fun way.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,451
Did you like Kent?

59
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,889
KATE: Kent was hot.
- Really?

60
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:09,725
- Those glasses were a nice touch.
- I started feeling the Great Plains vibe.

61
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,231
Like he was an angry cowboy
who drives a van.

62
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,870
- Hot.
- But has ninja equipment at his apartment.

63
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,739
He had a lot happening, Kent.
You know what I mean?

64
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,774
- He's like a Transformer.
- I might need to meet Kent again.

65
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,879
Come here, toothpaste and all.

66
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,206
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you, Brad.

67
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,872
You're the best girl in the world.

68
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,516
INSTRUCTOR:
Ready, and...

69
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,680
...slow, quick, quick, slow.

70
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,701
INSTRUCTOR: Brad, streamlined arms.
Kate, hold your frame.

71
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,427
A one and a two.

72
00:04:57,947 --> 00:04:59,881
Let's get these off of you.

73
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,573
That was fun.

74
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,616
- That feels good.
- It's the acupressure.

75
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,583
- Really?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

76
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,047
This stuff is connected to all
different stuff inside your tummy.

77
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,886
- I know.
- Lf I push the wrong thing...

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,153
- Do you know what that's for?
- Not till later.

79
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,298
- Okay?
- So when's the big day?

80
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,466
KATE: Hm?
- I'm sorry?

81
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,966
We're getting married
in the spring in South Carolina.

82
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,731
- What about you guys?
- Oh, we're not getting married.

83
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,398
WOMAN: Oh.
- So why are you taking dance classes?

84
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,044
That's just one of many things...

85
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,077
...that we do together.
- Yeah, it's fun.

86
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,272
I can't think of anything
we don't do together.

87
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,849
Right. So why wouldn't
you wanna get married?

88
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,816
- Well, we're happy.
- We're happy.

89
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,147
And I love her, so...

90
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,450
Marriage just brings pressure
and stress and all kinds of stuff.

91
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,786
We don't want our relationship
to turn into work.

92
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,987
We wanna be together because
we enjoy it, not because we have to.

93
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,758
There's a reason
that they use the expressions:

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,662
"Tying the knot" or "ball and chain."

95
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,167
Have you listened to the words
of a marriage ceremony?

96
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,068
Like, "I promise to obey"?
Or, "Till death do us part"?

97
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,936
I'd rather be stuck on an island...

98
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,340
...with some weird millionaire hunting me
and me trying to escape...

99
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,447
...than be involved with those slogans.

100
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,277
That's like a time bomb
waiting to explode.

101
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,676
What about children?
You want to make them, no?

102
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,150
- No.
- No. No.

103
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,516
- I don't wanna make them.
KATE: Uh-uh.

104
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,989
I just don't wanna, like,
be responsible for this kid...

105
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,187
...and hurt their feelings
and disappoint them.

106
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,161
That's what happened with our families.

107
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,562
We're both from divorced families.
We've seen it.

108
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,498
We don't need to repeat the pattern.

109
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,537
But, anyway,
congratulations on getting married.

110
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,765
That sounds really cool,
and to each their own.

111
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,102
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,711
BRAD: Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

113
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,695
Big Bad Brad.

114
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,503
ERIC: How you guys doing?
- Look at this. How are you?

115
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,472
- You remember my girlfriend.
- How are you?

116
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,042
- Stan and Eric.
- Good to see you.

117
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,578
So, what are you guys doing
for Christmas?

118
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,307
I've got the entire family flying in.

119
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,679
Thirteen airport pickups.

120
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,550
Four days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

121
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:24,056
My brother thinks his daughter,
the 4-year-old...

122
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,751
...is gonna be the next Beyonce.

123

[HUMMING]

124
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:32,233
She's bad. And she sucks.

125
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,897
I'm vacationing in tropical Albany
this year with Trish's family.

126
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,837
They got us a cot, which is awesome.

127
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,775
But we'll probably sleep on the musty couch
in the basement with the cats...

128
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,538
...all seven of them.

129
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,683
Oh, and we get to be there
the whole week.

130
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,715
Kind of sounds like a prison sentence.

131
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,547
Why do you put yourselves
through that?

132
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,521
- It's Christmas, right? Don't you have to?
- We don't need to do it anymore.

133
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,421
- And we absolutely don't do it anymore.
- We're done.

134
00:07:58,594 --> 00:07:59,754
Why, what are you doing?

135
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,954
We're going to Fiji. Just the two of us.

136
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,962
- Fiji?
KATE: Yeah.

137
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,623
Don't your families get upset?

138
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,632
You tell them you're doing charity work.

139
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,966
You know, something like building houses
in Third World countries.

140
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,199
Teaching English in Puerto Rico.

141
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,307
Delousing orphans in Somalia.

142
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,538
Helping Chinese kids capture lobsters...

143
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,309
...boil them, cut them,
clean the weird stuff out of the middle.

144
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:26,216
We find that the more details you give
kind of throws them off the scent.

145
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,590
You lie to your families at Christmastime?

146
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,125
You really can't spell
"families" without "lies."

147
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,819
Try it.

148
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,923
But don't you ever feel guilty?

149
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,966
For taking a vacation on our vacation?
No, not really.

150
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,003
- You do look pretty sexy with a tan.
- Thanks, babe.

151
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,804
You can take this guy.
Take this guy and cover him here.

152
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,774
- Like that.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

153
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:54,847
By the way, I made a couples' massage
for us when we get in.

154
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,678
You did? That's great.

155
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,785
I should probably
check us in online after this.

156
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,788
- Did it.
- You checked us in already?

157
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,449
You're the best, sweetheart.

158
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,187
I picked up those noise-canceling
headphones you wanted.

159
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,456
- You did not.
- It's next to your travel pillow.

160
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,691
- Oh, my God, I kept hinting.
- I'm excited.

161
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,995
We should probably sign up for
the scuba boat as soon as we get there...

162
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,264
...because I hear it fills up really quick.

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,375
Don't you ever feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

164
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:25,037
Scuba diving and... We did that
in Bali and Costa Rica and Hawaii and...

165
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:28,183
Baby, this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

166
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,184
That's a whole different island
and the resort is beautiful...

167
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,879
...and the scuba diving there

that you had to see that.

332
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,049
Let me apologize for them.

333
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:31,488
If you want to say "mistletoe"
because it's too heavy for you, I get it.

334
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,218
Don't feel weird about that.

335
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,455
If you need to leave, you let me know
what your comfort zone is.

336
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,065
Because that was weird.

337
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,827
I cannot believe you did not tell me
your real name.

338
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,561
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,739
It's crazy. We've been together for 3 years,
and I don't know your real name.

340
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,242
- Doesn't that strike you as odd?
- No, it doesn't strike me as odd.

341
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,141
I hated my name, so I changed it.

342
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,839
You don't say, "My name
used to be Asshole, but it's Bob."

343
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,109
You say, "My name's Bob."

344
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,812
Maybe to a stranger on the street, but to
somebody you're sharing your life with?

345
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,923
- You tell them your real name.
- I don't wanna get into this now.

346
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,889
This is what I was afraid
would happen if we came here.

347
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,325
This isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

348
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:11,193
Your real name isn't "Asshole"?
It's not your middle name?

349
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,392
- I don't wanna be blindsided again.
- Oh, that's very funny.

350
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,094
Go ahead and take a shot at me.

351
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,297
It's bad enough with those Neanderthals.
I gotta take it from you?

352
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,375
No, you shouldn't.

353
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,807
And you shouldn't let them
walk all over you either.

354
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:28,449
Kate, they are trained UFC fighters.
They know pressure points on people.

355
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,107
But you're twice their size.

356
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,276
They're semiprofessional cage fighters.

357
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,979
One person comes out, one doesn't.
You know what I mean?

358
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:38,786
- Like cockfighting, but, like, with dudes.
- You said they were personal trainers.

359
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,657
- They're dude cockfighters.
- Like that thing on pay-per-view?

360
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,266
Yes, exactly.
Except they don't actually get paid for it.

361
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,029
They mostly brawl in people's back yards,
then upload the footage to You Tube.

362
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:53,206
Honey, my childhood was just like
The Shawshank Redemption.

363
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,572
Except I didn't have some kind, older,
soft-spoken gentle black man...

364
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,474
...to share my struggle with.

365
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,979
But you're not that child anymore, okay?

366
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:05,051
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

367
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,984
Okay, I really don't wanna get into this.

368
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:10,920
Let me just let you know the truth.
They're intimidated by you.

369
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,829
What you need to do is go out there
and set some healthy boundaries...

370
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,693
...and demand that they respect you.
You know what I'm saying?

371
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,302
DENVER: Big City, time to open presents.
HOWARD: Come on, son. We gotta go!

372
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,667
This is your opportunity.
You can do this, baby.

373
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,700
BRAD:
Mm-hm.

374
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,073
Okay, gentlemen.

375
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,615
Can we just take it down a notch, please?

376
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:39,117
I'm not a kid. You can't
talk to me like that anymore.

377
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,915
We're adults. Do you understand?

378
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,819
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest. Right?

379
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,189
There's going to be certain boundaries
that will exist between us now.

380
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:50,729
They might be invisible, so I know
that you won't be able to see them...

381
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,232
...but you'll certainly be able to respect
the fact that they're there.

382
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,399
These boundaries are not to be crossed.

383
00:20:57,572 --> 00:20:59,631
And if they are crossed...

384
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,333
...there's gonna be
real consequences to that.

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,604
Thank you.

386
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,779
BRAD: Ow! Oh, God.
- Welcome to the Octagon, son!

387
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:16,816
Don't! Stop it! Where you taking...? Ow!

388
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,627
- What's happening?
DALLAS: Suplex!

389
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,529
Oh, my God.

390
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,758
BRAD:
Ah!

391
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,064
- Oh, God!
- Dad, tag us in.

392
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,071
- You boys get hurt, I lose custody again.
- Tag them in!

393
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,799
COD Y: Come on, Daddy.
CONNOR: Tag us in.

394
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,569
DALLAS: Merry Christmas.
- Yes.

395
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:37,803
Bring it!

396
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,806
DENVER:
Yeah! Get it!

397
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,984
Yeah! Yeah!

398
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,377
Ah!

399
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,647
- Google me, bitch!
- What?

400
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,656
Google me! You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

401
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,523
- No!
- Enough roughhousing!

402
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,060
Stop!

403
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,326
Let's open the presents so Orlando
can get to his other Christmases, all right?

404
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's do it.

405
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,671
That was excellent.

406
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,337
Baby?

407
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:12,003
It's me, it's me.

408
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,449
Are you okay? Did you break anything?

409
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,049
I am so proud of you.

410
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,353
Lando, you're closest to the tree.
You distribute.

411
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,459
Gosh, wasn't it just so hard to find gifts
under the $ 10 cap this year?

412
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,297
The first gift is to Connor.

413
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,598
- The $ 10 what?
- $ 10 spending cap.

414
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,674
From Uncle Brad
and his special friend Kate.

415
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,243
Maybe this will make you think
about being mean to your nice uncle...

416
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,075
...after you see what he got you.
Go ahead, open it up.

417
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,540
KATE: Brad.
- Yeah.

418
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,050
- What?
- Xbox? This is awesome, man!

419
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,586
Top-shelf for you, pal.

420
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,725
It's got the triple-core processor,
wireless controllers, the whole deal.

421
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,485
There was a $ 10 spending cap.

422
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,391
How in the hell did you find
an Xbox for under $ 10?

423
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,364
Somebody's trying to show off
how much money he makes.

424
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,933
- Yeah.
- Maybe someone's family...

425
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,332
...didn't tell him there was
a $ 10 spending cap.

426
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,337
Maybe if you came home
more than once a decade, you'd know that.

427
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,600
Okay, guys, can we try
to stay positive here?

428
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,677
What's the problem? We're trying
to give gifts to some children.

429
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,337
It's Christmas.
Let's keep the momentum going here.

430
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,609
Okay, the next gift is to Cody.

431
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:28,688
And this is from your dad. Okay?
I'm sure this is a good gift too, okay?

432
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,653
Dig in there. Tear it up.

433
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,522
A flashlight? That's it?

434
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,362
- Why don't you love me, Daddy?
BRAD: Okay, okay.

435
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,837
Honestly, I think it's my fault. I didn't
know there was a $ 10 spending cap.

436
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,976
Well, my gift from Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

437
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:51,271
BRAD: I have a feeling that
your gift from Santa...

438
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,641
...will probably ring in
right around $ 10 too.

439
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,808
- Why? Is Santa Claus cheap like my daddy?
BRAD: No, Santa is Dad.

440
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,154
- Dad just goes ahead and writes "Santa"...
- Lando.

441
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,549
BRAD:
What? I don't understand.

442
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,927
What's happening? What's happening?

443
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:10,059
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- There's no Santa Claus?

444
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,565
Okay. You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding with me.

445
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:16,137
They know there's not a Santa Claus,
right?

446
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,565
- They do now.
- How can you lie to us, Daddy?

447
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,404
BRAD: There is a Santa Claus.
- Cody, come on, man.

448
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,546
COD Y:
Even Santa Claus don't love me!

449
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,013
Hey! That's not gonna bring back Santa.
That's not gonna bring...

450
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,915
When he hurts inside and can't use
his emotion words, he takes to streaking.

451
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,745
COD Y:
Ah!

452
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,589
Don't worry. He always comes back.

453
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,989
COD Y:
Nobody loves me!

454
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:44,997
Okay, look. I'm really, really, really sorry.
I just assumed...

455
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,498
All right. All right.

456
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,967
Let's keep it moving. I'm starting
to lose my buzz over here.

457
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:51,997
All right?

458
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,608
- What's this one here?
- You're gonna love this puppy.

459
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:58,337
HOWARD: Yeah?
KATE: That's a satellite dish, Howard.

460
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,775
Why would I want a satellite?

461
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:02,508
Dad, it's not a satellite.
It's a satellite dish.

462
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:05,585
It's terrific because you got more channels,
more viewing options.

463
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,881
You don't think I get enough channels?

464
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,856
Well, your TV right now is a radio, so...

465
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:15,189
Wait. How much is this gift
gonna cost me a month?

466
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:19,456
It won't cost... We're paying
for the services, so nothing, actually.

467
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,966
Wait, wait, wait. Just because
I drive a combine for a living...

468
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,403
...doesn't mean I need me
a fancy-pants lawyer son paying my bills.

469
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:30,067
You win. If you wanna pay for the stuff,
pay for it. Whatever you want.

470
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:32,907
The installation guy comes on Tuesday.
He'll install it.

471
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,572
Cancel it. We install things ourselves
in this house.

472
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,811
Dad? I think you'll want a professional
to handle this technology...

473
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:43,253
If you think I'm going to allow
a sex predator in a uniform...

474
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:46,553
...to wander around my house
and touch my underwear...

475
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:50,255
...you got another thing coming.
No. No, no, no.

476
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,458
I'll see you topside in 5.
All three of you on the roof.

477
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,967
SUSAN: Let's go.
- Okay.

478
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,603
Here, bring her to her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

479
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:02,970
Why don't you just...?

480
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,510
Do you wanna go over to your mom?

481
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,472
Yeah. Okay, come here.

482
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,743
Be careful. There you go.

483
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,149
SUSAN: Ain't it nice having everybody
home for the holidays?

484
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,017
Yes. It is.

485
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:20,823
SUSAN: We're gonna make bologna
sandwiches, I think.

486
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:28,465
Okay. Here we go. Okay.

487
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,703
- Take it before it explodes.
- Thank you.

488
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,536
I gotta go do some man's work.

489
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:47,980
You gotta use a locknut on that.

490
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,716
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any locknut.

I have been present.
I've been here all day.

991
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,463
We've been doing things
alongside each other...

992
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:02,199
...but I would like for us
to do some things together.

993
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:06,540
I think you're upset with your family,
and I think you're taking it out on me.

994
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:09,113
- I've been upset with them for years.
- It's not fun!

995
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,615
This is not about my family.
This is about you and me.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

997
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:16,288
I just want something different for us.

998
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,822
- Merry Christmas, stranger.
- Mom!

999
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:20,522
God, I've missed you.

1000
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:22,786
- Good to see you, Mom.
- Oh, it's been so long.

1001
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:25,722
- And you must be Kate.
- Yes.

1002
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,628
Oh, she's darling.

1003
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:30,734
- It's wonderful to meet you.
- Thank you. It's nice to meet you.

1004
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:34,465
- So should I call you...?
- Just call me Paula. Just Paula.

1005
00:56:34,674 --> 00:56:37,006
I am so glad you came.

1006
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:40,968
Looks like you've taken good care of him.
Certainly hasn't missed many meals.

1007
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,377
- Oh, that's great.
KATE: He likes to snack.

00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:44,642
PAULA: Yes, he does.
- I do.

Well, come on in and relax.

I've fixed all of your favorite dishes,

Denver and Susan are watching TV, so let's
just sit here and catch up for a minute.

KATE: Your house is beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

KATE:
This is gorgeous.

1014
00:56:57,097 --> 00:56:59,565
Well, you knew Bradford lived with me
after the divorce.

1015
00:56:59,732 --> 00:57:02,064
Denver and Dallas
were more comfortable with Howard...

1016
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:05,033
...but Bradford
was the more sensitive type.

1017
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:08,672
Oh, we were just best friends.
Just inseparable.

1018
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,436
My God, he breast-fed until he was 5.

1019
00:57:11,611 --> 00:57:14,546
- Thought I'd have to take you to college.
- We've had enough...

1020
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:18,241
The only one who was on my tits more
was a professor I dated after his father.

1021
00:57:18,418 --> 00:57:21,387
- Can you not say "tits," please?
- Hey, kids!

1022
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:22,885
Oh, Kate, this is Darryl.

1023

Hi, nice to meet you.

1024
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:27,392
It is so nice to meet you, young lady.

And always great to see you, big guy!
Hey, how was traffic getting out here, huh?

1026
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:36,902
You know what?
I'd really like to get your gas money.

1027
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,971
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money, thank you.

1028
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,802
I make a lot more than you do,
so no, thank you.

1029
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,069
Bradford, be nice.

It's okay, sweetie.

Look, Brad...

1032
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:54,948
...I'm not trying to be your father.

1033
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:57,048
You already got one of those.

1034
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,651
I'm just hoping for a chance
to be your friend.

1035
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:04,128
You were my friend, Darryl.
You were my best friend.

1036
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:08,327
We grew up together, we rode bikes
together. We'd smell each other's hands.

1037
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:12,403
Now you're sleeping with my mom, and
it's weird for me. Can you appreciate that?

1038
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,632
I never had a sexual thought
about your mom until I was 30.

1039
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:18,208
Can you leave it alone?
You can't be my friend anymore.

1040
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:21,643
You can't be sleeping with my mom
and still be my friend, okay?

1041
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,076
Is anybody else thirsty?

1042
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,274
- Kate, what can I get you to drink?
- I'm good.

1043
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:27,578
Your mother is a very sexual being, Brad.

1044
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,745
- She's a very what?
- She's a great lover and...

1045
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,016
Say that again
and I'll bust your mouth open.

1046
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:35,525
Look it, this is Christmas,
and we are not gonna go there.

1047
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:38,687
Kate has been kind enough
to send us some games...

1048
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:41,698
...and we are gonna play them,
and we're gonna have fun. Okay?

1049
00:58:50,472 --> 00:58:53,464
Why are you staring at me
when you eat the wings?

1050
00:58:53,642 --> 00:58:55,269
It's uncomfortable.

1051
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:00,309
Connor, honey, don't eat those brownies.
Those are my special brownies.

1052
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,613
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

1053
00:59:04,787 --> 00:59:06,186
Oh, of course.

1054

Get your teammate
to say the word on the top of the card...

1055

...but you can't say
any of the words listed beneath.

1056
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:14,627
And if you say any of the taboo words
then you get buzzed.

1057
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:16,492
Okay? Does that make sense?

1058
00:59:16,665 --> 00:59:20,897
I'm so excited to have you all here to play
this game together. It'll be so much fun.

1060
00:59:25,174 --> 00:59:26,641
So who wants to go first?

1061
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,071
- I'll go.
- Okay.

1062
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:30,473
Brad, why don't you buzz your mom...

1063
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:32,079
...and then I'll do the timer?

1064
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:33,679
Thanks.

1065
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:36,913
On your mark, get set...

eat while you play that?

You don't have to say the answer.

You say something like "an eight-legged
animal," or like "a superhero..."

Can't say "superhero."

- Let's just try again.

Okay. In high school, my senior year
spring break I was in Cancun.

1135

I was wearing this bikini top,
I'd lost all this weight.

1136

- Tourist. Skinny.
- And... No, no, no.

1137
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:21,516
- Thin?
- No, I was on the bar, shaking around...

- Dancer.
- My stuff fell out. All the bartenders...

1139

- Your what fell out?
- My stuff.

1140
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:27,747
Everybody would call me
when I went to the bar.

1141
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,515
They'd say: "Oh, here comes..."?

1142
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,059
Peek-a-boo.

1143
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,054
Peek-a-boo.

like, "look." Or like something...

Can't say "look."

- Let's go.
- Lf I have the thing...

She said the answer.

that you would eat...

...and you put it on the barbeque.

1154
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:00,946
- Chicken.
- My favorite...

1155
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:02,249
- Beef.
- Can't say "beef"!

No attitude, I've shut down.

She buzzes me, I'm explaining
to you how to play the game...

1169
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:36,985
...you obviously don't understand
the ways to play the game...

1170
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:38,285
...and I'm shutting down.

1171

- You do?
- I don't want you to apologize for it.

1174
01:04:03,986 --> 01:04:07,752
Because love means never having to say
that you're sorry. You know what I mean?

1175
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,686
But for the record, I do forgive you.

1176
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:12,327
But when you're playing board games...

1177
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:15,657
...you shouldn't go so conceptual,
you do wanna go a lot more literal.

1178
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:19,198
- But how else will you know unless you...?
- No. I took a pregnancy test today.

1179
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:21,961
You took what?

1180
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,498
I took a pregnancy test today.

1182
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:28,172
It was in my sister's bag...

1183
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:32,109
...and I'd been a couple days late,
so I thought I should probably take a test...

1184

- Honey, you pulled the goalie?
- What?

1185
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:37,341
You can't pull the goalie without
checking with your team.

is about.

Well, what are you talking about?

1188
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,550
Relax, Brad, it was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1189
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:47,661
Why don't you just hit me with that
right from the start...

1190
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:50,195
...versus making me take laps
around the anxiety pool?

1191
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:52,328
What is this reaction?

1192
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:56,130
If there's one thing we learned by being
forced to be with our families today...

1193
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:59,069
...it's about the dangers of procreating.
All right?

1194
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:02,972
- Besides, that's not what we want in life.
- No, Brad, I realized it today.

1195
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:06,046
I thought I'd always known
I didn't wanna have kids.

1196
01:05:06,214 --> 01:05:10,116
Then I took the test, waited to see if it's
positive or negative, and thought...

1197
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:13,413
For just a second I felt different,
you know?

1198
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:15,351
I felt hopeful.

1199
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:20,518
Like maybe it would just happen and
we'd be forced to get over all of our fears.

1200
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:24,228
We've spent so much of our relationship
creating all these boundaries.

1201
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:28,028
Making sure that we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility and obligation.

1202
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:31,070
I don't wanna live like that anymore.
That's not loving at all.

Is that an '80s song?

- No, Brad.
- Are you throwing '80s songs?

however it's gonna be.

we get married, or have kids one day...

You already destroyed

You wanna bust up my kitchen as well?

I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean
to do that. I was just trying to...

...she's not with me.
- Oh.

She finally smelled
the pathetic on you, did she?

1321
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,034
No.

1322
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:26,544
In fact, she said that she wanted
to get more serious with me.

1323
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:29,877
Yeah, she said that,
you know, she loved me...

...and she wanted to see herself having
a family with me. Having kids with me.

Well, congratulations.
That what you wanna hear?

- But I said no, Dad.
- You what?

01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:47,333
Yeah, I told her
I didn't wanna get married.

Hey.

01:16:15,183 --> 01:16:16,207
Okay, listen:

1355
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:20,049
If you get one, you might as well get two,
because they're like dogs.

1356
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:21,716
What are you talking about?

1357
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:25,154
Kids. If you leave one by itself at home,
you'll never leave...

1358
01:16:25,326 --> 01:16:27,726
...because you'll feel guilty
about it being by itself.

1359
01:16:27,895 --> 01:16:30,864
With two, you don't feel bad
because they got someone to play with.

1360

The other thing
to think about is school.

If you send them to private school
you got sweater vest and lacrosse all day.

1362
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:40,304
But with public school, you worry
about some hyperactive art student...

...hopped up on medication,
trying to shank the little guy.

And that's uncomfortable too.

1365

Are you having this conversation with me
because you're comfortable having it?

1366

Or just because you wanna go to Fiji?

I wanna go to Fiji.

The tickets are already paid for
and the hotel rooms aren't transferable.

But, honey, I do feel comfortable now,
I think, having this conversation.

1370
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:04,197
Because, in my heart,
I know that I found...

...the one person in life that I wanna
have these conversations with.

And that person's you.
I love you so much.

01:17:18,713 --> 01:17:20,840
So this doesn't mean we're getting married...

...or having kids right away.
- No, no, no.

But we should talk about it,
because these things happen.

Yeah. They're wonderful.
They give you love unconditionally...

- Chores for money.

Then we find an appropriate time.

- Okay, babe.

getting married or having kids right away.

to let love grow where it wants to grow.

To be honest, they'd be shocked
to even hear Kate was pregnant.
