Yeah, my favorite
Christmas tradition

5
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,332
is trimming the hellraiser.

6
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,184
Guys, I found something
we can watch together

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,752
for Christmas this year.

8
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:20,272

and so critically reviled

10
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,127
that after it aired, the creator
has his knighthood revoked.

11
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,612
That sounds terrible.

12
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,247
I want to watch it twice,

13
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:30,249
but I'm spending Christmas
with my relatives.

14
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:33,118
Or rather, I'm spending
the day with my relatives

15
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:34,770
while they refuse
to acknowledge Christmas.

16
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,556
You Jehovah's Witnesses--
so severe.

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,558
Andre and I will be spending
Christmas giving gifts

18
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,493
to the more persuadable
of our Jewish friends.

19
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:43,946
I wouldn't call an unannounced
visit from your pastor "a gift."

20
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,397
And don't bother this year.

21
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,949
I'll be at the movies
with my bubbe.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,468
You're not taking both of them?

this Christmas.

This semester has been so long
and dark and angry.

00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:57,743
I was thinking we could have

28
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,044
some light-hearted fun
as a family.

29
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,212
I think what we've learned,
Abed,

30
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:02,514
is that attempts to make
the holidays brighter

31
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,183
tend to give them
a certain darkness.

32
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:05,718
