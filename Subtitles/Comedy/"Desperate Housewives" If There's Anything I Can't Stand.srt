<i>that guy wouldn't be around

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,350
i didn't want poor aunt lily

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,800

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,750
<i>it occurred to her</i>

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,800
<i>the neighborhood looked
exactly as she had left it.</i>

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>she then decided</i>

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,900
<i>she should have
painted her house blue.</i>

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,450
<i>moments later,</i>

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>she wondered if she would
see her husband in heaven.</i>

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,250
<i>these are just
some of the thoughts</i>

21

an old woman's mind</i>

<i>when she comes home to die.</i>

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,250
now if you need anything,

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,850
you just ring this little bell,
and i'll come running.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,300
i'm sorry to be
so much trouble.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
well, the good news is,

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
i-i won't be a burden
much longer.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,750
oh, don't say that.

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,050
the doctors say
there's a good chance

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,950
that you'll be with us
for a very long time.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,500
i know what's
happening to me, katherine.

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
you don't need to lie.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,950
aunt lily...

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,950
mm.

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,050
what does it feel like?

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,800
dying, i mean.

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,700
it's not that bad.

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
i feel lucky.

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,350
when you know
time is running out,

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,200
you--you get a chance
to reflect on your life.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,200
i-i really did try
to live a good one.

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,400
you did more than try.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,050
god is going to welcome you
with open arms.

44
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,850
i'm not so sure.

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,200
oh, why would
you say that?

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,400
i keep thinking
about dylan...

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
what we did,
what we covered up.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
we did what we had to.

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,650
we should have told someone.

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,650
we couldn't. you know that.

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,550
it--it was a mistake,

52
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,400
and it's not too late
to rectify it.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,450
your life may be over,

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,750
but that does not
give you the right

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,950
to go around
destroying the lives of others.

56
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,850
i can't go to my grave
with this on my conscience.

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,050
please! we have
to tell that girl

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,300
what happened
in this room.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,700
absolutely not.

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>as her guilt over
the past began to mount,</i>

do not apologize for me.
lee, you're the one who said

113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,100
you know, 'cause you folks
can't have kids.

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,650
<i>i mean, uh, i mean,
of course you can have kids,</i>

115
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,250
um, you--you know,
because times have changed,

116
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,950

124
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,800
i have a delivery
for danielle van de kamp.

125
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,100
can i get you
to sign here, please?

126
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,350
is that for us?
no, it's for danielle.

127
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,150
there you are.
thank you.

128
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,450
that's odd. who would
send her a scooter?

129
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,550
i knew it!
phyllis--rex's mother.

130
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,650
ever since he died,

131
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,850
she's been trying to buy
the children's affection.

132
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,750
wow. well, it's
a honey of a bike.

133
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,050
i'm sure danielle
will appreciate the thought.

134
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,750
well, i'm not
giving it to her.

135
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,850
can you think of a worse present
for a pregnant girl?

136
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,950
well, i'm not knocked up.
let me have it.

137
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,850
you know how i feel about
2-wheeled motorized vehicles.

138
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,200
they're too dangerous.

139
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,500
we'll donate it to the church.

140
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,450
what?!
reverend sikes said

141
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,650
they're looking for items for
the raffle.
so we're just gonna??

142
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,200
well, it's better than
you breaking your neck on it.

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,950
mom, you know how much
i want a scooter. come on.

144
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,150
you heard your mother.
we're donating it to the church.

145
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,450
of course, we need to make sure
it's in good working order

146
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,150
before we do that.
(starts engine)

147
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,250
not without a helmet.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,650
this blows. are we gonna
let her do this to us?

149
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,950
absolutely not.

150
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,400
if we win that raffle,
we're keeping it.

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,050
hey.

152
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,750
it is nice to
hear you humming again.

153
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,850
well, it's amazing what
a week without chemo can do.

154
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,050
yeah. when does
the last round start?

155
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,650
next month,
so i have some time

156
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,850
before i start feeling
like total crap again.

157
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,950
and i was hoping we could
put that time to good use.

158
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,500
are you sure?

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,650
i mean, the doctor said

160
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,250
it could be months
before you get your mojo back.

161
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,400
well, it's back.

162
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,850
and since when
do you question the mojo?

163
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,450
you're right.
you're right. forgive me.

164
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,850
okay, so here
are your options.

165
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,750
"a," we could go romantic,

166
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,950
play soft music,
light some candles,

167
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,000
or "b," go straight
to the--whoa!

168
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,050
(kisses) god,
it's so been so long.

169
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,250
i hope i remember
how to do this.

170
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,450
well, it's just like riding
a bike. you never forget.

171
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,800
now start pedaling.

172
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
hey. mmm.

173
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,650
hey. what are you doing? ooh,
sorry.
i just messed up your hair.

174
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
i'm just trying to fix it.
ow!

175
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,000
sorry. al-almost got it.
hey! (laughs)

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
whoa. hey.

177
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,150
screw it.(laughs)

178
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,250
what--what are you doing?
oh, i ripped it this morning.

179
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,950
it's been itching
the hell out of me...

180
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,550
and this is much better. are you
sure you wanna
take that off, honey?

181
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,000
i mean, won't you be cold?
no, i'm good. mwah!

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,600
??

183
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,750
??

184
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,800
what??

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
late???

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,650
???

187
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,900
??

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
??

189
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,750
(susan) come on, bree.
you have to let us do this.
uh, it's a lovely thought,

190
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,500
but i really don't want
a baby shower.

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,950
well, i bought you
an expensive gift,

192
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,850
and i'm not giving it to you
unless there's a party

193
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,150
with people who can see
how generous i am.

194
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,500
(orson) bree, watch this!

195
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,900
orson, i said be careful!

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,250
(sighs) i just
think it's tacky

197
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,450
to have a baby shower
when it's not your first baby.

198
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,450
<i>well, i don't see the problem
with it... hint, hint.</i>

199
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,050
yeah, and showers aren't just
about presents. they're fun.

200
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,800
and we can play games,
like "how big is mummy's tummy?"

201
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,050
excuse me?

202
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,450
yeah, we get a ball of yarn,
and we each cut a piece

203
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,150
that we think is just big enough
to fit around your stomach,

204
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,100
and the one closest
wins a prize.

205
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,450
<i>i really don't want
a shower.</i>

206
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,800
(orson) look! look at me!

207
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,500
orson, just five more minutes!
that's all you're getting!

208
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,250
i tell you what. why don't we
just skip the shower,

209
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,850
and after the baby's born,
i'll have a christening party?

210
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,950
what do you say?

211
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,500
(grunts) i'm okay! (laughs)

212
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,150
i'm fine.

213
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,250
oh, dear god.

214
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,250
excuse me, ladies.

215
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,950
i-i couldn't help overhearing

216
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,850
you--you talking
about my mom's shower.

217
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,500
i-i think i could be
of a little assistance here.

218
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,050
<i>why do you have to take
our new neighbors cookie bars?</i>

219
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,450
oh, look, i made
a terrible first impression,

220
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,150
so i thought i'd make them
some of my home-baked goodness.

221
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,050
(scoffs) but you didn't
bake any goodness.

222
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,450
you just warmed up the goodness
i bought at the store.

223
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,800
well, yeah. i
don't bake. catch up.

224
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,750
you know, not all neighbors
have to be friends.

225
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,800
why don't you just
let it go?

226
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,050
mike, they live
15 feet from us.

227
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,450
if we have a fire,
i wanna be sure

228
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,050
<i>that they like us enough
to call 9-1-1.
ah, that's the real reason.</i>

229
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,900
you can't stand it when
somebody doesn't like you.

230
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,250
well, maybe. well, maybe bob and
lee just
like to keep to themselves.

231
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,150
that's fine,
and once they like me,

232
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,900
they can keep to themselves
all they damn well please.

233
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,850
hi. i wanted to bring you

234
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,550
a "welcome to the
neighborhood" present.

235
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,750
you should try one while they're
still warm from the oven.

236
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,650
that was really nice. thank you.
oh, are there nuts in them?

237
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,650
nuts?
yeah.

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,000
gee, let me think.

239
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,550
nope, no nuts.

240
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,850
are you sure?
'cause i'm highly allergic.

241
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,950
half a pecan could kill me.

242
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,650
i'm not seeing any nuts.

243
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,050
okay, you made them,

244
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,900
so did you or did you not
put nuts in them?

245
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,750
okay, here's the thing.
i'm a really crappy baker.

246
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,350
to give you something
that i made myself

247
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,750
would be like an insult, so--
so--so--so you bought them,

248
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,650
and--and then you heated them up
in attempt to make your gesture

249
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,750
seem more thoughtful
than, in fact, it was.

250
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,050
hey, i would've made
them myself if i knew how.

251
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,650
honestly,
i'm a good neighbor.

252
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,050
(laughs) yeah, well, neighbor,
why don't you take

253
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,150
your store-bought, warmed-up,
possibly poisonous cookie bars

254
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,850
and give them to someone

255
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,700
more likely to survive
your generosity?

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,750
do you like wine?

257
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,100
no, no, so please don't bring me
a bottle from your vineyard.

258
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
this rip is pretty big.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,450
it'll take about a week.

260
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,400
<i>a week?</i>

261
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
all right.
you'll hurry if you can?

262
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,750
honey, it's okay.
you look cute in a scarf.

263
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,350
i'm upset
'cause that salesgirl

264
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,650
just walked away
with my sex life.

265
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,250
what? after two
months
of puking my guts out,

266
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,850
last night i was
finally in the mood,

267
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,150
but tom--not so much.

268
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,250
apparently, my bald head is
a big turnoff for him. (scoffs)

269
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,650
why'd you take your
wig off? it was itchy.

270
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,050
okay, not smart.

271
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,350
gaby, i am his wife.

272
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,950
<i>he's supposed to love me--</i>

273
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,550
not my body, me...
my--my soul.

274
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,750
why can't he make love
to my soul?

275
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,250
interesting.

276
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,750
question--when was the
last time you were in the bar

277
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,850
and heard a guy
turn to his friend and say,

278
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,050
<i>"hey, check out
the soul on that girl"?</i>

279
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,150
what are you saying?

280
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,750
i'm saying men are visual.

281
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,350
hell, i have a whole closet
full of costumes.

282
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,750
you need to give tom
something to look at,

283
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,850
something spicy, like...

284
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,250
gaby, i'm not a redhead.

285
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,550
but you could be,

286
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,650
which brings me
to my second point--

287
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,650
men like variety.

288
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,650
tonight you're a
redhead. (laughs)

289
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,550
tomorrow... you are...

290
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,150
(imitates swedish accent)
helga, the sexy milkmaid.

291
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,150
(normal voice) or...

292
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,150
(deeper voice)
amber, the lonely runaway.

293
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,250
(normal voice) or...

294
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,100
jeff, the friendly guy
from work.

295
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,200
what? i don't know
what tom is into.

296
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
claude, you know i
don't like it when you "hmm."

297
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
edie... how long
have you had this?

298
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,450
had what?

299
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,850
i don't have anything.

300
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,300
i'm just here for
my 5,000-mile checkup.

301
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,250
well, you know that bullet

302
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,200
you've managed to dodge
all these years?

303
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,250
which one?

304
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,450
the clap? the herp?

305
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,050
the syph?!

306
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,250
crabs?

307
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,000
relax. i'll boil
all the sheets and towels,

308
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,750
and then we'll use
this special shampoo,

309
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,050
and in three days,

310
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,650
the crotch carnival
packs up and leaves town.

311
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,250
oh, man.
how did this happen?

312
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,100
don't give me that look.
i know exactly how i got 'em.

313
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,750
i used the tanning bed
right after mimsy porter,

314
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,800
<i>that skank.</i>

315
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,350
(sniffs) ew, it smells like
burnt licorice.

316
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,950
well, come in
the bathroom,

317
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,300
and i'll show you
how to use this.

318
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,750
(metal bristling) i
think
i can figure that out.

319
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,350
you know, the good news is we're
in a committed relationship.

320
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,650
otherwise, we'd have to make
that call of shame

321
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
to everyone we've
been with. (sighs deeply)

322
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,250
(victor) ...you've
heard me make before,

323
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,650
but something i feel
very, very strongly about.

324
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,150
for me, it's a
very simple formula.

325
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,150
more development leads
to an increased tax base,

326
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,100
which helps build schools
for our children.

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,350
around the country, the needs
of children are being...

328
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,550
(whispering)
what are you doing here?

329
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,950
(whispering)
i need to talk to you.

330
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,050
can't you just call me?

331
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,200
this is not something that
you wanna hear on the phone.

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,450
(victor) ...and
not follow this trend.

333
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,250
(whispers indistinctly)
and we will put education
where it belongs--

334
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,300
at the top of the list.
ew! how did you get those?

335
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
how do you think? edie.

336
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,900
you are still
sleeping with edie?

337
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,550
well, you're still sleeping
with victor, aren't you?

338
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,750
yeah, if i didn't, he would
think something is going on.

339
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,650
what is your excuse
for doing it with edie?

340
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,750
she wants to,
and i'm a guy.

341
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,700
ow!
this is serious, okay?

342
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,850
if victor wakes up
with a zoo in his pants,

343
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,050
there's gonna
be hell to pay.

344
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,450
you don't have to tell me.
if he finds out about us,

345
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,150
i'm the one that's gonna
wind up in a landfill.
okay, just don't panic, okay?

346
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,850
we're gonna get the salve
or the ointment

347
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,200
or whatever it is you put down
there, and we're gonna be fine.

348
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
we'r're screwed.
yeah.

349
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,450
(lynette) tom?
the kids are asleep.

350
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:17,550
are you coming to bed
anytime soon?

351
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,150
yeah, i just gotta pick
a new running back

352
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,800
for my fantasy
football team.

353
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,750
that's too bad.

354
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,500
i had a little fantasy thing
planned of my own.

355
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,150
whoa. lynette...

356
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,750
lynette's not
here right now.

357
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,100
i'm brandy,
the slutty cheerleader.

358
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,050
this is all very romantic,
gaby,

359
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,550
but i still have four
building proposals to read

360
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,650
before tomorrow.

361
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,300
<i>that's nurse gaby to you.</i>

362
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
nurse gaby?

363
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,750
am i sick?

364
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,950
well, the doctor says
you need to relax,

365
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>and i know
just how to relax you.</i>

366
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
wow.

367
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,650
it smells like licorice.

368
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,150
it's a blend
of 36 essential oils,

369
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:32,150
anise root and fennel.

370
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,400
do you like it?

371
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,350
it smells
a little medicine-y.

372
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,900
that's the fennel.
(chuckles)

373
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
it's stinging a little.

374
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,050
that's the tension...

375
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,900
(whispers)
leaving your body.

376
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,050
<i>it's really stinging.</i>

377
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,350
and we can rinse it off...

378
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,500
in three to five minutes.

379
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,950
but before we do that...

380
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,400
what the hell is that?

381
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,950
you know, for a guy getting
rubbed down by a hot nurse,

382
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,800
you ask a lot of
questions. sorry.

383
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,050
oh, come on, uncle frank.

384
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:25,750
what's the point
of having a gay uncle

385
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,100
if you're not gonna help me
make friends with these guys?

386
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
oh.

387
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
uh, mom said that
the whole family knew.

388
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,600
um, okay. gotta
go. love you. (beep)

389
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,550
what's going on? oh, i found
raphael
wandering in the street.

390
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,150
i went to take him back,
but bob and lee aren't home,

391
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,250
so i'm just gonna
give him a little treat

392
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,750
and put him back in their
yard.
bup, bup, bup! wait a second.

393
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:49,750
what?
leave him with me.

394
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,550
i need to score some points
with those guys,

395
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,850
and being a dog-rescuing hero
could be just the ticket.

396
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,550
so what, you're just gonna keep
him here until they come back?

397
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:01,250
uh-huh. maybe a
little longer. how long?

398
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,750
well, long enough
for them to worry.

399
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,750
you know, the more they worry,
the more i'm a hero. get it?

400
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,150
i get that you're insane.

401
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,250
i'm not, i'm not.
now get some mud.

402
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,100
i wanna dirty him up so he looks
like he's been through hell.

403
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
okay, in you go.

404
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,950
here, let me help you
with those.

405
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,000
oh, that's all right.
i've got them, mr. knievel.

406
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,000
oh, boy. you're never gonna
let me live this down, are you?
nope.

407
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,550
i thought the same thing.
it seems to me that you
should go to the doctor again.

408
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,700
(all) surprise!

409
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,380
uh,guys... what
did i tell you?

410
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,160
you said "no shower."
but look around--men.

411
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
so technically,it's a
party, not a shower. mwah.

412
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,900
andrew told us that you
only said no... (kisses)

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,720
'cause you didn't want to impose.

414
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,290
oh! (laughs) so
you're responsible?

415
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,060
yeah,well,i-i know you
said not to make a big fuss,

416
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,360
but,hey,you earned it.

417
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,420
(gabrielle) well,don't
just stand there. come in.

418
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,490
we have lots of food
and fun and surprises.

419
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,840
<i>(under breath)
yeah,all kinds of surprises.</i>

420
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,560
(woman,singsong
voice) where is she?

421
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,010
bree!

422
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,540
phyllis!

423
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,150
i,uh,helped with
the invitations,too.

424
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,340
i can't tell you how
touched i was to be included,

425
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,780
especially after my
many conciliatory gestures

426
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,690
were so coldly rebuffed.

427
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,230
i have been awful.

428
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,730
i wouldn't blame you if
you stormed out right now.

429
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,440
nonsense.

430
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,040
i'm here to celebrate
our renewed friendship...

431
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,240
and your baby.

432
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,610
<i>or should i say babies?</i>

433
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,400
you know, it's
often a sign of twins

434
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,970
when a mother's face
gets all plump like yours.

435
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,050
oh,um...

436
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,650
i,uh, bet you
wouldn't mind

437
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,290
if i broke my neck
on that scooter now.

438
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,430
i'm off to the bank.

439
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,220
aunt lily just took a pill,
so she's down for the afternoon.

440
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,660
okay. have fun.

441
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,960
is your mother gone?

442
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,550
yeah. do you need her?

443
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,820
no,no. (sets down bell)

444
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,200
this is what i wanted.

445
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,530
i thought you
took a sleeping pill.

446
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,140
i pretended to so
she'd leave us alone.

447
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,930
aunt lily,what's going on?

448
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,740
i have to tell
you something.

449
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
first,you should know
that what happened...

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,690
(gulps) it was
nobody's fault.

451
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,590
what do you mean, "what happened"?

452
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,150
you don't remember living
on this street before,do you?

453
00:22:59,330 --> 00:22:59,900
no. (panting)

454
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,570
well... there's
a reason for that.

455
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
(katherine) dylan?

456
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,450
mom,i thought you left.

457
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,970
i forgot my checkbook.

458
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,460
could you go down and
find it for me? sure.

459
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,200
you really should get your rest.

460
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,480
hey. hi.

461
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,520
hi. got your wig back,huh?
yeah. mm-hmm. good as new.

462
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,160
listen,i thought we could put
the kids to bed early tonight,

463
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,610
if you know what i mean.

464
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,830
i do,and i'm up for that.

465
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,110
fantastic.

466
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,350
i hope brandy
won't get stuck late

467
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,200
at cheerleading practice.

468
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,650
oh,about brandy...

469
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,930
bad news.

470
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,220
what? what--what happened?

471
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,660
well,penny wanted to play
beauty school with the wig,

472
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,320
and,well,let's just say
she's got no future as a stylist.

473
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,400
(chuckles) bad haircut,huh?

474
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,980
oh.

475
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,300
sounds like brandy might
get awful mad about that.

476
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,120
brandy's history,tom. let her go.

477
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,470
(lee in distance) raphael!

478
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,580
come here! raphael!

479
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
come home,boy!
(clapping hands)

480
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,470
raphael?!

481
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,590
lee? is something
wrong? raphael got out.

482
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,800
i-i don't know what happened. i think he jumped the fence.

483
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,390
oh. well,would you like
me to help you look for him?

484
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,180
seriously? what
a--what about your party?

485
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,020
oh. (chuckles) it's
just a baby shower...

486
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,330
that i'm throwing... for my best friend.

487
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,770
i can't--i can't ask
you to leave that. that's--

488
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,070
oh,please. what
are neighbors for?

489
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,230
raphael?!

490
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,730
here,puppy!

491
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,480
i see you've taken down
all the pictures of rex.

492
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,170
well,i'm,uh,sorry if
that offends you,phyllis,

493
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,510
but i didn't want orson to
feel uncomfortable in his new home.

494
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,030
i see.

495
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,770
you're trying to be considerate of your husband's feelings.

496
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,140
<i>well,i'm glad that you're
at least trying to get it right</i>

497
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,540
the second time around.

498
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,510
still,it must be awfully
hard on danielle and andrew

499
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,430
to have their father's face
banished from their own home.

500
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,810
he wasn't banished.

501
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,970
by the way...

502
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,070
where--where's danielle?

503
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,080
she's,uh, at boarding school...

504
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,630
in switzerland.

505
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,040
switzerland?! is
it asking too much

506
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,140
to be told what
continent my granddaughter is on?!

507
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,050
you are keeping my
grandchildren from me,

508
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,840
and i don't know why.

509
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300
i'm going to mingle.

510
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,000
every time i start a
chat, you walk away.

511
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,250
i mean,if you don't
want to talk to me,

512
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,500
why did you invite me?

513
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,510
it's a surprise
party, you daft woman!

514
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,870
what makes you think i
had a hand in the guest list?

515
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,620
so... you don't want me here?

516
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,550
oh,for god sakes,phyllis,

517
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,990
it's not as if we got
along when rex was alive.

518
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,920
what did i ever do to you

519
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,800
but try to treat
you like a daughter?

520
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,190
i even gave you my
mother's sable coat.

521
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,800
you hated your mother.
but i loved that coat.

522
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,520
then i'll give
it back to you.

523
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,400
no,you keep it

524
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,040
as a reminder of
how hard i tried

525
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,740
to make you like me.

526
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,330
grandma, are you
leaving already?

527
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,590
i'm sorry,dear,

528
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,970
<i>but your mother has made
it impossible for me to stay.</i>

529
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,170
where does she
keep my sable coat?

530
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,870
probably in her
bedroom closet.

531
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,080
where is she going?

532
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,600
she asked me where
your fur coat was.

533
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,380
and--and you told her?!

534
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,590
oh,crap.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
hey! so,can i take these?

536
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,600
<i>(chuckles) so...
danielle is having a baby.</i>

537
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,100
yes,and for the
sake of her reputation,

538
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,230
we've agreed to
pretend that it's mine.

539
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
i just hope that

540
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,140
those swiss doctors
know what they're doing.

541
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
she's not in switzerland.

542
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,220
she's at the sisters of hope convent.

543
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,960
look,phyllis,i'm sorry.
i know this is upsetting.

544
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,790
actually,i'm thrilled.

545
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,460
i'm going to be
a great-grandma.

546
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,330
well,um... (chuckles)

547
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,800
technically,yes.

548
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,280
what do you mean, "tecically"?

549
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,520
we're saying that the
baby is mine and orson's,

550
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,320
and if you hover
around like a grandmother,

551
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,420
people will be suspicious.

552
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,360
<i>you're not
keeping this baby from me,</i>

553
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,740
not if you don't want me to
tell those people downstairs

554
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,780
whose child it really is.

555
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,250
<i>you wouldn't.
think of danielle!</i>

556
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,240
i wish you had.

557
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,760
if you'd raised her properly,

558
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,630
<i>she wouldn't be
pregnant without ahusband.</i>

559
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,560
you think i don't know
i'm a failure as a parent?

560
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,350
that's why this
child means so much to me.

561
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,310
it's my second chance.

562
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,540
well,i hope the second time
around that you take my advice.

563
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,130
i always said that you were
too strict with those kids.

564
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,110
parenting tips
from you? that's rich.

565
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,030
i was a wonderful mother to rex.
then why did he always avoid you?

566
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,670
why were you barely ever here?

567
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,070
because of you! he
knew you hated me.

568
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,290
oh,he was happy to
let you think that,

569
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,340
but he was the one
who dreaded your visits.

570
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,510
(whispers) oh.

571
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,590
oh. (gasps) phyllis,wait!

572
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,370
excuse me,everyone, but
i have something to say.

573
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,000
what--what is it,grandma?

574
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,420
i...

575
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,860
i have to go,

576
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,700
and i just wanted
to say how nice it was

577
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,180
to see you all
again after so much time.

578
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,790
good-bye.

579
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,270
(lowered voice)
thank you for the gift.

580
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,440
you know,bree,

581
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,350
you're not the only one who
would like a second chance.

582
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,180
nothing,huh? no. no,he's lost.

583
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,250
and he doesn't
know this neighborhood.

584
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,860
there's no way he's
gonna find his way home.

585
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,340
oh,he will. come on.
you gotta keep believing.

586
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,910
oh,crap! bob's home.
(scoffs) what am i gonna tell him?

587
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,770
don't. we'll just keep looking.

588
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,530
i have a feeling we're
gonna find that cute little guy.

589
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,830
you--you are so
nice to do this,

590
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,460
i mean,especially after the
way i acted when we first--

591
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,490
you know what?
don't worry about it.

592
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,200
i'm gonna go inside
and get us some water,

593
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,450
and then we're gonna
just keep looking. okay.

594
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,400
lee! i can't find
raphael. you seen him anywhere?

595
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,960
oh,bob,prom--promise you won't hate me.

596
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,380
what are you talking about?
what happened? raphael got out.

597
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,480
he got out? yeah.

598
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,900
he doesn't know the neighborhood. i know he doesn't know the neighborhood.

599
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,250
what are you talking
about? i know--i don't--

600
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,690
how are you looking for him?
well,susan,she-- she's getting water.

601
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,630
oh,wait, he's right there.

602
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,220
oh! oh,my god!

603
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,850
what was our dog
doing in your garage?

604
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,040
i have no idea.

605
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,410
what?

606
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
(lowered voice)
did you get a chance

607
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,860
to,uh, napalm
the jungle yet?

608
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,250
yep. and?

609
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,170
all quiet on the southern front.

610
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,100
gaby,we have got
to be more careful.

611
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,310
absolutely.

612
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,970
it's kind of exciting, though.

613
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,450
what is? playing with fire,

614
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,340
almost getting
burned but not quite.

615
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,370
don't be thinking like that.

616
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,040
if victor catches
us, he'll kill us both.

617
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,060
(whispers) that's
what's so exciting.

618
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,140
hi.

619
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,110
hi.

620
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,210
oh,my--excuse me.

621
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,670
mmm,that's,um...

622
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,890
an interesting
cologne you're wearing.

623
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,540
my wife gave it to me.

624
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,460
it's got,uh, anise root,fennel.

625
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,630
what,you like it?

626
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,260
yeah,it's just,um...

627
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,810
i don't know...
weirdly familiar.

628
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,910
crab cake?

629
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,190
uh,yeah. thanks.

630
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,980
crab cake?

631
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,690
crab cake? oh,thank you.

632
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,970
crab cake?

633
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,070
thank you.

634
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,360
kids are asleep.

635
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,370
<i>i'm not.</i>

636
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,710
whatcha got back
there? just a little present.

637
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,760
say hello to brandy's
even sluttier sister...

638
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,930
candy.

639
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,100
what are you doing?

640
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,150
well, i just--i just thought

641
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,460
since we had so
much fun last night,

642
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,370
<i>maybe we can
have a little more fun.</i>

643
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,300
and that's only possible

644
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,590
when you're pretending i'm someone else?

645
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,140
well, you have
to pretend,too.

646
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,580
<i>what?</i>

647
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,200
this... (scoffs)

648
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,280
<i>is me,tom,
not brandy or candy.</i>

649
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,790
it's just your wife,lynette. am i not enough for you?

650
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,740
what are you getting so mad for?

651
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,420
the first wig
was your idea.

652
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,070
yeah,because i'm bald.

653
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,460
and i know that
that's a big old turnoff,

654
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,630
but,you know,
i can't help it.

655
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,630
i have cancer.

656
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,210
yes,i know. i hear
about it all the time.

657
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,940
can you blame me for wanting
to escape every once in a while?

658
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,030
<i>escape from
me,you mean? yes!</i>

659
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,410
you know why last
night was so much fun?

660
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,220
because i got to make love
to someone who wasn't sick.

661
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,610
look,i know,i know,i'm not
supposed to say this stuff.

662
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,610
i have to be the
heroic husband who listens

663
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,770
and holds you when you
cry and never cries himself.

664
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,940
but this affects me,too.

665
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,040
well... i know that.

666
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,320
you do? yeah.

667
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,640
how?

668
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,020
since this whole thing began,

669
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>have you ever once
asked me how i'm doing?</i>

670
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,290
oh... my god.

671
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,620
i haven't,have i?

672
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,380
i am one of those...

673
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,490
whiny,self-involved sick people.

674
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,990
i didn't say that.

675
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,370
no,i am. it's been months,

676
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,475
and i have barely thought
about what you're going through.

677
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:15,770
it's okay. you're
going through something--

678
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,950
will you stop
being so heroic?!

679
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,920
i'm a cancer bitch!

680
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
what?

681
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,810
i'm not gonna
argue with you.

682
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,220
(laughing) you suck.

683
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,710
well...

684
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,300
i guess i could
give candy a whirl.

685
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,930
are the kids really asleep?

686
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,740
'cause i think she
might be a screamer.

687
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,000
actually, if we're gonna pretend...

688
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,270
how about tonight

689
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,120
<i>i'm not a hero</i>

690
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,900
and you are not
a cancer patient?

691
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,670
we'll just be
tom and lynette,

692
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,030
see what happens.

693
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,650
oh,i'd like that.

694
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
how's bob's suit?

695
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,500
ruined. oh. what if we
take it to my cleaners?

696
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,390
susan,that paint's not
coming out... (whimpers)

697
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,700
so we're buying
him a new suit...

698
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,080
for 2,000 bucks.

699
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,270
(gasps) $2,000?

700
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,160
well,according to
lee, it's a dolce.

701
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,710
i don't know what that means, but
he said it six times. that's crazy.

702
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,670
no,what's crazy
is i'm about to buy

703
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,280
the most expensive suit of my life,

704
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,100
and i'll never wear it.

705
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,470
oh. i just wanted them to like me.

706
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,290
well,they don't.

707
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,530
lee said that
six times,too.

708
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,620
there must be some way
i can apologize to them.

709
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,490
we can't afford any
more of your apologies.

710
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,650
i know. uh,maybe if i--
damn it,susan, let it go,okay?

711
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,320
i asked you to before,and you
didn't,and look what happened.

712
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,840
so i'll ask you
again. just let it go.

713
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,670
mike,wait. we
should talk about this.

714
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,000
i'm going to bed.

715
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,190
i've gotta work
tomorrow. i'm buying a suit.

716
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
grandma!

717
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,130
what are you doing here? you
needn't be embarrassed, dear.

718
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,010
your mother's
told me everything.

719
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,550
it's great to
see you. (chuckles)

720
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,340
i hate this place.
it's like baby jail.

721
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,200
oh. well,that's what i've
come to talk to you about.

722
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,260
perhaps it's time
for you to leave.

723
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,110
(lily,raspy voice) dylan?

724
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,040
is that you?

725
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,020
we have--have to talk.

726
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,010
hey.

727
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,110
i'm glad you're home.

728
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,570
i wanted to talk to
you about aunt lily.

729
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,750
what about her?

730
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,610
it was so weird. she called
me into her room this afternoon.

731
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,900
she started saying she knew why

732
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
i didn't remember
living on this street before.

733
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,650
oh,sweetie.

734
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,420
your aunt lily
is fading fast.

735
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,750
half the time,she
doesn't know what she's saying.

736
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,900
was that her?

737
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,590
no,i just checked on
her. she's sleeping.

738
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,440
you know,you have
that recital in two weeks.

739
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,250
shouldn't you
be practicing?

740
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,570
(panting) dylan.

741
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,300
please!

742
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,420
<i>pests--</i>

743
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,400
<i>they come in
all shapes and sizes</i>

744
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,780
<i>and disrupt our
lives in a variety of ways.</i>

745
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,040
<i>at first, they're merely annoying,</i>

746
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,060
<i>and we do our
best to ignore them.</i>

747
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,680
home in my own bed....

748
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,970
<i>but if we don't
take them seriously,</i>

749
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,200
<i>they can become quite dangerous.</i>

750
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,230
<i>for some,</i>

751
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,130
<i>death seems to be
the easiest solution.</i>

752
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,510
<i>but the problem with pests</i>

753
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,570
<i>is that what
they leave behind...</i>

754
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,680
<i>is just as dangerous.</i>

755
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,840
