I don't have insurance right now

737
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,727
because I can't really afford it.

738
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,647
And there's no way
I could afford to fix his car.

739
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,858
How do people do this stuff?

740
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,485
I mean, I have a job.

741
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,738
It's kind of a joke.
I mean, I've been there almost a year,

742
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,825
and I still have only, like, 15 hours a week.

743
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,370
Why don't they give me more hours?

744
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,707
Do you think it's 'cause they think I suck?

745
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:35,128
Did you think I sucked
when I served you at the checkout?

746
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:36,629
No.

747
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,466
I mean, I can't even afford
to pay my rent right now.

748
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,970

to start selling shit pretty soon.

751
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,061

You know, it's just as much
for you as it is for me.

785
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,183
I waited outside the school for 45 minutes.

786
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,185
Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to go.

787
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:40,438
Well, maybe you could let me know
when you decide not to show next time.

I told you, like, a thousand times.

You didn't tell me you were just
going to not show up.

919
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,934
and he got a whiff of it, so he went for him,

920
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,103
and this mouse

921
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,524
got up on his hind legs

922
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,025

930

931

936
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,519
But I'd drop the new mouse into the cage,

937
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,896
and he'd just hide behind the old mouse.

938

939
