1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,033
Foul!

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,400
Ref, what's the matter with your whistle!

3
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:11,325
You know, you should really
be encouraging Shane and Silas

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,429
to talk about Juda's death

5
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,912
or, down the road, you're looking at two

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:17,608
very dysfunctional adults.

7
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:20,285
Shit!

8
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:23,398
I guess he left her pretty well fixed.

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,694
I heard there was nothing.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,367
I wonder how she's getting by.

11
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:28,982
Jesus, Nancy, you weren't
kidding, this stuff is primo.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,136
You wanna climb in.

13
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:31,518
Give me a little respect.

14
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,385
I'm the biggest game in the
private community of Agrestic.

15
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,112
Drugs sell themselves biscuit.

16
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,232
You ain't shit.

17
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,691
Her husband is boning the tennis pro.

18
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:41,123
She loved him long time.

19
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:42,153
Dean!

20
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,975
That little cunt!

21
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:46,351
Mrs. Botwin, can we have sex in your house?

22
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,351
Jesus.

23
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,743
I've got everything under control.

24
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,868
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

25
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,434
Down, ladies.

26
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:00,011
And go!

27
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,699
Give me shoulders. Give me attitude.

28
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:04,308
Head down, ladies.

29
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:07,363
You know about Celia's husband?

30
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,098
Sleeping with the tennis pro.

31
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,215
He's homosexual?

32
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:11,993
Not Victor, the oriental girl.

33
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:14,660
Helen Chin? She completely transformed my serve.

34
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,664
I hope they don't fire her.

35
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,590
Ladies...

36
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,633
throwing stones in the glassroom.

37
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,497
No, gossiping about Celia.

38
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:21,259
Lovely.

39
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,512
Come on, Nancy, it's harmless fun.

40
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,805
Probably not for Celia.

41
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:25,833
Oh, please!

42
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,486
Celia wasn't programmed to feel.

43
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:30,067
Why don't you chat about who
your husbands are fucking?

44
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:31,525
Look, here come girls.

45
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,198
You take care, Nancy.

46
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,646
It must be so hard for you being all alone.

47
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:37,797
God bless.

48
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,188
Mom?

49
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,304
I thought Blanca was picking me up after school.

50
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,833
Yes, well, surprise!

51
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,714
Blanca had to take your sister to the airport.

52
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:51,805
The airport?

53
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,505
Where is she going?

54
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,452
Quinn is on her way to boarding school in Mexico.

55
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,315
She didn't say anything.

56
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,342
Yeah, well, not a sentimentalist your sister.

57
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,035
Can we talk about this in the car?

58
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:04,631
But...

59
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:05,626
But in the car.

60
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,698
Go and change your clothes.

61
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,662
I'll meet you at the desk. Go on.

62
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,001
The karate class will be
starting in just a minute.

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,399
Mr. Saint Denis, so nice to see you.

64
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:14,254
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Botwin.

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,135
Shane is doing very well in karate.

66
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,699
I'm so glad to hear that.

67
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:20,770
Mom, the lady at the desk says you need to pay.

68
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:21,984
I already checked last week.

69
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:23,643
She said your check didn't clear.

70
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,051
There must be some explanation.

71
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,538
Yeah, you don't have any
money in your checking account.

72
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,215
I'll go to the desk and straighten
everything out. Go back to class.

73
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,158
I gotta pee.

74
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:32,895
Fine, hurry up.

75
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,750
Hold up the bell. Remember to hold
up the bell so it doesn't get wet.

76
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:36,390
Mom!

77
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,405
Hey, Nancy.

78
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,007
Hi, Celia.

79
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:47,097
Nancy, hey! Check this out!

80
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,771
Ow!

81
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,789
Shit, Nancy! I am so sorry.

82
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,144
What did you just chuck at my face?

83
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,012
It's called a roomerang and when you throw it,

84
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,772
it's supposed to come back to you...

85
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,955
when someone else's face doesn't get in the way.

86
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,029
But I'm not saying you did that on purpose.

87
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:02,099
Can I have a tissue?

88
00:04:02,197 --> 00:04:02,985
Oh, sure.

89
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,773
Doug, we need to talk.

90
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,206
Oh, no. No, no.

91
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,414
Don't tell me you're dry.

92
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,083
Not dry, Doug. I'm broke.

93
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,404
Thank God!

94
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:17,019
Maybe I should save some
money by firing my accountant.

95
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:18,777
Okay, let's not get carried away.

96
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,235
We should brainstorm on this.

97
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,364
Have some dialog, confab, pow wow.

98
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,591
I can't believe I trust you
with my money, you're an idiot.

99
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:26,588
I'm an idiot savant.

100
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:30,290
Say what you want about me personnally
but I'm a great fucking CPA.

101
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,912
You won't let me deposit
cash in my checking account.

102
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:35,507
I'm running all over town paying my bills in cash.

103
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,327
Because I can't have a papertrail of
cash deposits. You gotta trust me on this.

104
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,078
What am I supposed to do? Sell my house?

105
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,634
How about Lupita, your housekeeper?

106
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,944
She's like family.

107
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,038
Besides her daughter is still
in court reporting school.

108
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,641
I started selling so I
could maintain my lifestyle,

109
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,434
not dismantle it.

110
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:53,883
Well, you're gonna have to sell more.

111
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,568
Nancy, it's the oldest rule in business.

112
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,777
Buy low, sell high.

113
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:01,865
Did you get it? Sell high!

114
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,394
If you ever make a biz card, you could use that.

115
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,345
Doug...

116
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:08,695
Okay.

117
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:09,939
Alright, listen.

118
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,345
I've been working on setting
up a small business loan for you

119
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,516
so you can have the front
to launder money through.

120
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:17,230
This way you can replenish your
checking account, pay some bills,

121
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,033
and boom! Bob's your uncle!

122
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,599
What is my legitimate small business?

123
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,239
I don't know.

124
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,063
Pick something. Paperwork is all the same.

125
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:24,250
Just let me know what you want.

126
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,219
Could my cover business
eventually become my real business?

127
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:30,337
In this economy, small businesses are fucked.

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,869
But that would be good for
us, don't worry about it.

129
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:34,481
Just pick something with low inventory. Okay?

130
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,671
I'm so screwed.

131
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,964
No, stop that! Everything is gonna be great!

132
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,899
I'm guaranteeing you at least
7 customers at tomorrow's game.

133
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,694
Oh and if you could be here
by 8, that would be perfecto.

134
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,955
How about a little cash upfront?

135
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,598
Sure.

136
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,949
Ah shit! I'm all taped out.

137
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,181
I'll hit the ATM later. I promise.

138
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:03,116
Nanc', I'd offer to write you a
check but that seems insensitive.

139
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,377
Not to mention unwise because
if you should get caught,

140
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,268
I can't have it coming back to me.

141
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,398
Silas!

142
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,548
Is there a phone off the hook upstairs?

143
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,162
- Dead!
- What?

144
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:15,866
It's dead.

145
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,658
All the phones are dead.

146
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,871
Oh shit!

147
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:22,470
Don't worry.

148
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:26,464
I'll go online and pay it right now.

149
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:31,702
Why can't I get online?

150
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,558
'Cause DSL is connected to the phone.

151
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll give you 50 bucks right now if
you don't give me any grief about this.

152
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,314
Cool.

153
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,155
Hey, you haven't talked to
Quinn's mom lately, have you?

154
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,987
I saw her at karate.

155
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,376
You didn't say anything to her, right?

156
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,305
About what?

157
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,326
You know, about how you caught me and Quinn.

158
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:53,585
Why would you think that?

159
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,507
'Cause I haven't heard from
Quinn and she wasn't at school.

160
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:59,187
I don't know, I just...

161
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:00,830
I don't get it.

162
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,151
She didn't say goodbye?

163
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:04,336
Goodbye?

164
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,224
What do you mean goodbye?

165
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,164
I heard Celia saying something about

166
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,191
Quinn going to Mexico.

167
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,464
Mexico?

168
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,265
I don't know. I overheard.

169
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:16,519
Quinn...

170
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:19,703
Quinn wouldn't go to Mexico without telling me.

171
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,803
I'm sorry, honey. I don't know the whole story.

172
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,046
You're sorry?

173
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,085
She's probably been trying to call me.

174
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:31,412
What the hell is the matter for this family
that we can't even have a goddamn working phone!

175
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,388
It's your fucking mess.

176
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:34,695
Silas!

177
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:35,958
Hi, Mrs.

178
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,186
Hi, Lupita. How you doing?

179
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,428
I think I have the menopause.

180
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:44,151
I'm thinking I am gonna
have another baby and I cry.

181
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,919
And then I hear: No! It's the menopause.

182
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,488
And I say: Thank you, God.

183
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,090
So, you no pay me last week.

184
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:54,704
I didn't?

185
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,793
You no pay me.

186
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:56,905
Are you sure?

187
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,112
You pay me now?

188
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,527
Okay, gracias.

189
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:13,725
Good morning, I am Shane Botwin
and I am 10 years old today.

190
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:16,832
And I have been told that these
are the people responsible.

191
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,009
Turn it off.

192
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,976
To celebrate this, my natal day,

193
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:23,985
I have asked for the Megatech
radio-controlled blimp UFO combo,

194
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:25,700
a nightvision binocular

195
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:30,882
and this DVD of Steven Chow
cinematic masterpiece: Shaolin Soccer.

196
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:36,098
I wonder if these so-called parents of
mine have purchased any of these items.

197
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,494
Let's see what the alleged
parental units have to say.

198
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:40,533
Honey.

199
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,837
Show him your stretch marks.

200
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,132
Show him yours.

201
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:49,606
You know, you were not born
until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

202
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:53,255
So you, my friend, are not
officially 10 years old yet.

203
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,270
Will you make me pizza eggs?

204
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,513
Hey! We got any leftover pizza?

205
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:00,323
Yes.

206
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,403
Then I will make you pizza eggs

207
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,332
but not because it's your birthday

208
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:11,331
but because I'm feeling a little bit peckish
myself and your mother is not a morning person

209
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:12,815
and I love you.

210
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:13,997
And it's my birthday!

211
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,296
And it's your birthday!

212
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,454
Do you think I'm weird?

213
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:18,243
Yes!

214
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,471
You're totally weird.

215
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,946
But you're our son.

216
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,441
You know, I wouldn't trade you in for
any other almost 10-year-old on Earth.

217
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,275
What if there's life on other planets and there's
an unbelievable, amazing 10-year-old outthere.

218
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,472
Why would I trade down, man?

219
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,649
To me, you're the best, dude.

220
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,436
You are the amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

221
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,489
...amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

222
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:51,600
...amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

223
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:59,248
It's amazing the guy would even
consider pleading not guilty.

224
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,538
Amazing.

225
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,121
Part of me thinks he actually believes
his own bullshit which is just scary.

226
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,247
Hey.

227
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,125
Do you think it's safe I take two Ambien?

228
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,871
I could really use some good sleep tonight.

229
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:29,087
I think you should take the whole bottle.

230
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:31,750
Funny.

231
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:40,721
Later!

232
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,013
Dean?

233
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,445
You awake?

234
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,248
Did your hair go to boarding school in Mexico too?

235
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,613
I don't know what you're talking about.

236
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:46,964
Where is she?

237
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:51,290
Silas, come over here and
hold this sign so I can staple.

238
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:56,105
Are you so frightened by your daughter's
sexuality that you had to ship her off?

239
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,742
Pardon me?

240
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,601
Who told you we had sex?

241
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,626
Young men, this is the first time I'm
hearing that you and my daughter had sex

242
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,709
although now that I've been made aware,

243
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,890
I'm tempted to bring her home
just so I can ship her off again.

244
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,318
That little slut!

245
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,885
How dare you?

246
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,386
Tell me where she is!

247
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,409
Why?

248
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,911
So you can fly down to Mexico
and spring her from casa reforma?

249
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,144
I love her.

250
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,955
You stuck your penis in her.

251
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:31,876
That's not love, believe me.

252
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,867
If you didn't know about us,
then why is she in Mexico?

253
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,403
That's a private family matter.

254
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:38,001
I am her family.

255
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:40,473
God! Poor thing.

256
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,494
Do you really think

257
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:46,306
that my daughter had deep
romantic feelings for you?

258
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:47,892
Is that what you think?

259
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,932
Now, I'm sure that you were a
fun and sweety perversion for her,

260
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,201
but the truth is Quinn had a day and a half

261
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,121
to get all of her ducks in
a row before going to Mexico.

262
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,707
And she didn't call you.

263
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,517
She didn't write or IM or
e-mail you either, did she?

264
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,238
But I'll tell you what she did do.

265
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:09,361
She downloaded 2000 songs into her i-pod

266
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,622
and dyed her hair pink with black on the tips.

267
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:14,646
Because all that Quinn cares about

268
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,033
is Quinn.

269
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:19,437
She takes after her father that way.

270
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,353
Poor schmuck!

271
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,472
Oh you poor schmuck, you just played wrong.

272
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,811
That's a boat! Ah ah! Mark that!

273
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,020
So wait, a boat is when
the four ends add up to 20?

274
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,648
A boat is when I spank this boy's black ass

275
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,198
for thinking he hold up with
his three switching bitches.

276
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,677
Three switching bitches?

277
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,165
That's 15 and a boat is 20.

278
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,556
Stop fucking with her, she's
trying to learn the game.

279
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:51,006
Then log off a hot agent chick
suck-ass and you teach her.

280
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,711
I'm betting for rims on ebay.

281
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:57,627
Just like a nigga to buy new Rolls Royce
bucket before he's even got a steering wheel.

282
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,098
You can kiss my ass.

283
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,094
I just put a steering wheel in there 2 days ago.

284
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,164
Okay, well then.

285
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,236
Tennis shoe, pimp.

286
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,913
That's 2, honey, and break
out the peppermint lotion

287
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,946
'cause you're going to massage my feet.

288
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,163
What would you have gotten if you won?

289
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,891
She was going to babysit.

290
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,653
What am I gonna tell Rachel?

291
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:18,958
Tell her the truth, baby.

292
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,437
That you're a stanky foot-rubbing loser.

293
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,427
I'll watch the kids.

294
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,278
For nothing?

295
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,619
It's his anniversary.

296
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:26,878
Oh that's so sweet.

297
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,108
How long have you been married?

298
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,724
Since Rachel got big with Shayne

299
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,203
and her daddy told Keyon he'd
all bun if he didn't do right.

300
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,395
All bun?

301
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,226
No hum... hotdog.

302
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,333
You know, you need to pay
Vaneeta if she's gonna babysit.

303
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,352
If this your business?

304
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,724
Everything is my business!

305
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,945
Speaking of business...

306
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,317
Yes?

307
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:52,198
I was wondering what your credit policy was.

308
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,165
What you think?

309
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,848
This ain't fucking Macy's.
You get what you pay for.

310
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,714
Because I'm a little short this week.

311
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,142
But hum...

312
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,401
there are people waiting

313
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,560
and I promise I'll come right back.

314
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,875
I don't know. You bet your
sweet ass you'll come right back.

315
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:10,548
You want weed on credit, you
gotta leave some collateral.

316
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,434
You believe this girl?

317
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:12,135
Like what?

318
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,569
You got some nice shoes.

319
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,196
What size you wearing?

320
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,283
How much you need?

321
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,942
An ounce, maybe two.

322
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:18,699
Hell, no.

323
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:20,695
Shoes ain't gonna cover that shit.

324
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,691
How about I hold on to that
nice rock you're wearing?

325
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,998
Alright, alright, I'm not unreasonable.

326
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:32,128
Sentimental value and all that.

327
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,129
Leave your car instead.

328
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:36,323
My car?

329
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,196
I'm leasing it.

330
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,669
Then you're really gonna wanna
get it back then, aren't you?

331
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,701
How am I gonna get home?

332
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,804
Take Conrad's bucket.

333
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:51,903
White lady in the hooptie.
You gotta let me get a picture.

334
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:52,809
Not my baby.

335
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,976
That's it!

336
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,168
Range Rover for Stony Clover!

337
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,026
Heylia, I've been working on that car for a year.

338
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,124
And it still looks like shit.

339
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,673
So, what's it gonna be?

340
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,576
Conrad, give her the keys to the hooptie.

341
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,417
It's a classic.

342
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,742
I promise I'll treat her like she was my very own.

343
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,369
It only takes Super.

344
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:18,178
You gotta check the water.

345
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,020
Okay.

346
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,292
And oil.

347
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,146
Don't you think you should leave those shoes too?

348
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:25,290
Girl, you better get out
before Vaneeta strip you down.

349
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,315
Nice doing business with you guys.

350
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,301
Have a good game!

351
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,848
Hey, does anybody have any
money left to play with?

352
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,035
- Not me.
- No.

353
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,080
Fuck it, then.

354
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,364
Let's get high and make fun
of Dean's ball head, huh?

355
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,160
Celia?

356
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,267
Nancy.

357
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:36,397
Hello.

358
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,671
What are you doing out here?

359
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,399
I had to sign some papers

360
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,956
in Doug's office.

361
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,296
I followed Dean here.

362
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,769
Did you see him?

363
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,757
Yes, I did. They were playing poker.

364
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,749
Oh great.

365
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:59,084
Now he's gonna come home broke
and stinking of marijuana.

366
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,566
I guess that's better than oriental pussy.

367
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:03,610
Excuse me?

368
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,785
Oh come on, Nancy, I know you know.

369
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:07,440
Everybody knows.

370
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,037
There are no secrets in this town.

371
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,116
Maybe a few.

372
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:11,941
No.

373
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,785
None!

374
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,315
You're having money problems,

375
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,103
our children had sex,

376
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:20,855
Judy Gordon orders oxycontin over the
Internet and has developped quite the habit.

377
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,348
"Jesus loves you" Judy?

378
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:26,558
"Jesus loves you" Judy loves her hillbilly heroin.

379
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,835
But you didn't hear that
from me. I don't like gossip.

380
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,915
Where is your car?

381
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,162
I don't know I parked...

382
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,393
I think I parked on the
other side of the building.

383
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,897
This place is so confusing.

384
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,531
Do you want a lift?

385
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,731
No, you know...

386
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:48,712
not now, you know...

387
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,085
I'd rather walk.

388
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,214
What about you?

389
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:54,299
You're not gonna sit here
all night though, are you?

390
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,674
Well, I was thinking of
tracking down the tennis whore

391
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,951
and beating her to death with a tire iron.

392
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,979
But I forgot to set my Tivo for The Shield so...

393
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,595
I think I'll go home.

394
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,509
I love Michael Chicklis.

395
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:10,268
Good night, Nancy.

396
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,390
See you, Celia.

397
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,275
Hello?

398
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:21,798
Hello?

399
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:23,842
Lupita.

400
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,153
Hola!

401
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:26,473
You hungry?

402
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,168
I can warm up some pasta.

403
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,283
No, thanks.

404
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,658
Silas, honey?

405
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:36,954
He been like that since after school. All day.

406
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:39,151
He don't eat. He don't move.

407
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:41,947
Right, ain't this cool?

408
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,987
This is better than Silas' bellarium thing.

409
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:46,656
Bellarium!

410
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,826
Maybe just one

411
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,484
Oh no!

412
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,758
Shane! Shane! Relax! We can fix it!

413
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,338
Shane, look at me.

414
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:59,318
We can fix this. Everything
is gonna be okay, buddy.

415
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,087
You got that, mom?

416
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,525
Dad made it all better.

417
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,204
Silas, honey.

418
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,416
What's going on?

419
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,972
I don't wanna talk about it.

420
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:14,765
Silas,

421
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:17,525
I know things have been a
little bumpy around here lately.

422
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,327
She didn't give a shit about me.

423
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,336
She?

424
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:21,994
Oh!

425
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,173
Honey, of course, she did. She just...

426
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:28,236
No!

427
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,221
She just took off without
even bothering to say goodbye!

428
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:36,039
My whole fucking life, people just go away.

429
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,543
Mom!

430
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,565
Jesus, Shane!

431
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,991
What happened? I call 911.

432
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,614
Allo? Allo?

433
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,246
Fuck, the phone is still dead.

434
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,289
You don't say fucking to your mother!

435
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:01,951
Ma'am?

436
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,658
Ma'am?

437
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,968
How will you be paying?

438
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,323
Cash.

439
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:09,867
I know what you did!

440
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:14,244
I know you stole that goat!

441
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,362
Mr. Norman!

442
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:17,143
Goat thief!

443
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:19,114
Mr. Norman, step back into your line.

444
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:22,052
I know it's the economy, stupid!

445
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,810
But that goat didn't belong to you.

446
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:24,956
He was a free goat.

447
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:26,906
Mom, it really hurts.

448
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,111
It's throbbing.

449
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:30,424
It's throbbing, mom!

450
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:31,867
Back off, nutty!

451
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,599
Cry-baby...

452
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,445
I'm gonna take your free goat and
shove it up straight up your ass.

453
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,621
What goat?

454
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,048
Woman, you are light!

455
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:51,611
You are lighter than Michael
Jackson, you're so light!

456
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:52,368
Where is my money?

457
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,283
Shane broke his arm last night.

458
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,420
Oh...

459
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:58,333
Sorry to hear that.

460
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,566
Where is my money?

461
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:03,648
I'll get it, I swear, I need more inventory.

462
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,589
I'll pay everything back.

463
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:06,890
I'm sure you will.

464
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,125
But until then it's time to give it up.

465
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,344
The shiny bits.

466
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,525
You have my car!

467
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:16,054
I can't sell no leased car!

468
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,446
Now, you want more, you got to leave more.

469
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,753
And you got a shitty watch
and you buy knock-off handbags.

470
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,411
It's just business, baby.

471
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:24,768
Now, I know you got troubles

472
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,596
but like my mamma always says:

473
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,872
"Tough shit!"

474
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,458
Do you have a cover business?

475
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:30,641
Of course, I do.

476
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,683
Got me a jew in Century City who set me up.

477
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,352
Now, I know he's skimming cream off the top

478
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,856
but he makes everything seem real nice on paper.

479
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,583
You're looking at the president and
chief executive officer of Tidy Up, inc.

480
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,281
Got me a van out back and everything.

481
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,455
Maid service?

482
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:45,914
Housecleaning.

483
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:47,679
I ain't nobody's maid.

484
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,646
You ain't no housecleaner neither.

485
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:51,515
You're a weed dealer with a front.

486
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,414
And these are my employees.

487
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,298
What do you do if somebody actually
calls to get his house cleaned?

488
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:59,318
Then I refer him to my cousin
Xandra who cleans for real.

489
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,307
She don't make shit

490
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:02,620
but Xandra found the Lord so she don't care.

491
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:05,739
One day, we're gonna all retire
to a beach house in the Carribeans.

492
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:08,391
'Till some rapid god type shit happens

493
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:12,488
and washes everything away in a tidal
wave like those poor fuckers in Indonesia.

494
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,920
Not me.

495
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,297
Tsunami. It's called a tsunami.

496
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,590
I love the sound of that word.

497
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:21,581
Knowing you'll probably name the baby Tsunami.

498
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,263
I don't care what you say, that's a pretty name.

499
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:28,364
You are not naming my grandbaby
after some killer wave!

500
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:30,615
And we ain't getting no beach house neither.

501
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,125
I can't stand the sand.

502
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,512
Sand, blood and realty.

503
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,221
They never get rid of.

504
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:41,692
See you all later.

505
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:46,654
How much you think we'd get for that?

506
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:47,713
Nothing.

507
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,349
She'll be back.

508
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,203
Oh shit!

509
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,757
Oh you have no idea.

510
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,446
Wait, let's not do this here.

511
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:11,117
No?

512
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,325
Where should we go?

513
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,451
A motel?

514
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,469
My poolhouse maybe?

515
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:18,434
How about up my husband's ass?

516
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,124
We need to go somewhere where
we can get very, very drunk.

517
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:24,942
I'm a mean drunk.

518
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,528
Let's go.

519
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:33,066
He was cute, funny, clean,...

520
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:34,209
Married!

521
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,539
To me.

522
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:38,842
It's not like we're running
off together. It was sex.

523
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,838
Very hot sex.

524
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,106
He went down on me for days!

525
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,386
Always did excellent work down there.

526
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,469
Piece of shit!

527
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,877
Is that what you think?

528
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:53,005
He's shit?

529
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:58,693
When you stop being cute
and clean and funny at home,

530
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,592
and start spending afternoons

531
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:04,421
with your head buried in
the snatch of a tennis pro,

532
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,048
yeah, you're a piece of shit.

533
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:08,384
Are you going to divorce him?

534
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,522
Divorce...

535
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,225
He can't support two households.

536
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:16,080
And I am not living in a townhouse again.

537
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:20,244
So what did you do that was so special?

538
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:23,146
I did everything he ever wanted.

539
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,783
Costumes, roleplaying...

540
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,285
I bought a fucking swing.

541
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,360
Listen, most guys cheat.

542
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:34,328
And it's not because the wife
is some horrible, frigid bitch.

543
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:39,202
But it's because they all have
this primal urge to seek variety.

544
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,405
Pieces of shit!

545
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:41,925
Dean is a good guy!

546
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,334
You know, shut up!

547
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,715
I'm very mad at him.

548
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:49,355
He's just not what I thought he'd be, you know?

549
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:50,430
Which was?

550
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:51,424
Rich,

551
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:53,288
powerful,

552
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,926
faithful.

553
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:59,273
He just turned out to be
another mid-level asshole.

554
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,837
That makes me Mrs. Mid-level Asshole!

555
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,870
That's why I'll never marry!

556
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,407
No, you just fucked the married and
then I have to watch it on video.

557
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,506
and now I have to fucking deal with it

558
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,765
and I don't like dealing with things.

559
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:16,349
I much prefer to pretend they don't exist.

560
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:18,831
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,553
You're a big whore.

562
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:25,206
I think I should go now.

563
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:27,797
Oh sit your flat ass back down.

564
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,064
You're a good listener.

565
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,157
Thanks!

566
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,340
Fuck you!

567
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:36,201
Let's get another round.

568
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,475
Hey, Nancy!

569
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:01,523
Where is your...

570
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,592
Where is your ring?

571
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,254
My ring?

572
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:09,393
Yeah, your pretty little diamond ring.

573
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,161
It's in the shop.

574
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:17,390
Oh! Well, I hope they can fix it.

575
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:22,650
Yes, me too, Celia. Thanks!

576
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,667
Yeah.

577
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:46,128
We can fix this. Everything
is gonna be okay, buddy.

578
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,300
You got that, mom?

579
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,204
Dad made it all...

580
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,180
Mom?

581
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,254
Yeah, honey? What is it?

582
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:08,683
What happened?

583
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,735
I guess when you fell, the camera got smashed.

584
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:19,531
Yeah.

585
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:23,080
Yeah, I guess that's what happened.

586
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,950
Yeah.

587
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:27,298
Don't worry, we'll get another one.

588
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,258
Okay.

589
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,446
Ambien?

590
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,297
Take them, you need to rest.

591
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,222
What are you gonna do?

592
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:52,342
Nothing. Really.

593
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,633
I'm not going to do a thing.

594
00:28:57,175 --> 00:29:00,544
Look, I take one myself.

595
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:09,088
See?

596
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:13,334
Good night.

597
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,407
I am your father, Shane!

598
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:32,780
Join me on the dark side and
together we can rule the universe!

599
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:33,803
Never!

600
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:35,790
Then prepare to die!

601
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,283
Ah ah!

602
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,228
Get back in here right now.

603
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:45,318
We are not done talking.

604
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,658
Just say good night, dad.

605
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:48,154
And turn off the camera.

606
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,420
Good night, dad.

607
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:57,221
