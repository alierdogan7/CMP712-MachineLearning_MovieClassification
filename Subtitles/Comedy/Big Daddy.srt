Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.

674
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,190
Hey, I got an emergency
problem with this kid here.
Is Arthur Brooks around?

675
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,650
Yeah, I'll go get him for you.

676
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,403
Can you sit over there for a while?
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.

677
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,946
Mr. Gerrity?

678
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,074
Hi. Arthur Brooks.
How are you?

679
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,575
I need to speak with you.

680
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,869
I didn't tell you to come down
to the office, did I?

681
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,413
Because I was
gonna send you the final
paperwork in the mail, man.

682
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,415
It's like the opposite of that.

683
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,668
Look, I can't manage
this kid.

684
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,921
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.

685
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,674
Mistake?
I had a mother lined up for him,

686
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,469
but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

687
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,930
The kid just won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

688
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,808
He's like a cocker spaniel.
I just...

689
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,310
I think he'd be better off
with his natural mother.

690
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,939
Well, she passed away
last night, Mr. Gerrity.

691
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:49,443
She had cancer. She must
have sensed that, like,
her time was running short

692
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,446
and that she wanted her son
to be with the natural father.
It makes sense.

take care of Julian,

696
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,834
we'll take him. But I gotta tell you,
man, he's gonna have to chill
for a while in a group home.

697
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,794
Group home? What is that,
like an orphanage?

698
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,462

them that anymore.

Temporarily I'll hang on to the kid
until you find him a new family.

Oh, I don't know, man.
I mean, I gotta watch out for
the best interest of the kid.

You said yourself you
were a bogus dad.

711
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,199
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

712
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,202
I don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.

figure stuff out on my own.
