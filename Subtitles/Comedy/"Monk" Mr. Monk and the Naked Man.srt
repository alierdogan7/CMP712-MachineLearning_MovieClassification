Okay, I'm sorry.

Here. You can take it.

Take it. It's fine.

You get those barricades up?

32

Yes, sir.

 <i>Dr. G is guesstimating</i>

34

around 1:00 a.m.
at the latest.

35
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:46,132
Probably midnight.

36

This a bad time?

37

It's this MagnaPod.

38
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,638
The thing's brand-new
and it keeps getting stuck.

39
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:53,148
I can get to the menu,
but every time I press play,

40
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,048
it just goes...

41
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm gonna put it away now.
We've got work to do.

42
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,108
And what happened
to your gun?

43
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:03,996
Right here, back pocket.

44
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:07,160
Well, I use my gun,
what, maybe once a year.

45
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,151
Use this all the time.

46
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,087
I bet I can guess
what you're thinking.

Thank you for coming.

Is he okay?

51
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,336
Yeah. Uh, he doesn't like
the beach.

52
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,445
What's he doing?

53
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,147
Putting on his sand shoes.

54
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,161
What are sand shoes?
I don't know.

55

Look, we've got
a little problem here.

<i>This is a clothing optional</i>
 <i>beach.</i>

Yeah.

59
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:44,780
Oh.

60

[gasps]
Oh.

61
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,069
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>Yeah. So what do you think?</i>

62
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,047
I just want him
to look around a little bit,

63
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,348
see if we missed something.

64
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,348
It'll just take a minute.

65
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:53,633
Oh my God, I see one.

66

<i>Oh God,</i>
 <i>they're everywhere.</i>

67
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:56,848
Oh no,
there's another one.

68
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,348
<i>I-I gotta take him home.</i>

69
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,448
This is too risky.

70
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,948
It's too late.
Here he comes.

71
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:02,148
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>We can do this.</i>

72
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,687
Let's just distract him.
Monk!

73
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:04,421
Hey.

74
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:10,393
There should be a law against
murdering people on a beach.

75
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:12,648
Who was she?

76
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,348
Actually, we don't really have
that much.

77
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,748
Her name was Vickie Deline.

78
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,243
23. Lived in Mission Hill.

79
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:20,948
And she worked in a bar.

80
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,648
What was she doing here?
Well, don't know.

81
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:23,948
She parked her car up top,

82
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,504
left her keys
in the ignition.

83
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:26,548
Up the hill?

84
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:29,552
Why--why didn't she park
down here on the access road?

85
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:30,948
Any footprints?

86
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:33,147
No. Uh, it rained
this morning.

87
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,146
But body's over here.

88
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,371
Oh, hey,
like those shoes.

89
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,047
Yeah.
These are my sand shoes.

90
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,394
Nice.

91
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:43,480
Oh, look at the sand!

92
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:44,948
Never seen...

93
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,248
sand quite that color.

94
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,743
Mr. Monk, what would
you call that color?

95
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,963
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>I don't know. Sandy.</i>

96
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,020
Oh, look. A sand dollar.

97
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,109
No, just a shell.
Here she is.

98
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:58,864
Here we go.

99
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:08,096
What are you doing?
Just missed her.??

100
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:12,314
There's a ? cut.

101
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,481
?

102
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,250
I guess Dr. G missed that.

103
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,448
It's like a paper cut.

104
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,492
[stretching]
Oh yeah, those hurt
like the dickens.

105
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,547
What about
all the stab wounds?

106
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,348
Yeah, they probably hurt too.

107
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,941
(Monk)
There's still sand in it.
It's fresh.

108
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:28,747
Did you
find anything nearby?

109
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,448
Any papers or an envelope?

110
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:31,048
Not yet.

111
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,459
Well, she was holding
something.

112
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,765
Maybe that's what the killer
was after.

113
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,948
She's missing
a fingernail.
Yeah.

114
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,549
Yeah, we got that.

116
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:45,419

I know a couple of Vickies.

00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:26,948
I'm not so
into last names though.

135
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,248
Sir, would you mind
putting your shirt on?

136
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,545
May I ask why?
It would just--

137
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,263
it would mean a lot to me.

138
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:34,748

144
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,296

Get used to it.

155
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,048
There's absolutely no biological
necessity for clothing.

156
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:18,426
It's a construct.
It's a man-made artifice.

sent you.

Magneri Computers Peter Magneri?

166

Yeah, he lives up there.

He's been hassling me
for years.

168

I understand
your time is valuable.

177

Actually, a reporter
worked it out.

look at her.

182
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:19,748
Where's my coffee?

183
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:21,348
You've already had
four cups, sir.

184
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,048
And your wife said--

185
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,948
Do I need a doctor's note?
No, sir.

186
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,248
I got a clean bill of health
from St. Andrews

187
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,548
less than three weeks ago.

188
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:28,948
They checked me over,
head-to-toe.

189
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,248
MRIs, X-rays, blood tests.

190
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,248
Do you know what, I'm going
to bury the lot of you.

191
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,148
Coffee, coffee,
coffee now.

192
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:38,148
She was murdered
last night on your beach.

193
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:39,448
Oh, not my beach.

194
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,348
It should be my beach,
but it's not my beach.

195
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,883
Don't even
get me started on that.

196
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,248
I didn't actually pay
for this, did I?

197
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,448
No, sir,
that's a thank-you note

198
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,048
from the children
at Lincoln Elementary.

199
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,548
You donated some computers.

200
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,148
The zoning commission
meets on Wednesdays.

201
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:51,721
You want to come?

202
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,848
Sir, where were you
last night about midnight?

203
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:56,248
(Magneri)
I was here. I'm always here.
I was working late.

204
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,748
(Disher)
Did you see anyone
or hear anything?

205
00:09:58,748 --> 00:09:59,948
Well, as a matter of fact,

206
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,048
there was a woman trying
to get in last night.

207
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,248
She kept on ringing
the buzzer.

208
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,048
(Stottlemeyer)
Who was she?

209
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:03,823
How should I know?

210
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:05,348
Did she say anything?

211
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,878
Yes. Something about
a matter of life and death.

212
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,548
And you didn't let her in.

213
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,148
What, are you crazy?
Everybody wants a piece of me.

214
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,848
Everybody's problem's
a matter of life and death.

215
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,048
Yeah, I know.
Happens to us all the time.

216
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,350
Everybody wants something.

217
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,048
Listen, while we are here,

218
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,648
when I press play
on this thing,

219
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,148
why does it keep
sending me back to the menu?

220
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,448
I have no idea.
Call customer service.

221
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,748
No, no, no.
Ha ha.

222
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,348
They kept me on hold
for an hour and a half.

223
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:29,748
Look, my warranty
just expired.

224
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:30,848
If you could take
a quick look at it--

225
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,714
Lieutenant!

226
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,487
Holster your MP3.
That's an order.

227
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,148
Is there a security camera
by the gate?

228
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:40,148
Yeah, but it's broken.

229
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,548
That's a big surprise.

230
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:44,493
Look at him,
out there in public.

231
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:45,448
(Natalie)
Mr. Monk,

232
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,813
it's a nude beach!

233
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,748
<i>(Magneri)</i>
 <i>It's repugnant.</i>

234
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,048
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>That's the word.</i>
 <i>Repugnant.</i>

235
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:53,148
Degenerate.
That's the other word.

236
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,247
Degenerate!

237
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,148
<i>(Natalie)</i>
 <i>Don't you think</i>

238
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,214
<i>that's a little bit harsh?</i>

239
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:58,448
[scoffs]
Being polite.

240
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,648
Where was he last night?

241
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,548
<i>Exactly.</i>

242
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:02,248
We already spoke
to Mr. Singer.

243
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:03,804
<i>(Magneri)</i>
 <i>Yeah, well,</i>
 <i>speak to him again.</i>

244
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:06,848
Oh, he likes to pretend
he's all peaceful and new age-y,

245
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,947
but believe you me,
there's a dark side.

246
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:09,941
<i>I believe it.</i>

247
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,047
I can tell.
Even from here.

248
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,336
He threatened me once
at a zoning meeting.

249
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:16,925
Hit me with a microphone.

250
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,140
He's a nudist!
That's what they do.

251
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
They--they hit people
with microphones.

252
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,914
Captain.

253
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:30,680
He's the guy.

254
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:32,448
He says he was here
all night.

255
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:33,748
We're going to talk
to his staff.

256
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,248
Not him.
The <i>nudist.</i>

257
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:37,280
Singer?

258
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,048
I already called, Monk.
His alibi checks out.

259
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,248
He was in a lockup
all night.

260
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,300
I don't know how
he did it...

261
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,574
but he's the guy.

262
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,378
I still can't believe it.

263
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,197
She was more than my roommate.
She was my best friend.

264
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm so sorry.
How long did you know her?

265
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,063
Three years.

266
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,478
We met at a bar
downtown.

267
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,848
She was waitressing,

268
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,350
and I was working across
the street at the hospital.

269
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,629
I used to be
a lab technician.

270
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,952
Used to be?
I quit...

271
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,442
about two weeks ago
to play the market.

272
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,647
Day trader?
Good for you.

273
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:18,994
<i>Well, we'll see.</i>

274
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,848
Ask me again
in a few months.

275
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,645
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>Sand.</i>

276
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:23,807
<i>That must be Vickie.</i>

277
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:25,448
She'd been going
to the beach a lot.

278
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:26,779
Meeting a nudist?

279
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,506
A nudist?

280
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,921
Was she seeing anyone
in particular?

281
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,088
Uh, I think so.

282
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,848
She'd been hinting
about a guy--

283
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,073
Was he a nudist?

284
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:38,647
Let me put it another way.
Was he always naked?

285
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,742
Mr. Monk, you're not
letting her talk.

286
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,263
<i>I don't know.</i>

287
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,948
I think she might have been
meeting him last night.

288
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,448
That's him.
I knew it.

289
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,348
You don't know his name.
We all know his name.

290
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,847
Can I talk to you?
Excuse us.

291
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:51,548
Come here.

292
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:52,648
What are we doing here?

293
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,848
We should be getting
a search warrant.

294
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,248
We gotta get back
to the beach.

295
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,239
Get into his trailer.
Would you relax?

296
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,135
I have never seen you
like this.

297
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:02,048
We're wasting our time.
It's the nudist.

298
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:02,848
We both know it.

299
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,333
I don't know that, Monk.

300
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,248
Look, maybe you're right.
You usually are.

301
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,574
But I have to do
my job here.

302
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:13,005
I need to dot every I
and cross all the Ts.

303
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,053
You can appreciate that.
[cell phone ringing]

304
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:17,348
<i>You don't want</i>
 <i>any uncrossed Ts, do you?</i>

305
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,248
<i>Just sticking up.</i>
 <i>Some crossed.</i>

306
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,848
<i>Some of 'em</i>
 <i>not crossed.</i>
Hello.

307
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:21,748
With different angles.

308
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,339
That would be anarchy,
wouldn't it?
Yes.

309
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,284
And we don't want that,
do we?
No.

310
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,148
Sweetheart,
I can't leave just now.

311
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,037
Mr. Monk isn't feeling
very well.

312
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:31,721
He saw a naked man today.

313
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,423
I knew you'd understand.

314
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,169
So I'll be there
at 4:30.

315
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,580
I just need to get
the address.

316
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,548
'Scuse me.
May I use this?

317
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,549
Sure.
Go ahead, sweetie.

318
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,154
CDs, huh?

319
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:49,047
I've gone digital.
60 Gigs.

320
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,111
Over 5,000 songs in here.

321
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,348
Of course, I can't play
any of them.

322
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,848
Okay. Where were we?

323
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:55,001
We were talking
about the nudist.
No, we weren't.

324
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,740
We were talking
about the nudist.
No, we weren't.

325
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,102
<i>Randy, check your notes.</i>
 <i>Where were we?</i>

326
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:00,102
<i>Uh, right.</i>

327
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:03,243
Um, did, uh, Vickie
have any other--

328
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,240
There it is.
What?

329
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:07,536
[beeping]

330
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:09,315
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

331
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:14,988
'Scuse me.

332
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,592
Okay. Did Vickie have
any other boyfriends

333
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:25,966
that we need to know about?

334
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:27,786
no

335
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:55,593
Wait, Mr. Monk.

336
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,150
I don't think
we should do this.

337
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:59,733
You got a better idea?
Yes. Not doing it.

338
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,376
Door was open.

339
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,292
Must've been the wind.

340
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:14,693
Don't we need
a search warrant?

341
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,338
What about
the guy's rights?

342
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,793
[scoffs]
All your little rules.

343
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,659
All your little laws.

344
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:22,939
They don't apply down here.

345
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:26,150
It's nudie town.

346
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:43,323
It's a petition to keep
beach clothing optional.

347
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:44,993
Oh yeah.

348
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:47,256
That could give somebody
a nasty paper cut.

349
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,275
There's a knife missing.

350
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:53,393
<i>(Natalie)</i>
 <i>It's right here.</i>

351
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:54,675

<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>Oh, this guy's good.</i>

353

354
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:10,893
Hello.
What? What? What?

355
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,387
Skinless chicken.

356
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,793
Seedless grapes.

357
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,493
You see how it's all fitting
together?

358
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:17,166
No.

359
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,093
look,Sugar in the raw.

360
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:20,692
Mr. Monk, you're scaring me.

361
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,293
I've never seen you
like this.

362
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:25,147
It's like you want
this man to be guilty.

363
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,295
[vehicle approaching]

364
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,911
Mr. Monk, there's something
that I have to tell you.

365
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:32,634
When I was an exchange student
in Greece--

366
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,437
Oh. Someone's coming!

367
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,792
The nudists.
It's the nudists.

368
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,393
The nudists are back.
The closet!

369
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,654
No! There's no room!

370
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:41,998
Oh yeah. No clothes.

371
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:46,721
(Singer)
Okay, I'll get the light here.

372
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:49,293
Do you have
anything to drink?

373
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,393
Oh yeah, sure, in the fridge.
Anything you want.

374
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,080
<i>The water's potable.</i>
 <i>Oh, cool.</i>

375
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,593
So who was she,
the girl who was killed?

376
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:57,593
<i>You know, I just know</i>
 <i>what I read in the paper.</i>

377
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,393
<i>She was a waitress</i>
 <i>from Mission Hill.</i>

378
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,693
Right, and they think

379
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,493
that you're actually involved
in this somehow.

380
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,293
I'm not surprised.

381
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,693
They're always looking
for a reason

382
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:06,990
<i>to kick me out of here.</i>

383
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:07,937
<i>(woman)</i>
 <i>What was she doing?</i>

384
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,793
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>

385
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,592
I get kids coming
down here every night.

386
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:12,893
Maybe she was looking
to score some drugs

387
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,293
or meet a dealer,
I don't know.

388
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,293
Can we just talk
about something else?

389
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,393
Yeah.
All this murder talk's
really bringing me down.

390
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:19,293
Yeah. It's sad.
All right. To business.

391
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,093
Yeah. Okay. So, Jenny,
can you take some notes?

392
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,184
Sure.
Okay, yeah.

393
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:23,460
Anybody got a pen?

394
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:26,067
<i>Do I have a pen?</i>
 <i>Definitely not.</i>

395
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,800
Whoops. 'Scuse me.
Sorry.

396
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:31,092
I got one!

397
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:31,993
Oh, cool. Whoops.

398
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:32,493
[pen falls]

399
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:34,028
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

400
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:37,393
It rolled down that way.
 <i>Under here?</i>

401
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:38,693
<i>Yeah, right behind you.</i>

402
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:41,292
<i>No, no, I think you just</i>
 <i>kicked it behind you, man.</i>

403
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,093
I don't see it.
Maybe under
the fridge.

404
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,165
Under the fridge?

405
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,724
<i>Check under there.</i>

406
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:50,493
Where?
I'm getting tired of this.
Just get a new pen.

407
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,974
If I get lower,
I can see more.

408
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:55,793
<i>Bend over.</i>
 <i>Right by there. Bend over.</i>

409
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:59,522
<i>This is getting tiring.</i>
 <i>Can we find another pen?</i>

410
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:00,993
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

411
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,792
Isn't that it right there??

412
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,598
<i>Move your foot.</i>
 <i>The other foot.</i>

413
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,618
The other foot.
No, Chance's foot.

414
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:09,492
Where?
There it is.
I see it.

415
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,508
<i>Wait a sec there.</i>
 <i>Yeah, it's right there.</i>

416
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,393
It's right under there.
We're good to go.

417
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,193
Very good.
Nice grasp.

418
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,521
Sorry about that, guys.

419
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,793
Slid all the way down there.
That's crazy.

420
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,676
<i>Okay, so item number one.</i>

421
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,736
<i>Zoning board meets tomorrow.</i>

422
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:27,993
Yeah.
Marin County Court House.

423
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,593
10:00 a.m.
This is it, people.

424
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:30,449
The Super Bowl.

425
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,893
<i>What's the use?</i>

426
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,093
Peter Magneri's
gonna buy their votes anyway.

427
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,192
Hey, no negative thoughts.
Come on.

428
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,952
You gotta stay positive.
It's our beach.

429
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,593
Nobody can take it from us,
right?

430
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:43,093
<i>No.</i>
 <i>Okay, so we have</i>
 <i>to remember the petition</i>

431
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,493
<i>and copies of the survey.</i>

432
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,260
And also here's the thing...

433
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,844
we have to go textile.

434
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,793
<i>It's just for one day</i>

435
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:54,193
and we don't want
to do anything

436
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:54,993
to offend these people.

437
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:56,193
Plus, I think it's illegal.

438
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:59,331
Forget it. I don't have
anything to wear.

439
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:00,375
Literally.

440
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:01,607
Huh.

441
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,493
You know, I have an old suit
in the closet.

442
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,374
<i>You wanna try it on?</i>

443
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,577
You don't want--
 <i>Suit?</i>

444
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,465
<i>What about the principle</i>
 <i>of the matter?</i>

445
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,093
<i>Hey!</i>

446
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:14,329
[thud]

447
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,173
<i>(Monk)</i>
 <i>Just take my hand!</i>

448
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,725
<i>(Natalie)</i>
 <i>Mr. Monk,</i>
 <i>where are you going?</i>

449
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,682
It doesn't matter.
Just keep running!

450
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,093
<i>My friends</i>
 <i>are going to worry about me.</i>

451
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:26,525
What friends
are you talking about?

452
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,816
Let go of my hand now.

453
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:33,293
Where's your warrant?

454
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,593
Where are your trousers?

455
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:35,993
Why don't you people
just leave us alone?

456
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,393
We're just trying
to live our lives.

457
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,992
So was Vickie Deline.

458
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:40,693
I know you were seeing her,
Singer.

459
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:42,993
Her roommate told me.
Her roommate.

460
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:43,993
What happened?

461
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:46,425
She didn't want to join
your little cult?

462
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,993
She tried to run.
You grabbed the knife.

463
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,393
I did not know the girl.

464
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:51,993
Liar!
I never met her!

465
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,293
Will you get out
of my face, please?

466
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,493
No, no, no.
No, I know that trick.

467
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,092
I step back,
I see the whole schmegge.

468
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,193
Mr. Monk,
are you okay?

469
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:00,593
Your friend here
is psychotic!

470
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,893
We both know you did this.

471
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>Pervert!</i>
Mr. Monk!

472
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,393
How? Tell me that!
I was in prison all night!

473
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:07,893
There are 20 witnesses.
Check it out.

474
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:11,856
Don't think I won't.
Natalie, let's go.

475
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:08,893
He was here all night.

476
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,393
Yeah, booked at 7:30 p.m.

477
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:12,546
and released at 8:00 a.m.
the next morning.

478
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:14,293
It was definitely him?

479
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:14,993
Positive ID.

480
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,442
You want to see
the fingerprints?

481
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,192
What was he in for?

482
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,293
<i>(Disher)</i>
 <i>Public nuisance.</i>

483
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,622
He was collecting petitions
at a strip mall.

484
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,092
Strip mall.

485
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,493
Doesn't mean anything,
Mr. Monk.

486
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,293
That's what they're called.

487
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,367
Well, he got out.

488
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:29,693
Somehow, he got out.

489
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:30,891
And back in again.

490
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:32,999
Without the guards
noticing.

491
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,177
Excuse me.

492
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,654
Where did you get that?

493
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:38,996
From the guard.

494
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:40,541
How about this?

495
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,704
The guard gives Singer
an apple.

496
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,792
Singer chews the apple core
into the shape of a key.

497
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,592
He fashions a rudimentary kiln
using that light bulb

498
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:50,166
<i>and a sardine can.</i>

499
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:51,593
<i>He hardens the apple core</i>

500
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,193
in his kiln, and uses it
to pick the lock.

501
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,088
Thank you.

502
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:56,549
An apple core key.

503
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:58,389
No?

504
00:21:59,193 --> 00:21:59,865
Okay.

505
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:07,996
He slipped through the bars
and out the bathroom window.

506
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:09,816
How?

507
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:11,993
He wiggled through.
He's a nudist.

508
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,593
They're all double-jointed.

509
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,693
They are?
 <i>Randy.</i>

510
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,371
<i>Don't be so naive.</i>

511
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:19,117
They're not like us.

512
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:22,852
look,I-I have a theory.

513
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,111
I-I think--

514
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,998
I think they secrete a fluid.

515
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:28,794
<i>Like an oil.</i>

516
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,793
<i>It's odorless,</i>
 <i>but I can smell it.</i>

517
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,193
It makes them all slippery.

518
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:33,693
They can wiggle
through anything.

519
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,992
They're like slugs.

520
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,493
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>Monk, nobody wiggled</i>
 <i>through anything.</i>

521
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,193
There was a guard on duty
all night.

522
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,993
Then he's in on it too.
He's one of them.

523
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,893
Well, what about the 20 cops
that are outside?

524
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,196
They're all in on it!

525
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:44,657
Don't you see?

526
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,843
It's a cabal.

527
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,092
What?
 <i>A cabal.</i>

528
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,193
<i>It's a secret society.</i>

529
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,593
Sometimes they're naked.

530
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:54,093
Sometimes they go around dressed
to confuse us.

531
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:55,193
Well, they're certainly
doing that.

532
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:56,593
Have you read their literature?

533
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:58,593
I have.
They want to convert us all.

534
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,293
<i>And they won't stop</i>
 <i>until we're all</i>

535
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:03,593
like them, on beaches,
in parks,

536
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,793
hanging out...
everything hanging out.

537
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,362
Hanging and hanging.

538
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:10,730
Captain, there's only one way
to deal with them.

539
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,397
We gotta ship them back.

540
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,639
<i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>Ship them back where, Monk?</i>

541
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:22,649
Exactly.

542
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,480
Sit down.

543
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:33,691
Sit down.

544
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:44,975
Sit down

545
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,093
Look, I don't know
what happened

546
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,393
on that beach
Monday night.

547
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:52,993
I do not know
who killed that girl.

548
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,839
Actually,
I have another--
Let me finish.

549
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,392
Don't you talk.

550
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,902
This is not a conversation.

551
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,788
This is an intervention.

552
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:02,795
I'll tell you
what I do know.

553
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,693
Number one--
it was not Chance Singer.

554
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:06,793
Captain!
Chance Singer

555
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,892
was in my jail
all night long.

556
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,513
Number two--
you are off this case.

557
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:13,008
You--

558
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:15,955
You-you're defending them?

559
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,225
Monk, this is
San Francisco!

560
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,893
There's a million weirdoes
out there.

561
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,679
Some of them
are wearing clothes.

562
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,633
Some of them are not.

563
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:28,193
And yes,
I am defending them.

564
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:29,518
That's what this means.

565
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,676
We defend them.

566
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:36,793
I spend a lot of my time--
too much of my time--

567
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,593
trying to keep bigotry
and racism

568
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:39,593
out of this department.

569
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:40,693
I am not a bigot.

570
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,093
Well, I don't know what else
to call it, Monk.

571
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,793
You wanna put this guy away
for the rest of his life

572
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,682
because he makes you
uncomfortable.

573
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:49,995
Look,
you've always had issues.

574
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,829
But this isn't just
another quirk or phobia.

575
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,593
Like, uh,
your fear of clowns

576
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:58,893
or round things.

577
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:00,390
This is different.

578
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:01,668
This is new.

579
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:04,220
And weird.

580
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:06,420
And ugly.

581
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:08,993
First of all, I am not
afraid of round things--

582
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,662
Monk,
you're a great detective.

583
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,505
Look at it
like it's a mystery.

584
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,159
There's something
going on here.

585
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,211
Something's going on
inside of you.

586
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:21,861
Figure it out.

587
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:24,682
Detective.

588
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,981
I don't wanna see you
back here until you do.

589
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,693
This is...
this is not fair treatment.

590
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:47,493
How do people
wear these things?

591
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,093
I feel like
I'm suffocating.

592
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:49,792
I know.

593
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,492
I'm chafing.
Are you chafing?

594
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:55,193
Hey, does anyone have
any more of that powder?

595
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:56,035
I need it.

596
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:57,192
Hey, there he is.

597
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:59,497
<i>Here he comes,</i>
 <i>here he comes.</i>

598
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,237
<i>Peter...</i>

599
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,023
<i>It's Magneri.</i>

600
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,493
Peter! Mr. Magneri.

601
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:06,993
Channel 7 News.
How do you feel?

602
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:08,106
I feel great.

603
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,593
I feel
the Board of Supervisors

604
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:10,937
will do the right thing.

605
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:12,893
They understand
that I'm just a taxpayer.

606
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:14,293
All I want
is a front lawn of my own

607
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:16,393
where I can relax
and play with my kids.

608
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:17,393
(Singer)
The problem is, Mr. Magneri,

609
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:18,793
Barr Beach
is not for sale.

610
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,193
It belongs to the people
of San Francisco.

611
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:23,093
Mr. Singer,
is that really you?

612
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,893
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

613
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:25,893
You look almost human.

614
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:26,692
yeah

615
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:30,093
California has been blessed
with 1,200 miles 

616
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,292
of coastline.

617
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,793
Surely there's another beach
somewhere

618
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,593
where Mr. Singer
and his freaky friends

619
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,147
can throw their Frisbees.

620
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:38,693
Look, the real issue here
is that

621
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,183
I am a high-profile
individual.

622
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,993
I need my own beach
for my privacy

623
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,738
and my personal security.

624
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,185
A young woman,
as you may recall,

625
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,153
was murdered on that beach
only recently.

626
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,585
And the police have been
questioning Mr. Singer

627
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:51,861
about that very incident.

628
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,182
You can't say that.
You can't just accuse people.

629
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:55,429
I'm not accusing you,
sir.

630
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:57,582
Adrian Monk
is accusing you.

631
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,585
Mr. Monk happens to be
the finest detective

632
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,684
in San Francisco,
and he has confided in me

633
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:05,735
that Mr. Singer
is his primary suspect.

634
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:06,663
And you believed him?

635
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,162
Adrian Monk is certifiable.

636
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:10,263
He was in my house last night
without a warrant,

637
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,862
hiding in my closet.

638
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:13,763
I was gonna press charges,
but frankly,

639
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:14,963
I feel sorry for him.

640
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,966
I hope he gets the help
he needs, I really do.

641
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:23,961
There's something
I never told you.

642
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,518
Something happened
when I was a boy

643
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:31,696
There was an incident.

644
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:35,097
With a...
with a man.

645
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,193
Who was that?

646
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:41,094
I'd never seen him before.

647
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:42,359
Stranger.

648
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,741
How old were you?

649
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:46,929
I don't remember.

650
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:48,165
Young.

651
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:50,991
I was...so small.

652
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:55,389
I remember...

653
00:27:57,163 --> 00:28:00,654
I remember[voice breaking]
I was naked.

654
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,247
Take your time.

655
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:05,849
I was so naked.

656
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:09,241
I just hated
being naked.

657
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:11,484
And I remember...

658
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:13,635
I was crying.

659
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,605
And then...

660
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,799
he hit me.

661
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,163
Adrian, I'm so sorry.

662
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,225
There was blood.

663
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:27,086
There was blood everywhere.

664
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:29,757
I was screaming.

665
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:31,184
I wanted him to stop.

666
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:33,778
And my mother...

667
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,046
my mother was smiling.

668
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:40,463
W-w-wait, your--
your mother was there?

669
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,191
Why didn't she stop him?

670
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:44,063
She was supposed
to protect me.

671
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:45,266
He kept hitting me.

672
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,571
Swinging me around
upside down, and...

673
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,149
<i>You</i> were upside down?

674
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,049
Was he wearing a mask?

675
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,963
I never wanted
to be naked again.

676
00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:06,163
Adrian,
that man was a doctor.

677
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,568
You're remembering
your own birth.

678
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,063
Doctor...doctor?

679
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:14,475
Anybody else,
I wouldn't have believed it.

680
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:15,636
But you...

681
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,163
Doctor?

682
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:17,685
Mm-hmm.

683
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,452
Well, that would explain
a lot, actually.

684
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,582
The lights,
and my father

685
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,016
in the doorway
holding a balloon.

686
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,462
You feel better?

687
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:34,907
[chuckling]
Yes.

688
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,407
I do.

689
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:40,920
Wow.

690
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,387
That only took
11 years.

691
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:49,862
[doorbell rings]
Hello!

692
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:51,763
Sorry, the door was open.
Natalie, listen.

693
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:53,763
Monk, I'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to call.

694
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:55,963
Something happened.
I was talking to Dr. Kroger.

695
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,763
I remembered something.
Mr. Monk.

696
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,563
There's been something
I've been trying to tell you.

697
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:00,663
When I was 19--

698
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,163
Is this gonna be
a long story?

699
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:03,023
Please let me finish.

700
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,562
I was an exchange student
in Greece.

701
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,263
And there was this
beautiful beach that was about

702
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,506
three blocks away
that I went to all the time.

703
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,763
Great.
And this is the thing,
Mr. Monk.

704
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:10,435
Um...

705
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,117
It was a European beach.

706
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,963
Which means...topless.

707
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:17,363
I don't care.
I had a breakthrough.

708
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,763
I was a nudist, Mr. Monk.
I was one of them.

709
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:20,763
I went back
four years ago,

710
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,763
so technically I guess
I still am one.

711
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:24,363
I was in the cabal.

712
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:25,463
No, Natalie, forget that.

713
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:27,263
I mean, maybe it means
you can't work with me anymore,

714
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:28,429
but I don't care.

715
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:29,763
I'm not apologizing for it.

716
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,063
I met the best people.

717
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,663
It was the most amazing time
of my life.

718
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:34,752
Great.
Natalie, listen.

719
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,663
I am not that guy anymore.

720
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:37,463
It's okay.

721
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,963
I had an amazing session
with Dr. Kroger.

722
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,402
I went back.

723
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,463
I went way back.

724
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:46,663
Way, way, way, way,
way back, back.

725
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:48,205
Back, back, back,
back, back.

726
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,263
And I got past it.
This whole naked thing.

727
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,964
I understand it now.

728
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,215
Wow.
 <i>Yeah.</i>

729
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:54,363
And guess what
I just did?

730
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,205
I walked through
Bishop Park.

731
00:30:56,363 --> 00:30:57,363
You know, the big statue?

732
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:59,735
The nude statue
of the nude woman?

734
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,980
I looked right at it.

735
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,463
Mr. Monk, the statue
in Bishop Park is a man.

736
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,663
Okay, I glanced at it.

737
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,563
But I wasn't completely
and totally repulsed.

738
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:09,763
I didn't black out.

739
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,463
And I didn't throw up!

740
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:13,562
Wow. You know,
there's a word for that.

741
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:14,163
Progress.

742
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,163
Progress, that's me.

743
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,762
Only 312 other issues
to go!

744
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,463
Well, I guess we'll just
take 'em one at a time.

745
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,498
Let's start
with dryer lint.

746
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,363
Hey, I guess this means

747
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:24,163
you owe Chance Singer
an apology.

748
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:26,251
Yeah, I guess I do.

749
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,363
Maybe I'll bring him something.

750
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:31,563
Like a bottle of wine
or some overalls.

751
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:32,304
What's this?

752
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:34,372
What?

753
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,263
Oh, a note.

00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,842
No, I mean this stationery.

The yellow copy is for you

769
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:24,963
You worked at St. Andrews
Hospital, is that right?

770
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,263
You were an X-ray technician.

771
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:28,163
Did you ever meet
Peter Magneri?

772
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,063
Who?

773
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:30,063
Peter Magneri.

774
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:31,763
He founded Magneri Computers.

775
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:32,822
They make these.

776
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,682
I thought yours broke.

777
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,923
Yeah, I bought another one.
90 Gigs.

778
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:38,395
Life's too short, right?

779
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:45,663
Mr. Magneri had
a checkup July 23rd.

780
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,593
That's four days
before you quit.

781
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:48,963
I got a clean bill of health

782
00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:50,763
from St. Andrews
three weeks ago.

783
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,742
They checked me for everything,
head to toe.

784
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:54,263
We just spoke
to the SEC.

785
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,063
Apparently, since July,
you've been very interested

786
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:57,463
in the Magneri company,

787
00:32:57,463 --> 00:32:58,794
except you haven't been
investing.

788
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,563
You've been selling short.

789
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,419
You've been betting
against the company.

Turn it off.

791
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,167
I'm sorry.
It won't stop.

792
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:09,471
Here's what happened.

793
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:12,162
Three weeks ago,
Magneri went in for a checkup.

794
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,130
You were the lab tech. on duty

795
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:16,263
You must have noticed something
on his X-rays.

796
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,663
Something serious.
Something that could kill him.

797
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,863
(Natalie)
It was the ultimate piece
of inside information.

798
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:22,435
(Stottlemeyer)
 <i>Literally</i> inside.

799

(Monk)
Peter Magneri
 <i>is</i> Magneri Computers.

800
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,300
You knew if anything happened
to him,

801
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,900
the stock would plummet.

802
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,999
All you had to do
was switch X-rays

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
and put a different label
on it.

804
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
Magneri got
a clean bill of health.

805
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,199
Nobody knew how sick
he really was,

806
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,700
not him,
not even his doctor.

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
You quit your job
and started selling short,

808
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
betting against the company.

809
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,500
When Magneri died,
you'd make a small fortune.

810
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,500
At some point,
Vickie found out.

811
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,400
Maybe you were looking
for a partner.

812
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Maybe you were just bragging.

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
But Vickie wasn't
like you.

814
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
She couldn't just sit back
and do nothing

815
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,800
and wait for another human being
to die.

816
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,700
She tried to warn Magneri.

817
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,700
You knew you had to stop her
by any means necessary.

818
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
That night,
Vickie told Magneri

819
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
it was a matter
of life or death.

820
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
She was talking
about him.

821
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,000
His life or death.

 <i>(Stottlemeyer)</i>
 <i>You chased her down.</i>

823
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,300
You killed her on the beach

824
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,000
That's insane.
You don't have any--

825
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,400
Proof?
Mr. Monk found this.

826
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
It was hidden
behind your toilet.

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,600
in perpetuity.

884
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
Well, we're giving it back.

885
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,100
You know,
we were talking about it,

886
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,800
and--and the beach
is a little rocky

887
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,500
for our tastes,
a little tough on the feet.

888
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,999
So we're gonna find
another beach.

889
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,900
are you??

890
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
Wait a minute, Singer.

891
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
Is this a trick?

892
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
No, my friend.
This is no trick.

893
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,100
You've won.
The beach is yours.

894
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,900
You've won.
Breathe.

895
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,700
Relax.
That's good, sit.

896
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Let me adjust your chi.

897
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
What's going on?

898
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Mr. Magneri.

899
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,399
Sir, we need to get you
to the hospital.

900
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,900
Hospital?
Trust me, sir.

901
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,899
You're a very sick man.

902
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,300
I'll explain everything
on the way.

903
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,500
He's right, sir.
I've seen your X-rays.

904
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,900
We've got an ambulance
waiting downstairs.

905
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
X-ray?
Hi. Remember me?

906
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Listen, I don't want
to upset you or anything,

907
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,300
but, uh...
my MagnaPod died.

908
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
No, I-I bought
another one.

909
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
And, uh, it's the second one
I've bought in three months.

910
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,899
Randy, give it a rest.
No, it's no big deal.

911
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,300
You see, it just keeps
getting stuck on "menu."

912
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
So, I mean, and my Walkman
never did that.

913
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,699
Well, get yourself
another Walkman!

914
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,600
Leave me alone.

915
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,599
(Disher)
No, no, it's no big deal.

916
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,900
Here, put it in here--
Randy, Randy, Randy!

917
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,499
Just listen--
Randy, give me this.

918
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,100
Give me this.

919
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,800
You're right,
it's broken.

920
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,200
Hello.

921
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
 <i>Hi.</i>
(Natalie)
Hi.

922
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,700
 <i>You're moving?</i>

923
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,900
Oh, yeah.

924
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,100
Moving on up.

925
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,800
Peter Magneri bought us
our own island

926
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,900
down the coast.

927
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,200
It's the least he could do.
You saved his life.

928
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,999
Oh, well, yeah, sure.
I'm his neighbor.

929
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,300
That's what neighbors do,
right?

930
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,000
Mr. Monk?

931
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,200
Yeah, look at that cloud.

932
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
What does that cloud
look like to you?

933
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,100
Huh?
What cloud?

934
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Oh, there's a cloud.
Way up there.

935
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
You guys talk.

936
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I'm gonna keep looking at it
for a while.

937
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,500
Well, hey,
if you're ever in, uh,

938
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,700
San Diego,
give us a call.

939
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,799
You won't have to crouch
in the closet this time.

940
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
[chuckling]
Okay.
I'd love to.

941
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,799
But I promised Mr. Monk
I wouldn't be visiting

942
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
any nude beaches until
five years after he's dead.

943
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,500
 <i>Mr. Monk,</i>
 <i>wasn't there something</i>

944
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,800
you wanted to say?

945
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,100
Uh, yeah.
Chance...

946
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,900
I'm sorry for hating you
and accusing you of murder,

947
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
and I've learned a lot,
and I'm a better person.

948
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,600
Hey, you know,
we're all just caught here

949
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,300
on this crazy,
big blue marble

950
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,500
doing the best we can.

951
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,499
Am I right?

952
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,400
Yeah, right.
Right?

953
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,000
Come here.

954
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,400
COME HERE??

955
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,600
??

956
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,500
He wants a hug.

957
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,200
Come on.
Come here.

958
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Little closer.

959
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
Come on.

960
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh, yeah.

961
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Good.

962
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
good

963
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh, yeah.

964
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,200
You're a good hugger.

965
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,900
You smell good.

966
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,700
Real good.

967
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,100
Good.

968
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,900
Thanks.

969
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,200
You want a wipe?

970
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
No, I'm good.

971
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,700
Mr. Monk?

972
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,100
Mr. Monk?

973
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,300
Mr. Monk!

974
