125
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,680
She sent us

126
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,216
The Reverend Mother said
we're not to come back without you.

But we know that she needs you and she
wants us to come and bring you back.

Is she okay ? Health-wise ?
Is she in danger ?

00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,852
Oh, no, she's fine. Well,
she's a little desperate.

She's desperate ?

00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:03,117
I'm sorry I couldn't join

I've heard you are
truly a spectacle.

142
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,880
Well, yeah, you know,
I work at it.

143
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,791
You're probably wondering why I asked
the Sisters to bring you here.

144
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,558
I am a little curious.
What's all the mystery ?

145
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:20,796
Well, you see, Deloris,
we need your help here...

00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,063
at St. Francis.

147
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:30,737
We seem to have got in
slightly over our heads.

148
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:33,041
What... do you want ?

149
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,380
Help us

Oh, no.

00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:43,315
Listen, I'm not cut out

153
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:45,656
Who would I teach ?
What would I teach ?

154
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,822
Teach the children.
Teach music.

155
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,994
You weren't cut out to be a nun either,
but look what you accomplished
at St. Katherine's.

156
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,766
You brought a new spirit into
the convent and into the community.

157
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,432
You were... infectious.

158
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,510
You could be just
as infectious here.

159
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,512
You're making me
sound like a disease.

160
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,072
We are struggling here with
a community that is tired...

161
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:10,846
and worn
and despairing.

- In a New York minute.

- Yeah, well, now, I'm undercover again.
- It could be fun.

- All I need is a bed...

- and a place to kneel.
- Wait until you see what
we have in the room for you.

something silly, did you ?
- Well, maybe.

- A bi-what ?

- A watched pot never boils.

I am the music teacher,

<i>Not electric,

Let me simplify it for you.
When I say ''eclectic,''

500
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,047
<i>what I mean is, I like lots

But my favorite,

00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:17,791
Yes, it is a shocking question:
''Who are the Supremes ?''

- [ Tyler ] Oh, Diana Ross.</i>

<i>- Well, let me tell you.
They were the premier group.
- Yes!</i>

''Yes !'' Because they were incredible.

<i>-What I love when I think about music...
-About time.</i>

517

The Archdiocese has decided St. Francis

Why does it have
to happen so quickly ?

You're totally in the red with

I happened to be eavesdropping
in Father Maurice's office,
and I heard him talkin'.

575
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:20,232
We were afraid this might happen.
I've been expecting it for some time.

<i>- What do we do now ?
- We'll probably be reassigned.</i>

What a stupid thing to do. This is
the only school left in this community.

We've got to do something.
Otherwise we're gonna lose our

00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:10,781
- Yes, as a matter of fact.
- I am familiar with the dilemma.

589
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:14,184

00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:19,883
- Yes, I am aware of this.
- You are ? How did you know ?

592
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:23,522
You'll find that when one deals
with Sister Mary Clarence,

593
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:26,863
one is smothered with more information
than one wishes to possess.

594
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,528
I'm afraid she's becoming
quite disruptive.

595
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:33,267
Disruption is the way
Mary Clarence communicates.

596
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:37,140

No, I wouldn't
want to frighten you.

599
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:50,314
But in my experience,
I found it easier and ultimately...

600
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:54,952
quite effective to give
Mary Clarence a free hand.

601
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:57,724
Aren't her ideas
extremely radical ?

If I remember correctly,

603
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,832
the term ''radical'' was
applied to us in our day.

Or have you forgotten the trouble

A fellow used to write to him and say,

''I want to be a writer.
Please read my stuff.''

961

'' Don't ask me about being a writer.

If, when you wake up in the morning,
you can think of nothing but writing...
