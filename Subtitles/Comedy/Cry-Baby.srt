I've never given a French kiss before.

547

Watch. It's easy.

548
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,200
You just open your mouth,

549
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,900
and I open mine,

550
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,100
and we wiggle our tongues together.

551
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,100
And it feels real sexy.

552
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,600
I won't get mononucleosis, will I?

553
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,500
No, Allison. Just try it.

554
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,300
If you don't like it,
I promise I'll stop.

I'm sorry, Allison.

564
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,400
It's just that you are so beautiful.

565
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,100
I want to let you, but I can't.

566
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,900
For my parents' sake.

567
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,100
Cry-Baby, they're both
dead. I'm an orphan.

568
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm sorry, Allison.

569
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,000
No wonder we're together, honey.

570
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,300
I'm an orphan, too.

571
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,300
You are?

572
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Yes.

573
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
And orphans have special needs.

574
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,700
Just on the outside of the
shirt, okay? Is it okay with you?

575
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,700
Yes. Oh, yes!

576
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,900
My parents were, they good
people and they... they loved me.

577
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,100
I want you. I need you.

578
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,900
I love you, too, Allison.

579
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
They had to go on a
business trip together.

580
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,100
It was their first airplane ride.

581
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh, Cry-Baby, your
fingers feel so good.

582
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,900
I've been saving it up
for a girl like you, honey.

583
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,000
Mommy and Daddy took
separate planes for safety.

584
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,500
In case one plane crashed, I
would still have a living parent.

585
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,700
But, Cry-Baby, both planes crashed

586
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
and I never saw my parents alive again.

587
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,600
[Thunder cracking]

588
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,400
Goddamn! Lightning!

589
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
What's the matter, Cry-Baby?

590
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,400
Everything is the matter.

591
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,700
It's just a thunderstorm.
Heat lightning.

592
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,700
It's sexy.

593
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,300
It's not sexy. Electricity
makes me insane.

594
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,000
Why, Cry-Baby? Why?

595
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,300
Here's why. Electricity
killed my parents.

596
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,800
They died in the electric chair?

597
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,700
That's right, Allison.

598
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,200
My father was the Alphabet Bomber.

599
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
He may have been crazy,
but he was my pop.

600
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,200
The only one I ever had.

601
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,200
God. I read about the Alphabet Bomber.

602
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,000
Bombs exploding in the... the
airport, the barbershop.

603
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,700
That's right, all in alphabetical order.

604
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,100
Carwash, drugstore.

605
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,200
I used to lay in my cradle and
hear him scream in his sleep.

But your mom?

609
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,300
My mother tried to stop him.

610
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,300
She couldn't even spell, for Christ's
sake, but they fried her, too.

611
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
But I'll pay them all back, Allison.

612
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,100
That's why, every day, I gotta do

613
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,000
something rotten for my parents' sake

614
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,700
and I cry for what I have to do.

615
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,300
But not much, though.

616
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,900
One single, salty tear

617
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,700
is all that they will ever
suck out of this Cry-Baby.

Allison, come home. They
beat me and kicked me.

L-Let her go. She's with me.

642

Her name is Allison
and she is a nice girl.

Allison, I'm sorry to get you locked up.

you were the coolest date I ever had.

But, Cry-Baby, who is that girl?

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,800
Why didn't you tell me you
already had a lady friend?

648

Lenora ain't nothing to me,
I swear on my daddy's grave.

Yes, Your Honor.

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,600
We have been praying
all night for our son.

664
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,700
And praying so hard
that we got headaches.

Hi, Wanda honey.

666
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,900
You were on the radio.

667
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,500
Would you just get me
the fuck out of here?

668
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,200
What does "fuck" mean, Hector?

669
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh, Maggie, it's just a
teen nonsense word Wanda uses

670
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,400
to make herself feel all grown-up.

671
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,900

take Wanda the fuck home?

676
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,300
You hear that, Your Honor? It's a sign.

00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,800
[Speaking indistinctly]

678
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,300
She is speaking in tongues.

679
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
God is in her gullet.
And he is in yours, too.

680
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,500
Let him out.

681
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,800
Let the words of the Savior be heard.

Order! Order!

683
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,900
No wonder your children are in trouble.

684
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,700
And you, Miss Malnorowski...

685
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,500
By the way, that's a
shame about your face.

686
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,600
There's nothing the matter with my face.

687
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,200
I got character.

688
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,300
I see that your parents
haven't taken the trouble

689
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,600
to come to get you.

690
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,400
(Mr. Malnorowski) Oh, yes, we did.

691
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,100
You happy now, Mona? You finally did it.

692
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,100
You put your own mother in an iron lung.

693
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,100
Mrs. Malnorowski,

694
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,900
there is no smoking in this courtroom.

695
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,600
Why not?

696
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,600
I pay taxes on cigarettes, don't I?

697
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,100
And what do I get for those taxes?

698
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,500
Happiness? Hell, no.

699
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,200
I get tuberculosis.

[Explodes]

701
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,500
Oh, Christ! Now I got a flat tire.

702
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm going to release these delinquents

703
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,800
to their parents' custody.

704
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,200
And if they were mine,

705
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,800
I'd give them a bare-assed whipping.

706
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,500
Ramona and Belvedere Rickettes,

707
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,400
I find you guilty of
disturbing the peace

708
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,400
and I fine the both of you $1,000.

709
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,000
That's all we have.

710
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,700
How are we supposed to live?

711
