1
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,178
Well, for my part

2
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:29,617
I like to say
as the new guy

3
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:32,019
will take over you

4
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,114
I hope I can fill
your shoes

5
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:34,488
because from the
looks of people here

6
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,822
and what they
think about you

7
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,819
they sure seem awfully big

8
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,125
As most of you know
I just moved here recently

9
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:47,899
from Demoy, with
my wife, Patty here

10
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,236
and Kimberly, our
1 4-month old

11
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,038
you all have made
us feel so welcomed

12
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:56,808
and Warren, I want you
to feel just as welcome

13
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,372
to visit our office
any time you want

14
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,212
In fact

15
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,241
as we'd been discussing
for last couple of weeks

16
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:05,517
questions about our
various product

17
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:10,516
Iike the new Universal
Life Policy next month

18
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,660
and...

19
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:17,656
anyway, here's to you, Warren

20
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,063
Hey, Warren, how do
you feel about these

21
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:27,737
young punks taking
over our jobs?

22
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:31,976
Seems like some kind of
conspiracy to me

23
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:34,814
Now I've known Warren here

24
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:38,413
probably longer than most
of you people been alive

25
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:42,915
we go way back
way back

26
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,985
in horse and buggy days

27
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,989
Anyway, I know something
about retirement

28
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,268
what I want to say
to you out loud

29
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:59,833
so all these young
hotshot can hear

30
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:03,176
is all those gifts there

31
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:06,546
don't mean a damn thing

32
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:11,543
and this dinner doesn't
mean a thing

33
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:16,056
and social security pension
doesn't mean a thing

34
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:21,053
none of these superficiality
mean a damn thing

35
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,533
What means something
what really means something

36
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:29,232
Warren, is the knowledge
you devoted your life

37
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:33,937
to something meaningful

38
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,968
To be productive

39
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,174
working for a fine company

40
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:43,175
held one of top rated
insurance company in nation

41
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:48,588
to raising a fine family
to building a fine home

42
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,788
to be respected by your community

43
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:56,789
to having wonderful
lasting friendships

44
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,767
At the end of his career

45
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:01,100
a man can look back and say

46
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:04,164
I did it, I did my job

47
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,075
then he can retire in glory

48
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:11,912
and enjoy riches far
beyond the monetary can

49
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,283
So all you young people here

50
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,280
take a good look
at a very rich man

51
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,490
I love you

52
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:45,738

00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:17,207
Good evening

00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,894
Hello?

56
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,630
Hi, honey

57
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,037

58
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:45,303

just a minute

59
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:50,302
Warren, here on the phone
is Ginny

60
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:58,519
Ginny? How are you doing?

61
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:03,515
lt went just fine, yeah
nice event

62
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,328
l know, but don't give it
another thought

63
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:10,925
you got bigger fish to fry

64
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:15,928
l know, we'll see out there
real soon anyway

65
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:18,605
What?

66
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:22,476
Yeah, did I get the robe?
Yes

67
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:25,572
that was quite an item

68
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,244
you sure went overboard

69
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:33,245
From U Nç Rental? I see

70
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:36,085
Well, thank you both

71
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:41,086
it sure going to
come in handy now

72
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:45,131
You bet you

73
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:48,695
Okay

74
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:53,699
Bye now

75
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:56,739
Did you thank Randall?

76
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,682
I did
What did he say?

77
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:02,685
I just told Ginny

78
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,812
You didn't thank
him personally?

79
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:05,685
Nço

80
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:09,658
Why not?
He didn't come to the phone

81
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,183
Why not?

82
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:14,686
I don't know
he didn't come to phone

83
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,892
You should have asked for him

84
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,162
You need to make
an effort

85
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:19,463
he's going to be
your son-in-law

86
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,368
and you hardly know him

87
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,305
I know well enough

88
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,865
You should try
to be more positive

89
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,934
she's lucky to have him

90
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,139
Yeah

91
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,272
You know

92
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:36,275
my father didn't think
so much of you at first

93
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,323
Where to, mister ?

94
00:10:55,365 --> 00:11:00,325
Looks like you need a ride

95
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,539
Surprise

96
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,776
I thought it'd be fun to
have breakfast in here today

97
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:17,446
you know, seem like
little beehive

98
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:22,447
Fine

99
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:32,301
Isn't this fun?

100
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:37,295
Well, sort of gives
us a rough idea

101
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,340
We are going to have

102
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:43,505
a lot of good times
in here, Warren

103
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,539
Yep

104
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,543
Here's to a whole new chapter

105
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,997
"... Child Reach, we need
people who want to help"

106
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,023
throughout the world

107
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:40,969
in many of
the poorest countries

108
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:44,167
there is a wonderful organization
called Child Reach

109
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,038
that is making a profound
difference in lives of

110
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:49,944
children just like these

111
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,711
For just $22 a month
justt 72 cents a day

112
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,742
you can become
a Child Reach sponsor

113
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:57,718
and not only touch the life

114
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:00,018
of a needy boy
or girl oversea

115
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:04,459
but also help the child's
family and community

116
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:07,861
"Think of it, just $22 a month"

117
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,798
and a little girl like this

118
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,668
would not be using
dirty water

119
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,932
a child like this
would be able to

120
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,372
go to school and learn

121
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:22,742
I'm so glad you've watched

122
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:27,772
now that you have
what are you going to do?

123
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:02,707
I'm glad to hear that

124
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:08,013
Right... Oh no

125
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,626
I can't take all
the credit for that

126
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,620
I don't know
I did use a calculator

127
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,059
That's my motto

128
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:20,194
"Alright, all ready"

129
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:23,536
Bye-bye... Hey

130
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,542
"there he is
what do you say, partner? "

131
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,511
Pretty good
how are you doing?

132
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,878
Nçot too shabby

133
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,849
I see you are all moved in

134
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:38,320
"Oh yeah, so what brings you
back to this part of woods? "

135
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:42,018
I was just driving by
want to pop up and see

136
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,151
what trouble
you're getting in to

137
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:47,027
"You know, keeping busy"

138
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,155
And I want to make sure

139
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,631
you don't have
any more questions about

140
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:54,103
those pre-teen models
I was working on

141
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:57,106
they seem pretty
straight forward at first

142
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,735
" Nço, no, I think I got
pretty good handle on things"

143
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,211
you did a super job
of handling everything

144
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:05,942
just super
smooth selling all the way

145
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:10,578
Because I have been concerned
about some of those items

146
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,147
that I watch you
slipping through cracks

147
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,684
"you know, it kind of
has been nagging at me"

148
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:23,688
" Nçope, business has
to worth something"

149
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,497
If everything would
bubble up to surface

150
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,005
why not give you at home

151
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,500
you can bet on that

152
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:37,069
I got to get to
a meeting at west

153
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:40,173
You want to take
the elevator down with me?

154
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:43,083
"Okay, sure
Great"

155
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,986
Great to see you
looking good

156
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:50,982
Thank you
Have you been working out?

157
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,858
Hi

158
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,767
How was it at the office?

159
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:35,964
Fine

160
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,734
Good thing I stopped by

161
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:41,767
T urns out he needs my help
with a couple of loose ends

162
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:46,771
That's wonderful

163
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:36,247
Dear Nçdugu

164
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,321
My name is Warren R Schmidt

165
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:48,326
and I am your
new foster father

166
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,644
alright...

167
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:03,243
" I live in Omaha, Nçebraska"

168
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:06,585
my older brother Harry
lives in Rod

169
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,921
with his wife Estil

170
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,918
Harry lost a leg 2 years
ago due to diabetes

171
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:17,026
I am 66 years old

172
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,460
recently retired as
vice president in

173
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:24,462
Actuary Woodman of the
World lnsurance Company

174
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,912
damn it fell into
this little kid

175
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:38,250
alright
maybe he's got a theory

176
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,279
and can plug a few
numbers into computer

177
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:43,724
but I can tell he
doesn't know a damn thing

178
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,957
about genuine real world
risk assessment

179
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:51,956
our managing department
will cark that bastard

180
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,046
Anyway

181
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:09,916
66 must sound too old to
a young one like yourself

182
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:14,049
The truth is it sounds
pretty old to me too

183
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,354
because when I look into the mirror

184
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:18,826
and see the wrinkles around my eyes

185
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:23,298
"and sagging skin on my neck,
head, and my ears"

186
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,233
veins on my ankles

187
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:29,728
I can't believe
it's really me

188
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,171
When I was a kid

189
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,266
I used to think
maybe I was special

190
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:37,871
that somehow destinied to
be a great man

191
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:41,509
Nçot like Walt Disney
or somebody like that

192
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:46,511
but somebody semi-important

193
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:50,192
I got a degree
in business statistics

194
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:52,558
was planning to start
my own business someday

195
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,495
build it up into
a big corporation

196
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,498
watch it go public

197
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,898
maybe make the Fortune 500

198
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:03,895
I was going to be
the guy you read about

199
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:09,033
but somehow it just
didn't work out that way

200
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,074
you got to remember l
got top job at Woodman

201
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,142
a family to support

202
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:20,884
I couldn't put
their security at risk

203
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:24,518
" Helen, that's my wife"

204
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,520
she wouldn't vote out

205
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,328
What about my family
you might ask

206
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,703
What about my wife and daughter

207
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,700
Don't they give me all the
pride and satisfaction I could want

208
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:48,711
Helen and I have been
married 42 years

209
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:53,711
Lately every night I find
myself asking the same question

210
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,550
Who is this old woman who
lives in my house?

211
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:04,597
Why is every little thing
she does irritates me?

212
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:07,068
Like the way she gets
the keys out of her purse

213
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,469
Iong before we reach the car

214
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,097
and how she throws our
money away

215
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,406
on her ridiculous collection

216
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,709
and tossing out perfectly
good food

217
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:21,308
just because the expiration
date is passed

218
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,310
and her obsession with

219
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:34,318
and the way she cuts me
off when I try to speak

220
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,932
I hate the way she sits

221
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:43,496
and the way she smells

222
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,200
For years now she has
insisted that I sit

223
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:49,143
when I urinate

224
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:52,773
I promised to lift the seat
and put the seat back down

225
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:57,775
it wasn't good enough for her

226
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:07,354
then there's Ginny

227
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:09,728
she's our only

228
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:14,726
I bet she'd like you

229
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:18,973
She used to get by
pretty good in German

230
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:22,239
She'd always be my little girl

231
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,872
She lives out in Denver

232
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:27,075
we don't get to see
her much any more

233
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:31,348
She only stay in touch by
phone every couple of weeks

234
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:33,787
She comes out
for holidays sometimes

235
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:36,485
but not as often as we like

236
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:41,486
She has responsibility
with high tech

237
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:45,192
very hard for her to break away

238
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:48,761
Recently she got engaged

239
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:53,765
so I suppose we'll be
seeing even less of her now

240
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:59,006
Fellow's name is
Randall Hertzl

241
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:02,745
He's got a sales job

242
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:05,151
Maybe Ginny is past her prime

243
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:09,181
but I think she can
do a lot better job

244
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:14,185
this guy is like smuf
not for my little girl

245
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:26,934
I'll close now and get
this into mail

246
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:29,774
Here I am rumbling
on and on

247
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:32,280
you probably want to
hurry up and cash that check

248
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:35,011
and get yourself something to eat

249
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:37,076
so take it easy

250
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,952
best of luck
with all your endeavors

251
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:44,949
Yours very truly
Warren Schmidt

252
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:55,068
Hi

253
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,196
I 'm going out to mail letter

254
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,206
do you need anything?

255
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,200
Nço

256
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:12,543
I have been doing
some research

257
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:17,949
it amazes me the librals
and look in silver cloud

258
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:24,764
What can I get you?

259
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,635
I'll have a blizzard and
vanilla ice cream

260
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,765
What would you like in it?

261
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:35,106
I'll have some...

262
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:37,612
Reeses pieces

263
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,138
and some cookie

264
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:45,142
What size?
Medium

265
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:31,222
Helen? Helen

266
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,829
What's the matter?

267
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:42,833
Helen

268
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,042
Before we go any further

269
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,172
I would like to go over
some expenses with you

270
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:23,117
we itemize all our charges and
break them into categories

271
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:26,986
our professional services
preparational bodies

272
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:31,221
this figure totals to $ 1 550

273
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,491
and for use of equipment
staff

274
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,490
In addition to funeral charges

275
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:53,637
Any question?

276
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:55,011
Nço

277
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,849
What if I drive myself

278
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,685
Anger is okay

279
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:05,683
"God can handle it, if
we are angry at him"

280
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,613
We are going to miss
Helen so much

281
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:40,884
"She was the greatest
warmest, most wonderful"

282
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,823
I know

283
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,018
We are praying for you
Warren

284
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,584
" If there is anything you need
you call us, okay? "

285
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:47,687
Okay

286
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,690
Okay?
Okay

287
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:05,440
I can't believe it
I still can't

288
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:07,005
I know

289
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,610
She was just

290
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:13,588
she was too young

291
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:18,582
" I know, thank you"

292
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:24,688
You are a good friend

293
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,539
You take care of yourself

294
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:38,206
"You too, Ray
Thanks for everything"

295
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:43,207
I see you real soon

296
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:04,129
Nçice of people to bring
all this food

297
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:09,133
there will be a lot
of leftovers

298
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:44,435
She was a very special lady

299
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:51,108
I really will miss her
I miss her already

300
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:56,421
I know we all do

301
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:01,418
Let's drink to her

302
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:18,474
Here's to Helen

303
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:23,474
They broke them all

304
00:32:24,787 --> 00:32:26,755
Helen

305
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,749
"We love you, we miss
you, we always will"

306
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,841
How are you doing?
You doing okay?

307
00:32:58,487 --> 00:32:59,818
Fine

308
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:04,815
Are you sure?
Yeah

309
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:10,287
Must be really tough

310
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:13,233
I remember when my aunt died

311
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:17,102
"so unreal, it was 4th of July "

312
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:20,040
I never forget it

313
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:24,205
"Listen, I know it's
not the time to talk about it"

314
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:25,679
before we leave if you'd
like to take a few minutes

315
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:30,242
take your mind off it

316
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:33,652
there's something real important
I want to talk to you about

317
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:36,658
What's that?

318
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,956
It's an investment opportunity

319
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:43,829
"really exiting, I want
you to get on ground floor with me"

320
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,266
and it's not a pyramid scheme

321
00:33:46,301 --> 00:33:48,326
a lot of people thought
it's a pyrimid scheme

322
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,567
" It's not, it's almost guaranteed
you can double your money"

323
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:54,770
you can triple it
in the first year alone

324
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,175
"The thing is, Warren"

325
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:58,577
I'm not going to be
selling waterbeds forever

326
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:03,051
"l got plans, we don't
have much chance to talk about it"

327
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:08,045
but I got pretty good
business head on me

328
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:57,736
Mayonnaise or mustard?

329
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:01,265
I like both

330
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,179
don't toast bread very much
I don't like my bread very toasted

331
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:09,275
I 'll have some of those
BBQ potato chips

332
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,980
not the plain ones
those are your mother's

333
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,352
the BBQ's are mine

334
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:17,415
In fact you and Randal can
take the plain ones

335
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:21,589
those will go to waste
I won't eat them

336
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,894
Maybe you can eat
them while on the plane

337
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:27,026
Fine

338
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,799
so good to see you

339
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,137
I hope you don't have
to get back so soon

340
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,235
Can you take a few days more?

341
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:38,872
Can you talk to them at work

342
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,611
they'll understand

343
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:47,611
" Heck, who's going to
take care of me? "

344
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:59,256
Here is your sandwich
Wonderful

345
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:02,193
"You know, Dad"

346
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:07,197
you're going to have to
get used to taking care of yourself

347
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:10,173
You might have to
hire a maid

348
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,577
A maid?

349
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:16,573
"Nço, I'll be alright
I don't need extra expense"

350
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:21,183
At least for a few weeks
while you are dealing with this

351
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:24,454
That's why I'm asking you
to stay to help me out

352
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:27,360
"Dad, I told you
I wish I could"

353
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:31,127
but I can't
I got too much going on

354
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:35,125
Even if I get more time off
I got the wedding

355
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,266
that's a full time job
on its own

356
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:40,605
Nçow that you mention

357
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:45,602
I think you should
consider postponing it

358
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:50,977
Postpone the wedding?

359
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,385
We can't do that
It's all set

360
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:57,290
You might want to take
this opportunity

361
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:01,820
to rethink things

362
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:06,823
But everyone's invited

363
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:11,929
"They understand, out of
respect for your mother"

364
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:15,342
She'd have approved

365
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:19,245
Nço one wants to change anything

366
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:24,241
"The thing is, your mother
and I spoke a number of times"

367
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,914
very seriously about
you and Randall

368
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,015
and what did she say?

369
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:35,018
Just that she loved you
she wanted you to be happy

370
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:39,196
this thing with Randall

371
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:44,194
She wanted to make sure
you don't have any regrets

372
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,600
so you might want to
keep your options open

373
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:55,073
But she helped us
pick the date

374
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:58,553
I was on phone with her
almost everyday

375
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:02,751
"planning, ordering things"

376
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:06,488
I really don't know
what you're talking about

377
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:09,656
Alright

378
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:14,658
have it your way

379
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:27,671
Good sandwich

380
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,447
Dad

381
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:40,359
Why did you get
such a cheap casket?

382
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:42,329
What?

383
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:45,094
I could tell you got
the cheapest casket

384
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,863
Everybody could

385
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:50,963
That is not true

386
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:55,033
I specifically did not
choose the cheapest casket

387
00:38:55,077 --> 00:38:57,443
They showed me
one less expensive

388
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,709
and I refused it

389
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:03,980
You mean a pine box?

390
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,954
I don't remember what it was

391
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:11,948
Couldn't you spend just once?

392
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,822
What are you talking about?

393
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:17,957
What about the bagel
out there?

394
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:20,126
That is an expensive vehicle

395
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:22,796
I didn't want to get it
but I did

396
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:25,136
That was completely
your mother's idea

397
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:27,971
She told me she had
to pay half of it

398
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:32,036
She said she had to sell
some of her stock to pay for it

399
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,877
That was her decision

400
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:38,875
I was going to have Winy weny
but she had to have adventure

401
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:41,416
What was I supposed to do

402
00:39:41,456 --> 00:39:42,718
T ell her she couldn't?

403
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:47,718
It was her money

404
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:52,928
" In here, Randall"

405
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:55,903
"Where?
In here, here"

406
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,666
Here you are

407
00:39:57,706 --> 00:40:02,666
you better get packed

408
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:15,747
Did you tell dad about book?

409
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,486
I forgot

410
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:19,551
"Warren, have you read"

411
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:21,789
""When Bad Things
Happen to Good People"? "

412
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,660
Nço

413
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:25,165
It's really amazing

414
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,895
You should read it

415
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:30,098
When we get back to Denver
I'll send you my copy

416
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:35,098
The workbook too
I did most of my exercises

417
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,843
Midwest Express

418
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:45,875
"So long, Randall"

419
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,389
You'll be in our prayers

420
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:53,383
"Okay, thank you"

421
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:58,622
Ginny

422
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:05,028
"T ake care yourself, Dad"

423
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,442
That's a good one

424
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:22,983
Bye Dad

425
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,322
"So long, Ginny"

426
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,850
See you in a few weeks

427
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:27,453
Okay

428
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:32,456
"Bye, Warren, you take care"

429
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:02,355
Dear Nçdugu

430
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:05,196
I hope you're sitting down

431
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:10,194
because I'm afraid l
got some bad news

432
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:14,204
Since I last wrote to you

433
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,804
"my wife, Helen
your host mother"

434
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:22,807
passed away very suddenly from
a blood clod in her brain

435
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:37,631
The services were lovely and
very well attended

436
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,693
Ginny came in from Denver
with her friend

437
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:45,639
folks drove up from as far
away as from Demon Wichita

438
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:48,667
a very moving tribute any
way you look at it

439
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:53,671
I wish you could
have been there

440
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:59,777
but now all the
excitement is over

441
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:03,586
and the smoke is clear

442
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:08,586
just me and my thoughts
knocking around

443
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:15,163
I believe I mentioned
in my previous letter

444
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:17,035
that I was an actuary

445
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:20,770
in one of the
world insurance company

446
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,770
" If I were given a man's age
race, profession"

447
00:43:25,915 --> 00:43:27,348
place of residence

448
00:43:27,383 --> 00:43:30,443
marital status and
medical history

449
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:32,215
I can calculate
with great probability

450
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:37,214
how long that man
will live

451
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,895
In my own case
now that my wife has died

452
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:45,890
there is 73% chance
I will die in 9 years

453
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:51,262
provided that
I do not remarry

454
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:54,903
all I know is

455
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:59,904
I got to make best of
whatever time I have left

456
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,946
" Life is short, Nçdugu"

457
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:08,946
I can't afford
to waste another minute

458
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:16,821
Two weeks later

459
00:44:36,285 --> 00:44:41,245
Life without Helen
has been quite a challenge

460
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,220
but I think you'll be
proud of me

461
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:49,720
"Yeah, this house is
now under new management"

462
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:54,725
but you never know
the difference

463
00:44:55,237 --> 00:45:00,197
Sure sometimes I can be
tired and forgetful

464
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:03,576
I guess that's not
worth mentioning

465
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:08,572
to someone in your situation

466
00:45:09,485 --> 00:45:14,445
Helen wouldn't want me
sitting around in self-pity

467
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:18,921
but she'd tell me
to shape up

468
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,191
so I try to get out much

469
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,428
stick to my routine

470
00:45:25,468 --> 00:45:30,428
That's very important in
phase of big change

471
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:37,137
Sure I am not quite
the cook like Helen was

472
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:42,139
but I am not like
in my bachelor days

473
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,769
It's a lot of work
keeping household together

474
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:07,765
I might sell the place and
move to a little condo

475
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:13,938
but for now I am
getting by just fine

476
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:21,912
In my last letter
I might have misspoken

477
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:27,885
used some negative language
about my late wife

478
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:29,997
but you have to understand

479
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:34,992
I was under a lot of pressure
following my retirement

480
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:42,238
" I 'm not going to lie
to you, Nçdugu"

481
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:45,805
It's been rough few weeks

482
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:50,808
I 've been broken
from time to time

483
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,928
I miss her

484
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:05,491
I miss my Helen

485
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,162
I guess I didn't know
how lucky I was

486
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,330
to have a wife like Helen

487
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:15,332
until she was gone

488
00:47:16,312 --> 00:47:19,338
"Remember that, young man"

489
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:23,044
you got to appreciate
what you have

490
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:28,045
while you still have it

491
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:19,529
You scare me
What are you doing?

492
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:24,528
I thought you might
want these back

493
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:38,108
"That was long ago
25, 30 years"

494
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:44,448
I can't believe
she kept these

495
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:54,393
That's talk about this
you are my friend

496
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:59,396
It was a big mistake

497
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:06,937
I am sorry

498
00:52:34,463 --> 00:52:39,423
You have reached Electronics

499
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:46,473
Shipping and receiving
this is Ginny

500
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:49,534
Ginny? It's Dad
How are you

501
00:52:49,578 --> 00:52:53,446
"Hey, I am swamped
What's up? "

502
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:55,950
I have surprise for you

503
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:57,918
Guess what?
What?

504
00:52:57,953 --> 00:53:02,890
I am on the road to see you

505
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:06,190
now I am outside

506
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:08,992
" Dad, what are you
talking about? "

507
00:53:09,031 --> 00:53:13,991
"Ginny, I 've been thinking
about things"

508
00:53:14,036 --> 00:53:16,004
how much you mean to me

509
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:20,065
the times we've been
together in last few years

510
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:25,068
all of a sudden I realize
what am I doing in Omaha

511
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:30,010
when you are out there
we should be together

512
00:53:30,052 --> 00:53:31,417
Wait

513
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:34,013
You are coming now?

514
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:35,387
If I drive straight through

515
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:40,384
I 'll be in time for supper

516
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:42,453
I don't think so
this is not a good idea

517
00:53:42,497 --> 00:53:46,331
Sure it is

518
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:51,328
Don't tell me you couldn't
use help with wedding arrangements

519
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:57,768
The thing is with Jill
we got everything under control

520
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,840
Let's stick to plan

521
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:07,848
you get here a day
before wedding

522
00:54:07,889 --> 00:54:10,790
Iike we said

523
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:12,521
I assume you won't
object me

524
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:15,291
sending any more of
those checks

525
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,197
" Dad, I do not
have time for this"

526
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:20,963
"you call me when you
get home, okay? "

527
00:54:21,003 --> 00:54:23,164
Fine

528
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:28,165
"Bye, Ginny
Bye, Dad"

529
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,297
Dear Nçdugu

530
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,700
How are you?

531
00:54:54,736 --> 00:54:58,536
I am fine

532
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:03,533
A week ago I decided to
take my way to Ginny's

533
00:55:03,612 --> 00:55:06,046
wedding in Denver

534
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:10,040
Ginny begged me
to come early

535
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,109
to help with
wedding arrangements

536
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:14,953
but I told her I needed
some time myself

537
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:19,950
I decided to go to places l
haven't been to for a long time

538
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:25,389
So much has happened to my
life that I can't remember

539
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:30,594
Whole section of my life
is just gone

540
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:36,633
You will say I want to
give my self some memory

541
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:41,744
"The first place I stop
is Holdrege, Nçebraska"

542
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:46,743
I think seeing the house
I was born 67 years ago

543
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:53,092
When I was your age
we moved away from Holdrege

544
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:57,121
I often wonder what our old
house would be like today

545
00:55:57,165 --> 00:55:58,257
Funny

546
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,768
I never forget the address

547
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:03,362
1 2 Logus Ave

548
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:08,365
1 2 Logus Ave

549
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:39,000
"Can I help you, sir? "

550
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,670
Nço thanks
I am just looking around

551
00:56:43,712 --> 00:56:45,907
I used to live here

552
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:47,972
Here in the store?

553
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:49,210
yep

554
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:54,211
My childhood home's
right on the spot

555
00:56:57,192 --> 00:57:00,958
That room would be
about here

556
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:05,956
Living room over here

557
00:57:08,036 --> 00:57:12,996
That was long time ago
before you were born

558
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:43,932
You're not going to
believe this

559
00:57:43,972 --> 00:57:48,932
we used to have tire
swing out here

560
00:57:51,313 --> 00:57:54,749
Awful lot has changed
since my day

561
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:57,183
It was still good to
be home

562
00:57:57,219 --> 00:58:02,179
very good indeed

563
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:07,751
" Nçext stop, Florence
Kansas"

564
00:58:07,796 --> 00:58:11,960
Where I pay my visit
to AU

565
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,366
I haven't been there
for years

566
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:19,362
now it's perfect time
to stop by

567
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:24,401
I even hook up with some
kids from my old fraternity

568
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:11,853
Nçdugu

569
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:13,121
I highly recommend you
pledge a fraternity

570
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:17,427
when you go to college

571
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:19,729
After that walk down
Memory Lane

572
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,794
it was tourist time

573
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:24,964
I made my way back
to Nçebraska

574
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:29,033
and stop at historical
museum in Brokenbow

575
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:34,037
to see their fine collection
of arrowheads

576
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,578
Later that day

577
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:41,578
I met a real lndian
or native American

578
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:46,624
we had nice chat about
history of the area

579
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:51,621
He really opened my eyes

580
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:59,696
" Nçext stop, cody house"

581
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:01,771
What a remarkable man

582
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:06,247
you can read about him
in enclosed pamphlet

583
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:08,044
I pull my car over

584
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:13,043
whenever I feel like
taking a break

585
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:17,857
The other day at antique shop

586
01:00:17,892 --> 01:00:22,852
I came across fine
collection of rare hummels
