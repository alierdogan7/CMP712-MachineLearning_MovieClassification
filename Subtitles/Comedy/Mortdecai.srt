MORTDECAI:
As you may well know, I am many things.

2
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,500
An arts dealer, an accomplished fencer,

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,140
fair shot with most weapons.

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,823
I am loved and respected
by all who know me...

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,585
Slightly.

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,660
But I have always felt

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,900
there's something missing, you see.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,300
Some final piece of my personal puzzle.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,900
I needed something bold, distinctive.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,300
Ah, thank you.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,060
The work of art with which

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,580
I could declare to the heavens,

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,700
I am Lord Charlie Mortdecai,

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,189
and this little bit of magic

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,708
is my mustache.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,900
I see.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,706
Shall we to business then, Fang?

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,909
Would you mind?

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,429
"Find," you said.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,910
Mmm, and find, I have done.

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,381
The Qianlong vase.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,180
Very, very rare.

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,269
Low-fired with an immersion glaze?

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,300
None of the southern

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,900
Yangtze ceramics are low-fired.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
But you know that. You're testing me.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,900
Why don't you test the vase instead?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,460
I am sure that you will agree

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,900
it is a bargain at two million pounds.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,829
Everyone knows you're broke.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,341
You will take one million.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,980
Ooh.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,786
Golly, that was a big one! (CHUCKLES)

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,142
Well, have it your way, Fang.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,310
One million pounds.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,866
I trust that you have, um,
brought the treasuries?

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,549
I think I'll keep the money.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,021
And the vase.

(MUMBLES)

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,660

(STAMMERING)

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,230
I paid three million for that tapestry,

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,784
then found out it is worth only one!

You took from me.
Now I will take from you.

50

Now, you look here, Fang! Fat. Fang Fat.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,780
A rogue, perhaps, a scamp

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,260
or scoundrel, I will grant you.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,020
But never an outright mountebank.

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,221
Enough!

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,506
You owe me.

57

MORTDECAI: Jock laid out
the state of our financial affairs.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,821
Basically, they involved debt.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,108
Massive, crushing debt.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,780
We hurried back to Mortdecai Manor,
where my beloved wife, Johanna,

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,420
having heard of our financial distress,

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,740
was arriving home

86

to sell off some
of my prized possessions.

87

Even my horsey picture was on the block.

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,900
But I was hopeful my new moustache

whilst you were away, my darling.

102

I do believe it was Maggie Thatcher
who said that kissing a man without

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,546
a moustache is rather like
eating an egg without salt.

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,786
Oh, Alastair. It's so lovely.
Do come back.

364
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,340
It's so wonderful to have someone

365

of reasonable intelligence
to converse with.

366
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,265
I'd be delighted.

367
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,862
Do I detect a slight crack
in the marital armor?

368
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,220
A mere tiff, old bean. Nothing more.

369
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,468
Oh, really? Seems like
more than a tiff to me.

370
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,108
My wife needs to come around
to a certain viewpoint. That is all.

Well, good luck, mate.

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,460

Oh!

1078
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,630
A bit of noise, sir!

1079
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,105
- MORTDECAI: Ahh!
- JOCK: There we go!

1080
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,821

Oh, it was dashed exhilarating.

1083
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,740
- (CHUCKLES APPROVINGLY)
- Where to, sir?

1084
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,820
Well, it was long ago,
and she was underage,

1085
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,860
but I do believe
the embassy is that way.

1086
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,550
- Right you are, sir.
- Right.

1087
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,230
- Jockie?
- Yes, sir?

1088
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,900
"Open your balls"?

1089
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,140
I have no idea.

1090
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,583
Is it that you actually know
and don't want to tell me?

1091
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,301
Yes, sir.

1092
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,660
- MARTLAND: Yes?
- They've got him.

1093
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,300
Ambassador's residence in Moscow.

1094
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,700
They're putting him on
the next flight to Heathrow.

1095
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,780
Thank you.

1096
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,062
Oh, and his wife
is on line six for you, sir.

1097

1100
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,501

1101

Yes, sir.

1102
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,500
Hello, Johanna. We've found him.

1103
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,820
He's on his way home.

1104
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,780
(SIGHS) Thank heavens.

1105
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,551
This place is an absolute
mausoleum on one's own.

1106
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,780
Do you feel unsafe?

1107
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,060
A bit.

1108
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,183
I could park outside for the night.

1109
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,660
Oh, I couldn't ask.
But how about tomorrow?

1110
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,227
Do come in, of course. Say, 8:00?

1111
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,900
You, me, and Charlie?

1112
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,260
Well, of course, Alastair.

1113
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,701
Wouldn't do, the two of us
here alone, would it?

1114
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,221
No, I suppose not.

1115
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,660
Still, if he can't make it,
he can't make it.

1116
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,421
May I bring anything?

1117
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,664
Perhaps there is something
you could bring.

1118
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,220

You are uppy, sir.

Am I? Where are we?

1127
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,428
You should see the other fellow.

(LAUGHING)

1129
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,860
The fact that you're as drunk
as a fiddler's bitch

1130
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,340
in no way obviates the fact

1131
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,066
that you very nearly caused
an international incident.

1132
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,740
A man your age has no excuse

1133
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,590
for looking or behaving like

1134
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,780
a fugitive from a home

1135
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,506
for alcoholic music hall artistes.

1136
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,980
I will have you know that
I am not an alcoholic.

1137
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,380
I am a drunk,

1138
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,150
and there is a vast difference.

1139
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,820
In my defense,

1140
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,988
I was not drinking until the plane.

1141
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,340
- And in the car, sir.
- And a bit in the car.

1142
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,860
And the Ambassador's residence.

1143
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,223
(STAMMERING) Ah!
And at the Ambassador's residence.

1144
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,140
The only advice I offer is
you do not apply

1145
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,024
to another of our embassies for help

1146
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,540
if and when you outrage the laws

1147
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,660
of the United States,
once you are there.

1148
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,669
Stop! Stop!

1149
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,111
Are you suggesting
that I go to the Colonies?

1150
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,300
Perish the vile thought.
I couldn't possibly.

1151
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,540
The sale of your Rolls-Royce to Krampf

1152
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,424
will offer you a perfect cover.

1153
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,509
Find out if he's got that painting.

1154
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,220
Get behind the gates of his estate

1155
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,626
and poke around a bit.

1156
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,580
The car has been loaded upon

1157
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,020
a cargo flight to Los Angeles,
and is halfway across the Atlantic.

1158
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,060
You will follow.

1159
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,627
California? Oh, icky!

1160
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,500
Your bags have been packed and checked,

1161
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,987

1164
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,620
I should like to ring my wife because

1165
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,822
she's probably quite worried about me.

1166
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,740
Oh, don't worry about her.

1167

1169

back, and leave Johanna to me.

and tells Emil, who goes to

1599
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,460
steal the painting from Bronwen.

1600
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,140
But Spinoza's already there.

1601
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,980
He boffs Emil on the bean

1602
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,420
- and takes the painting.

1603

the painting into the Rolls

1604

and I unwittingly smuggle it to Krampf.

that Bunny has the painting,

1608
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,227

it was from him.

Because if Martland should get
his grubby hands on that painting,

he would destroy
a magnificent work of art.

enter the Goya into the auction,

We'll make a switch.

1670

But first we must convince our buyers

1671

that the Goya's back in play.

Then we'll show it to them.
