00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,127
old and ugly,
rich, has a hot wife.

171
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,629
Like...

172
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,547
Gollum.
Not Gollum.

173
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,715
Georgie!

174
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,551
Come see me for a little chat when
you get upstairs. (CLICKS TONGUE)

175
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,471
All right! You got
the point and the wink.

176
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,056
Boss man likes you.

177
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,849
It just doesn't
fit the HBO brand.

178
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,686
We do violence and
heartache, but it's sexy.

179
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,020
Mmm-hmm.
Do you understand?

180
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,023
Of course. What was I thinking?
(LAUGHS)

181
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,191
You know what we could do?

182
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,194
We could throw some vampires in there
to have sex with the penguins.

183
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,072
And then you could have brooding,
sexy little vampire penguins.

184
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,448
Would that work for your brand?

185
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,993
What if the polar bears
were hookers, and on meth?

186
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,370
And then they show their tits for no reason.
How would that work?

187
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,706
I think you're joking,

188
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,126
but if you could do that, that
would be very interesting for us.

189
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,003
Yeah, very interesting.

190
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,796
And if I do get
the promotion, then what?

191
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,506
I have to work more
hours at the job I hate.

192
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,050
Wow, you're really bumming me out, man.
I hate this job, too.

193
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,218
Wait, what's going on?

194
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,804
Feds got in at 5:00 this morning.
Seized everything.

195
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,140
Georgie! Man with the plan.

196
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,058
I am going to take a little
rain check on our chit-chat.

197
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,769
Company shutdown effective immediately.

wink-point shitcanned?

199

What are you doing here?
How did HBO go?

200
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,866
Well,
they're passing on this one,

201
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,910
but they are definitely interested
in not seeing my other projects,

202
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,955
so it turns out I can't fly.

203
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,750
Why are you not
at work, George?

204
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,461
Oh! (STUTTERS)
I got fired.

205
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,464
You want to sell?

206
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,885
Well, my work situation
has changed a little.

207
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
Look, I'm going to be completely
honest with you guys.

208
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,180
The market has dropped.

209
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,514
We just bought it.

210
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,974
You said it was
a good investment.

211
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,184
I think you said that.

212
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,393
You said that!

213
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,396
In any case, it doesn't
matter who said it.

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,648
Nobody's buying studio
apartments right now.

215
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,900
It's a microloft.

216
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,194
Okay, let's just grow up
and call things what they are.

217
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,695
It's a studio apartment.

218
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,072
I knew it!

219
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,574
Even if you could sell it,
it would be at a loss.

220
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,201
You're not seeing
that money again.

221
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,997
As soon as we can
get back on our feet,

222
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,707
we'll talk about
coming back to New York.

223
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,250
Right now my brother
has offered me a job

224
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,002
and Atlanta's
the best place for us to be.

225
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,171

made last year, $800.

You know what? I think you
like that I don't work.

235
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,789
How could you let
this happen to us?

236
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,332
Eight hundred dollars!

237
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,042
I didn't mean it.
I was upset.

238
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,461
Yes, I meant it! (CRYING)

We've got to stop somewhere.

Fine. Okay.

251
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,719
I'm just really tired, okay?

252
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,970
I said "fine," all right?

253
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,805
Just quit selling me
after I said yes.

254

Fine.

I'm going to scream, George.

I just hope they have a bed.

If they didn't, it would probably
be called "Elysium just Breakfast."

to be a joke, George?

out of our skins!

you just said, but I did.

back out because they

00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,429
But she's a liar,
because it is luminous.

344
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,556
Thank you. Who are you?

345
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,099
My name is Karen.

346
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,102
I'm sorry if my hands smell like tahini.
I was just making some hummus.

347
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,354
Take it home!
(BLOWING)

348
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,068
This is much less
aggressive than clapping.

349
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:45,279
Try it, try it.
Seriously, it's better.

350
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,448
Babe, can I talk to you
just for a second, outside?

351
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,535
Did you smoke pot?

352
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,705
(CHUCKLING) No.

353
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,125
Why did you just lie to me?
I'm not going to tell on you.

354
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,127
I had one hit.
One?

355
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,046
I think it might be the best
pot I've ever had in my life.

356
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,091
You have to try this.

357
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,385
Hey, Rodney. What's up?
What's up? What's up?

358
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,053
This is Linda.

359
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,638
Hey. Here you go, beautiful.

360
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,182
Linda with the luminous skin,

361
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,476
it's so nice to meet you.
Thank you.

362
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,978
Did you know that all these
people, they live here?

363
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,813
This is a commune.
Isn't that crazy?

364
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,023
(COUGHING) That's crazy.

365
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,649
I'm Rodney, I'm her husband.

366
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,277
He's an African-American.

367
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,614
Wow, you guys
are really in love.

368
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,743
We are. We are just as much in
love as if we were the same color.

369
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,370
We actually had our
wedding ceremony right here

370
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,331
and Seth was our
spiritual officiant.

371
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,457
Who's Seth?

372
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,209
You haven't met Seth?

373
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,919
In a word, he's

374
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,881
a teacher, a guide,
a coach, a guru, a shaman.

375
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,966
He's everything.

376
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,051
Everything.

377
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,761
So, Seth is your leader?

378
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,262
SETH: No, no, no.

379
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,223
We have no leaders here.

380
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,643
Mother Earth is
the only leader we need.

381
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,729
You two must be
the proud owners of

382
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,773
that upside-down people-mover
out in the driveway.

383
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,566
I'm Seth.

384
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,610
I'm George. This is Linda.

385
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,736
Hi.
Hi.

386
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,863
Looks like you made
it out unscathed.

387
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,740
(GEORGE GROANS)

388
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,700
Not totally unscathed.
Ow!

389
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,245
Feel it? (SHRIEKS)

390
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,541
How do you feel?

391
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,792
I'm better, I think.

392
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,168
That's good.

393
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,212
We'll deal with those withholding
father issues another time.

394
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,048
And you must be...

395
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,299
I'm Linda.

396
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,261
Linda.

397
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,221
Hi. Oh.

398
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,224
You smell like
walnuts and suede.

399
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,310
(LAUGHING) Walnuts and suede.

400
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,398
Welcome to Elysium.
Come on, I'll show you around.

401
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,901
That's a God's eye. I made
it myself, last Kwanzaa.

402
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,570
I love what
you've got going here.

403
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,071
Honest,
I feel like I can breathe

404
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,906
for the first time in
I don't know how long.

405
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,241
It's incredible!

406
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,078
How long has
the house been here?

407
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,291
I bought this house in 1971
with nine of my friends.

408
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:07,212
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis,
Ronny Shames, Danielle Meltser,

409
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:12,175
Janie Brody, Billy Marcus,
Glen Stover, Tony Piloski,

410
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,427
and Janice Woo.

411
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,096
Meet Carvin. He's kind of the
lion around these parts.

412
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,682
So, have you lived
here this entire time?

413
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,102
Yeah, ever since I bought
the place in 1971.

414
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,979
Right.
With nine of my friends.

415
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,482
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis,
Ronny Shames, Danielle Meltser...

416
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,859
Those are the names
you just said.

417
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,195
Yeah. Billy Marcus, Glen
Stover, Tony Piloski...

418
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,031
Those are all people
you've already named.

419
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,866
So, you don't have
to say them again.

420
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,409
Any of those
people still live here?

421
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,996
No, no. They're mostly dead.

422
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,040
Pretty much dead.

423
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm going to go to bed.

424
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,293
Good night.

425
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,711
Dead but not forgotten.

426
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,254
I mean, who knows how many days

427
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,672
any of us have
left on this Earth?

428
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:51,798
Right.

429
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,761
That's why I choose to fill my
life with nature and laughter

430
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,346
and friendship,

431
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,056
love.

432
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,265
(CHUCKLING)

433
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,269
This is some commune.

434
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,812
"Commune"?

435
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:09,399
Boo, hiss. We prefer the
term "intentional community".

436
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,651
When you hear
the word "commune,"

437
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,902
you think of a bunch of hippies

438
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,072
sitting around, smoking
pot and playing guitar.

439
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,908
Hey!

440
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,993
I'm Eva!
Hi!

441
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,662
I hear you guys
are from New York.

442
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,247
Fellow New Yorker.
88th and Broadway.

443
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,374
Oh!

444
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,708
Yeah.

445
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,628
What do you know?

446
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,422
We're from the West Village.
Yeah.

447
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,424
Waverly and Christopher.
The best neighborhood!

448
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,509
I know!

449
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,302
I know New York is a great city

450
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,054
but I do not miss
that lifestyle at all.

451
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,516
It was just stress and
BlackBerrys and sleeping pills.

452
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,185
I used to drink a triple latte
every morning just to wake up.

453
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,687
I see your point,

454
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,147
but I kind of
value the sleeping pill

455
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,858
and the BlackBerry
and the latte.

456
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,528
You know, you can really
get trapped in that web of

457
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,865
beepers and Zenith televisions
and Walkmans and Discmans,

458
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,201
floppy disks and zip drives.

459
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:05,706
Laserdiscs, answering machines
and Nintendo Power Glove.

460
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,792
Wow, you know so
much about technology.

461
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,044
All right,
the pond behind the house

462
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,131
is just begging
to be dipped in.

463
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,465
Skinny style.

464
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,718
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

465
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,052
Yeah, let's...

466
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,345
You're unbelievable.

467
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,680
Skinny style!

468
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,307
ALL: George! George!
Jump in, George!

469
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,602
Atta boy, baby!

470
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,400
I cannot believe...

471
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,153
I'm naked! I'm naked!

472
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,865
I'm sorry. My bad.

473
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,369
A lot of magical
things have happened

474
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,787
since you walked
through those doors.

475
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,999
KAREN: Amen. My menstrual
cycle started back up again.

476
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,292
Stop.
What?

477
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,002
And I don't even have a uterus.

478
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,629
I mean, I have it.
It's in a jar.

479
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:57,257
It's actually in the room that
you're staying in. (ALL LAUGHING)

480
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,884
This is great,
actually, because

481
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,012
we actually totally
forgot to pack our uterus.

482
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,346
(ALL LAUGHING)

483
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,226
Hey, all right!
I like your shirt.

484
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,854
Here.

485
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,230
No, man, I can't do that.

486
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,815
We share everything here.

487
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,943
Wow.

488
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,073
Who are these people?

489
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,075
I have no idea.

490
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,661
I'm just going with it.

491
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,089
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

492
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,247
<i>God afton.</i>

493
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,667
One! Two! Three!

494
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,919
Give it a nice push!

495
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,934
Oh, you guys.

496
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,602
Incredible night.
Truly.

497
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,854
Do you take credit cards?

498
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,940
No, no, we all decided
that you paid us last night

499
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,819
with your friendship and
honesty and your stories.

500
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,864
I mean...
That's so kind.

501
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,615
Do we get change back for that?

502
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,411
If we didn't need the money
so badly, we would insist.

503
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,747
Just remember,
money buys nothing.

504
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,542
Nothing important, right?

505
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,503
No, no.
Money literally buys nothing.

506
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,797
I think you mean
metaphorically.

507
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,965
No, literally. Nothing.

508
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,384
Literally,
money buys most things.

509
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,219
No, nothing.
Are you saying that...

510
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,054
I'm saying that literally,
it...

511
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,140
No, but I'm saying, literally,
money buys nothing.

512
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,892
It buys nothing.
You're right.

513
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,560
Money pays for nothing.

514
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,978
That's right.

515
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,028
But not literally.
Honey.

516
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,031
And I don't want to hear that this
one slipped back into the world of

517
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:30,452
two-way pagers and VCRs

I never left.

I was just relaxing
outside the door, here.

690
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,670
But I think you two
should talk privately.

691

All right.

692
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,802

Is this the stupidest,

693
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,553
most crazy decision
we have ever made?

694
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,347
Honey, come on. We're just
running away from life.

Linda, the concept of an
intentional community like Elysium

696
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,102
is far more involved
and far more evolved

than any of these plastic,

coming outwith.

night than you had in a long time?

Yes, I did.
Honey, it was amazing.

708
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,003
So why shouldn't we
feel that every day?

709
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,297
I think it's such
a obvious choice.

710

There's no one way
to live our lives.

cool if we do that.

866
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,811
What?

867
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:58,731
We share everything here, George.
Truck's in town.

868
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,443
Yeah, sure. Most of
our stuff is still in it.

869
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,612
But, here you go.
My car is your car.

870
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,988
Right on. Right on.

871
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,074
So, I'm light on your biography.
Where are you from?

872
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,201
Could we talk about this later?

873
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,453
(CHUCKLING)

874
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,414
I like that. Kathy said
you were really funny.

875
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:16,749
KATHY: My ears are ringing.

876
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,043
Hope I'm not
interrupting boy time.

877
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,086
Actually,
more like, "me time."

878
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,881
Seth called a truth circle.

879
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,175
You newbies are
going to love it!

880
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,093
Let's go.

881
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,178
I'll wait for you.

882
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,267
(DIDGERIDOOS PLAYING)

883
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,104
KATHY: <i>Now then,</i>

884
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:43,025
what would you say
a truth circle is?

885
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,570
A circle of people
that tell the truth?

886
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,281
Exactly right.
Good, Linda.

887
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,283
Context clues.
Do you see how she did that?

888
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,701
Here, George.

889
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,620
What is this?

890
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,996
It's ayahuasca tea.

891
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,123
Oh.

892
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,792
I think I'll pass.

893
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,045
We feel that sharing the tea is an
extension of sharing our truths.

894
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,339
It smells like
Willie Nelson's braids.

895
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,258
You interrupted me, George.

896
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:10,344
Well, hey, was I lying?

897
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,637
Not yet.

898
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,222
Linda, would you like to start?

899
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:14,974
Okay. Um...

900
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,517
You're lying.

901
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,810
I didn't say anything yet.

902
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:18,978
You didn't have to.

903
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,521
I'm wondering,
maybe I shouldn't go first.

904
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,855
I think maybe
somebody else should...

905
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,315
I'll go.

906
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,527
Truth, I'm worried
that my changing body

907
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,737
may make me less
desirable to my partner.

908
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,698
Less desirable?

909
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,410
I find you sexier than ever. As
we used to say in Charleston,

910
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,036
"When the belly starts to show,"

911
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,496
"that's when
the titties start to grow."

912
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,331
And everybody
knows I love titties.

913
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,291
Everybody knows I love titties!

914
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,501
KATHY: Stunning truth.

915
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,921
Linda, do you want to try again?
Something true this time?

916
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,008
Okay.

917
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:50,676
I can't believe
you're going to sit here

918
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,594
and puke your lies all over us.

919
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:54,179
LINDA: What?

920
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,389
If I wanted my
face covered in lies,

921
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,808
I would still be in porn.
Right?

922
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,521
Obviously, we've never done this
before and it's a little...

923
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,690
It's probably just hard for you
because you're so full of shit.

924
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,568
Linda, don't let George
disrespect your process.

925
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,777
What?

926
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,446
Just think of George
as a crying baby.

927
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,281
A crying, broken little baby.

928
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,491
Wow, thanks a lot, Seth.
I appreciate that.

929
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:17,578
Do you really appreciate it, or are
you just lying directly to my face?

930
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,787
I'm being sarcastic.

931
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,289
Look who's decided
to be truthful.

932
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:25,002
He actually uses sarcasm when he gets
into uncomfortable confrontations.

933
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,463
Yeah, right, like I do that.

934
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,715
And you hate it.

935
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:30,966
I don't love it.

936
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,468
Or maybe you hate it.

937
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,095
It gets old. It does get
a little... Yes, I hate it.

938
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,346
You hate it when I make jokes?

939
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,391
I can tell when you don't really
care and you're just humoring me.

940
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,185
And how does that
make you feel, Linda?

941
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,271
Like crap. Like my
problems don't matter.

942
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,274
What are you talking about?
Your problems are my problems.

943
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,652
Minus the eczema.
That would be your problem.

944
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:55,074
See? I hate that.
And I don't feel supported.

945
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,283
What?
I don't feel...

946
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,701
Did you just say, "I don't
feel like I support..."?

947
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,495
Yes, I did.
You want the truth?

948
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,122
I work like crazy
so you can make a documentary

949
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:05,084
about penguins with
testicular cancer!

950
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,294
The point is, you jump...
KATHY: Here's the point.

951
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,712
Linda, he's getting to the point.
Let me get...

952
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:11,757
This is when
the breakthroughs happen.

953
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,925
Would you please let me
get to the point?

954
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:15,344
Don't get angry at me!
Get angry at her.

955
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:18,013
I work...
"Linda." Start with "Linda."

956
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,890
Linda...
Don't edit yourself.

957
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,266
I'm not.
"Linda."

958
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,185
I work...
Have at her, George.

959
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,311
Hit her!
What?

960
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,940
Not with your hands.
With words, with your truth.

961
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,441
I'll hit you with truths.

962
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,026
Do you want to know
what it's like to work

963
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,654
as hard as I do and
get no appreciation?

964
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,157
Just so you can do whatever flight
of fancy you have this year

965
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:41,036
whether it's pottery, or photography,
or it's "the Occasional Cafe."

966
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,955
What the fuck is
"the Occasional Cafe"?

967
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,248
That was an occasional café!

968
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,749
Pick one thing and
just stick with it!

969
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,752
Do you know how hard it is
to be married to somebody

970
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:51,380
who is still trying to
figure out their major?

971
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,720
I'm sorry that
I haven't figured out

972
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,306
what it is that
I love to do yet, George.

973
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,351
But at least I'm not sitting in
a fucking office like you did

974
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:07,646
miserable, hating your job,
and complaining about it.

975
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,982
That job that I sat at
and complained about every day

976
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,525
paid for the apartment
you wanted so much.

977
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,026
We don't even have it any more.

978
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:19,867
Linda, is there anything else
you want to say to George?

979
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,161
Any other ways he's
completely failed you?

980
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,415
Do you want the truth?

981
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,880
George is right.

982
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,798
He's totally right.

983
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:41,763
I've never committed to
anything in my entire life.

984
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:48,353
No, it's not...

985
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,314
It's true.

986
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:51,523
Linda,

987
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,359
I think you just met Linda.

988
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,613
KATHY: You're an
amazing woman.

989
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:00,782
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

990
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,284
I have one more question.

991
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,703
Ask anything,
my sweet soul warrior.

992
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,332
Why is that grass crying?

993
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,459
It's really loud.

994
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,878
I have a feeling
that it's my fault.

995
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,297
Because I think I made it cry.

996
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,548
Don't take it personally.

997
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,008
What the fuck are
you talking about?

998
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,593
It's the ayahuasca.

999
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,970
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

1000
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,222
What the fuck is going on?

1001
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,307
Ayahuasca has
hallucinogenic properties.

1002
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,351
It's like a stronger peyote.

1003
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:29,353
Mine just kicked in.

1004
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,271
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1005
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,190
Yeah, no, I don't
think it's affecting me.

1006
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,108
I think mine's
starting to kick in, too.

1007
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,153
I can see
George's spirit animal.

1008
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:39,279
What?
What?

1009
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:40,405
What did you say?
What did you say?

1010
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,449
You see my spirit animal?
You see my spirit animal?

1011
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,533
What is it?
EVA: What?

1012
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:44,618
Huh?
Huh?

1013
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,786
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1014
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,829
Hey, guys, I just lost my keys.

1015
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:49,873
I had them right
in this pocket.

1016
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,792
EVA: She's going to
have so much fun.

1017
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:55,671
SETH: There's a snake
in the mirror.

1018
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,802
EVA: The word that's coming out of my
mouth looks like a tiny pink mouse.

1019

1020
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:05,973
(GROANS)

1021
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,308
Are you okay?

1022
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,151
Yeah, yeah!

1023
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,656
Whoa! Holy shit!

1024
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,244
Sweetheart, listen to me.
Listen to me.

1025
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,414
You are tripping
your balls off.

1026
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,625
I can fly!
I believe I can fly, George!

1027
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:36,920
Metaphorically, I believe you can fly.
Literally, you can't fly!

1028
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:38,547
I believe I can fly!

1029
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,216
If you're going to get literal
with an R. Kelly song

1030
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,260
do<i> Trapped in the Closet.</i>

1031
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,138
You can't break your neck
if you're trapped in a closet.

1032
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,764
You just watch me.
No, no, no.

1033
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,808
Watch me, George.
No, no, no!

1034
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,311
I believe I can fly!
No! No! No!

1035
00:46:56,565 --> 00:47:00,402
See? You can fly.
I always believed it.

1036
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,070
LINDA: Oh, my God.

1037
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:06,867
Hmm.

1038
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,495
Hmm.

1039
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,040
Morning.

1040
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,291
Oh, God.

1041
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,168
That was a little crazy.

1042
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,961
That was great.

1043
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,425
You probably don't remember, but you
said some crazy stuff last night.

1044
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,761
I remember every word of it.

1045
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,848
Oh, God, I really
just feel great.

1046
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,476
Why is the doorway crying?

1047
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,269
(CHUCKLES) I'm just kidding.

1048
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,271
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

1049
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,154
<i>Downtown Atlanta.</i>
Uh-huh. Okay.

1050
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,198
<i>Corner of Peachtree
and Third Street.</i>

1051
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,326
Terrific. I can probably get there
around noon if I leave now.

1052
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,410
<i>You're qualified?</i>

1053
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,329
Yeah, I'm more than
qualified for the job.

1054
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,497
<i>Noon at the latest.</i>

1055
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,207
I look forward to it.
Thank you.

1056
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,045
Wayne!
Hey.

1057
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,131
Wow, that's quite
a big pile of pages.

1058
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,175
I get it, George.

1059
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,552
You're interested.
I'm flattered.

1060
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:11,223
When the time comes, I'll let you know.
I'll share it with you.

1061
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,100
I got a protagonist issue
I'm still working out.

1062
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:14,226
All right.
I have a lot of thoughts

1063
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,644
that I wanted to
get down here, and...

1064
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,563
That sounds great. I gotta
go into town for a second.

1065
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:20,148
How are you going to do that?

1066
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,858
Rodney didn't tell
you what happened.

1067
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,527
What happened?

1068
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:26,780
I don't understand.

1069
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:30,826
I know. I know, right?
It's crazy. It's crazy.

1070
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,163
What exactly happened, all right?
Take me through.

1071
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,041
Okay. Well, it was like,
"I'm going on the road."

1072
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,584
Cut to, in the pond.

1073
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,545
No, don't "cut to" the pond.

1074
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,004
What... Don't cut.

1075
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,966
I mean, can you believe that?
Can you believe it?

1076
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,384
No, I can't believe it.

1077
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,429
Which is why I want you to
tell me, how did that happen?

1078
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:51,596
I'll tell you what.

1079
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,473
Hindsight being 20/20,

1080
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,350
I probably wouldn't have
done it the same way.

1081
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:57,310
KATHY: What did you need
our car for anyway?

1082
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,229
GEORGE: It doesn't
matter any more.

1083
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:10,073
Hey, George.

1084
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:11,491
Hey, Eva,
I didn't see you there.

1085
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,619
You look sad.
Well...

1086
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:17,497
Everything that's been happening
in your life recently,

1087
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:21,710
the fact that you're walking on
two feet at all, it's amazing.

1088
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:23,712
Seriously, George.

1089
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:27,382
I've been walking on two feet
for most of my adult life.

1090
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,050
(CHUCKLING)

1091
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,720
Oh, George.

1092
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:33,054
I like you.

1093
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:35,223
I like you, too, Eva.

1094
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,392
We should make love sometime.

1095
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,070
George?
Yeah.

1096
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:51,323
I heard you. Yeah.

1097
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,241
You don't know
about our philosophy.

1098
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,202
Here at Elysium
we believe that open

1099
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:57,078
sexual boundaries
lead to a deeper honesty.

1100
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:59,206
How would you and
Linda feel about that?

1101
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,712
Anyway, think about being inside me.
Talk to Linda.

1102
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,927
Here you go, sir. Have a great day.
Thank you very much.

1103
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,638
And you enjoy that apple.

1104
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:15,847
Honey!

1105
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:19,559
I just sold my first apple. I picked
it, I bagged it and I sold it.

1106
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,020
Terrific. Our car is
at the bottom of a lake.

1107
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:25,398
So, George, I hear Eva asked
to intercourse with you.

1108
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,608
What?

1109
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,776
Yeah.

1110
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,152
Thanks, Seth.

1111
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,821
That was what I was
going to tell you.

1112
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,824
Apparently, at Elysium,
they practice free love.

1113
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,954
And Eva suggested
that we try it.

1114
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,539
What did you tell her?

1115
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,167
No. I said no.

1116
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,586
I mean, we didn't
finish the conversation,

1117
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,632
but I was about to,
and I will and did say no.

1118
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,050
This is just biology.

1119
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,636
Homo sapiens weren't meant
to be monogamous creatures.

1120
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,264
I don't know, that just
sounds to me like an excuse

1121
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,474
for everybody just to
get into bed together.

1122
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:02,227
If you want to pick a fight
with your body's sexual chi,

1123
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,979
it's just going to
drive it inwards.

1124
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,023
And that invites
disease and death.

1125
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:08,441
(WHISTLES)

1126
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:10,860
Man, I'm not a fan of death.

1127
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:16,491
People treat sex like it's this huge
deal with crazy life consequences.

1128
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,034
Right.

1129
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,327
CARVIN: What are
you doing here?

1130
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:21,580
I don't understand. What are you
doing here on our property?

1131
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,872
That sounds like
the lion's cry.

1132
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,124
This is our property!

1133
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,376
Of course we have
the goddamn deed to it.

1134
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,295
Then prove it.
Where is the deed?

1135
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:33,091
If you think I can remember where
I put a piece of paper in 1971...

1136
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,551
If you wanna make
a stink out of this,

1137
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,177
you can do that,
but you're going to lose.

1138
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,722
Or, we resolve this
very quickly

1139
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:41,224
and we all come away
with something.

1140
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,311
It's okay, George.
I got this.

1141
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:46,021
I wasn't going to do anything.

1142
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:49,524
Our people have a spiritual
right to this land!

1143
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,527
We have deep roots here.

1144
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,947
I don't think the lion could have
roared any clearer, my friend.

1145
00:51:58,575 --> 00:51:59,659
No dice.

1146
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,664
There's thousands more where that came from.
I actually...

1147
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,041
Can I have one of those?

1148
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,543
Yes, please, that's for you.
And keep that, sir.

1149
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,379
Oh, really?
Smile.

1150
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,298
I can do that, too.

1151
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,549
Deal with me.

1152
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,052
How do you like that?
Here, Brett, why don't you?

1153
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,345
See? How do you like that?

1154
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,013
Really? Do you want it?
I'll take another.

1155
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,057
Yeah, sure. Here you go.
Thanks very much.

1156
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,726
Please, please.
It's my pleasure.

1157
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,145
Three can play at that game.

1158
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,731
There's a Kinko's
13 miles down the road.

1159
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:30,815
Go get copies.

1160
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,067
I will get more cards.
I will be back.

1161
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,069
Come back and buy a zucchini.

1162
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,112
MAN: And we will
build that casino.

1163
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:41,368
Carvin, do you have any idea
where the deed is?

1164
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,996
No, I'll find it, because
I use the think method.

1165
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,290
I just think of,
"Where wouldn't

1166
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:49,668
"I expect it to be?"
and I go there.

1167
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,086
And so far, it's not there.

1168
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:52,796
SETH: Don't worry,
we can fight this.

1169
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,339
Oh, my God!

1170
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,757
What's the matter?
What happened?

1171
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,759
George just killed
a defenseless animal.

1172
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,971
What?
No, I just swatted a fly.

1173
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,767
For Christ's sake!
Here we go.

1174
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,520
And now it's dead. What if it
had young living somewhere?

1175
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:11,481
Young? Like, maggots?
Are you serious?

1176
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,650
This man has a fetish for violence.
No, I don't.

1177
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,944
He has a fetish for violence!

1178
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,112
We're talking about a fly.

1179
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,279
SETH: And where does it end?

1180
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,656
When you kill a fly,
you kill a bird.

1181
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:20,907
You kill a bird,
you kill a dog...

1182
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,575
You kill a dog,
you kill a soldier.

1183
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:24,661
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I was killing soldiers.

1184
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:25,870
I support the troops.

1185
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:28,289
I cannot even look
at you right now.

1186
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,208
I'm sorry, I'm trying
to learn all the rules.

1187
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,876
There are no
rules here, George.

1188
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,294
Except "no swatting flies."

1189
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:34,796
That's not a rule.

1190
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,631
It's just a way of
thinking about stuff.

1191
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:37,966
You did something wrong

1192
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,801
and you're a little embarrassed about it.
It's okay.

1193
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,885
I did something wrong?

1194
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,011
Forgiveness is always allowed.

1195
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:44,180
I've seen you throw
a battery at a pigeon.

1196
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,101
I didn't kill it.
Why are you doing that?

1197
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:49,978
It was a long time ago.
A long time ago.

1198
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,896
And it was right on our window, it was all...
(IMITATES COOING)

1199
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,314
That's not the point.

1200
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,401
I've said for years we should
have a bug zapper here.

1201
00:53:56,568 --> 00:54:00,488
1971, right here
at this table with

1202
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,158
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie,
Ronny, Danielle...

1203
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,118
Here we go.
Thank you, acid.

1204
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,996
Tony, Janie, and Janice Woo.

1205
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,039
You know, it's amazing,
I can remember

1206
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:13,042
Janice Woo with
perfect clarity.

1207
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,171
I just can't remember
where the deed is.

1208
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,047
You know why? Because I
didn't fuck the deed.

1209
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,132
That's right.

1210
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:35,231
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hey, it's Sherm. I'm out as usual.
Leave a message.</i>

1211
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,901
Hey, Sherm,
it's George, from work.

1212
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,194
How are you doing, man?

1213
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,863
Look, I was
wondering if you've heard

1214
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,365
of any job opportunities
back in the city.

1215
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,034
Linda and I have been
out of town for a while

1216
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,745
and we're kind of
itching to get back.

1217
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,206
Call me if you get the message.

1218
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,209
Hey.

1219
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,044
Hi.

1220
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,754
Oh, wow.

1221
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,924
She really is blossoming,
isn't she?

1222
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,469
Yeah, look at her go.
Marking her turf.

1223
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:06,221
So free.

1224
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,723
I'm just sad that she didn't
respond to the free love idea.

1225
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:11,184
I know. I know.

1226
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,728
I respect your and Linda's
relationship so much.

1227
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,064
But if you ever
change your mind...

1228
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,607
You'll be the first to know.

1229
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,151
I promise
I wouldn't disappoint.

1230
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:23,404
(STUTTERS) Yeah, that's great.

1231
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:27,367
I mean, I can lick your balls
while I give you a blowjob.

1232
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,493
No way!
Yeah.

1233
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,702
Oh, my God.

1234
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,748
I'm getting a little wet
just talking about it.

1235
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,167
Me, too.

1236
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:42,465
People, they are breaking
ground on the casino today!

1237
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,092
We got to protest!

1238
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,094
The people will be heard!

1239
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,763
Where's my bullhorn?
I need the bullhorn!

1240
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:52,016
Where once stood
an insignificant fruit stand

1241
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,854
will now grow the much
sweeter fruit of prosperity.

1242
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,357
So here's to good jobs,
economic growth

1243
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,277
and tax revenue
for years to come.

1244
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:08,116
I'm the fucking founder, for Christ's
sake, suburban mall-dweller!

1245
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,160
No, no, no. You're
all on private property.

1246
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,537
Yeah, it's our property.

1247
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:14,956
Private property this.

1248
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:18,042
Almond, no, no! Anger is
not the cure for this.

1249
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,294
Come on,
we have to do something.

1250
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,004
I know! It's like...

1251
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,131
Brother, if we could just talk,

1252
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:24,465
heart to heart, for one moment.

1253
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,801
CARVIN: Greed-mongering
shithead!

1254
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,137
We're going to
expose you and your greed!

1255
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,389
You're all free to stand
on that side of the barrier.

1256
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,059
<i>Hey, news gal!</i>

1257
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,061
<i>Where the hell are you going?
We got what we need.</i>

1258
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:39,188
<i>Don't your viewers care about</i>

1259
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:42,275
<i>a corporation making backroom
deals with politicians</i>

1260
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:44,527
<i>so they can screw over
another local business?</i>

1261
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,614
<i>Not for a 30-second segment
at the end of Atlanta P. M.</i>

1262
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:57,582
It's impossible to
reason with these people.

1263
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:58,833
They won't listen to the truth!

1264
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,836
CARVIN: Your bulldozer's
a bully-dozer!

1265
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,339
We have to do something right now.
This is it.

1266
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,507
Hey, lady,
do you want to see something?

1267
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:09,010
Do you want
a really good news story?

1268
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,219
Take this!

1269
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:13,431
We've got boobs out!
And they're good ones!

1270
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:14,682
If you want to
move any further,

1271
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:15,808
you're going to
have to run me over!

1272
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:17,393
Holy shit!

1273

00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:45,922
Wonderful.

1283

00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:09,737
<i>It's certainly possible.</i>

1293
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,489
<i>Deena, could you
let us know if you're</i>

1294
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,199
<i>ever planning on
protesting a casino?</i>

1295
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:16,536
<i>They're building a casino
at my place later tonight.</i>

1296
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,622
<i>Okay, nailed it.
There's more.</i>

1297
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,207
<i>Deena, I don't think
any of us would protest</i>

1298

took off your shirt.</i>

1299

a new weather report</i>

1300

<i>which is hot, sweaty
and I have an erection.</i>

1301
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,345
This is historic.

1302
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,097
The revolution has begun.

1303
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:40,935
All because this courageous
woman saw an unjust world

1304
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,812
and waved her boobies at it.

1305
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:44,272
Let's celebrate!

1306
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,902
I didn't even know
we had a television.

1307
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,530
Let's open some chutney!
The tomato chutney!

1308
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,323
The tomato chutney!

1309
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,119
No. No!

1310
00:58:58,453 --> 00:58:59,829
Where's George?

1311
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,458
Are you okay?

1312
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:04,751
I'm doing great!

1313
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:08,796
I felt something today when we
were standing up there and just...

1314
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,548
I know.

1315
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,843
Screaming it out and seeing
you with your shirt off...

1316
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,888
That's an amazing
experience for me.

1317
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,725
I just only hope
that George gets it.

1318
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,311
You are a natural leader.

1319
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:26,522
Oh, God, get out of here.
I feel like a schoolgirl.

1320
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:30,735
Go on, tonight's your night.
Enjoy it, celebrate it.

1321
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:38,910
Hi!

1322
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:42,330
God! I still cannot
believe that I did that!

1323
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,123
You're a hero.

1324
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,875
You're like
a topless Norma Rae.

1325
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,210
I feel amazing!

1326
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,544
It's great to see you so happy.

1327
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,962
I know, I am!

1328
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,340
I really am.

1329
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:54,717
So...
Yeah.

1330
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:55,885
It's been two weeks.

1331
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:57,470
I want to stay.

1332
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:58,846
I want to stay.

1333
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,139
Okay, but before you answer...

1334
01:00:00,223 --> 01:00:01,557
I already answered.

1335
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:05,561
There's a possibility that I
have a job back in New York.

1336
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,855
We can go home.
We can go home!

1337
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,192
But I really...

1338
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,569
I really feel
like this is our home.

1339
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:17,073
For the first time in my life,
I feel like I have a purpose.

1340
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:20,618
I've heard you say that before so
many times with so many other things.

1341
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,703
No, it's different this time.
I feel it.

1342
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,956
So you can live the rest of your
life without bathroom doors?

1343
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,082
Yes.

1344
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,291
You could be a vegan?

1345
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:29,085
I am a vegan. I love it.

1346
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,795
For two weeks
you've been doing it.

1347
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,214
They say three weeks and then
it's out of your system.

1348
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:37,218
Open relationships?

1349
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,139
No sexual boundaries. That's
part of the deal here, too.

1350
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,890
Can you do that?

1351
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,310
Exactly.

1352
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,855
So, please, let's just go...
Okay.

1353
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,398
Okay? Yeah?

1354
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,483
No, okay. Free love.

1355
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:57,280
As long as there's trust, and
communication, and respect,

1356
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,575
we can all enjoy
each other intimately.

1357
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:04,412
What? I love all of
these people, George.

1358
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:08,291
I love how I feel about myself
when I'm here. I just...

1359
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,626
George, I want to stay.

1360
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,255
Okay.

1361
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:15,923
Okay.

1362
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,258
Really?

1363
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,093
Let's do it.

1364
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,262
Oh, God.

1365
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:26,601
I'm so proud of us right now.

1366

me the good news.

1372

I'm so excited to
hear of your decision.

01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,723
Yeah, it's great! I know.

1374
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,770
Eva's really something,
isn't she?

1375
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,314
Yes, absolutely. The best.

1376
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,110
I just made love to your wife
in the other room.

1377
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:21,822
Great.

1378
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,741
Thank you.

1379
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:28,120
Honey, we said we
were going to do it.

1380
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:31,540
No, I said we would
do free love in theory.

1381
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:33,167
I didn't say
let's do it tonight!

1382
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,669
George! Oh, my God!

1383
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,672
This is awful.
This is such a nightmare!

1384
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,674
You have to do it tonight.

1385
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:41,384
I don't know
if I can do it tonight!

1386
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:42,468
You have to!

1387
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:45,304
You can't just make me
be the only one who did it!

1388
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:46,847
This was your idea!

1389
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:49,225
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you did it!

1390
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:52,520
You just have to please go do this
tonight, otherwise we're doomed!

1391
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,854
I don't know...
For us!

1392
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:55,273
I can try.

1393
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,357
No, there's no "try."

1394
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,025
There is only "do."

1395
01:02:58,359 --> 01:02:59,902
What, are you Yoda?
George!

1396
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,363
I'm okay. I can do this.
Are you sure?

1397
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,031
Yeah, this is good.
Tonight's the night.

1398
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:06,492
This is it.
This is what it's about.

1399
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,287
Yeah! No shackles. We're
doing this as a team.

1400
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,915
You got to do this.

1401
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,585
Oh, God!

1402
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,880
This was your idea, George.

1403
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,758
It's a good idea, right?
It's a good idea.

1404
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,802
Monogamy is sexual slavery.

1405
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,973
She got an exquisite pussy, well, how
about my exquisite erection? Huh?

1406
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,394
Eva, what do you think, do you
like my exquisite erection?

1407
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,064
Do you like my
erection selection?

1408
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,483
What do you think, Eva? Yeah?

1409
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,738
Are you going to take it? Are
you going to take that dick?

1410
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,782
Are you going to
take that dick?

1411
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,660
I'm going to pop off
a piece of my dick.

1412
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,621
Oh, yeah,
I'm fixing to fuck you.

1413
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,498
I'm going to fuck you.

1414
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:55,916
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1415
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,463
I'm going to get it
all up in your vag.

1416
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:04,175
Get it up in your
vag with my dick.

1417
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,844
With my dick.

1418
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:11,015
I'm going to put it in
with my dick.

1419
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:17,146
I'm going to put my dick in.

1420
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:18,522
What's up, man?
Are you all right?

1421
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:19,774
What's up?

1422
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:32,495
So, how we doing, George?

1423
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,538
Hi, Wayne.
Great. Never better.

1424
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,290
It's funny because
I didn't want to get

1425
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:38,084
into this before
because we had just met,

1426
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,336
but, as you know, I'm writing
a new novel right now.

1427
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,420
Really?

1428
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:44,924
It's a political parable about the
flaws of capitalistic society.

1429
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,426
I could tell you the story, but
it would probably bore you.

1430
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:48,969
Maybe later.
I'll just give you a taste.

1431
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:52,014
Basically, it's about this
one guy named John Belson.

1432
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:55,101
And John is just this guy,
an average Joe...

1433
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:57,436
I can actually even maybe
name him "Joe Belson."

1434
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,230
You could.
And the big thing is...

1435
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,898
Tell me if I'm boring you.
No, finish your sentence.

1436
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,734
The big thing is,
at a certain point I reveal

1437
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,821
that this is all happening
in Washington, D.C.

1438
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:08,906
Wow. Yeah.

1439
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:10,950
Belson's a creature
of the Beltway.

1440
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,661
Yeah. I'll tell you this...

1441
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:14,745
Eva...

1442
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,580
I'll read you this one part,
unless you're not interested.

1443
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,841
Hey. There you are.

1444
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,175
Hi.

1445
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:30,177
I am ready to have sex.

1446
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,471
Great. Come here.

1447
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:34,890
Awesome!

1448
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,310
But I can't believe
this is actually happening.

1449
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,728
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

1450
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,313
God, George...
(PANTING)

1451
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:43,315
Your heart is racing.
I know.

1452
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:45,693
I've wanted to do
this since we first...

1453
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,361
Yeah.
Since we first...

1454
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,280
And now it's okay.
Yeah.

1455
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:52,032
Now it's not like before.
Now I can actually...

1456
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:55,578
Breathe, George, breathe.

1457
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:57,121
Feel it in your diaphragm,
just breathe it in.

1458
01:05:57,288 --> 01:05:58,747
You're going to feel it
in your diaphragm with my...

1459
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,584
You're going to
feel it with my dick.

1460
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,043
Okay.

1461
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,379
Do you need to
take a minute, George?

1462
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,423
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1463
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:08,883
I'm going to do this.

1464
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:10,468
This is going to happen.

1465
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:11,594
Yeah.

1466
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,721
I'm going to throw down.

1467
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,931
I'm going to
throw down onto you

1468
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:19,852
with my testicles.

1469
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:21,187
Okay.

1470
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,314
I'm going to get on it.
I'm going to get on it

1471
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:26,609
and I'm going to get in it
and down it and through it.

1472
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,111
It's going to be
magically delicious.

1473
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,655
You're going to
be my lucky charm.

1474
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,574
Okay, just don't talk,
let's just...

1475
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,785
I'm going to get a big old
brimming bowlful of fuck

1476
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,913
on your boobs.

1477
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,706
George, let's just...

1478
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,541
I'm going to lick your titties.

1479
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,210
I'm going to lick your...

1480
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:45,961
What?
Can I lick it?

1481
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,007
I'm going to
slap you on the eye

1482
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,092
with my cock.

1483
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,720
I'm going to flick you in
the nuts with my balls.

1484
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,055
I'm going to put my...

1485
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,681
Put it on your neck.
I really don't...

1486
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,726
That's I'm going to pump
you with my gonads.

1487
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:01,810
No.

1488
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:02,978
That's a spicy meatball...

1489
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,104
George, you know...

1490
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,314
...in your spicy hole.

1491
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:06,607
George, you're creeping me out.

1492
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,360
I'm sorry. When I get nervous, I
sometimes just talk, and that's...

1493
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,778
I'm sorry, let's...

1494
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,282
Okay. George...

1495
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,619
I really think you
should go take a minute.

1496
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,371
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I don't think this is...

1497
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,622
Just don't even worry about it.

1498
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,873
Maybe we should do
this some other time.

1499
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,542
Let's not.
No, just the head of it in.

1500
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,336
It wouldn't even have to stay.
I'd just go, like, beep-boop.

1501
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,296
Then technically, we did it.
Just a quick little...

1502
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:30,798
You wouldn't even know.

1503
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,508
No. No.

1504
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,884
This is very important,
all right?

1505
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,512
We have to do this for Linda.

1506
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,472
I'm sorry, George.
I'm just not into it.

1507
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:39,723
I am.

1508
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,141
Great.

1509
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,852
Let's switch out. Okay?

1510
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:54,071
I'm about to put my vag

1511
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,991
all up on your dick.

1512
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:00,619
Excuse me.

1513
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:07,835
Hey, George.

1514
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,421
Oh. Sorry.

1515
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,339
Are you meditating
or something?

1516
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:14,675
No, not at all. Come join me.

1517
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:19,138
You didn't feel like going on
the moon hike with everyone?

1518
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:23,350
No, I'm taking a breather
from all that tonight.

1519
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,687
Maybe it's divinely inspired

1520
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:30,733
that you and I
are here right now.

1521
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,986
That's nice.

1522
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,572
I can see that you
have a kind soul.

1523
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,038
Are we...

1524
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,665
Is this...

1525
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,044
(SHUSHING)

1526
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,009
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1527
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,721
It's like Tantric or something.

1528
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,723
I'm having my baby, George.

1529
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,643
What? Fuck. No, you're not.

1530
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:06,977
Yes, I am, George.

1531
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:08,729
No, no, no. Stop doing that.

1532
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,314
There's nothing
to stop, George.

1533
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,024
My baby is on its journey.

1534
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,901
Oh, my God! All right.

1535
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,319
I'll call the hospital.

1536
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:16,862
No, no need.

1537
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:18,572
I'm going to do this myself.

1538
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:20,240
No! No, that's a bad idea.

1539
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:23,911
It is the best idea the
universe has ever come up with.

1540
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,082
This is the most natural thing
that can happen to a person.

1541
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,250
(MOANING LOUDLY)

1542
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,127

I do something that

expected that I could do,

possibly be mad at me

follow your lead?

better than Rick's.

we could have fun here

01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:09,311
I know. It is insane.

1713
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:10,979
I am so glad
you're on the same page.

1714
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,273
I thought I was
the one going crazy.

1715
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,775
Now I feel like you're the one going
crazy, but I'm here to help you.

1716
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,027
I am not crazy.

1717
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,153
I'm not crazy either.

1718
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:19,237
Well, I don't...

1719
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,864
That makes two of us.
Okay.

1720
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:22,282
(SHUSHING)

1721
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,075
Let's just make love.
And then we'll talk.

1722
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,869
No. I would rather not.

1723
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,914
Yeah. I understand.

1724
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:31,082
George. I remember him well.

1725
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:35,128
What we will do, is we will
make love without touching.

1726
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:39,966
You know what, I gotta go.

1727
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,301
Wait, Linda...

1728
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:45,597
God, Seth.

1729
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:48,850
I was almost there.

1730
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,019
(LAUGHING)

1731
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:53,855
I just figured
out what George's

1732
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:55,815
fortune cookie
fortune would say.

1733
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:59,986
"Confucius say when wife screw other
guy, husband must get rid of wife."

1734
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,572
"She no good.
The pork fried rice."

1735
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,159
What exactly did Mom do to you
that she didn't do to me?

1736
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:07,661
Come on, I know it's offensive,

1737
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,287
but you gotta admit,
it's funny.

1738
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,997
That's funny!

1739
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:12,707
I'm not Chinese.

1740
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:16,378
That's funny! All I'm saying is
Linda is no good, screw her,

1741
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,714
screw those hippie-dippies, with their B.O.
and their white dreads.

1742
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,132
You have no idea, man.

1743
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:22,759
Okay,

1744
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,178
so you're
complaining about Linda?

1745
01:19:25,262 --> 01:19:27,264
You're the one who wanted
to sleep with other people.

1746
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:28,974
I didn't think she would say yes!
Bingo.

1747
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:30,976
At least she had permission
before she cheated.

1748
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:33,561
My husband has been fucking at
least one woman on the side

1749
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,522
ever since before our wedding.

1750
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,775
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

1751
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,902
You have a tracking
system in your car.

1752
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,946
You never shut up
about it, stupid.

1753
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,244
Little reality shift, Rick?

1754
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:50,787
Honey, no, no, no.

1755
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,539
No, no, no.

1756
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,457
No! Listen to me.

1757
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:57,836
I love you, and I have sex with other
women because I love you so much.

1758
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:00,630
I'm getting it out of my system.
I'm trying to protect you.

1759
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,173
Are you kidding me?
What do you want me to do?

1760
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:05,010
Do you want me to tell you every
time I sleep with somebody?

1761
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:08,179
And then we have to deal
with that every time?

1762
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,597
What is wrong with you?

1763
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,558
George, back me up on this!

1764
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:15,895
What are you doing?
What's that face...

1765
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,314
Why are you doing that?

1766
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:18,982
Are you pooping?

1767
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,066
No, I'm crying.

1768
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,568
That's not what
crying looks like.

1769
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:23,153
What do you want me to do?

1770
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:25,822
Can you get the fuck out of my
house and out of my life forever?

1771
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,533
That's it.
Okay, thanks. Get out!

1772
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,036
You're taking my infidelity
and making it about you!

1773
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,996
Do you realize how
selfish you sound?

1774
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,998
This is exactly
why I have to cheat!

1775
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,958
I hate you.
I want a divorce.

1776
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,043
No, honey, no.

1777
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:40,628
I left my wife at a commune.

1778
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,380
What the fuck am I thinking?

1779
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:44,549
I'm auditioning for
<i>Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

1780
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,593
Are these your car keys?
Yes.

1781
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:49,387
Honey, you don't...

1782
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,056
Wait! No! No!

1784
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,146
What are you doing with my car?

1785
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:00,023
We're family.
It's our car.

1787
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,193
Get out of the goddamn car!

1788
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,029

(RICK PANTING)

1790
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,085
That looks good. It looks even.
Centered?

1791
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,382
I'm going to town.
I'll see you in a bit.

1792
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,008
Bye, Linda.

1793
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,859
Mmm.

1794
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,736
Terrible, I know.

1795
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,571
Steak at a diner.

1796
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:53,201
It's like getting
cognac at a gas station

1797
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,328
or a diner.

1798
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,749
Carvin, please don't judge me.
I needed meat.

1799
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:02,001
Hey, I come here every Sunday.

1800
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:04,504
You can't live
off of macrobiotic

1801
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,631
bean curd shit your whole life.

1802
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,676
The first time
I snuck away years ago,

1803
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,386
I had a veggie burger.

1804
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,805
The next time, chicken salad.

1805
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,807
And then, two pounds of bacon.

1806
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,142
Oh, my God!

1807
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:18,768
Nobody knows about this.

1808
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,478
Your secret is safe with me.

1809
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:21,646
Who cares?

1810
01:22:21,855 --> 01:22:24,357
I've been in
Elysium four decades.

1811
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:28,403
Hell, I co-founded the place with
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis...

1812
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,155
Yeah, I know.
All those people.

1813
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:31,531
Billy Marcus, Tony Piloski...

1814
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:32,866
All of them. All those people.

1815
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:36,202
My point is you gotta do
what is right for you.

1816
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,039
Don't get me wrong. Elysium
is an amazing adventure,

1817
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,875
but sometimes I think

1818
01:22:42,584 --> 01:22:46,045
I missed out on something
that was even more real.

1819
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:47,630
You know, more real.

1820
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,634

member of the meat family.

1823
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,226
That's some kind of wurst.
"Wurst"?

1824
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:03,313
I don't know why they call
it "wurst." It's the best.

1825
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

you here, brother.

I need to talk to her.

I'm diving into
the Linda pool these days.

1829
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:21,998
I only tell you this
because I love you, brother.

1830

Move or I will run you over,
because fuck you, brother.

1832
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,132
Capoeira.

1833
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:33,343
Although a beautiful form
of Afro-Brazilian dance,

1834
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,887
it's also a devastating
form of self-defense.

evolved away from you, George.

You're so full of shit!

with CD players now?

01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:02,765
I told you.

1855
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,518
That's a very
easy mistake to make.

Yeah? Thanks!

even think of that?

That's very convenient.

1884
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,920
This is not working!
No shit!

1885
01:26:14,087 --> 01:26:16,214
What the hell are you doing?
Get off of him.

1886
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:21,469
I came back to tell you
I love you more than anything.

1887
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:22,804
Oh, honey.

1888
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,514
Jesus! Can a person
go a day in this place

1889
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,349
without getting
a dick in the face?

1890
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,101
I've heard that.
Every day.

1891
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,268
That's what I'm talking about.

1892
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:33,564
Come on, George!

1893
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,941
Get him!

1894
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:37,026
You've progressed far
beyond George, Linda.

1895
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,737
You're selfless,
you're pure, you're vegan.

1896
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,739
I just had a steak at a diner.

1897
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,200
In time, I can learn
to forgive you for that.

1898
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,785
Let go of George!

1899
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,662
Anything for you, my love.

1900
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:54,210
You have to know that he asked
me to run away with him

1901
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,379
and he said that you would
all just find your way.

1902
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:57,547
God damn it!

1903
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,134
Linda! I would never do that to
my brothers and sisters, please.

1904
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:05,638
He's lying! Seth burned the
deed to the commune. I saw him!

1905
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:08,224
He burned it?
The deed to the commune?

1906
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,350
Motherfucker!

1907
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:11,227
Seth, is that true?
You burned the deed?

1908
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,312
You burned the deed?

1909
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:17,233
Look, if everyone's going to get
all law yeristic on me, yeah.

1910
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,610
Yeah, I did.
I sold and I burned the deed.

1911
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:21,446
Rat bastard turncoat.

1912
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,365
But I did it for love.
I did it for Linda.

1913
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:28,244
Anyone would have done the
same thing for $11,000.

1914
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:29,912
I love you.

1915
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:31,956
But I love me more.

1916
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:34,417
And for you guys to
turn this around on me,

1917
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:36,669
well, frankly, it's selfish.

1918
01:27:36,836 --> 01:27:38,796
And fuck you, Grisham.

1919
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:40,715
(ALL GASP)

1920
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:48,681
Ow! God, my wrist!

1921
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:52,935
I don't think I did that right.
My wrist is killing.

1922
01:27:53,019 --> 01:27:54,437
Honey, you're a lover,
not a fighter.

1923
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:55,980
GEORGE: I'm an idiot.

1924
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,857
I love you so much.
I'm sorry.

1925
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:01,194
I know. I'm so sorry
too. I went too far.

1926
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:02,904
I drank the Kool-Aid.

1927
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,697
And then when I was
done with the Kool-Aid,

1928
01:28:04,781 --> 01:28:07,575
I made more Kool-Aid
and then I drank that too

1929
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:09,744
and it just
filled with Kool-Aid.

1930
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:13,206
I love you and I will support
you in whatever you choose.

1931
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,582
Forever.

1932
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,876
I don't care where we live.

1933
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,711
You're where I want to be.

1934
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:21,339
And you're where I want to be.

1935
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:30,056
Yes! Oh, yes!

1936
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:31,974
That's what I'm
talking about, George!

1937
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,566
And we're back.

1938
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,318
Later in the show,
we're going to be

1939
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,070
learning all about
how these text messages

1940
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,072
are actually making
our children stupider,

1941
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,074
and the statistics
are terrifying.

1942
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,659
I've seen them and they are.

1943
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,536
But first, do you remember
about a year ago,

1944
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,037
when a bunch of hippie types

1945
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,747
up in the mountains put
on their birthday suits?

1946
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,415
They were protesting a casino?

1947
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:59,544
I would remember it better if they
took those birthday suits off.

1948
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:01,546
I don't know what that means.

1949
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:03,881
Our own Deena Schuster
is back with an update

1950
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:06,133
about these
Bohemians in the buff.

1951
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,386
Hi, Deena.
Hi, guys!

1952
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:10,763
It looks like one
of those naked ninjas

1953
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,140
was cooking up more
than just a skin feast.

1954
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,601
I'm talking
about Wayne Davidson,

1955
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:17,728
the best-selling author
of the breakout

1956
01:29:17,854 --> 01:29:19,897
political thriller,
<i>Belson's Lament.</i>

1957
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:23,109
As well as the eagerly awaited
sequel, <i>Belson Rising.</i>

1958
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,361
My favorite thing
about that book is

1959
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,613
when they reveal that
it's in Washington, D.C.

1960
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:28,781
(YELLS)

1961
01:29:28,865 --> 01:29:30,074
What did I do?

1962
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,450
Michael, I haven't read it yet!

1963
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:34,954
DEENA: First-time novelist
Davidson is a nudist, winemaker

1964
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,540
and full-time resident
of an intentional community

1965
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:39,417
in Northern
Georgia called Elysium,

1966
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,378
worlds away from
the corridors of power

1967
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,839
he so piercingly
chronicles in his books.

1968
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:48,426
There's even talk of a Belson
movie starring Ray Liotta,

1969
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:50,136
who has been spending time here

1970
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:51,888
with the wardrobe-less
wordsmith.

1971
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:55,391
Ray is an amazing actor,

1972
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,059
he makes a great vegan chili

1973
01:29:57,143 --> 01:30:00,313
and he is an intense lover.

1974
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,815
We almost lost
the whole place last year,

1975
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,234
until an old friend
saw us on the tube.

1976
01:30:05,318 --> 01:30:07,153
I thought she was dead.

1977
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,280
And yet, she wasn't dead.

1978
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:12,408
DEENA: Co-founder Janice Woo had
a copy of the original deed,

1979
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:15,286
preserving the community's
rights to the disputed land.

1980
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:18,664
And as luck would have it, none of
the founding members were dead.

1981
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:21,083
Not Jerry Beaver,
not Stephanie Davis,

1982
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,252
not Ronny Shames,
not Danielle Meltser,

1983
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:25,463
not Janie Brody,
not Billy Marcus,

1984
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:28,090
not Glen Stover
and not Tony Piloski.

1985
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,761
In fact, all were found to be in
above-average health. For now.

1986
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,763
And the story of
Belson's journey

1987
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:35,973
to bookshelves is
just as unlikely.

1988
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:37,558
It was discovered by a boutique

1989
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:40,102
Brooklyn,
New York publishing house

1990
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:42,605
run by husband and wife,
George and Linda Gergenblatt.

1991
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,065
I actually wrote a book, too,

1992
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:48,152
and it's a children's book
called <i>I Believe I Can Fly.</i>

1993
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:52,323
And it's about a confident little
penguin who overcomes his limitations.

1994
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,075
Originally,
we were going to call it

1995
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,369
<i>The Penguin With
Testicular Cancer.</i>

1996
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:57,870
Originally, but...

1997
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,163
That wasn't going to sell.

1998
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:00,414
No, no.

1999
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:03,626
And now we have a growing company
where we can foster new writers.

2000
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,754
And we have connections to a
lot of really fresh voices.

SHARI: My husband's book
is destined to be a classic.

in love since we met.

2004
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:17,848
I have always had
a thing for black women.

2005
01:31:20,935 --> 01:31:23,020
And you wrote the whole thing
here at Elysium?

Yes.
