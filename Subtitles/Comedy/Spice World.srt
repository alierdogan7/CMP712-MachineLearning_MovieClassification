1
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,360
Love is blind

2
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,130
As far as the eye can see

3
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,500
Deep and meaningless

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,330
Words to me

5
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,340
Easy, lover

6
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,310
I need a friend

7
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,780
Road to nowhere
twists and turns

8
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,550
But will this never end

9
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,120
Well, my dear
you know that he pleases me

10
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,350
But short time solutions
ain't no resolution

11
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,860
There ain't no release for me

12
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,190
Too mch of something

13
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,700
Is bad enogh

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,670
Bt something's coming over me

15
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,240
To make me wonder

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Too much of nothing

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Is jst as tough

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
I need to know the way to feel

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,850
To keep me satisfied

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,750
Unwrap yourself

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,450
From arond my finger

22
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,220
Hold me too tight

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,330
Or left to linger

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,230
Something fine

25
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,070
Bilt to last

26
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,240
Slippedp there
I gess we're running

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,740
Out of time too fast

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,580
Yes, my dear, you know

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,040
He soothes me

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
Moves me

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,450
There's no complication
There's no explanation

32
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,720
It's just a groove in me

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,920
Too mch of something
is bad enough

34
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,120
Bad enogh

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,230
Bt something's coming over me

36
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,630
To make me wonder

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,260
If too mch of nothing

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,400
Is jst as tough

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Jst as tough

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
I need to know the way to feel

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,680
To keep me satisfied

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,780
What part of "no"

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,220
Don't yonderstand

44
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,450
I want a man
not a boy

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:41,370
Who thinks he can

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,510
Well done, girls.
Foarte bine.

47
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,880
Despre ce vb?
Nici mãcar nu te uitai, Cliftord.

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,080
... Ba da, mã uitam.
- Nu minþi. Chiar nu te uitai.

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,750
I sensed the vibes.
I have an excellent vibe sensor here.

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,820
... Right.
... He doesn't love us anymore.

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,050
Yes, I do love you
like a wildebeest...

52
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,790
loves tive lionesses
chewing at his legs.

53
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,830
Hello, I'm Piers Cuthbertson Smythe.

54
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,800
Today I'm spending
the tirst ot five days...

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,570
with the Spice Girls.

56
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,540
Elton!

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,840
Good to see you.

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,240
- Great glasses, Elton.
... Thank you very much.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,380
Girls, we've got to go.
Sorry, Elton.

60
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,660
Any second now, the Spice Girls
will be stampeding down this corridor...

61
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,360
in a trenzy of chaos and energy...

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,460
which ot course
has become their hallmark.

63
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,760
What, chickens? How many?

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,100
I thought you said they'd
be coming down this way.

65
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,040
I never said that.

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,870
- You want me to cut?
... I think that would be wise.

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,110
Don't worry about tans here.
They're all round the tront.

68
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,440
They're sorted.

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,790
Come on and do it

70
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,060
... Girls, it's Andy.
- Not up the skirts, thank you.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,930
What was that you said, Clitford?

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:19,570
Do what your mama said

73
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,110
- Bye!
- Let's go. Come on.

74
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,640
Hands oft my flutfy toys.

75
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,310
- Nobody come in my bit.
- Don't touch my wardrobe.

76
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,950
Can we get changed, everyone?
We're gonna be there in 15 minutes.

77
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,820
Dennis, Albert Hall.

78
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,590
We're heavy and rolling.

79
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,160
Come on and do it

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,900
Don't care how you look
It's just how you feel

81
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
Horoscopes.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,240
I don't believe star signs.

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,540
You wouldn't,
because you're an Aquarian.

84
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,740
- Aquarians don't believe in anything.
... I don't believe that either.

85
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,010
Oh, no!

86
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,180
I can't tind my boots.
I think I've lost them.

87
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,150
It's always the same.
I never know what to wear.

88
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,320
It must be really hard tor you,
Victoria...

89
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,090
trying to decide whether
to wear the little Gucci dress...

90
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,690
the little Gucci dress...

91
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,130
or the little Gucci dress.

92
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,600
Exactly.

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,040
I know. Why don't you wear
the little Gucci dress?

94
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Good idea. Thanks, Emma.

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,710
... There they are!
... What?

96
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,050
You're wearing my boots, Geri.

97
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,520
Oh, yeah.
I don't know how that happened.

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,790
Typical Leo, that is.
Borrowing stutt without even asking.

99
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,950
That's Capricorn.

100
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,560
Don't you be starting
on Capricorns.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,020
- That's it. You've had it.
- Have them back!

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,990
I don't want them.

103
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,560
Get ott!

104
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,200
- Excuse me!
... What?

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,970
- What do you think ot this one?
- It's great.

106
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,340
Now hear this.
There's a press conference coming up.

107
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,880
That means smiling at the cameras
and answering a lot ot dumb questions.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
That is all.

109
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,150
It really is tremendously exciting.
We're breaking the news right now.

110
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,880
Next Saturday, 8:00, for the
tirst time ever, the Spice Girls...

111
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,090
are gonna pertorm live for the
very tirst time at Albert Hall.

112
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,990
- Are you excited, girls?
... Very excited.

113
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,890
We're working with a new band.

114
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,830
It's gonna be tantastic and will be
broadcast live throughout the world.

115
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,500
How many countries
are we talking about?

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
... Millions.
- Or maybe even more.

117
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,940
Do you have a message
for the multitude ot f ans out there?

118
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,400
Yes.

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,940
Goes out to the people in France.

120
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,210
They're huge in Portugal.

121
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,080
To all the people in Leeds......
Northerners!

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,620
I don't have an idea what that means,
but it's gonna be great.

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,220
I'm excited.
My mum's excited.

124
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
They are adorable.

125
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,760
Yohaven't even shaved for us,
have yo, Jonathan?

126
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,530
- I got what you want.
... Shut up and watch this.

127
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,430
These are the Spice Girls.

128
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,030
I've seen them.

129
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,800
- I like the blond one.
... No.

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,070
- Sporty.
- Yeah, Sporty one's good.

131
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,200
This is what our movie
should be about.

132
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,210
They're young, they're cute,
they're hip, they're wacky.

133
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,810
... But can they act?
- What act?

134
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,380
Did anyone care
it Marilyn Monroe could act?

135
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,020
All they cared
was she in focus.

136
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,580
I just got an idea,
and you're gonna love it.

137
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,790
I can see it very clearly.
It's the Spice Girls.

138
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,590
There's tive ot them.

139
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:33,170
- And they're singers.
- I love it. We pitch this atternoon.

140
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,330
- Yes, Chiet?
- How are the girls, Clifford?

141
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,340
Ready for show time on Saturday?

142
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,270
Just going to rehearsals.
They're hot, Chiet.

143
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,180
They've got tire in their eyes
and great big shoes on their teet.

144
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,910
I'm telling you, Chief,
they're raring to go.

145
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,820
Well, remember that now
is the dangerous time.

146
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,680
They've had a lot of success
very quickly...

147
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,990
so get ready for the backlash.

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,420
When the speeding melon
hits the wall...

149
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,860
it is Christmas tor the crows.

150
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,160
Of course it is.

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,930
Do you want me to go atter
the paparazzi, Chiet?

152
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,500
I could start kicking asses,
if you like...

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,040
stir things up a bit.

154
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,140
There's no need
tor any stirring.

155
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,440
Put a couple ot cats
among a tew pigeons.

156
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,610
Leave the pigeons alone.

157
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,780
Watch the feathers fly.

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,550
Get some blood on the walls!

159
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,720
Sorry, Chiet. Just an idea.

160
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,390
There will be time tor that
soon enough.

161
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,120
Remember, the drummer
who is without sticks...

162
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,660
has no backbeat.

163
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,960
Absolutely.

164
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,130
Right, puss?

165
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,230
... What did he say?
- I haven't a clue.

166
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,240
But I know that he's right.

167
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,510
Drummer?

168
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,540
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

169
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm giving you everything

170
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,780
All that joy can bring

171
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,990
- This I swear
- I give you everything

172
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,590
And all that I want from you

173
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,230
Is a promise
you will be there

174
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:17,770
Say you will be there

175
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,670
Now, remember, the camera
is the window to the soul.

176
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,680
... Window to the soul.
... Through the eyes, obviously.

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,850
What I want to do is take my audience
on a journey into the mind's eye...

178
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
of the Spice Girls...

179
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,080
tocus on their deeper subconscious.

180
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,190
... Deeper subconscious.
- That's it, Enzo. Got it? Great.

181
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,460
Track.

182
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,930
- I think we'll need a longer lens.
... BAFTA, BAFTA.

183
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,800
- Hold on. What's going on?
- What are you doing?

184
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,370
... Sorry, my tault.
... Sort your fingers out.

185
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,610
- You left your boxing gloves on?
... Let's do it once again, please.

186
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,040
That was absolutely pertect
without being actually any good.

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,640
Once again, then.

188
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,150
Hi, Nic.

189
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,150
Please, let's keep
the momentum going.

190
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,960
Obviously atter a short break.

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,460
Are you all right?

192
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,760
Look at that emotion,
that real, raw emotion.

193
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,230
Come on, boys.
Capture that magic.

194
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,400
Quickly!

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
How are you feeling?

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,240
Oh, all right,
except my back's done in...

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,340
my tront's done in,
my insides are wrecked...

198
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,340
and I haven't seen my feet tor weeks,
but I hear they're really f at too.

199
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
- They are. Not.
- How's baby?

200
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,120
How would you teel being carried around
all day in a nice, squishy water bed?

201
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,580
Very lucky, I think.

202
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,150
It kicked.

203
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,820
When's it due?

204
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,920
... Last week.
- You want to charge it storage.

205
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,960
So how's Trevor?

206
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,330
- He's gone. Trevor's lett me.
... I don't believe it.

207
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,100
... Sound running.
- Excuse me.

208
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,270
Would you mind
not tilming, please?

209
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,440
... Cut.
- I knew Trevor was irresponsible.

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,310
... But he's now gone and proved it.
- What a complete...

211
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,910
What I want to do with this documentary
is show the real Spice Girls.

212
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,180
I want to break through
the show business side.

213
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,020
I want to crash right through it
and reveal the truth.

214
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,320
That's fine, as long as you crash
through the showbiz f acade on schedule.

215
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Don't get in anybody's way.

216
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Yes, well, a smile costs nothing.

217
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,560
Don't worry, Nic.
It'll be all right.

218
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,700
- Oh, no.
... What?

219
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,040
- I think I am getting broody.
- Oh, no.

220
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,070
Just wait till you lot
start having kids.

221
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:42,650
That will be really weird.

222
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,280
How my Gloria gets her clothes
so dirty, I'll never know.

223
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,690
Bless her.

224
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,530
My poor back.

225
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,100
I don't know how you can have
any more ot them kids.

226
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,560
- You've got six already.
... Is it six?

227
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,500
They're so cute when they're little,
then they grow up to be real bleeders.

228
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,970
Thank God tor boarding school.

229
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,310
I only see mine once a month.

230
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,380
- Our Terry goes to me...
- Cheers.

231
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,040
He goes,
"Ma, I wanna be a singer."

232
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,320
I said, "Lad, go to college,
get yourselt a proper job."

233
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Does he listen? No.

234
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,690
They never do, though, do they?
I mean, you know.

235
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,060
Darling, kids today
don't know how lucky they are.

236
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,230
Brucey, Demi...

237
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,360
will you turn
that bloody racket down?

238
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,470
Hate to interrupt.

239
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,700
There's a small matter
ot an extremely live gig on Saturday.

240
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,970
- All right. We're coming.
... I don't want to.

241
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,980
- Take care.
- Jools, we're coming.

242
00:13:43,980 --> 00:14:31,490
I need a wee.

243
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm giving you everything

244
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,800
All that joy can bring
Yes, I swear

245
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,470
Last time
that we had this conversation

246
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,980
I decided we should be friends

247
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,380
- But now we're going rond in circles
- Quick! Baby Spice. Get the shoes.

248
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,750
- Which one's Baby?
... The blond one.

249
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,650
Now you tell me
that you've fallen in love

250
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,360
Well, I never, ever thoght
that would be

251
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,400
This time
you gotta take it easy

252
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,330
Throwin' far too much
emotions at me

253
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,400
Bt any fool can see

254
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,370
They're falling

255
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,740
Posh one.

256
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,980
- Which one is her?
- The one that looks posh.

257
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm giving you everything

258
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,020
All that joy can bring

259
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,850
Yes, I swear

260
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,350
I'll give you everything

261
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,890
And all that I want from you

262
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,020
Is a promise you

263
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,530
Will be there

264
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:51,340
Say you will be there

265
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,740
If you

266
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,810
Pt two and two together

267
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,680
You will see
what our friendship is for

268
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,850
Across to Geri. Hips. Very good.
Very nice. This is a good bit.

269
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,580
If you can't work this equation

270
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,450
Then I guess I'll have to
show yothe door

271
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,860
There is no need
to say yolove me

272
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,400
It'd be better leftnsaid

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,460
I'll give you everything
On this I swear

274
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:48,330
Just promise
you'll always be there

275
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,100
Look at that, Brad!

276
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,430
"Spice Girls set
to conquer the globe."

277
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,730
Why is it that I
can't pick up a paper...

278
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,840
without seeing them
all over the front page?

279
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,640
... You told us to write that story.
- I know.

280
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,840
As long as they sell newspapers...

281
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,350
we're gonna have to keep
writing about them.

282
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,580
Well, I'm sick ot them.
We need a new angle, Brad.

283
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,320
Who cares it the Spice Girls
get to number one yet again?

284
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,690
Who cares if they climb to the top
ot Mount Everest on an ostrich?

285
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,800
Or it they tind a cure
tor déjà vu.

286
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,960
Not me.

287
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,100
Or it they tind a cure
tor dèjà vu.

288
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,200
- Not me.
- I got a better idea.

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,710
You try this tor size.

290
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,270
"Spice Girls...

291
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,540
live show cancelled."

292
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,710
That's not bad.

293
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,950
"Spice Girls tall out."

294
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,360
"Spice Girls split up."

295
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,460
Think how many copies of the paper
we'll sell with a headline like that.

296
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,530
... I like it.
- I can make it happen, Brad.

297
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,730
Me, Kevin McMaxtord.

298
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,370
I put them up there.
I can bring them down!

299
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,070
... Yes.
... Who's gonna help me, Brad?

300
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,070
Who is gonna help me
take on Girl Power...

301
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,040
and bring it crashing
and whimpering to the ground?

302
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,910
I'll find someone.

303
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,750
I just wish
you wouldn't get so upset.

304
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,080
Now hear this.

305
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,690
It is dangerous to store moisturizing
cream in the retrigerator...

306
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,860
as it can be mistaken
tor mayonnaise.

307
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,560
That is all.

308
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,730
Check.

309
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,430
- What do you mean, check?
- I mean check.

310
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,360
... My bishop's got your king.
- Where?

311
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,600
There. You either got to move it
in front or move it out of the way.

312
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,810
I'll move that tairground horse
to there. Sort that out.

313
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,940
- You can't do that.
... Says who?

314
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,910
Says Mr. Chess. It's been
in the rules tor thousands ot years.

315
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,910
I'm gonna break the rules
and set this f airground horse tree...

316
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,550
amongst all these little
square tields like that.

317
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:58,060
I'm gonna slap you in a minute.

318
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,960
It's obvious to us that
the Spice Girls are movie stars.

319
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,600
We've worked on this idea
tor months.

320
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,970
- Graydon?
... Can we turn otf our cell phones?

321
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,470
Respect tor the writer.

322
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,380
This is the ultimate tale.
Five girls, tive lives, one story.

323
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,080
As old as time itself
but as tresh as newly cut grass.

324
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,220
That's fresh.

325
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,420
The girls play tive sisters...

326
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,150
whose parents disappeared
during the January Harrod's sale...

327
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,160
and were never seen again.

328
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,090
Ripped trom today's headlines.

329
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,590
Now they live at home,
struggling to support...

330
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,630
an elderly grandmother who sutfers
trom some mysterious wasting disease.

331
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,170
I've got tears.

332
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,270
Their only hope at breaking
the cycle of poverty...

333
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,600
lies with the middle sister,
Melanie C...

334
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,180
who's convinced she could be
an Olympic ski...jump champion...

335
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,510
it only she could overcome
her tear ot heights and snow...

336
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,580
and could just get her hands
on a pair of skis.

337
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,150
That's amazing.
That's tantastic.

338
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,290
... What do you think?
- I think it stinks.

339
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,490
Ot course it stinks,
but it's a start.

340
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,800
We're cooking here.
This is a stew, a gumbo.

341
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,970
A jambalaya, it you will.
We're just jamming.

342
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,810
Okay, here's another idea.

343
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:27,040
Crocodiles.

344
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,050
If you want tickets to the Spice Girls'
first-ever live gig, you're too late.

345
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,320
Bt they're with me now on Srgery.
Welcome, girls.

346
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,060
... There's Sporty, Scary, Ginger...
... Turn it otf.

347
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,730
- I will.
- What's it like to be Baby Spice?

348
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,230
You think I'll always be seen as
Baby Spice, the sweet, innocent one...

349
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,300
even when I'm 30?

350
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,570
You love it really, Emma.
You play up to it all the time.

351
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,200
No, I don't.

352
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,340
... You do. You're doing it now.
- I'm not.

353
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,840
You see, the thing about you...

354
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,220
is you've got this dead-cute smile
so you can get away with anything.

355
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,920
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

356
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,090
Four horrible murders...

357
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,160
perpetrated by the same...

358
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,930
ruthless psychopath.

359
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,700
Each victim riddled with a hundred
machine gun bullets by this maniac.

360
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,430
But who is it?
Protessor Schutzmann?

361
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,740
Father Conan Murphy?

362
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,600
Lady Matilda Davenport?

363
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,110
Or Miss Emma Bunton?

364
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,520
The murderer is...

365
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,180
Father Conan Murphy.

366
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,220
I am really ted up with people thinking
all I do is talk about clothes.

367
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,890
People are really shallow.
They judge you on what you look like.

368
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,360
Exactly.

369
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,830
I think it's the same with fish.
I mean, look at this.

370
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,970
You've got the spotty one
that's wacky.

371
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,870
You've got the tlutfy one
that's cute.

372
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,570
Then you've got
this ugly loser one...

373
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,540
that reminds me
ot my ex...boyfriend Steven.

374
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,210
Did you know that the largest tish
in the world is the manta ray?

375
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,480
Then there's the little ginger one...

376
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
that is tull of useless intormation...

377
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,620
about manta rays.

378
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,960
I don't get it.

379
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:26,400
Why do people stereotype us
all the time?

380
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
The trouble is we're all
getting really predictable.

381
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,900
... I should stop being loud and lairy.
- Yeah, right.

382
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,140
Fat chance.

383
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Hold it there.

384
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,180
Give it to me.

385
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,440
Why don't we give each other
new characters?

386
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,980
Like what?

387
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,250
I tell you what.
What about Bricklayer Spice?

388
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,620
Sexy. Come on, energy.

389
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,420
- Or Trainspotting Spice.
- Smashing.

390
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,090
What about Sporty-but...l-am...actually
interested...in-other-things Spice?

391
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,260
Go tor it. Come on.

392
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,700
Or Cheesed-otf-with...cheesy
photo-session Spice.

393
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,940
... And again.
- Let's go do our own thing.

394
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,010
Take it from me

395
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,210
Take it from me

396
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,510
You know I mean
what I'm saying

397
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,350
Yobetter watch out
You better wisep

398
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,680
To mind games he's playing

399
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,950
He may have the looks

400
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,360
He may have the charms

401
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,330
But where does he go
What does he do

402
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,300
When he's not in your arms

403
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,230
Keep your headp high

404
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,300
Don't you know
you are the sperfly

405
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,170
And that ain't no lie

406
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,380
Because it's Satrday night
You got a feeling it's right

407
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,210
Don't you know
we'll get so high

408
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,080
Bye!

409
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,680
Get down
Get deeper and down

410
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:01,190
Saturday night
Get down, deeper and down

411
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:11,740
Hello, Mr. Bond,
or can I call you James?

412
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,770
Want that shaken or stirred?

413
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:23,380
That's it.
I'm otf. I'm going.

414
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,790
I'm so sporty!

415
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:36,760
Telling on a superstar
That's what you are

416
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,330
My mummy's my best triend.

417
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,570
I'm just too posh.

418
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,870
When are Liverpool
gonna win the cup, like, eh?

419
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,370
Are we tinished yet?

420
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,380
Ah, blah, blah. Girl Power.

421
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,540
Feminism.
You know what I mean?

422
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, no.

423
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,950
I feel as though I'm being strangled.
How do you feel?

424
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,660
Really uncomfortable.

425
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,460
I just nearly tell otf these shoes
and sprained my ankle.

426
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,100
These things are really tight.
They're going right up my bum.

427
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,760
- These are really comty, actually.
- Don't even think about it.

428
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm ott.
I'm getting these oft.

429
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,100
- I need some plattorms.
- How can you wear this stutt, Geri?

430
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,940
Yes! I got just the man
tor the job.

431
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,110
He did the Fergie
toe...sucking pictures.

432
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,040
He got the Teletubbies
taking a poo.

433
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,580
He can get you a picture ot Clinton
tucking his T-shirt into his underpants.

434
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,780
He sounds great,
but where the hell is this guy?

435
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,990
I'm here.

436
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,520
How do we know
you're any good, pal?

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,360
8:45... You snitting your socks
betore putting them on.

438
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,400
8:55... You in the litt,
picking your nose.

439
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,800
Another bogey breaktast.

440
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,630
He's good.

441
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,140
You again...

442
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,310
behind the bike shed with
Eileen Winters, when you were 12.

443
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,380
He's very good.

444
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,040
He's gone.

445
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,480
Stand back, man
Thank you very much

446
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,820
I need somebody
with the human touch

447
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,450
Now hear this.

448
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,790
Atter using the showers...

449
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,390
could people please pick up
the clumps ot hair in the plug holes.

450
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,800
It's unhygienic
and can lead to flooding.

451
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,970
Can't Clitford
just tell us normally?

452
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,910
Next up: publicity party......

453
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,910
beautiful people, reporters,
interviews...

454
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,340
lots ot finger food...
have tun.

455
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,680
That is all.

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,080
- They're here. Don't look.
- I'm not looking.

457
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,650
I hate these parties.
Everyone dresses so over the top.

458
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,060
If you notice, they all ask you
how you are and don't even care.

459
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,760
Well, I should be at the tootie now,
and it I'm not there and they lose...

460
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,730
You know him?

461
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,900
... Sorry.
... Do you know who I am?

462
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,830
Who are you?

463
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,340
Piers Cuthbertson Smythe.
I'm with the Spice Girls.

464
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,440
Your name is not down,
you're not coming in.

465
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,940
You said they'd recognize you.

466
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,950
Yes, I go to all the shows,
but Gucci, Pucci, Prada and Fendi...

467
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,920
I was very disappointed
with their spring collections.

468
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,390
As for McQueen and Galliano,
I could go either way on them.

469
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,620
What do you think about manta rays?

470
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,360
Oh, yes, marvelous designer,
Manta Ray.

471
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,960
I love Manta Ray.

472
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,570
These are Manta Ray's shoes,
these are his glasses.

473
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,200
Bob, we've gotta sort your hair out.
In tact, I'm gonna do your hair tor you.

474
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,770
What's wrong with the hair?
Everybody's always going on about it.

475
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,240
It's not as if we wanna be threatening
to a man's masculinity or anything.

476
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,810
... Ot course not.
- Or be dominating.

477
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,880
The tunny thing is when we meet men,
sometimes they get nervous...

478
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,420
and don't know what to say.

479
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,060
... I'm just gonna go to the toilet.
- Hello, Trish.

480
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,060
I've been talking
to a Spice Girl.

481
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,660
I know.

482
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,400
Now, Bob, I think you look great.

483
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,740
What the hell have you done?

484
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,070
Nicola! Remember me? Piers, yes.

485
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,910
We're with her.
We have to get in.

486
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,850
- Spare ticket?
... We have a ticket.

487
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,450
And tonight is the night

488
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,620
When three become one

489
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,850
Thank you.

490
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,690
Look, I've got something
really important to ask you.

491
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,990
But if you don't wanna do it,
it's all right.

492
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,960
... What is it?
... I was thinking.

493
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,360
One ot you could be godmother
to the baby...

494
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,800
but then I thought, I love you all
and you're all my best mates.

495
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,170
I want you all to be godmothers.

496
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,370
One condition: It's got to be
a Liverpool supporter.

497
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,710
Hang on a minute.
Do godmothers get stretch marks?

498
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,850
I'm sorry to interrupt, but it is
interview and photo time now.

499
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,050
- Do we have to go?
- Yes, you do. It's your job.

500
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,520
... See you. I'm so sorry.
- Sorry, Nicola. See you.

501
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Girls, it's publicity
tor Saturday's show.

502
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,660
- Hi, I'm Barnaby.
- Oh, hi.

503
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you a part
of the Spice phenomenon?

504
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,900
No, I'm just nobody.

505
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:25,320
Excuse me a minute.

506
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,890
So we're on a wide...angled lens.

507
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,290
Running.

508
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,260
Tonight I'm going to be asking
the big questions.

509
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,430
How are relationships molded...

510
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,200
in this strange,
kaleidoscopic world...

511
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,530
the Spice Girls inhabit?

512
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's tind out.

513
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,840
So, do you have any time for boys?

514
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Boys? Doesn't ring a bell.

515
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,740
I think with boys, you should
be able to just wheel them in...

516
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,380
then they're there, and that's it.

517
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,120
- Really?
... And order them like a pizza.

518
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll have a deep-pan, six foot...

519
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,720
green eyes, pair of loafers
and no socks.

520
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,420
And no cheese.

521
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,360
But you do like boys,
don't you, Geri?

522
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,630
Come on. Is the Pope a Catholic?

523
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,300
Apparently he is, yes.

524
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,140
Here at home, church leaders
have reacted with shock today...

525
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,800
to report that the Spice Girls...

526
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,040
have cast dobt on the religious
conviction of the Pope.

527
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,310
That's more like it!

528
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,220
A Vatican spokesman said
the pontiff was hurt and confsed....

529
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,980
by the suggestion
that he might not be Catholic.

530
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,490
We asked the Bishop ot Candleford
what he thought ot the report.

531
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,160
It's a terrible suggestion,
almost blasphemous.

532
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,990
Ot course the Pope's a Catholic.

533
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,800
Otherwise he wouldn't have been invited
to become pope, would he?

534
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,130
I'd like to know what evidence the Spice
Girls have to support these allegations.

535
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,200
I really would.

536
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,610
Here we go.
The backlash has started.

537
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,810
When the rabbit ot chaos is pursued
by the terret of disorder...

538
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,810
through the fields ot anarchy...

539
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,480
it is time to hang your pants
on the hook of darkness.

540
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,860
Whether they're clean or not.

541
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,290
Why Milan, Clifford?

542
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:16,190
Just a TV special... ltalians,
screaming kids, thesal thing.

543
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,360
Are we there yet?

544
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:28,370
Come on, come on

545
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:40,020
Do you wanna be in my gang
my gang, my gang

546
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,450
I'm the leader

547
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,320
What the hell is this?

548
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,020
I'm the leader of the gang
Yeah

549
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,690
No way.

550
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,330
Cliftord, what is going on here?
Clitford?

551
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,060
Stop.

552
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,730
What are you stop?

553
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,340
We didn't agree to have this lot
dancing with us.

554
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,400
I know you said
it was going to be tacky...

555
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,140
but this is tacky.

556
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Hey, Bobby Charlton,
why have they stopped?

557
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,350
They're stopping because
these clowns suddenly appeared.

558
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,350
I don't doubt you, my triend, but they
should be on another show or a zoo.

559
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,520
Look at his muscles. It looks as though
he's got terrets burrowing under there.

560
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,730
I know. I'm sorting it out.
Over here.

561
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,930
... You think that's real down there?
- Looks like rolled up socks to me.

562
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,940
You carry on like this,
I take the girls back.

563
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,710
You're taking the girls back?
What about the contract?

564
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,010
Contract? Ha!

565
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,680
In my bed I've got two teddies,
a rabbit, two dollies.

566
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,110
One's Susan.
She's got a bad eye.

567
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,050
The boys stay here.

568
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,250
The girls go, I sue you.

569
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,790
A.C. Milan? No.
You're a bit weak in your midtield.

570
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,220
Then I've got a green girafte
which I won at a tair.

571
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,260
It was the only one lett,
and I telt really sorry for him.

572
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,860
So you want to play hardball?
What do you want, tisticutf s?

573
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,130
Then there's Buzz, Woody, the alien,
and a flutfy pink hot-water bottle.

574
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,700
There's just not enough room tor you.

575
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,440
... Your mother.
- My mother?

576
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,780
Your mother.

577
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,880
Hey. Your mother!

578
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,750
Your big f at mother,
and your brother-in...law.

579
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,320
And your mad cousin.
And your next door neighbor's goat!

580
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,120
- Now I kill you.
- Go tor it.

581
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,760
Boys, boys.

582
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,400
Calm down. Have you not heard
of the word "compromisation"?

583
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,830
What?

584
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,170
Crazy, crazy.

585
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:56,250
Come on, come on

586
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:03,630
I said

587
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:15,170
Do you wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang

588
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,180
I'm the leader

589
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm the leader of the gang
Yeah, yeah

590
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,420
But there's no one
like the girl I am

591
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,460
I can take you

592
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,260
High as a kite
every single night

593
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,860
I can make you
jump ot of bed

594
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,130
- Now, that looks better.
... We agreed on a compromise.

595
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,470
Who'd ever believe it

596
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,770
... What on earth's that?
- That's the compromise.

597
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,640
Do you wanna be in my gang
my gang, my gang

598
00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:09,060
Hey, Bobby Charlton!

599
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,700
Was that really worth it?

600
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I'm so glad we got the morning off.

601
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,000
- First one in a month, Clifford.
- Are we there yet?

602
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,640
- I'm dying for the loo.
... So am I.

603
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,680
Clitford,
can we stop the bus?

604
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,340
Dennis, pull over.
We've got a crisis.

605
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,080
The girls need to go
to the bathroom again.

606
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,490
- I'm bursting to go wee.
- Come on. Move.

607
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:43,590
- Geri, I've borrowed your shoes.
- Mind the spider!

608
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,060
You see?

609
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,630
Doesn't matter how successful you are,
sometimes you have to pee in the woods.

610
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,040
I don't understand how all the toilets
can break down at the same time.

611
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,470
It's not my tault
they keep breaking down.

612
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,040
It's hard to get a plumber to your
house, and that stays in one place.

613
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,650
But you try calling one out to a bus
that's moving around the countryside.

614
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,450
... It's impossible.
- Can't you do something about them?

615
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:09,120
... Like what?
- Fix them.

616
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,220
Listen.

617
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,260
I love these girls
and I'll do anything for them...

618
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,500
but I won't do that.

619
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,700
I don't want to go any turther.
I'm scared.

620
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,140
Why does the countryside
have to be so bloody muddy?

621
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,240
Something just brushed past me,
and I'm not joking.

622
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,480
It was only a disgusting beast
that wants to eat you.

623
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,550
... Oh, pack it in, Mel.
- It weren't me.

624
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,950
I think we're lost, you know.

625
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,250
Spiders are everywhere.
Whose idea was this?

626
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,190
What's that?

627
00:36:45,190 --> 00:37:29,630
... Oh, my God! Run for it!
... I can't move!

628
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,700
Get oft!

629
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,740
You've done it now.

630
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,710
Geri, go and say something to them.

631
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,740
Go on.
Say something good, Geri.

632
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:45,720
What do you want with us?

633
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,620
Yeah.

634
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:59,030
Sorry, but they've all sold out.

635
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:05,900
... Oh, my God.
... What is it?

636
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,440
What's his name?

637
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Is that three or tour "K"s?

638
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,350
Four.

639
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,550
Gosh, you're tat.

640
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,250
Ew, he wants you to snog him.

641
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:30,290
He wants you, G.

642
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,260
They want a picture.

643
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,700
Smile.

644
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,840
... What do you mean, aliens?
... Aliens trom outer space.

645
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,240
They had these
little squidgy f aces.

646
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
And really cheap green coats.

647
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,950
You're obviously under massive stress.
I think you need some time ott.

648
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,080
I'm going to stand up to the chiet,
be assertive.

649
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,990
I'm gonna ask him...
no, tell him...

650
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,490
the girls are going to
have the morning otf.

651
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,630
- The answer is no, Clifford.
... Chiet?

652
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,230
- The girls cannot have the morning ott.
- Of course not.

653
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,630
The tact that they've
been working really hard...

654
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,770
and they're at the point
ot exhaustion is...

655
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,240
- Irrelevant.
- Irrelevant.

656
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,640
Without sacrifice
there is no success.

657
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,480
Without pain
there is no pleasure.

658
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:34,860
And without something
there is no nothing.

659
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,660
Very assertive, Clitford.
You better go and tell them.

660
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,030
- I know.
... Go on, then.

661
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm going on, then.

662
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,040
... See you, Clitford!
... Hold on.

663
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,340
... Where are you going?
... Going home to sleep.

664
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,310
- See you tomorrow atternoon.
... Sorry. There's been a change ot plan.

665
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,880
The schedule's too tight.
No morning ott.

666
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Oh, nice one, Clittord.

667
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,890
... You nearly had us there.
... You're not good at telling tibs.

668
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,920
I'm sorry.
There's too much to get through.

669
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,590
- You're not joking, are you?
- Oh, no.

670
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,960
You see, we've got to
see Nicola in the morning.

671
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,460
The baby's overdue.

672
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,800
Baby's are allowed to be overdue.
You're not.

673
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,010
Please, I'll buy you
a milk chocolate Magnum each.

674
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,540
... Okay.
- Get back.

675
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,040
Look, Clitford,
you can only push us so tar.

676
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,150
- Yeah, right.
- You just better watch it, mate.

677
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:42,430
From now on, there's no more
Mr. Nice Spice.

678
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,430
Where are they going?

679
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,940
... What do you think?
- I don't know, mate.

680
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,100
Fooled you.
See you in the morning.

681
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,210
Don't forget my Magnum.

682
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,110
Now hear this.

683
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,750
You are about to enter Dance Camp.

684
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,020
You will be under the instruction
ot the toughest...

685
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,620
dance teacher ot all time,
Mr. Step.

686
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,180
Right, you horrible lot!

687
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,990
Left, right, lett!

688
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,290
Don't give me that "Julie Andrews high
on a hill'' type claptrap. Chop, chop.

689
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,300
I'm your mother now,
and I don't mean Superior.

690
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:28,200
Take that sweet out ot your mouth...

691
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,410
... Shimmy, shimmy.
... Are you the dance teacher, Mr. Step?

692
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,310
That is correct.

693
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,850
I'm going to show you
my "pas de bra.''

694
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,050
That won't apply to you.

695
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,390
Pay attention.

696
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:58,340
One, two, one.

697
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,170
Mother!

698
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,940
- We can't dance like that.
- Yes, I know.

699
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,840
I've seen your videos.

700
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,680
That's enough.
Shall we do our own thing?

701
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,920
I don't even understand them,
they seem so strange.

702
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:11,950
That's it.
We're gonna get tit, fit, fit.

703
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,020
That's it.
We're gonna get tit, fit, fit.

704
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:33,500
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

705
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,510
Never give up on the good times

706
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:41,380
Gotta believe
in the love you find

707
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,680
Never give up on the good times

708
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,620
Sharp turn right. March!
Living it up is a state of mind

709
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,860
Love it.
Make your mothers proud ot you.

710
00:42:52,860 --> 00:43:04,170
What sort ot men are you, anyway?
Left, right.

711
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,200
Right then, Spice Girls,
regimental chant.

712
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,570
Right then, Spice Girls,
regimental chant.

713
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,580
We're the Spice Girls, yes, indeed
Just Girl Power is all we need

714
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,850
Pick it up!
We know how we got this far

715
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,150
Strength and courage
and a Wonderbra

716
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,550
Cold this work with only one
Right wheel!

717
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,250
Just with me I'd have no fun

718
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,020
Would this work with only two
Lett wheel, go down.

719
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,990
We need more for what we do

720
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,360
Would this work with only three

721
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,560
Three's a crowd, bad company

722
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,700
Wold this work with only four
No way, girl, we need one more

723
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,870
Listenp
Take my advice

724
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,040
We need five
for the power of Spice

725
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,410
Give itp, give it out
Take a stand, scream and shout

726
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:48,110
One, two, three, four
Five Spice Girls

727
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,510
Get in there.
Posh Spice, where are you going?

728
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,550
- There's a spider in there!
- Get out ot those tubes.

729
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,590
Come on. Get up that ramp.
Get hold ot that rope.

730
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:03,790
That is correct!

731
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,900
That is not correct.

732
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:17,270
I'II give you not correct.

733
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,280
Lights otf.

734
00:44:19,280 --> 00:45:42,630
... It's not even dark yet.
- And you, Melanie.

735
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,100
It's pathetic that we can't
even sleep in our own rooms.

736
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,500
I don't know what we're making such
a tuss for. It's only an old house.

737
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
A big old house.

738
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,300
A big, very old, haunted...

739
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,140
big old house.

740
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,480
I had this horrible dream
last night.

741
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,580
I dreamt we were all doing
the live show.

742
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,210
I went on stage.

743
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,880
I was just about to open my gob,
and nothing came out.

744
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,180
Something
even more weirder happened.

745
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,350
... You didn't have a head?
... How did you know?

746
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,160
I have the same dream.

747
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,060
No way.

748
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,530
I had exactly the same dream,
but mine was much, much worse.

749
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,200
You see, I had a head
but there was no makeup on it.

750
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,700
Oh, no.

751
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,870
I just don't understand.
So what does it all mean?

752
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,370
Probably our subconscious minds
so we don't have to deal...

753
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,710
with our inner anxieties
when we're awake.

754
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,840
Like we're all gonna be scared
of this live show.

755
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,510
And that we might not
be able to sing.

756
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,420
And it's gonna be
a complete disaster.

757
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,350
Oh, no.
Let's just stay here together.

758
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,520
Yeah, squash up.
I'm going to sleep now.

759
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,790
I am. See you.

760
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,230
I hate you, McMaxtord.

761
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:55,870
I really, really hate you.

762
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:06,380
I hate you!

763
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,450
Look at that! More stories!
More evil harpoons trom the press!

764
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,850
I wouldn't let it
bother you, Cliftord.

765
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,750
Just chill out.

766
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,890
Yeah, the press
can just tlick otf.

767
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,560
Makes me wanna strangle something!

768
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,860
If we took any notice of all that press,
we'd go mad like you.

769
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,300
I just can't take it anymore!

770
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,070
It's all lies!
I'm simply not like that!

771
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,570
Bring me a straitjacket!

772
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:40,040
Yes, you can laugh!
You can laugh!

773
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,980
He is so uptight,
he's gonna have a heart attack.

774
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,820
- Maybe he's not getting enough bacon.
- Could be.

775
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,450
Do you know what would be pertect?
It he tancied Deborah.

776
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,560
- Yeah!
- I reckon he's got a chance with her.

777
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,730
... She hasn't had a boytriend in months.
- He doesn't tancy her.

778
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,100
The body language is all wrong.
He doesn't even look at her.

779
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,330
But that doesn't matter.
Men don't like showing their emotions.

780
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,100
That is true.

781
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,940
But apparently there's these animals
in the jungle or the rain forest.

782
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,780
Anyway, when the male's courting
the temale, he goes and pees on her.

783
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,480
- Oh, no!
... Geri, do you have to?

784
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,680
But it's his way of showing
that he f ancies her.

785
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,780
And the thing is,
they get it on afterwards and mate.

786
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:29,260
Call me old-tashioned,
but I preter a bunch ot tlowers.

787
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,600
- Here's where we get "high concept.''
- Eight miles high.

788
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,330
A Royal Air Force stealth bomber is
hijacked by extraterrestrial terrorists.

789
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,940
Inside the pilot's pocket
is a computer disk...

790
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,010
with a virus encoded on it that is
so deadly, it could destroy the world.

791
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,980
The British prime minister
has absolutely no choice.

792
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:55,490
He has to call in
the Spice Force Five.

793
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,690
Can you see the merchandising?
Action tigures?

794
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:13,400
Crack operatives in their own tield.
There's the martial arts expert.

795
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,080
Counterespionage agent.

796
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,910
Goal!

797
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:29,390
Explosives expert.

798
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,390
Oh, no!

799
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,420
Master ot disguise.

800
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:39,600
Wonder Woman

801
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:47,240
You're a Wonder Woman

802
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,510
Girl Power!
Equalization between the sexes, hmm?

803
00:49:51,510 --> 00:50:01,620
And...- oh... Victoria.

804
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,290
- Then what? Back to reality.
- Absolutely.

805
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,890
Oh, hell, yeah.
Why not?

806
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:15,570
What kind ot reality
are you interested in? I'm open.

807
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,430
Competition winners.

808
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,540
The chance to make those
f antasy tigures become a reality.

809
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,110
Dreams come true.
The stuft of tairy tales.

810
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:30,410
So, how's it teel to have won the trip
round London with the Spice Girls?

811
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,320
- It's great.
... I expect your friends are jealous.

812
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,350
- Yeah.
... I'm sure they are.

813
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:40,660
- How's that sound?
- Planes, dogs, trattic.

814
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,830
We won't be using this bit anyway.
Don't worry about it. Come on.

815
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,530
I hate that.
Couldn't get a word in edgewise.

816
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,770
They treat us like bloody kids.

817
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,640
Okay, kids,
welcome to the Spicebus.

818
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,670
- Cool.
... Girls, competition winners.

819
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,440
Balloons, cakes,
sandwiches, tun, tun.

820
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,780
- Do you want a Polaroid?
- It's Jack and Evie, isn't it?

821
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,520
... Do you want something to eat?
- Ready? Smile.

822
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,020
Why do they have loads ot
tish paste sarnies at parties?

823
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,590
- No one likes them.
- I know.

824
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:13,120
It must be great
being a Spice Girl.

825
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,290
- It's good.
- lt'd be better it it wasn't tor...

826
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,360
our f ascist slave driver
bossing us about all the time.

827
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,870
Let's just escape
trom this place!

828
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,640
Don't worry, she does this all the time.
She is mad.

829
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,740
Yes!

830
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,910
When I say "go, '' we go.

831
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,210
... Go!
- Grab some crisps.

832
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,650
- Where are we going?
... Just go with the flow.

833
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,280
Take it easy, girls.

834
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,190
... Mind telling me where they're going?
- They're being spontaneous.

835
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,190
I told them before,
it they want to be spontaneous...

836
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:53,460
they'd have to
clear it with me first.

837
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,300
... Let's go.
- Can we have a ride on your boat?

838
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,870
Quick! There's an aquatic
adventure happening here!

839
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:04,040
What we need now
is a really serious speedboat.

840
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,480
- Dennis, tollow them.
... I'm on the trail.

841
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,850
My boy lollipop

842
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,420
Yomake my heart go giddy-p

843
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,750
You are as sweet as candy

844
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,560
Yo're my sugar dandy

845
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,090
Uh-oh
My boy lollipop

846
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,960
The Spice Girls at sea.

847
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,270
What an extraordinary combination
ot Girl Power and horsepower.

848
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,940
Can't this thing go any taster?

849
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,340
My heart told me so

850
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,510
I love you
I love you

851
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,850
I love yoso
But I don't want you to know

852
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,880
Faster! Come on!

853
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,350
I need you, I need yo
I need you so

854
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,790
And I'll never let you go

855
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,690
Deborah, can you please explain
what the hell is going on here?

856
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,030
... They're having tun. Rock 'n' roll.
- No, it's not.

857
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,260
Rock 'n' roll is staying up all night
and getting completely ott your f ace...

858
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,770
and throwing television sets
out ot hotel windows.

859
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,370
I don't remember
any mention ot boats.

860
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,100
You're my lollipop

861
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,240
Enzo, they're dancing.
Can we have them dancing, please?

862
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,110
I can hear singing.
Can you get what they're singing?

863
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,480
... Don't you remember being a kid?
... What?

864
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,220
You know, talling over in
the playground, scraping your knees.

865
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:25,490
Deborah,
what planet are you trom?

866
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:33,300
Hold on!
Water on the lens, Piers!

867
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,740
Here they come.

868
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:48,240
Stop!

869
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,950
Oh, my!

870
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,980
There is a child in the water.
I want a close...up of...

871
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,350
... All I'm getting is you shouting.
- Shush then.

872
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,660
Turn it round! Quick!

873
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,990
Don't worry! I'II save her!

874
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,500
At last, a real drama.
Sorry.

875
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,100
Get oft!
I'm trying to tilm.

876
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,870
I got a loud splash there, Piers.

877
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,700
Just great!

878
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,640
Parents lend us their kids,
and we drown them.

879
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,410
- That was so brilliant!
- Wicked!

880
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,650
That was not supposed to happen!

881
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,220
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

882
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,550
... You mean, I got wet tor nothing?
- Help!

883
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,390
... What?
... This dress is dry-clean only!

884
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,820
Do they have sharks
in the Thames?

885
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:41,100
... Oh, shut up!
- They're coming.

886
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,300
... Whose idea was this?
... Yours.

887
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,640
... Can we do it again?
- No!

888
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,910
- Vicky, do you wanna wear this?
- I'm not that desperate.

889
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,750
Are you all right?

890
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:22,610
Do you realize what'll happen
if any of this ever gets out?

891
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,710
And more drama
concerning the Spice Girls.

892
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,040
Today, two young
competition winners...

893
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,950
had a dramatic escape when they fell....

894
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,020
from a speeding boat
on the river Thames.

895
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,380
This report from James Platt.

896
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,950
Take it easy, Clitford.
Would you like a Rescue Remedy?

897
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:45,900
I think it's time tor a chat.

898
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,430
Look at this.
Front page news again.

899
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,740
Suppose the whole lot of you
had been drowned?

900
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,240
- We weren't though.
- Speak tor yourselt.

901
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,970
What did you think
you were doing?

902
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,880
- We were just having fun.
... What?

903
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,980
You know, tun,
like "ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.''

904
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,720
Look, we're old enough to take
responsibility for our own lives.

905
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,450
You don't have a life.
You have a schedule.

906
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:11,420
You are part of a well-oiled
global machine.

907
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,590
There are people working
their butts ott tor you!

908
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:16,260
- People like Deborah.
... Can you leave my butt out ot this?

909
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,730
Just don't be
so uptight, Clittord.

910
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,230
Uptight? You've got
a live gig here tomorrow.

911
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,330
It's my job
to see that you turn up.

912
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,000
My bum is on the line here!

913
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,470
Could you please leave butts and bums
out ot this tor one minute?

914
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,080
Some things are
more important than gigs.

915
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,980
... Like what?
... Like self-respect and our treedom.

916
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,020
Yeah, and triendship.

917
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,120
What are you saying?
You don't want to turn up here tomorrow?

918
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,360
Maybe we don't!

919
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,290
- What did you say that tor?
... I don't know.

920
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,160
Listen, you.

921
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,030
It's up to us whether we turn up
to this gig or not tomorrow, all right?

922
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,870
Okay, stay at home.
That's tine.

923
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,970
- Fine!
- Fine!

924
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,540
- We can't let the f ans down.
- He didn't mean that.

925
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,940
... Didn't I?
... Can we please stop arguing?

926
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,310
When you know exactly
what is supposed to be happening...

927
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:14,820
could somebody
please let me know?

928
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,620
Great, Clittord.
Now look what you've done.

929
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,790
... That's just too bad.
- It is, because you know what?

930
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,830
- I'm going home now. See you!
- Bye!

931
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,030
Can we just stop all this?
It's doing my head in!

932
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,570
Emma!

933
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,640
I hope you know
what you're doing...

934
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,170
'cause if you're looking tor a tight,
you're gonna lose!

935
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,110
What do you think?
No, I don't want to hear what you think.

936
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,350
... What do you think?
- I think you detinitely lost.

937
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:48,320
I think...

938
00:57:48,320 --> 00:58:04,000
I think I may have just started
the breakup ot the Spice Girls.

939
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,540
It's tine, Chief.
Everything's tine.

940
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,100
... Oh, no, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

941
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,040
How bad is it?

942
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,710
Imagine how bad
it cold possibly be.

943
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,580
- Yes?
- Well, it's worse than that.

944
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,120
- Oh, dear.
- Don't get upset, Chief.

945
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,550
... Oh, dearie me.
- You're getting all emotional, Chief.

946
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,950
Look, the show will go on...

947
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,020
even it I have to
round up four triends...

948
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,230
and personally
dress up as Victoria.

949
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,060
Let us hope
it does not come to that.

950
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,400
- I won't let you down.
- You'd better not.

951
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,370
Remember: The headless chicken
can only know where he has been.

952
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:45,140
He cannot see
where he is going.

953
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,610
Do not be that chicken, Clitford.

954
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:57,250
Chicken. Right.

955
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,590
Things are moving.
The girls have had a row with Cliftord.

956
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:04,590
They might not
turn up tor the show.

957
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:09,130
Something strange is happening.

958
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,500
What is it?

959
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,300
Something's happening to my f ace.

960
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:26,350
I think you're smiling.

961
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:29,950
That you'd be like this.

962
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,520
I'm sorry.

963
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:39,900
Sorry that you ever left here.

964
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:46,000
Sam, for old time's sake.

965
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,310
Yeah, sure, for old time's sake.

966
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,650
So there we go, girls.
That's six coftees.

967
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,620
- Thanks, Brian.
- One pound tifty.

968
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,780
... Can you put it on the slate?
- What slate?

969
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,120
The "we'll pay you back when
we're rich and f amous" slate.

970
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,820
Call me old-f ashioned
and sentimental, but no.

971
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,830
Do you think I'm
the Salvation Army?

972
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,760
It was worth a try.

973
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,130
How's the musical career going?
You got any deals?

974
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,640
- Not quite.
... But we've got this new song.

975
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,670
What is it? Flip-flop?
Or hip-hop?

976
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:23,870
... Funk?
- Hip-hop?

977
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,740
Funk? Where have you been
tor the last ten years?

978
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,980
I don't know the music scene now.
I can't make head nor tail of it.

979
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,320
Anything goes these days.
You just do what you want.

980
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,550
I'm a jazz man,
and I'm telling you...

981
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,750
jazz is due tor a comeback.

982
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,320
Brian, they've got
this great song.

983
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,160
- Do it tor him.
... He's not interested.

984
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,760
Of course he is.
You are interested, aren't you?

985
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,330
Sit down and shut up and listen,
'cause we're gonna do it anyway.

986
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,900
... Let's do it.
- Ready?

987
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,070
One, two, three.
Hit it!

988
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,400
One, two, three.
Hit it!

989
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,340
I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want

990
01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:01,640
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want

991
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,250
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna

992
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:15,590
Really, really, really wanna
Zig-a-zig-ah

993
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,890
If you want my fture

994
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,730
Forget my past

995
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,800
If yowanna get with me

996
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,400
Better make it fast

997
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,600
Now don't go wasting
my precios time

998
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:42,050
Get your act together
We cold be jst fine

999
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:45,090
If yowanna be my lover
yogotta get with my friends

1000
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:48,060
- Gotta get with my friends
- Make it last forever

1001
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,390
Friendship never ends

1002
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:52,400
If yowanna be my lover

1003
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,600
Yohave got to give

1004
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,970
Taking is too easy

1005
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:05,440
But that's the way it is

1006
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:17,090
Slam your body down
and wind it all around

1007
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:25,660
Go on, Mel!

1008
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,600
- If yowanna be my lover
- What'd you think?

1009
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,440
Not bad. Just needs
a wee bit more jazz in there.

1010
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,270
I think it'll make the Top 20.

1011
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:57,360
It's great!
I love it!

1012
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,060
- It's so sad.
- That's what I was thinking.

1013
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:05,370
We used to live in there.
Now look at it.

1014
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,970
- What are you doing here?
... What are you doing here?

1015
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:10,340
Same as you.

1016
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,980
This all seems like
ages ago, doesn't it?

1017
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,580
It just shows you, you can't go back.
Nothing's the same.

1018
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,150
... I wonder whatever did happen to Brian.
- We owe him tor a couple ot cottees.

1019
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,890
- Yeah.
... Let's go and get some chips.

1020
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:28,320
... I'm not paying for cotfees.
... Bacon butties tor me.

1021
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,760
... You don't care what you eat, do you?
- No, I don't.

1022
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,100
I wonder it we've changed a lot
since we've been f amous.

1023
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,340
... I don't think I have.
- Nor have I.

1024
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,340
I just think we worry
about difterent things.

1025
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:45,710
In the old days it was,
"Where's our next meal coming from?''

1026
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:49,010
And now it's,
"Where's our next single going to?"

1027
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,280
And like,
is it all gonna be over soon?

1028
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,980
Melvin B, Emma...

1029
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:59,460
Melvin C, Victoria, Geri.

1030
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,360
You have been tound guilty
ot releasing a single...

1031
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,800
that is by no means as kicking
as your previous records.

1032
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,830
Nor does it have such a wicked,
dirty, tat bass line.

1033
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,970
You are sentenced
to having your next record...

1034
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:16,040
enter the charts
at number 179...

1035
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,340
betore dropping straight out
the tollowing week.

1036
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:23,040
Furthermore,
you are sentenced to 20 years...

1037
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,080
of having to appear
on cheesy chat shows in Taiwan...

1038
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,890
talking about how
you used to be tamous.

1039
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:35,960
And may God have mercy
on your lip gloss.

1040
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,430
Call Hootie and the Blowfish.

1041
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,260
You know what's happened? We haven't
got time tor our triends anymore.

1042
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,300
Like Nicola.

1043
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,140
We're supposed to be
godmothers to her baby.

1044
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,300
We haven't even spent
any time with her.

1045
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,310
Why don't we
take her out tonight?

1046
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,140
- Yeah, and go really mental!
- Yeah!

1047
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,350
Hang on. We've got a show tomorrow.
What are we gonna do about that?

1048
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:06,160
It Clittord tinds out we've
been out all night, he'll go berserk.

1049
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,830
What are we waiting tor?

1050
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:27,740
- Come on, Vicky!
... I can't run in these heels!

1051
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,210
Thought I'd tind you here.

1052
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,680
Sorry, there's only room tor
one depressed personality in here.

1053
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,120
At least you're still alive.

1054
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,690
That's the bit
that depresses me.

1055
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:43,120
It it makes you feel any better,
I've got a degree in politics...

1056
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,100
philosophy and economics,
and I spend my entire lite...

1057
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:49,700
worrying about whether Mel C
is wearing the right Nike Air Max.

1058
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,830
By the way,
did you sort them out?

1059
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:54,670
Yes.

1060
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,210
Mind you, I'd rather
be us than the girls.

1061
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:02,510
Fame is...-
Fame is such a tickle thing.

1062
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:07,880
... What can I get you?
... Gin and tonic, please.

1063
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,750
Just a minute.

1064
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:15,220
- Can you make that a double?
... Yes.

1065
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,930
- You know what happens now, don't you?
... What's that?

1066
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:21,200
We both sit here
getting more and more selt-pitying...

1067
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,230
telling each other tragic tales
of lost lovers...

1068
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,370
then deaden the pain by having
a night ot tull-on passion...

1069
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:33,610
and end up completely ruining
our protessional relationship.

1070
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:38,880
Well, I'm up tor it,
it you are.

1071
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:58,630
Time, ladies and gentlemen.

1072
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,870
- You all right, Nicola?
- Fine.

1073
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:04,910
It's the last time I'll be going out
tor a while, so I'm gonna enjoy it.

1074
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,580
- I love this song!
- That's 'cause we wrote it!

1075
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,510
- Let's go for a dance.
- No. I'll watch you.

1076
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,150
- Carry on.
... Take care, Nicola.

1077
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:23,220
Come on!

1078
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:33,070
Could somebody please tell me
exactly what is the dress code here?

1079
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:37,110
The race is on
to get out of the bottom

1080
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,910
The top is high
so yor roots are forgotten

1081
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:44,610
Giving is good
as long as yo're getting

1082
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,750
What's driving yo
is ambition I'm betting

1083
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:55,520
I said
Who do yothink yoare

1084
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,630
I said who

1085
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,430
Some kind of sperstar

1086
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:05,640
You have just got to
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it

1087
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,670
Who do yothink yoare

1088
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:26,960
Trst it,se it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are

1089
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,490
You're swelling out
in the wrong direction

1090
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:34,500
Yo've got the bug
Superstar, yo've been bitten

1091
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,530
Yor trmpet's blowing
for far too long

1092
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:45,910
Climbing the snakep the ladder
But you're wrong

1093
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:54,820
Nicola!

1094
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:58,450
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1095
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:01,090
- Can we sit there?
... Can you get out of the way?

1096
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,430
I think the contractions
have started.

1097
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,830
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- I don't remember swallowing a baby.

1098
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:08,160
... It's tor an emergency.
- The baby's coming.

1099
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,770
- Now don't panic.
- Don't panic!

1100
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,330
I'm not panicking.

1101
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:15,700
- What do you do in an emergency?
- Call my mom!

1102
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,340
We need an ambulance.

1103
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:20,340
- I don't think there's enough time.
... Okay, we don't need an ambulance!

1104
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,550
Dennis! We've gotta
get to the hospital!

1105
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,010
What happened?

1106
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,420
- We're having a baby.
- What? All ot you?

1107
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,920
... Just get there!
- Come on!

1108
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,790
Round them up!
We're gonna hit the trail!

1109
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,590
... Ow! That was a contraction!
- Cuddle.

1110
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:42,900
Deep breathing,
that's the thing.

1111
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,370
Not you, Victoria! Her!

1112
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:48,800
...Does anyone know how to deliver a baby?
-Don't look at me.

1113
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,770
... I know all about home delivery.
- Yeah, right.

1114
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,540
I read it in a book.
The tirst thing to do is, uh...

1115
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,610
- Put your legs together.
... Too late.

1116
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,680
... Should've done that nine months ago.
... Don't make me laugh.

1117
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,490
Do not make her laugh, because
it'll just shoot out like a cannonball.

1118
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,790
Seriously now, what it
the baby comes out right now?

1119
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,930
It's not gonna go very tar.
She's still got her tights on.

1120
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:18,330
Stay up there.
We're not ready tor you yet.

1121
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,840
That's it! Push!

1122
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,400
- I am pushing!
... Are you sure she should push?

1123
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,170
What else is she gonna do?

1124
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,610
It I push any more,
I'll turn myselt inside out!

1125
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,110
... What's going on?
... She's pushing!

1126
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,110
- How dilated is she?
- Not very.

1127
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:34,280
- She only had one gin and orange.
... Just calm down, girls.

1128
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:38,020
You're in tor a long wait.
This is going to take a long time.

1129
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,120
Oh, that's nice.

1130
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,690
It's all right.
We're here.

1131
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:48,530
Mama, I love you

1132
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:51,830
That's catchy. Hmm.

1133
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,470
Excuse me.
Are you the Spice Girls?

1134
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,040
Some of them.

1135
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,170
My son's banged his head.
He's unconscious.

1136
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:01,340
I was wondering it you could
talk to him, try and wake him up.

1137
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:09,520
- We can do that.
- Sorry about this.

1138
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,690
Malcolm, the Spice Girls
have come to talk to you.

1139
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,960
Isn't that wondertul?

1140
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,490
Hello, Malcolm.
It's Geri.

1141
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,860
- I'm Melanie C.
... And I'm Victoria, Malcolm!

1142
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,700
Stop it.

1143
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,400
Well, what should we do now?

1144
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,140
I don't know.
Maybe we should just talk to him.

1145
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:31,710
... What are we gonna say?
- Maybe you should take your top ott.

1146
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,480
Shut up!

1147
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,580
It was just a joke.

1148
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:39,080
There's not much point.
He's got his eyes shut.

1149
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:53,830
Not now.

1150
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,030
- How are you teeling?
- Bad. Where are the girls?

1151
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:02,940
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1152
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,110
How about trying to tind out?

1153
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,940
Come on! Chop-chop!
Hurry it up!

1154
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,750
It's amazing how much pain
mothers have to go through.

1155
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,280
No wonder my mom
thinks I'm so ungratetul.

1156
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,120
... I hear it's like passing a football.
... That's nothing.

1157
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:23,890
My mom said when she had me, it was like
passing a block ot flats with balconies.

1158
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:26,730
Hello?
Hi, Deborah.

1159
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,260
We're in hospital.

1160
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,270
We're tine. It's Nicola.
She's having a baby.

1161
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,870
No, we can't leave her.

1162
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,540
Oh, no.
I've got to go. Bye.

1163
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,670
I can't believe it.

1164
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,510
I cannot believe it.
They're waiting for a friend's baby?

1165
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,610
- It's called loyalty.
- No, it's called insanity.

1166
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:50,990
The whole world is waiting tor
their show, and the girls aren't here.

1167
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:55,290
They're doing it to spite me.
They're trying to make me crack.

1168
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:59,060
But I won't.

1169
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,560
I won't.

1170
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,800
I spy with my bionic eye...

1171
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,770
something beginning with "H.''

1172
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:10,740
... A hospital.
- Shut up, Geri.

1173
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,010
I'm otf duty now, Helen.
Everything all right?

1174
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:15,040
Fine. Doing anything
nice tonight?

1175
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,150
- I'm going to see the Spice Girls show.
- That'll be nice, Gladys.

1176
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:21,420
Oh, I better get a move on.
See you all later.

1177
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:26,120
Hopetully.

1178
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,690
Listen, this is silly.
Don't wait tor me. You gotta go.

1179
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:36,260
Nicola, we said we would stay,
so we're gonna stay.

1180
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,940
- I think this is it.
... Yeah, it is.

1181
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,500
Push down, Nicola.
Very good.

1182
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,940
Hi, Clitford. I don't know
what time we're gonna be there.

1183
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,210
The world can wait.
This is more important.

1184
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:52,380
It's about friendship and commitment,
but you wouldn't know about that.

1185
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,850
I'll speak to you later. Bye.

1186
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:58,420
It can't take this long
to have a baby!

1187
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,220
This is the '90s.

1188
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,620
He's about to crack up
at any moment.

1189
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,630
The sense ot tension,
ot impending doom, it's......

1190
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:09,230
... Are you getting that sweat on his lip?
... Sound running.

1191
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,400
- That's beautitul.
- I could put a little bit more on.

1192
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,270
Clitford, five minutes.
Have you got five minutes?

1193
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,970
All right, seeing as there's
nothing else going on around here.

1194
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,310
... Graydon, tetch.
- Come on.

1195
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,310
Okay, here's the story.

1196
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:25,880
It's the girls' tirst live pertormance.
They are major stars.

1197
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,120
It's only minutes
until curtain up.

1198
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,350
All hopes ot the Spice Girls'
live triumph are surely dashed.

1199
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:34,920
Oh, my God! It's coming out!
I think I'm gonna taint.

1200
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,490
... No, you're not.
... Slap me!

1201
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:40,400
... Oh, my God!
- Is it a boy or a girl?

1202
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,700
... It's a beetroot!
- It's a girl!

1203
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:49,070
With hands like that,
she'll make a great goalie one day.

1204
01:14:49,070 --> 01:15:03,180
Now that is Girl Power.

1205
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:06,360
Hey, you just...
I do believe he's got a camera.

1206
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,360
- You're that reporter, aren't you?
- Emergency!

1207
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,790
... I don't believe you!
... Get him, Melanie!

1208
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:17,100
I'm late tor the theater!
The curtain's already gone up!

1209
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,740
He crashes to the ground.

1210
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:24,770
And now the girls come face to face
with their tabloid tormentor.

1211
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,680
The evil reporter has been unmasked,
and in that moment...

1212
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,280
Damien's whole worthless life
tlashes betore his eyes because...

1213
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,550
the girls have made him realize that
he's been living a meaningless lie.

1214
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,590
Do you know what, girls?

1215
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:40,460
You've made me realize...

1216
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,720
I've been living
a meaningless lie.

1217
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,490
It's his character's
one defining moment.

1218
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,900
There isn't a dry seat
in the house.

1219
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,130
- I'm wet already.
- I don't buy it.

1220
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,640
One minute Damien is this big,
threatening monster...

1221
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,770
the next he's some weeping wimp.

1222
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,340
That's the power
ot Girl Power, man.

1223
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,540
- So that's the end?
... No.

1224
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:05,980
Damien goes after the really
big evil boss, McMaxford.

1225
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,780
... What about the girls?
- They've gotta get to Albert Hall.

1226
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,790
They've been at the hospital
for 12 hours.

1227
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,420
He's not here.

1228
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,290
I don't believe it.
Just when you need him.

1229
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:17,790
Now it's a race against time.

1230
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,030
- So there's gonna be a chase?
... Those are the rules.

1231
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,160
Out ot the way, girls.

1232
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:28,600
- What are you doing?
- Fasten your seat belts.

1233
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,040
Hey! That's my bus!

1234
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,010
What are you doing?

1235
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:38,350
Get out ot the way!

1236
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,820
Come on!
What are you doing?

1237
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:43,050
What's the matter?
Are you blind?

1238
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:47,060
Put your foot down!

1239
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,020
Sunday drivers.
It's only Saturday.

1240
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:54,200
Okay, now the Spicebus is racing
across London, through Trafalgar Sqare.

1241
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,470
Pigeons are flying up.
Guys are diving into fountains.

1242
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,870
And as it zooms down the Mall
past Bckingham Palace...

1243
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,870
Prince William
is looking through a curtain.

1244
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:07,080
He turns to the Queen, man,
and says, 'Oi, Granny, look!

1245
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,140
It's the Spice Girls!
They're on telly in a minute!''

1246
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,580
And the Queen says,
"Oh, you're right.

1247
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,380
Isn't that the Posh one driving?"

1248
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,620
- There's the Queen.
- Hi, William.

1249
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,320
- Hi, Charlie.
... Hello, Harry.

1250
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,690
... Suddenly they're on top ot the bus.
- Why?

1251
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:23,020
- The rules!
... Yeah, the rules.

1252
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,630
And there they are,
standing together in gale force winds....

1253
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:27,760
holding on for dear life.

1254
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,070
Emma slips, but Geri grabs her.
But then Geri slips.

1255
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:34,440
Mel B grabs her, bt she slips,
so Mel C grabs her!

1256
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,740
Is that tour?
No, there's one driving.

1257
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,410
They're standing on top of the bus,
whiplashing back and torth...

1258
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,780
about to be turned into Spice Jam!

1259
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,350
- Oh, my God!
- And?

1260
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:50,950
Two old nuns in a Mini Metro
pull up right in tront ot them.

1261
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:55,420
The braking tmbles the girls
back inside the bus.

1262
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,920
That was close.

1263
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,800
- Is everyone all right?
... Victoria!

1264
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,700
Sorry!

1265
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,300
Now they're coming
to the Tower Bridge.

1266
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:07,770
Yor attention, please.
The bridge will shortly be lifted.

1267
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:14,110
The road is rising in tront ot them
to let a boat through!

1268
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:15,640
The bridge is going up!

1269
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,280
They can't believe it!

1270
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,920
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!

1271
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:26,390
Are they crazy enough
to try and jump the gap?

1272
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:29,460
Hold on to your knickers, girls!

1273
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,560
Hey, baby,
these are the Spice Girls!

1274
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,500
Of course they're gonna go tor it!
Up it goes.

1275
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,670
A tive-ton London bus sailing
through the air at 80 miles an hour.

1276
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:47,080
... It's incredible!
- It's expensive.

1277
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,240
Not necessarily.

1278
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,080
Just when you think they're safe,
they discover the bomb.

1279
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,580
What bomb?

1280
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:01,820
That bomb.

1281
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,390
- Why?
- Those are the rules.

1282
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,500
I've had enough ot the rules!
Are you trying to kill them?

1283
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,860
- Stop it!
- They've suttered enough!

1284
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,600
- Please!
- All right! All right!

1285
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,870
They run up to the Albert Hall,
up the steps...

1286
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:24,950
and then they hurtle down the corridor
and burst through that door right there.

1287
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,980
You lied to me.

1288
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,950
Now, now.
Hey, that's enough of that!

1289
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,890
- Come on now!
- Where are they?

1290
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,090
I'll rewrite it.

1291
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:41,300
Spice Girls!

1292
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,800
- Let's go!
- Quick! We're late!

1293
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:57,040
Clitford's gonna be mad.

1294
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,880
- Oh, no!
- Coppers.

1295
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,690
Stay calm.
It'll be all right.

1296
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:10,060
Is there a problem, Otficer?

1297
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,530
Dangerous driving,
criminal damage...

1298
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:16,530
tlying a bus
without a license, and...

1299
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:21,270
frightening the pigeons.

1300
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:25,010
- Go on, Emma.
- But what do I say?

1301
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:28,740
I'm really sorry, Otficer, but we were
late tor a show, so we were in a hurry.

1302
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,610
We didn't hurt anybody
and we're just really sorry.

1303
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:43,060
We promise never, ever
to do it again.

1304
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,930
Shall we cut?

1305
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:49,260
- What's the matter with him?
... It's the very essence of documentary.

1306
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,670
Silence. Silence.

1307
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:56,200
This is marvelous.

1308
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,970
Okay...

1309
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:00,010
so this is the plan.

1310
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:03,780
The band starts up,
the tans go wild...

1311
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:09,950
the lights come on
and I walk center stage and hang myselt.

1312
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,090
By the way,
this is my good side.

1313
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,060
My tinal words are...

1314
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,330
"The Spice Girls...
I hate them!"

1315
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:21,260
... What are you doing sitting around?
... We've got a show to do.

1316
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:23,260
- Let's do it!
... Where are the mikes?

1317
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:27,100
- Where are the clothes?
- And where are the bacon butties?

1318
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,400
... I love those girls.
... Great.

1319
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,510
I love those girls!

1320
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:39,380
Damn.

1321
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:46,190
Well, that's ruined a perfectly
good ending to this documentary.

1322
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,390
Everything's under control.

1323
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:51,260
Then let us enjoy this triumph
while we can...

1324
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,500
before the hounds ot catastrophe
break tree ot their shackles...

1325
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,500
and slobber chaos
all over our taces once again.

1326
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,940
- Ciao, Chiet.
... What did he say?

1327
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,000
Does it matter?

1328
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,410
You know that thing you do when you've
been really horrible to someone...

1329
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:07,640
and you want to make it
all right again?

1330
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,480
And you have to,
you know, say stutt.

1331
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,950
- Apologize?
... That's the one.

1332
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:15,220
... I want to do that.
- You want to apologize?

1333
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:19,350
Right. So, what do you think? Do we
still have a protessional relationship?

1334
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:23,260
Ot course we do.
Why ever not?

1335
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,460
Just a minute.

1336

Kng-fu fighting
Dancing Queen

Travel, space, man
And all that's in between

1355
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,820
- Flamenco
- Lambada

1356
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,620
- But hip-hop is harder
- We moonwalk the fox-trot

1357
01:25:06,620 --> 01:26:11,790
Then polka the salsa

1358
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:15,760
I'm worried about my character.
It's unreal. Do you know what I mean?

1359
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,730
I know I'm supposed to be the baddie,
but why do I hate the Spice Girls?

1360
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:23,300
- There's no reason.
- He's a caricature sort ot.

1361
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,730
Sort ot this evil,
grotesque symbol...

1362
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:28,470
about how power corrupts
and perverts.

1363
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:31,610
Yeah, but why can't
I have a sotter side?

1364
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:35,180
The kids are gonna start hating me,
attacking me in the street, like.

1365
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:38,050
Look, as an artiste,
a good kicking...

1366
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:41,220
could be the highest compliment
you'll ever get.

1367
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,220
They want me to play
their road manager.

1368
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,160
I'm on a mobile phone
getting angry all the time.

1369
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,220
Well, I don't want
to end my career.

1370
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,390
Fat or stupid or lazy...
That's all I get ottered, Alan.

1371
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:56,160
- The sort ot character people ignore.
- They don't want my Scottish accent.

1372
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,400
That's tine, doing a silly accent.
But the chest wig...

1373
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,640
... Where's Mel B?
- This comedy chest wig.

1374
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:05,070
- Hi, Mel.
... Hello.

1375
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:07,480
... Are you all right?
- I've gotta wear this chest wig.

1376
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,980
- You're Mel B?
... No, C.

1377
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:14,150
Just call me Sporty.
It's all right.

1378
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:16,320
All right, sweetheart.

1379
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,820
That's that saying
from the tilm you did.

1380
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:22,390
That was really good.
What was it called?

1381
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:25,830
- That was brilliant.
- I've torgotten, but you were good.

1382
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:29,430
I think we'd all like to say
a big thank you tor being in this.

1383
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,630
We needed a serious actress
in this movie to give it some depth.

1384
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:36,270
- We didn't want it to be...
- Superticial.

1385
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:39,070
Could I ask about my chest wig?
They want me to wear this......

1386
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:43,080
Graydon, can I speak to you
about our characters, please?

1387
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,610
I was thinking, in one scene
I'd like to be really angry...

1388
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:50,550
and maybe slap someone like...
like Victoria.

1389
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:52,720
... Sure. Why not?
... Emma.

1390
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:57,290
And you know what? I don't wanna be
on an exercise bike all the time.

1391
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:01,230
Well, I've got this little catchphrase
that I'd really like to say.

1392
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:07,370
I'd go up to somebody and I'd go,
"I'm not trom London, you know!''

1393
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,870
'Cause you really are
trom London, right?

1394
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,510
- I get the joke.
- Does he not know that I'm from Leeds?

1395
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:16,610
Oh, you lot,
someone's watching us.

1396
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:20,350
Oh, yeah.
Look at all those people in there.

1397
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:23,420
- Hi.
... Hello.

1398
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:25,790
Look at them two snogging
at the back there.

1399
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:29,960
I bet you didn't see any ot our tilm.
And look where your hand is.

1400
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,390
Go on! Go on!

1401
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,530
Look at the mess they've made
with the popcorn. That's what I do.

1402
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:38,130
I always wonder
why people sit there...

1403
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:40,940
at the end of the tilm
and watch the credits go up.

1404
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,170
It's probably the sad anticlimax.
It's all over. Back to reality.

1405
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,410
... That's it.
- I know where they're gonna go.

1406
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:51,410
They're gonna go down the pub
and then they're gonna go to the chippy.

1407
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,750
Hey, you. No, not you. Behind you.
I like your dress.

1408
01:28:55,750 --> 01:29:00,150
- Is that a new Gucci one?
... C&A, mate.

1409
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:04,560
Some people are watching this on video.
Is there nothing on telly, then?

1410
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,060
Yeah, but you know what
they're wondering now, don't you?

1411
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:17,600
What happened to
the bomb on the bus?

1412
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,810
Elvis was

1413
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:23,510
A coola shaker

1414
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:26,480

'60s Twiggy set the pace

1423
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:53,570
Way back then she had the face

1424
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:56,580
That's all in the past

1425
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:00,010
