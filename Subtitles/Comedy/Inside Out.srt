Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

176
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,161
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

177

-Where did you read that?
-It doesn't matter.

The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,972
-You're kidding.
-Mmm-hmm.

191
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,308
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

-At that diner in Nebraska.
-Oh, yeah.

It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

spontaneous combustion,

522

to tell us something about yourself?

Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

The lake freezes over,

540

take Riley to the moon!
