00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,557
Hey, Stifler, how come Steve

00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,043
MATT: Bite me, Fuck Face.
DEREK: Come on, man, you're missing it.

3
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,398
l've seen it a million times,
you fucking ass-booger.

4
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:05,162
ANDY: Steve is like a filmmaking genius.
DEREK: A true American hero.

5
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:06,726
The Tarantino of titties.

6
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,082
Yeah, there's just no way
you could ever be this good.

7
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:10,646
Hey, look, l'm going to prove to Steve...

8
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,764
that l'm up to the standards
of the Stiffmeister Productions.

9
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,403
After Steve sees my directing talent...

10
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:19,797
-little bro's joining the family business.
-ls that what he said?

11
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:23,880
-He finally called you back?
-No, but l left him another message.

12
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,598
He'll get back to me.
lt's only been three weeks.

13
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:34,761
Gentle-fucks, a toast.
Tomorrow, we begin our reign as seniors.

16
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,442
Okay, people, let's take a break.

17
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:40,959
ELYSE: Remember, we play this at the end of
the ceremony after Pomp and Circumstance.

18
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,197
l don't want anyone starting
the wrong song again.

19
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:46,120
-Elyse, you need to relax, girl.
-l'm fine.

20
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,245
l just.... You know,
it's my first time up here, and--

21
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,921
Yeah, but it's graduation.
lt ain't the Boston Pops.

22
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:55,079
This performance sets the tone
for our senior year. l mean....

23
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:59,683
Look, you just remember
that everybody here is pulling for you.

24
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,081
Dork. Dork. Dork. Goose.

25
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:10,477
-l like them feisty.
-What're you doing here, Stifler?

26
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,081
We just want to say sayonara,
and let you fuck-necks know...

27
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:17,877
we plan on winning the state title, now that
the Stiffmeister's running the show.

28
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:21,801
-Adios, butt-hugger.
-He's a bigger asshole than his brother.

29
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,999
Holy shit, Arrianna.

30
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,997
Matt, what're you doing here?

31
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:34,200
Oh, we just want to make sure
the seniors have a very memorable last day.

32
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,120
That's cool. So, there's a campout tonight...

33
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,165
and it's only for the grads,
but you could come.

34
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,807
Let me check my schedule. Hell, yeah.

35
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:47,722
Bring your sleeping bag,
in case we decide to pitch a tent.

36
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:56,201
ANDY: Check it out. Perfect timing.
DEREK: This is going to be classic.

37
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,998
Time to initiate
Operation Gradu-fuck-uation.

38
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,438
This is gonna be awesome.

39
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,279
-Shit.
-Oh, yeah! Jackpot!

40
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:10,316
MATT: Payback, seniors.
Don't get that pepper spray on your hands.

41
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:16,045
A graduation gift from the Stiffmeister.

42
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,881
ANDY: Dude, we should've sprayed
the diplomas.

43
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,606

[Laughing]

45
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:34,162
Bite my nuts and call me Skippy.
lt's a Steely Dan.

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,524
-A what?
-lt's a double-headed dildo.

47
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,640
lt's a dildo. lt's a dildo.

48
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,397
-Holy shit.
-lt's even got a name.

49
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,036
Picardo?

50
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,399
-Spray that shit.
-Fuck, no. Finders keepers.

51
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,923
ELYSE: Okay, everybody, Pomp and
Circumstance. Five-minute warning. Let's go.

52
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,237
The bandees. Let's get out of here.

53
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,163
-Matt?
-Leesy.

54
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:04,480
How they hanging?
Still small and perky, l see.

55
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,876
-[Sarcastically] That's funny.
-[Sarcastically] Yeah.

56
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,721
-What're you doing here, Matt?
-l just came by to wish you good luck.

57
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,241
-You know, on the whole music thing.
-Good luck?

58
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,000
You haven't said a word to me
since the eighth grade.

59
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah, and that tone of voice
is exactly the reason why.

60
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,362
So, l'm going to take off now.

61
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:30,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to honour our graduates.

62
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,959
Douchebag's gonna miss it.

63
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,481
Oh, yes.

64
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:50,279
Are they crying?

65
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,240
Holy shit!

66
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,876
Yes!

67
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,159
Eat shit, seniors.

68
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,481
[Audience gasping]

69
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,476
Uh oh!

70
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,002
Stifler!

71
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:53,082
l've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time.

72
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,960
And now, the day of reckoning has come.

73
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,566
Hello, Matthew.

74
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,362
Your brother must be very proud.

75
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,077
You've continued his legacy.

76
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,117
Tormenting the innocent...

77
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:15,685
defiling all that is good and pure.

78
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,561
But now, you're going down.

79
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,679
What're you going to do,
expel me, Shermanator?

80
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,840
l am a sophisticated counselling machine...

81
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:33,522
sent back in time
to guide young and innocent minds.

82
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,677
My primary directive is to protect
the students of this institution...

83
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,280
and all, indeed all mankind...

84
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,805
from the menace that is another Stifler.

85
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,475
Behaviour modification is required.

86
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,526
lt's not too late to change your future.

87
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:57,955
No, expulsion would be too easy.

88
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:00,960
[Police siren wailing]

89
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,164
l know the perfect punishment
to fit your crime.

90
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,559
Since you have so much trouble
with the band...

91
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,321
perhaps you should make friends with them.

92
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,999
No fucking way.

93
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:20,204
Either you learn to be more considerate
or you will be expelled.

94
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,440
No football.

95
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,516
No parties.

96
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,359
No spring break.

[Echoing] No graduation.

98

-You're going to Band Camp.
-Band Camp!

103

All right, Steve! Valley Girls Gone Wild.

105
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,322
Fuck.

106
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,515
MATT: Told you Steve'd get back to me.

107
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,926
l mean, it was just a postcard...

108
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,123
but it gave me a great idea.

109
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,276
Look...

110
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,403
Steve's shit-head friend, Jim...

111
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,842
he married
this freaking nympho band-geek, Michelle.

112
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,725
And he said
all they do at Band Camp is screw 24l7.

113
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,766
Matt, buddy, you cannot screw band chicks.
There are standards.

114
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:42,363
l'm not talking about screwing them,
scrotum-breath.

115
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,921
l'm talking about videotaping them.

116
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:48,397
People love to see dorks doing
that freaky shit on hidden video.

117
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,162
Bandeez Gone Wild.
Steve's gonna have some competition now...

118
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:54,795
because little bro's
joining the family business.

Colour night vision? l'll take it. Shit.

123
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,645

140
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:42,639

You guys ready?

148
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,480
What the fuck?

149
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,122
Are you a rookie? You look lost.

150
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:48,082
Are you an asshole?
You're hairy, and you smell like shit.

151
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,679
l'll ignore that kind of talk once.

152
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,837
We don't speak that way here.

153
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,205
Rookies are to wear their beanies
at all times. Those are the rules.

154
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,960
And who made you
the mayor of Geek Town?

00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:07,726
l'm Brandon Vandecamp,
senior drum major, Beechwood Academy...

Oh, and who are they, Mr. President?
The First Lady and Vice Pussy?

158
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,606
Suits you well.

159
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:25,278
Golly, jeepers, thanks. Hey, you know,
since l'm an official band geek and all...

160
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,517
can you guess
what my favourite piece of music is?

161
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,962
-l have no idea.
-The Nutcracker.

Holy mother of Mozart.

00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,596
This is bad.

00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
You didn't know Jackie Chan
was in the house, did you boys, huh?

166
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,238
Stop that. Stop that now.

167
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,557
Those knob-slobbers started it.

168
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,161
That's not true, sir.
We simply reminded him to wear his beanie.

169
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,522
And then he viciously assaulted
Brandon's genitals.

170
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:54,885
-That's a lie, you dick-snot.
-Oscar, Jimmy, escort this man to see...

171
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,357
-the Macro.
-The what?

172
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,957
-You're dead.
-Now, gentlemen.

173
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,837
God, Brandon, are you okay?

174
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:06,281
You want to tell me
what the hell you're doing here, Stifler?

175
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,801
lt don't matter, Big O.
He ain't gonna be here long.

176
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,956
-Bitch!
-Get over here.

177
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,163
Macro gonna fuck your ass up, fool.

178
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,715
-What the fuck's a macro?
-The Macro.

179
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:16,923
Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer.

180
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,282
l heard this one time,
this kid went into that office...

181
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,039
a baritone and came out a soprano.

182
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,960
-Clarinet up the ass backwards, yo.
-What?

183
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,999
[Faint screaming]

184
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:32,481
Pussies.

185
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,686
[Screaming on TV]

186
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:44,636
[Slamming]

187
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,126
Oh, l'm sorry.

188
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,277
Frankenstein. Scary stuff.

189
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,796
l am just a Boris Karloff nut.

190
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,000
-l'm the Macro, Mr. Levenstein.
-Holy shit, you're Jim's dad.

191
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,400
He screwed that redheaded nympho chick
at my lake house.

192
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:06,036
-Oh, my, you're not a Stifler?
-Yeah, l'm Steve's brother, Matt.

193
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,877
-There are two Stiflers?
-Yes, sir. Hey, what're you doing here?

194
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:14,801
Oh, well, Jim is now out of the house,
married to Michelle...

195
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,924
that redheaded nympho chick
that you spoke of.

196
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,960
And, being a former
Tall Oaks Counsellor of the Year...

197
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,962
she was hired to be the Macro this summer,
but she got pregnant.

198
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,597
No doubt due to the tendencies
you alluded to earlier.

199
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,599
And l have a great rapport with
young people...

200
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,996
so l just stepped in and volunteered.

201
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:39,477
That cretin is not in our band,
and we are not responsible for his actions.

202
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,206
-Who pissed in your piccolo?
-l'm sensing some hostility here.

203
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,561
-He poisoned my band.
-What?

204
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,525
-l'm the Macro and it's my job to deal with...
-What is he doing here?

205
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:49,883
-Matt Stifler is pure evil just like his brother.
-...conflict.

206
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,400
Thanks, Leesy.

207
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:53,716
[Huffing]

208
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,520
She seems nice.

209
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,846
There are rules, of course.

210
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,565
-You will have to wear a beanie.
-Yeah.

211
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:04,923
Oh, l know. lt's a little silly,
but it's tradition here...

212
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,477
something you're familiar with,
being on the football team, l'm sure...

213
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,957
with your elephant walks and circle jerks
and drinking butt beer.

214
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,277
But here, you just have to wear
a silly little hat and...

215
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,801
-a somewhat stylish Tall Oaks T-shirt.
-Yeah.

216
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,363
So, just go with the flow, Matt...

217
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,756
and you will have loads of fun...

218
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,039
and you'll be making new friends in no time.

219
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:34,520
Hey, Ernie Kaplowitz, tenor sax.

220
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,281
Cool! l'm a rookie here, too.

221
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:42,281
l really wanted to come last year,
but Computer Camp conflicted, and--

222
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:46,406
Oh, yeah, that was here when l arrived.
l think it has your name on it.

223
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:49,800
What is it?

224
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:55,002
Hi, welcome to Casa de Stifler.
l'll be your host, Matt.

225
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,557
Every day here, l'll make it my sincere goal
not to have to kick your ass.

226
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,366
Allow me to show you
to your new accommodations.

227
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,881
When l'm out here, you're in there.

228
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,003
Have a great day, fucko.

229
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,436
l don't....

230
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:13,842
ERNlE: Okay...

231
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,519
l'll just go and put this stuff away for you.

232
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:16,801
All right. Bandee-vision.

233
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:23,560
This is a 1978 Ohio State show...

234
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:24,966
The Wizard Of Oz.

235
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:28,642
The one where the sousaphone player
forgot to dot the l? Oh, hey.

236
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,161
Yeah, right. Freaks.

237
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,442
Never fear, the Stiffmeister's here.

238
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:40,564
Band Camp just got
a whole lot better, ladies.

239
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,155
You're Steve Stifler's younger brother,
aren't you?

240
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,999
-Young and hung.
-Great.

241
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,324
-Could you send him a message for me?
-No problem, senorita.

242
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,439
Well, it looks like Steve gave someone
the old Stifler bang-and-boot.

243
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:03,638
-ls there a problem here?
-No, everything's fine.

244
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:08,724
-Have fun at Band Camp.
-Thank you, l will.

245
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,797
-Later.
-Word.

246
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,960
You need to start showing some respect
around here, Stifler.

247
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,323
You need to show yourself
back to your table, Big Dog.

248
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,159
Out of my way, Yo.

249
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:28,366
Hola, chicas.
Elyse, so good to see you again.

250
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,679
So, what's going on tonight?
We gonna party, get a little crazy?

251
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,235
Who wants to rack up
a few frequent fucker miles?

252
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:37,285
-You know, you are the most--
-Most sexy man ever to come to Band Camp.

253
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,246
-What? Chloe, he is so obnoxious.
-Sexy obnoxious.

254
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:44,285
-Thank you.
-l'm tired of messing around with these...

255
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,198
dorky-ass nice guys...

256
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,477
and sensitive-artist types.

257
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:53,204
-Let's party with a real hombre tonight.
-Hell, yeah. That's me:

258
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,561
-100%% hombre.
-All right, my room, 8:00.

259
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,202
Great first day, campers.
This is your Macro speaking...

260
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,677
and, hey, morale
couldn't have been higher today.

261
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,406
So hop in the sack,
and get a good night's sleep because...

262
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,565
starting tomorrow, we have
many, many exciting activities planned...

263
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:16,242
not the least of which is
the race for the Tall Oaks Cup.

264
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,363
So let the games begin.

265
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:22,435
MATT: Bandeez Gone Wild.
Scene One. Party hombre.

266
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:31,279
lt's called Strip Trivia. We made it up.
lt's a Band Camp tradition.

267
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:35,725
"Fourth and Long," "Sextuplets,"
"Banging Babes," and "Who Blew Me?"

268
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,884
This looks like my kind of game.
Shall we play?

269
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,725
You sit in the middle.
Your game, my seating chart.

270
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,326
Sit a little closer, ladies.

271
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,637
Don't be scared. lt's all right.

272
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,842
Okay...

273
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:51,005
the rules are simple.
You choose a category and a question...

274
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,442
and every time you miss, you strip.

275
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,562
Hell, yeah.

276
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:58,162
-l'll go first. "Who Blew Me?"
-Good.

277
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:05,605
l am a silver Stradivarius trumpet
played by a Pulitzer Prize winner.

278
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:07,881
Who blew me?

279
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,436
-Yeah, like l'd know.
-Sorry.

280
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,046
Lose the shoes, and pick again.

281
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,004
You didn't tell me this shit was about music.

282
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,557
-Well, it is Band Camp, moron.
-Hey, to be fair...

283
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,759
maybe we should just give him a head start.

284
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,805
All right. Yeah.

285
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,639
Okay, all right. All right.

286
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,965
What's wrong with you?
Scared to show off the mosquito bites?

287
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,686
l've matured since the fourth grade, Matt.
Have you?

288
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,679
Oh, l've got 10 pounds of dangling maturity
right here, Leesy.

289
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,600
-Quit calling me that.
-Okay, okay, moving on.

290
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:46,360
-Matt, just pick another question, please.
-All right, screw it. Whatever.

291
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,083
There you go. Suck on that.

292
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,201
-Fourth and Long.
-Sure, no problem.

293
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:00,679
Of Beethoven's major symphonies,
which has the longest fourth movement?

294
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,364
All right, l see where this is going.

295
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:06,041
Fine, you win.

296
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,836
[Grunting]

297
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:11,521
l free ball, ladies.

298
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:16,206
Got to let the big boys breathe.
All right, we play by my rules now.

299
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:19,445
Football questions only.
Prepare to strip, ladies.

300
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,637
-Wait. But first, does anybody want a beer?
-l do.

301
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:28,842
The counsellors have a secret stash
in the fridge across the hall.

302
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,716
-Would you mind?
-Now we're talking about a fucking party.

303
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,525
Stiffy'll be back in a jiffy.

304
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,160
[Disagreeing]

305
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,195
l mean, there's nobody around...

306
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:41,596
and we haven't seen your best side yet.

307
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:42,676
[Laughing]

308
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:50,083
[Whispering] Yes! We got him.

309
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,839
So busted.

310
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,721
Man, big boys, wake up.

311
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,196
Just gotta turn down the A.C. in there, huh?

312
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:07,402
Good night, girls.

313
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:17,001
Sorry, asshole, game's over.

314
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:21,439
Yeah, the big boys
will love the long walk home.

315
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,005
Room check, girls.

316
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:26,476
Oh, shit.

317
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,957
-Ditch his clothes.
-Out the window.

318
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:32,042
All right, who wants a long neck?

319
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:40,319
Nurse Sanders.

320
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,396
-They set me up.
-He attacked us with pepper spray...

321
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:48,081
-and ruined our graduation.
-l went there for a friendly game....

322
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,202
Hold it. Hold it. Kids.

323
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,243
Okay...

324
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,159
where are your clothes?

325
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,126
l have them.

326
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:59,638
-May l ask why?
-Well, they got me naked--

327
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:02,844
-Oh, whatever. He took his own pants off....
-And they stole my clothes.

328
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,566
And l got stuck up there
with Mrs. Doubtfire checking out my....

329
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,365
[Horn blaring]

330
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,364
Let me see if l have this straight.

331
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:17,998
Elyse, you think Matt is an arrogant jock
who wears his penis on his forehead...

332
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,363
just to gain the approval of
his sociopathic brother.

333
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:25,201
And Matt, you think Elyse
is an uptight, geeky prude...

334
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,926
who needs to loosen up and get laid.

335
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,079
Excuse the expression, dear.

dirty-girl panties.

842
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:42,518
lt should be more spontaneous.

843
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:46,641
Stop.

844
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:49,446
Maybe you should hang out
with your friend Matt a little bit more.

845
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,516
Yeah, right.

846
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:54,043
l know he's a dick and everything,
but he's also got one.

847
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:58,240
Make some love music, you know?
And then your notes will just cum to you.

848
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:01,919
-Oh, Matt!
-Stop.

849
00:59:02,127 --> 00:59:03,560
Matt. Matt.

850
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:09,002
Go long, you asshole. Go.

851
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:11,564
Hey, Elyse.

852
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,644
Throw it back. Come on.

853
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:16,806
What you got?

854
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,486
Missed. Sorry.

855
00:59:27,047 --> 00:59:28,685
MATT: Hey, if l have to ring the triangle...

856
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:30,598
-you have to throw the football, all right?
-Okay.

857
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,484
Draw your arm back. There you go.

858
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:36,162
Shoulder to your target. Right.
Okay, now step forward.

859
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:38,556
Come on we're not marching. One foot.

860
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:41,400
-Okay.
-You're fine. Ready? There you go.

861
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:42,966
Draw the ball over your ear...

862
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:46,084
and when you throw it, let it roll
right off your fingers, all right?

863
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:48,316
Okay.

864
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:50,046
Come on, throw it.

865
00:59:55,727 --> 00:59:57,445
See? l taught you something. What?

866
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,916
So every time l throw it,
you're gonna run and go get it?

867
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:01,679
That's generally how it works.

868
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:03,519
Like playing fetch with my dog.

869
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:07,236
-Yeah, except l don't lick my own balls.
-You would if you could.

870
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:08,556
Oh, yeah.

871
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:11,242
Okay, again.

872
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,316
Right here.

873
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,001
ELYSE: Look, that one looks like a bunny.

874
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:19,158
MATT: No, it doesn't.

875
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:22,438
Maybe a bunny with one nut.

876
01:00:22,647 --> 01:00:25,286
-No, that's its tail.
-Whatever you say.

877
01:00:28,527 --> 01:00:31,485
-You think we'll win this thing?
-Hell, yeah, we will.

878
01:00:31,607 --> 01:00:35,725
-lf you write in a bagpipe part.
-Oh, God, l'll never make that mistake again.

879
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:38,719
-What?
-The eighth grade recital.

880
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,082
You made me write in a part for you.

881
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:46,164
You wore your kilt.

882
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,876
Yeah, Steve showed up with his friends.

883
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:52,603
They gave me so much shit for that.

884
01:00:52,927 --> 01:00:55,202
l didn't come out of my room for days.

885
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:58,559
You made it up to him
by stealing all my underwear...

886
01:00:58,647 --> 01:01:00,922
so you could run them up the flagpole.

887
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:03,599
lncluding my training bras.

888
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,081
Okay, since we're having
some big fucking Oprah moment here...

889
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,123
l'm sorry about your underwear.

890
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:12,805
And the diary.

891
01:01:15,447 --> 01:01:17,324
And all that other shit, too.

892
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,036
That's it.

893
01:01:57,567 --> 01:02:00,320
-You started it.
-This is gonna get me that scholarship.

894
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:01,396
What?

895
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:04,047
l've got to go write this down
before l forget.

896
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:05,560
[Elyse humming]

897
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,166
Hey. Hey. Hey.

898
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:10,883
Could we do this again tomorrow night?

899
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:13,720
Yeah, sure. l'll see you here at sunset.

900
01:02:14,207 --> 01:02:15,481
Hey.

901
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:18,762
Should l bring that Picardo thing?

902
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:20,997
Okay, l'll do a solo for you.

903
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:22,556
[Elyse giggling]

904
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,515
[Groaning in pain]

905
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:32,405
-What's up, Ernie?
-Hey.

906
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,558
lt was that fugly nurse again.

907
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:08,799
Oh, my God.

908
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:10,161
Matt Stifler?

909
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:15,358
-Holy shit, look at you.
-Arrianna, what are you doing here?

910
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:18,644
We practise our routine with the band.
What are you doing here?

911
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:21,036
l had to come. The school made me.

912
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:25,243
-Does anybody know about this yet?
-Oh, they do now.

913
01:03:26,247 --> 01:03:29,284
Hey, come on, no pictures.
What're you, the papa-tit-zzy?

914
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:31,039
-Holy shit, this is so hilarious.
-Smile.

915
01:03:31,127 --> 01:03:34,802
Ladies. No time for fraternizing.

916
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:39,680
Get the bags.
Guess l'll see you around, bandee.

917
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:43,920
What a dork.
l'm going to email this to everybody.

918
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:08,040
Girls, that was great. Percussion, take five.

919
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:09,799
Horns, we've got to work on intonation.

920
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,401
The final performance is tomorrow,
you guys.

921
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:14,959
They're so lame.

922
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:18,202
You play the triangle. How cute.

923
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:22,044
No, l don't. Look, l told you...

924
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:23,961
-l had to--
-l gotta go.

925
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:27,244
-l don't socialise with bandees.
-l'm not a fucking bandee.

926
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:31,122
l'm not. Look.
l've just been acting like a geek.

927
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:34,240
l've been playing them
so l could get them on hidden video.

928
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:37,717
l've been secretly videotaping them
doing all this crazy shit.

929
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:41,525
-Really?
-Yeah, l could show you.

930
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,277
Okay, come by after dinner.

931
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,281
l'll leave my pompoms
in the window for you.

932
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,001
-You're late.
-Yeah, no shit. Open the window.

933
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:29,038
Hold on. Be careful with it.

934
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,884
All right, one condition
before l show you the fruits of my labours.

935
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:42,116
What's that?

936
01:05:42,447 --> 01:05:45,166
l want that picture
on that camera phone erased.

937
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,319
Nobody at school hears
about the triangle or the beanie.

938
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:01,921
l don't want anybody
to think l'm a dorky-ass bandee.

939
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:03,759
Fine. Like, now can we get on with it?

940
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:07,157
MATT: As soon as you get rid of that picture
of me on your phone.

941
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:23,686
PATTl: Are you going into town?
LAURlE: Not tonight. l'm too tired.

942
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,281
LAURlE: Besides, they're much hotter here.

943
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:29,165
l know. lt's a great crop this year.

944
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:47,121
-There. Done deal.
-Now can we see the video?

945
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,525
Stiffmeister Productions...

946
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:53,043

its talented new director, Matthew Stifler...

947
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,038

948
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:59,405

Bandeez Gone Wild.

949
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:01,802
Oh, yeah.

950
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:09,562
-Oh, my God.
-That is unbelievable.

951
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,517
-You're kidding me, right?
-That's great.

952
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:37,964
PATTl: Danielle likes Jimmy,
but she's like a foot taller than him.

953
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:39,446
And wait till you hear this.

954
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:41,995
Sheree slept with that big Oscar guy,
the drummer.

955
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:43,520
Said he was amazing.

956
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:47,159
LAURlE: l hooked up with Brandon once.
Some drummer. He has...

957
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,999
no rhythm,
and he can't even bang very long.

958
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:50,885
PATTl: Oh, my God. Are you serious?

959
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:54,960
LAURlE: Yeah, he's a preemie. l'm not talking
about the day he was born, either.

960
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:58,606
Can you get my back?
l think l got a little bit of sun today?

961
01:07:58,687 --> 01:07:59,676
Sure.

962
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:02,685
Get this. He has one ball.

963
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:05,477
PATTl: No way.
LAURlE: One ball.

964
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:09,400
Yeah, that why he carries that big stick
around everywhere.

965
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:11,443
lt's got his other ball on top.

966
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:16,245
Shit, shit, oh, shit.

967
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:17,516
[Screaming]

968
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,600
What is that thing?

969
01:08:27,647 --> 01:08:28,636
[Screaming]

970
01:08:34,087 --> 01:08:35,361
Let's kill it.

971
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:37,876
-Where'd he go?
-There he is.

972
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:39,036
Look out.

973
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,158
This is going into the lake.

974
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:22,556
No one's gonna know
about your little video.

975
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:25,161
'Cause the shit you got us doing on tape....

976
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:33,522
So we got a contest to win tomorrow.
And l don't want to see you.

977
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:35,002
Understand?

978
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:42,240

How about some lpecac, Vande-cooch?

990
01:10:53,447 --> 01:10:57,156
This herbal fucking extract will help you
Beechwood fief play in tune, huh?

991
01:10:58,647 --> 01:10:59,636
Shit.

992
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,036
l told you
l don't want to see you anymore, Stifler.

993
01:11:11,127 --> 01:11:13,197
Some day, you'll thank me, asshole.

994
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,401
-Orange?
-Again?

995
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:22,883
-Damn.
-That orange shit is janky.

996
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:24,798

997

OSCAR: l don't care how many times they
won. They're not getting the grape today.

Okay, everybody.

lt's no surprise Beechwood is good.

But this year is different.
This year, we can beat them.

01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:11,244
Brandon Vandecamp.

1011
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:12,476
Beat that.

1012
01:13:15,327 --> 01:13:18,717
NELSON: East Great Falls,
you may enter the field for competition.

1013
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,364
ELYSE: Band 10 hut. One, two, ready.
MATT: Shit.

1014
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,960
Leesy, wait, no.

1015
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:42,003
No. Wait.

1016
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,117
You know, l'm so sorry.
l don't know what happened.

1017
01:13:54,207 --> 01:13:56,277
Not my shoes. Here we go.

1018
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:01,962
Stifler!

1019
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,237
MACRO: You know, you're like
your brother, Steve.

1020
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:24,797
And l don't think those are the shoes
you should be so eager to fill.

1021
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,845
You know, the people
Steve thought were his friends...

1022
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,481
-really didn't like him very much.
-What?

1023
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,966
But l think you're different.

1024
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:36,120
l think people want to like you, Matt.
You just make it really hard.

1025
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:53,596
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
When you're a loser.

1026
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:04,005
Mr. Levenstein reports
that there were a few incidents...

1027
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,315
at camp.

1028
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:08,196
But he also says that...

1029
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:11,922
you bonded with the band briefly.

1030
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:19,880
When school starts,
you're going to be on a very short leash.

1031
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:23,682
Remember, the Shermanator sees it all.

1032
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:26,235
Be gone.

1033
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,083
Did everybody hate my brother?

1034
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:47,437
Stardate: August 21, 2005.

1035
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:50,282
Some progress made with Stiffy Junior.

1036
01:15:50,687 --> 01:15:53,042
Behaviour modification evident.

1037
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:56,119
Will continue to monitor.

1038
01:15:56,727 --> 01:15:58,877
Shermanator out.

1039
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,922
A little "Double-D Sheree" action.

1040
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,124
Little bit of Dr. Robot.

1041
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,320
Crazy fucker.

1042
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:28,001
Hey, Stifler, where's your instrument?

1043
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:29,236
Dude, you're in the wrong uniform.

1044
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:32,000
Screw them, dude. They're gonna freak out
when they see the video.

1045
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:34,203
Look, we thought that if we had
an advance screening...

1046
01:17:34,287 --> 01:17:36,278
then everyone would see
that you're not really a dork.

1047
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:38,642
l can't. lt's gone.

1048
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:42,684
-What?
-The video, man, l deleted it.

1049
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:44,636
Why?

1050
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:48,087
Guess little bro's quitting
the family business.

1051
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,600
Are you kidding me?

1052
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:54,838
He went fucking bandee on us.

1053
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,196
[Bell ringing]

1054
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:12,046
Hey, what's up, guys?

1055
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:14,684
You a dead man, motherfucker.

1056
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:17,358
-You, too, little man.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1057
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:21,396
Dude, the purple puke was an accident.
Somebody switched the coolers.

1058
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:28,043
Hey, that orange shit is janky, yo.

1059
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:33,357
Chloe, we never saw Elyse,
you know, naked.

1060
01:18:34,087 --> 01:18:35,964
Matt turned off the computer.

1061
01:18:36,807 --> 01:18:39,275
So we're just supposed to forgive him now?

1062
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:42,921
-He's still an asshole.
-You're right.

1063
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,161
l am an asshole.

1064
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,717
l can't take back spying on you...

1065
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,082
and l can't win that Bandee Cup thing.

1066
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:52,960
But l can help someone
get what she deserves.

1067
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:55,837
l'm not asking you to forgive me.

1068
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:58,515
Just help me help Elyse.

1069
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:11,362
-l got the number.
-Go ahead.

1070
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:14,837
555-0171 .

1071
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:19,406
He shouldn't have been dumping lpecac
in anyone's cooler.

1072
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:21,239
We could've won on our own.

1073
01:19:23,447 --> 01:19:27,565
l don't even care that he saw me on camera.
Well, l mean l do, but....

1074
01:19:28,607 --> 01:19:30,757
Honey, this just came for you.

1075
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:35,766
lt's from Robards.

1076
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,395
What's it say?

1077
01:19:40,087 --> 01:19:42,555
Dr. Choi wants to meet with me?

1078
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:01,598
-Okay.
-Okay.

1079
01:20:01,807 --> 01:20:03,638
-Okay.
-Okay.

1080
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:06,282
Bye.

1081
01:20:21,847 --> 01:20:24,156
Hi. Elyse Houston.

1082
01:20:25,327 --> 01:20:27,966
l have an appointment with Dr. Choi.

1083
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:32,443
-You're not in the book.
-No, there must be some mistake. See...

1084
01:20:34,327 --> 01:20:35,646
l have a letter.

1085
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:42,724
This letter is, well....

1086
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:44,636
lt's a fake.

1087
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:47,925
-This is not Dr. Choi's signature.
-What?

1088
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:01,676
Stifler.

1089
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,477
You son of a bitch.

1090
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:13,285
What? lt wasn't enough
for you to humiliate me at Band Camp?

1091
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:15,927
Now you have to set me up here?

1092
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:37,165
What's going on here?

1093
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:39,966
This is my band.

1094
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:42,204
And that's her music.

1095
01:22:38,127 --> 01:22:39,116
Well...

1096
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:43,236
l've certainly seen some interesting attempts
to gain admission...

1097
01:22:43,887 --> 01:22:45,445
but this is a first.

1098
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:50,966
Excellent audition, Miss. Houston.
Let's go discuss that scholarship.

1099
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,800
l thought Brandon won.

1100
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:57,084
No, Mr. Vandecamp
was disqualified for plagiarism.

1101
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:58,236
BOY: All right.

1102
01:23:00,367 --> 01:23:02,323
JlMMY: That's what l'm talking about, yo.

1103
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:08,602
Oh, my God, you guys, that was amazing.

1104
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:13,046
-Thank you so much.
-Thank him. lt was his idea.

1105
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:14,116
Word.

1106
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:20,277
-You planned all this?
-With some friends.

1107
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:24,315
Come here.

1108
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:31,042
Oh, l believe this is yours.

1109
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:33,522
You know...

1110
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:38,086
Picardo is a brand of piccolo.

1111
01:23:39,007 --> 01:23:41,237
You really are an asshole sometimes...

1112
01:23:41,647 --> 01:23:42,636
Stiffy.

1113
01:26:55,727 --> 01:26:57,445
JlMMY: Man, change the channel, yo.

1114
01:26:57,647 --> 01:27:00,559
Hook a brother up with some mad beats.

1115
01:27:00,807 --> 01:27:02,399
OSCAR: Will you cut that out?

1116
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:04,923
Your name is James Hi Ping Chong.

1117
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:06,639
Your dad owns a Chinese restaurant.

1118
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,241
You live in the suburbs.
You ain't never gonna be a gangsta.

1119
01:27:09,847 --> 01:27:10,836
Damn!

1120
01:27:13,407 --> 01:27:14,476
JlMMY: That's cold, dawg.
