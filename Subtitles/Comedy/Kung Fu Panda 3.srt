1
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,260
We'll have two justice platters , please

2
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,300
- umm...three
- And a few tofu bun

3
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,911
Oh , the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that ?

4
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,121
She wants it on the side

5
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,350
On the side
-On the side

6
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,730
dragon you can do it.

7
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,770
Go dragon warrior
- Defend the valley

8
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,270
Go dragon warrior
- Yeah defend the valley

9
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,580
You guys aren't doing the dramatic pose , are you ?

10
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,180
Do we have to strike the pose every time we land ?

11
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,470
You guys never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance.

12
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,990
I've heard about some masters who could win
a fight just by throwing open a door

13
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,156
Dramatic entrance ?

14
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,074
Master Shifu

15
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,130
The dragon warrior is great.

16
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,760
Really ? I was just making....yeah I mean yeah I am.

17
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,080
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

18
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,060
Hence , the dramatic entrance

19
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,070
Whoa , nice dramatic entrance

20
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,800
-What's the occasion ?
-Today will be my final class

21
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,270
Your final...? wait
I didn't even know you were sick

22
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,400
Although you have been looking a little....
-I'm not sick.

23
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,860
healthy. A little healthy.
A lot actually

24
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,340
My final class because from now on...

25
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,050
your training will be in the
hands of the dragon warrior

26
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,780
What ?

27
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,680
Me ? teach ?I mean why not Tigress ?
She's always telling everyone what to do.

28
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,710
Be quiet Po.
-See what I mean ?

29
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,980
Tigress is not the dragon warrior.
You are.

30
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,400
Come on they're the five.
What can I teach them ?

31
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,430
There is always something more to learn.
Even for a master.

32
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,460
For instance , let me show you another move.

33
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,430
The dramatic exit.

34
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,310
What's that ?

35
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,940
Are you kidding me ? that....what ?

36
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,040
-Where'd he go ?
-Master

37
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,380
He's gone guys. It's cool.
- We are await your instruction master.

38
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,720
All you have to lose is our respect.

39
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,260
Seriously how bad could it be ?

40
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,381
Leave me....

41
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,470
OK OK let's switch it up.
Monkey, immovable mountain stance.

42
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,179
Yes Master.

43
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,700
I mean.... Tigress tornado back flip
- Yes, master

44
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,780
Oh no fire.
-Fire

45
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,140
Sorry, my fault
Crane go high, I mean low

46
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,406
Oh my claw thingy
- Viper and tigress , to... like a totem pole

47
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,533
Poison , Technique.

48
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,600
You two, to...
sworming insect bite with yellow tail , yellow jacket...

49
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,850
Spicy....tuna

50
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,400
Good job, Po.

51
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,020
Did you at least learn a little something ?
- Yes , that you can't teach.

52
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,910
And tigress is flammable  turns out.

53
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,100
That was a complete disaster.

54
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,370
I'm glad we're not Po right now.
-What a loser

55
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,950
What was Shifu thinking ?
- What was Oogway thinking ?

56
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,750
I think he heard us.
- I didn't hear anything.

57
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
He said you're a loser

58
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,700
Sorry Oogway.

59
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,610
Would you stop doing that ?
- How was your fisrt day teaching ?

60
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,910
Humiliating.
- I heard.

61
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,630
Who told you ? Did Tigress tell you ?

62
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,560
I heard from Monkey and Crane and Mantis and
your dad and Mrs. Chau from the gift shop

63
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,280
And those ducks who just passed
and Tigress told me.

64
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,590
Yeah, well did she also tell you that it'll never
happen again cause I'm done ?

65
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,730
Teaching , or being humiliated ?

66
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,760
Both. I don't know why you ever thought
I could teach that class ?

67
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,270
Oh I knew you couldn't.
- What ?

68
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,660
You set me up to fail ? Why ?

69
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,560
If you only do what you can do
you'll never be more than you are now.

70
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,510
I don't wanna be more
I like who I am.

71
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,280
You don't even know who you are.

72
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,600
What do you....? Of course I do
I'm the dragon warrior.

73
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,440
And what exactly does that mean dragon warrior ?

74
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,650
It means...you know... just going around
and punching and kicking

75
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,180
Defending the valley and stuff.

76
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,060
Punching and kicking ?

77
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,090
You think that is what the great master Oogway saw for you ?

78
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,790
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled so
you can spend your days...

79
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,060
Kicking butt ?
And running through town high-fiving bunnies ?

80
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,007
Yes
-No

81
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,680
Oogway saw greatness in you Po
against my better judgement.

82
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,540
More than you can see in yourself.

83
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,090
Incredible power awaits you

84
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,260
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

85
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,140
What was that ?
-That was chi .

86
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,840
What's chi ?

87
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,490
The energy that flows through all living things.

88
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,350
So you're saying if I , so you're saying if I teach, I'll
be able to do cool stuff like that ?

89
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,630
No I'm saying if you teach ,I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

90
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,240
Mastery of chi requires mastery of self

91
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,110
Oogway sat alone in a cave for thirty years asking
one question....

92
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,870
Who am I ?

93
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,750
Who am I ?

94
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt .

95
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,660
So now I have to sit alone in a cave for thirty years ?

96
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,670
Eventually.
After you master teaching

97
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,800
Teaching ?
There's no way I'm ever gonna
be like you.

98
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,050
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

99
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,850
I'm trying to turn you into you.

100
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,390
Turn me into me ?
Wait a second. That makes no....(sense)

101
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,610
Almost there shifu , just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

102
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,280
Sorry, no offense master Oogway
I just....

103
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,730
I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.

104
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:44,847
What is this place ?
-Aaah...my brother's farm

105
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,487
If I stepped on you, would you die ?

106
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,287
Yes.

107
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,447
The mortal realm.

108
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:59,487
You hear that Oogway ?
I'm back.

109
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:03,747
Kai has returned.

110
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:07,497
Who ?
- Kai. General Kai.

111
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,957
Supreme warlord of all China

112
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:15,837
I don't know.
- The jade slayer , master of pain

113
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,027
You may know me as the beast of vengeance

114
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,077
Maker of widows ?

115
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,497
OK I used to work with Oogway.

116
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:29,927
Oh master Oogway, he was a great warrior.
We've heard of master oogway...Wise and...

117
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:32,497
OK.... Silence.

118
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:42,927
Find Oogway's students
and bring them to me.

119
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,517
By the time I am done with them Oogway...

120
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:57,177
There will be no one left who will even remember your name.

121
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:01,137
Kai is coming.

122
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,457
I am ready...

123
00:14:06,537 --> 00:14:08,637
to teach you a lesson.
-Teach me ?

124
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,977
Oh no he's the dragon teacher
- Yeah he's so handsome.

125
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:14,007
Thank you for the compliment.

126
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,277
No, please don't teach me to death

127
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,367
Po ?

128
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,147
Oh hey dad
What's up ?

129
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:27,507
I like just ....stopping by for a little soak.

130
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:33,407
OK , What's wrong ?
-Nothing

131
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,077
Nothing ? I come home and find you taking a
bath with your dolls.

132
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,237
Action figures.
-And instead of adding bath-salt to the water...

133
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:43,647
You just added szechuan peppercorns.
-Szechuan what ?

134
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,257
My tenders.

135
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:53,687
OK yes, something's wrong
- There there son , you tell your daddy all about it

136
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,277
Lift your arm

137
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,387
Shifu says I don't know what it means to be the dragon warrior

138
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,437
And now I have to be a teacher.

139
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:04,417
I thought I finally knew who I was. If I'm not the dragon Warrior, then who am I?

140
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,857
A teacher ? Teaching kung fu ?

141
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,177
That's a promotion. Take the job, son

142
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:16,237
And someday, when you're in charge of the whole
Jade palace, I can sell noodles in the lobby

143
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:21,077
Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?
Get out. Get out. Go, go, go.

144
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:25,107
Franchise expansion awaits us
-What about the dragon warrior look alike contest ?

145
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:28,017
Mrs. Chau always wins that.
-Skadoosh

146
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:31,417
And the dragon warrior dumpling eating contest ?

147
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:35,387
I have to defend my title
-No one's gonna beat your dumpling eating record.

148
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:38,007
Someone's about to beat your dumpling eating record.

149
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,747
Go. Go. Go.

150
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:44,037
Who's eating my dumplings ?
-And who's paying for them ?

151
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:47,237
101, 102

152
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:58,037
Li : 103.

153
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,447
Is that a new record ?

154
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,397
Who are you ?

155
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,397
I'm Li Shan
-What ?

156
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,957
I'm Li shan.

157
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,447
I'm looking for my son.

158
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:26,217
You lost your son ?
- Yes, many years ago.

159
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:30,267
I lost my father
- Very sorry

160
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,187
Thank you.

161
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:39,017
Well , good luck to you.
- You too.

162
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:41,277
I hope you find your son.

163
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:44,697
And I hope you find your father

164
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:58,617
Son ? Oh my gosh, it is you.

165
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:02,197
Well don't just stand there
give your old man a hug.

166
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,847
I can't believe you're alive.

167
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:15,197
I thought I'd lost you forever
little Lotus

168
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:21,447
Oh, OK. This is very embarrassing, but I think you've got me confused
with a panda named Lotus. My name is Po.

169
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,707
Oh right, you wouldn't... OK

170
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,127
See , the little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.

171
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,607
Really ?
-Really.

172
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:34,187
I can't believe it. After all these years and you're
really here ? This is amazing.

173
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:37,387
Oh dad. Come say hi to...

174
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:42,377
I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.
-I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li

175
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,837
You...come here

176
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:50,957
Thank you, thank you for taking
such good care of my son.

177
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:58,027
Your son ?Now hold on just a minute.
How do we know this stranger is even related to you ?

178
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:02,097
Look at that.
Our bellies could be brothers.

179
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:05,837
Hey son, let me teach you how to belly gong.
All right, belly gong

180
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,747
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

181
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,277
I can't believe we're taking a picture together.

182
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:23,167
But I still don't understand.
I thought Po was the only panda left.

183
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:26,777
No , there's a whole bunch of us.
- Where ?

184
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:31,357
Here, a secret panda village in the mountains
- A secret panda....

185
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:37,627
But how did you know where I was ?
-I received a message that led me here.

186
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,827
How could you receive a message if no one could find you ?

187
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:44,117
Sounds suspicious to me.

188
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:47,357
No, wait wait. It was a message from the universe

189
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,247
Rats.

190
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,437
Now what's all this about a dragon warrior ?

191
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:56,497
How'd you know I was the dragon warrior ?
Did the universe tell you that, too ?

192
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:01,957
No, the poster did and the gift shop
I bought a tiny cup.

193
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,507
Oh right, of course...

194
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:09,217
You gotta... you have no idea there's so much to show you.
You're gonna be so awesomely proud.

195
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:10,977
Come on, come on.

196
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,217
I'm already awesomely proud.

197
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,647
Couple more steps.
-Oh

198
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,167
Feeling the burn.

199
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:26,517
Do you have panda asthma, too ?
Does that run in the family ?

200
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:29,357
Dad, you're gonna love this

201
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:31,257
It's like the coolest thing ever.

202
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:35,047
This is the hall of heroes

203
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:39,167
Home of the most priceless kung fu artifacts
in all of China.

204
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,887
This place is ....
-Awesome ?You were going to say awesome, right ?

205
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,057
Because it totally is.
-Totally

206
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:49,377
But be super careful, everything is very fragile here.
Like the Urn of Whispering warriors.

207
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,087
Someone broke that once.

208
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,817
Who ?
- Some idiot

209
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:59,286
This is master flying Rhino's battle armor.
-I wonder if I could fit in that

210
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,076
Get out of my head, dad.
I've wondered the same thing.

211
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,746
If I could fit in it ?
-If you could? No, if I could fit in it.

212
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,846
Dad, check it out.

213
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,246
Master Ram's crossbow
The infinite gates smasher.

214
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:13,356
Dad, look at this. The battle helmets of
master Rat's army. They're so tiny.

215
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:17,046
Master Dolphin's water proof armor.
This is my favorite.

216
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:21,066
Check it out. It's the legendary battle rickshaw of emperor Hawk

217
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,566
Sweet ride.

218
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:29,726
Dad, what are you doing ?We're not supposed to touch anything
-Oh sorry sorry. Should I put it back ?

219
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:33,886
Yeah you probably should.
You look so cool, though.

220
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,586
How does it feel? Do the hinges hinge ?
Does it smell like rhino ?

221
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,936
Does it feel like you're impenetrable ?
Does it feel like you can take on a thousand warriors ?

222
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:44,916
And emerge unscathed ?

223
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:48,136
Yes, it's pretty cool.

224
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:52,436
Wonder what this does ?
I should pull it.

225
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,576
I think I just peed a little.

226
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:08,966
Anything else we should try in here, son ?

227
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:16,366
Charge

228
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,396
Faster, faster, faster

229
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:23,356
Thumb war
- Reinforcements

230
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,086
This is so much fun

231
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:34,556
Here we go.
-Awesome

232
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:37,916
There, there
-I'm fine I'm fine

233
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,536
There you go

234
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:41,786
Dolphin style attack

235
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,456
You got me
-Dolphin style retreat

236
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,636
Go long son.

237
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,096
I wasn't ready

238
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,426
Coming back at you.
-I got it.

239
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,426
Throw high
- Yeah, C'mon.

240
00:21:57,186 --> 00:22:00,916
I'm coming for you.
- Bring it on master Rhino

241
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,156
Here I come

242
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:17,936
I'm gonna get you.

243
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:23,486
Who's gonna get you ?

244
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:29,326
Master Rhino.
-Why, what's wrong ?

245
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:42,036
Guys guys, you're never gonna guess who just showed up.
Not in a million years.

246
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,616
You can't.... you just try
-Your father

247
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:49,146
Wow, how did you just guess that ?
Oh, wait a second. Yeah of course. We look exactly the same.

248
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:54,576
Say hi to my friends, Mantis
Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper

249
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,096
Oh Viper, was it ?
- Monkey, sir.

250
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,886
They're kind of my best friends.

251
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:01,166
And this... this is master Shifu.
Legend

252
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,696
It is an honor to meet you, master Panda.

253
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:09,626
Perhaps your father would care to join us in the
training hall? Your son will be teaching the class

254
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:16,196
I'm sure he's tired. I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired. I'm gonna show him the chrysanthemums suite.

255
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:19,716
What ?Tired ?No, I'm fine.
I would love to watch you teach.

256
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,266
Trust me. It would be more fun to watch me

257
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:22,606
Fight

258
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:25,776
What is that ?
-The valley is under attack.

259
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,406
Son ? Under attack ?
-This is perfect

260
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:32,596
Now you can see what being the dragon
warrior is all about.

261
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:33,966
Follow me.

262
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:44,036
Enemies of justice.
Prepare for.... whoa

263
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,666
Are you kidding me ?

264
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,646
What's the deal with the green guys ?

265
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,546
Some kind of jade zombies.
-Jade zombies ?

266
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,326
Jombies, Jinx

267
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:07,276
Lotus be careful
- It's OK dad. I do this every....

268
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:12,986
Whoa. I recognize this guys.
The master Badger twins.

269
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,756
With their crushing double gong
technique

270
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,366
Yeah that's the one.
That guys is.... no

271
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,446
Master Porcupine.

272
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,566
I thought he died hundred hundred years ago

273
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:28,506
These guys are legends.

274
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,616
Get a quick sketch of us.

275
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:39,386
Did you get it ? Did you get it ?

276
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:42,336
Aw, I blinked. Can we get another one ?

277
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:49,486
I'm being choked by master Porcupine.
This is so cool.

278
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:53,386
Look. It's you.
-Po, focus.

279
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:57,826
Message from universe ?
I'll give you one message from the universe...

280
00:24:57,906 --> 00:24:59,716
Stay away from my son.

281
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,516
Sorry dad. I'll clean it up later.
-Whoa, whoa, not my good pan. Take this one.

282
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,586
Lotus, watch out.

283
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,646
Dad, check out my dumplings of doom.

284
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:28,496
Gotcha.

285
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:34,296
I see you.

286
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:37,066
Your chi will soon be mine.

287
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,766
Is he talking to me?
-Which one ? They're all talking.

288
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,986
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

289
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,386
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

290
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:47,586
OK but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first otherwise
it won't be scary, it'll be just stupid.

291
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,176
It's not them talking. Idiots.

292
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:52,576
It's me talking through them, Kai.

293
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,296
Who ?
-OK OK, enough.

294
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,416
Did you see that? Did you see ?
- Whoa, what just happened ?

295
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:07,296
The green smoke just poof....and then poof
Shifu, what wast that ?

296
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:10,256
Kai? Kai? Kai

297
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:12,806
Nope. Never heard of him.

298
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:17,926
Kai, where is it ? There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

299
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,266
Yes

300
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:21,726
Behold.

301
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:26,146
All the answers will be found within.

302
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,726
What ? It's blank ?

303
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,566
Are you kidding me ?
Not again.

304
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:39,446
Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry
Oh OK, here we go.

305
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,836
It is written in Oogway's hand.

306
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:47,226
Long ago, I had a brother.
-Oogway had a brother ?

307
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,186
In arms. In arms, sorry.

308
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:52,866
He said brother in arms.
-Can you just unroll it all at once ?

309
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:58,406
I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army.

310
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:03,106
And fighting by my side was Kai.

311
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:06,206
My closest friend.

312
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:13,586
One day we were ambushed.
I was badly wounded.

313
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:18,766
My friend carried me for days
looking for help.

314
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:23,496
Until we came to a secret village, high in the mountains.

315
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,646
An ancient place of healing.

316
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:30,346
A village of pandas.

317
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:33,506
Pandas ?
-Yes, pandas.

318
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:38,306
Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.

319
00:27:41,196 --> 00:27:45,016
They taught me how to give chi.

320
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:53,786
But Kai wanted the power all to himself.

321
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:59,296
He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.

322
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:05,316
I had to stop him.

323
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,696
Our battle shook the Earth.

324
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:17,936
Until, finally, I banished Kai to
the spirit realm.

325
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,846
Should he ever return to the mortal realm

326
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:24,966
he can only be stopped by a true master of chi.

327
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:28,076
True master of chi ?
Like you.

328
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:30,236
Me ? I can barely make a flower bloom.

329
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:32,806
I'd need at least thirty more years, and a cave.

330
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:38,296
Viper: We need a chi master.
Shifu: He will continue stealing the chi of masters until he has consumed it all.

331
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,516
Viper: We have to make a way to stop him.

332
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:43,606
Crane: Oh get more more powerful with every master he defeats.
Tigress: There is no choice. We fight.

333
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,856
I can teach you, son.

334
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:52,286
You can do this?
-Of course, I'm a panda.

335
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:55,596
That must be why the universe
sent you here.

336
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,576
OK, so what do I have to do ?

337
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,596
You have to come home with me.

338
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:03,466
To the secret village ?
-Yes, son.

339
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:07,346
You must rediscover what it is to be a panda.

340
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:11,096
You have to learn how to live like a panda.
Sleep like a panda.

341
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:13,686
Eat like a panda.

342
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:18,356
Those 103 dumplings ?
Hmm... I was just warming up.

343
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:21,866
I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.

344
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:26,556
You can't take Po away from me. No, no
I want a second opinion.

345
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:29,416
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

346
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,476
I think he should go.
-Fine. A third opinion.

347
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:37,566
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?
-Dad you heard what Shifu said Oogway said.

348
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:40,416
This guy can only be stopped by a master of chi.

349
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:44,106
And I can only master chi by knowing
who I really am.

350
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,996
Well, I'm a panda.

351
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,366
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

352
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:03,766
Do you really think Po can master chi in time ?
-Doesn't matter what I think.

353
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,866
It only matters what the universe think.
- So, that's a No ?

354
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:11,756
Master, what are we going to do ?
-You are going to find out where Kai is.

355
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:15,246
Follow the trail of those jade creatures
but do not engage

356
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:18,856
For with every foe he faces
Kai becomes stronger.

357
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:23,096
Why me? Is it because I asked.
- No, it is because you can fly.

358
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:26,516
Go.
- Should be kept your beak shut.

359
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:29,346
And take Mantis.
- What? Oh man, is it because I ...?

360
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,166
Yes

361
00:30:57,236 --> 00:31:01,636
Lunch break ?
-You don't need to ask me twice.

362
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:03,915
Dad?
-Yes.

363
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:06,145
Dad?
- Yes.

364
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:10,335
What are you doing here?
-What am I doing ? Getting a backache.

365
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:12,405
Did you have to step on every rock ?

366
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:15,915
No, I mean why are you here ?
-What was I supposed to do, huh ?

367
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,175
What if the pandas don't have food you like ?

368
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:21,895
You're never gonna be able to save the world
on an empty stomach.

369
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,555
I consider my presence mission critical.

370
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:28,915
Oh yes about that. We can't share
the location of the village with others.

371
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:33,315
So...
-Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh ?

372
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:37,765
I raised Po for twenty years before
I finally told him he was adopted.

373
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,705
Seriously ?
-Yeah.

374
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:43,245
OK, I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.

375
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:47,665
You can fly ?
-I'm a bird, Po.

376
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,345
We're here.

377
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:12,765
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

378
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:16,895
And my son hates stairs.
So let's go home.

379
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,465
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

380
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:22,135
I've waited my whole life to hear those words.

381
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,835
Rats.

382
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:37,455
Whoa

383
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,915
This is the secret panda village ?
No wonder you keep it a secret.

384
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,975
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

385
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:06,225
Now you can whoa.
- Whoa.

386
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,745
Li ?
Everyone, Li is back.

387
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:45,835
They're both back.
-He found his son.

388
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:47,005
He made it.
-They're back.

389
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,705
Li ?
-He found his son.

390
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:50,525
Everyone, Li is back.

391
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,675
Hang on, we're coming.

392
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,095
He made it.

393
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:57,005
Why are we running?

394
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:02,725
He made it.
-Li shan is back.

395
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:17,435
Everyone, everyone gather around.
This is my son.

396
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:21,305
Triplets.
-Hi, I'm Ku Ku

397
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:24,305
I'm Meng Meng
-I'm Shuai Shuai, he smells like cookies.

398
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:28,845
He's so handsome. Just like his father.
-Thank you.

399
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:32,735
Son, these are your cousins.
Dim and Sum.

400
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:35,195
I have cousins.
-Welcome.

401
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:38,445
Whoa, buns on a string.
-We call it a snacklace.

402
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:39,275
That's right.

403
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,775
We'll make you another one.

404
00:34:43,035 --> 00:34:44,935
It's you.

405
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:49,475
Oh, that's nice to see you. Hi
-I don't know who you are.

406
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:53,055
Oh, stripy baby. So beautiful.

407
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:56,515
Oh, OK, careful with that. That's my action figure.
- Can I keep her ?

408
00:34:56,515 --> 00:35:02,905
No....problem. Of course, yeah that's why I brought her.
Take good care of her.

409
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:05,455
Yes, stripy baby.

410
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:09,467
You look just like me
but a baby.

411
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:18,397
You're like me but old.
You're like me but fatter.

412
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:21,987
You're like me but.....

413
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,247
with a hat.

414
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:28,177
You all look like me.

415
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:32,097
Let's feast in my son's honor.

416
00:35:34,387 --> 00:35:38,297
What the.....?
- Pandas don't walk. We roll.

417
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:45,497
How you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous ?

418
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,547
Po, what are you doing ? Po ?

419
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,357
You're right.
That is better than walking.

420
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,717
What kind of panda doesn't know
how to roll ?

421
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,977
Well, I'm kinda new at this whole
being a panda thing.

422
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,957
And what kind of panda are you ?
You have a funny neck.

423
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:21,087
I'm not a panda at all.

424
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:25,177
What's that ?
-My hat , My beak , My wing , My dumplings.

425
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:28,127
No more questions.
Go away, kid.

426
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,627
Here, son, I packed your chopsticks.
- Thanks, dad.

427
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:34,647
What?
-What are those for ?

428
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:36,947
These ? These are chopsticks
They're for picking up dumplings.

429
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:39,267
You mean you only eat one at a time ?

430
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,897
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential.

431
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:05,617
I am Mei Mei.

432
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:09,277
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

433
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:14,827
That's sweet, Po but please try to save all other
compliments until after the performance.

434
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:19,487
Me? No, I didn't say....

435
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,077
Shut it.
After the performance.

436
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:24,657
Has it started yet ?

437
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:31,147
Best ribbon dancer in the world

438
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:34,677
At least that's what she says.
- Look away, look away.

439
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:37,207
No, you can't. Can you ?

440
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:42,607
Dad, why does she keep staring at me like that ?
-Try to keep up.

441
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:47,357
I don't really know how to dance.
-Of course you do.

442
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,997
All pandas dance.

443
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:51,797
I know what you're thinking.
You do ?

444
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:54,247
How can one panda be so beautiful ?

445
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,727
For me ?

446
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,737
Help me, dads.
-Yeah, no. You're on your own.

447
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:06,117
You're doing great, son.

448
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:09,817
Your turn.

449
00:38:25,857 --> 00:38:28,357
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.

450
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,217
I have so much to learn.

451
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:42,177
Wings of surveillance.

452
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,177
Why do you do that ?
-Do what ?

453
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:47,657
Just because you say "Wings of......" before something
it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.

454
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:50,427
It's like me saying, "Antenna of power" or....

455
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:53,067
" Thorax of making sandwiches"

456
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:56,467
Wings of disagreement.
-Whoa, there.

457
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:01,207
Master Bear, master Chicken, Master Croc,
what are you doing out here ?

458
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:05,307
Jade creatures attacked our villages. We've tracked them here.
-Stop.

459
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,697
They must be in there.

460
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,517
Master Shifu strongly advised us.....

461
00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:19,047
not to engage.
- Gotta get in there.

462
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,207
But master Shifu said...
-You're seriously afraid ?

463
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:23,997
Even master Chicken's going in there
and he's a chicken.

464
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:36,007
That's it, I'm going in.
-Mantis, we have orders not to....

465
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,907
They need our help. Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

466
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:40,077
No, wait.

467
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:41,147
Fear the bug.

468
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,257
Alright, you little.....

469
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,157
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming.
- "Antenna of power"

470
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,217
Ah, it didn't work.
-Mantis.

471
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:56,487
Mantis ?

472
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:58,917
Mantis ?

473
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:16,937
Your chi is strong
just like your friend, the bug.

474
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:18,897
Mantis

475
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:32,417
Don't worry, little birdie.
I'll put your chi to good use.

476
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:37,847
Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.

477
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:39,127
No.

478
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:48,837
Wings of...regret.

479
00:40:55,467 --> 00:41:02,167
Oh yeah, first day of panda training.
Alright flower, I'm gonna make you bloom.

480
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,357
Dad, dad .

481
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:08,497
What? What? What is it ?
-I'm ready for my first day of panda training.

482
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:08,827
What ?

483
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:12,187
You know, learn to be a panda,
master chi, save the world.

484
00:41:12,217 --> 00:41:14,547
Pandas sleep till past noon.

485
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:17,747
So lesson number one is
go back to bed.

486
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:19,247
Of course.

487
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,087
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

488
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,547
Did I oversleep ?
-You sure did.

489
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:33,737
Yes

490
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:36,687
Yeah show him kids.
-Can you do this ? Can you do that ?

491
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:38,257
How about this? How about that?

492
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:40,417
Am I doing it? Is this good ?

493
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,837
I got it.

494
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:48,087
Grandma panda, heads up.
-We better roll.

495
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:50,987
Po, lunchtime.

496
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:01,487
You gotta let the hill tell you
where to roll.

497
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:06,657
Rookie mistake.
-Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill.

498
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:10,917
That's beautiful.
-Snack time.

499
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:14,147
Po, you can fly ?
-I'm coming in hot.

500
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:19,057
Get them while they're cold.

501
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:23,147
What are you doing there?
That food is for Po.

502
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:24,727
Throw it in.

503
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:30,297
There, there, that's it.

504
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:32,527
Feeling relaxed ?
-Yeah, really.

505
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:35,637
Just let yourself fall into it.
-Got it.

506
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,717
I'm fine. I just.....

507
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,857
There we go.
Just let it all out.

508
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:45,787
That's my boy.

509
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,347
Get out of there.

510
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,197
My noodles. Leave my noodles alone.

511
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:02,667
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.
-Let me get some of that.

512
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,477
Leave my hat alone.

513
00:43:09,257 --> 00:43:13,657
We love noodles.
- Oh, just like my Po.

514
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:20,977
What are you guys looking at ?

515
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,167
That's how we roll.
Cannonball.

516
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,307
Yeah

517
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:46,627
Mom, look it

518
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:53,497
How was that ?

519
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,037
Whoa

520
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:03,387
Now you try again but don't try so hard.
-OK, OK.

521
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:12,077
Much better.

522
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:21,347
Thanks, dad.
- For what?

523
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:25,437
You know, just for you know,
showing me what it feels like...

524
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:28,087
to be a panda.

525
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:32,087
So when do you think I'll be ready ?
Ready ?

526
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,167
You know, learn how to master chi.

527
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,757
Soon, real soon.

528
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:39,207
Come on.
I wanna show you something else. C'mon

529
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:46,767
Sorry about the mess,
I don't usually get visitors.

530
00:44:57,017 --> 00:45:00,477
Is this my mom ?

531
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:09,017
I had this done on your
one hundredth day.

532
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:13,777
Your mama couldn't hold you still.

533
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:16,887
You nearly eat the paper.

534
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:19,597
It's true.
-What was she like ?

535
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,947
She was the total package.

536
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,297
Smart, beautiful.

537
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:32,367
Tremendous appetite.

538
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,367
She was the love of my life.

539
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:39,627
And then, just when I thought I couldn't get any luckier.

540
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:43,657
Along you came, my little Lotus.

541
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:48,117
I really had it all.

542
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:53,257
Until that one moment...

543
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:59,607
When I ...

544
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:01,077
lost everything.

545
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:45,657
Dad, you don't have to worry about
losing me ever again, OK ?

546
00:46:54,307 --> 00:46:56,887
Let me get some of that.

547
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:07,307
It's from the eastern province.

548
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:13,627
Master Lizard, master Ox, master Eagle,
all of them.

549
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:19,427
In every village from the sea to here.
Every master in china...

550
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:22,317
has vanished.
- Maybe they are all at a party ?

551
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:24,797
Monkey.
-I didn't get invited either.

552
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,917
Kai has taken their chi.

553
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:31,667
We are all that stand between him and the
knowledge Oogway left

554
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,397
in our care.

555
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,817
The villagers, evacuated ?
- Done, master.

556
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:39,287
Crane? Mantis?
- Still nothing.

557
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,777
Wait, it's them.

558
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,974
Kai

559
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:09,974
Nice, very tacky.

560
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:13,374
How dare you set foot on these grounds

561
00:48:13,454 --> 00:48:15,804
Look at your pathetic fools.

562
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:19,844
Groveling at the feet of
Oogway the magnificent.

563
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,604
You are not fit to speak his name.

564
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:24,824
I am not fit, little kitten ?

565
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:32,134
I fought by his side. I loved
him like a brother.

566
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:35,944
And he betrayed me.

567
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:43,794
Well now I will destroy everything
he has created.

568
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:45,964
Go.

569
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:09,454
How's that for a little kitten?

570
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:27,894
I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory.

571
00:49:28,054 --> 00:49:30,844
Why not ?
He destroyed mine.

572
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:34,594
Mantis, it is me, your bestie.

573
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:42,304
Sorry Tigress.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

574
00:49:58,214 --> 00:50:01,264
Shifu.
- Bring them to me.

575
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,214
No, you must warn Po.
- Master please

576
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:27,264
I will show you the true power of chi, brother.

577
00:50:29,074 --> 00:50:30,094
No.

578
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:08,904
Oogway, forgive me.

579
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:14,454
Hmm, what do you say Oogway ?
Do you forgive him ?

580
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,854
You may have destroyed the Jade palace

581
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:20,244
but you will never succeed.

582
00:51:20,654 --> 00:51:24,754
There will always be someone to stop you.

583
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:29,334
Who? The panda?
His chi is strong but

584
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,374
it won't be enough.

585
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:36,284
He will meet the same fate as you
-No.

586
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:39,754
And so will every panda in that village.

587
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:48,564
Yes.

588
00:51:51,854 --> 00:51:54,114
Po, I hope you're ready.

589
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,179
Dance Lotus, dance.

590
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:06,049
He's so handsome.

591
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,789
Hi
-That's a panda hug.

592
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:11,289
Hey

593
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:17,309
Po

594
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:55,069
Tigress ?

595
00:52:58,289 --> 00:52:59,979
Who's she?

596
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,679
Baby stripy baby.
- What are you doing here ?

597
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:10,199
Kai attacked the valley.
He's taken every master in china

598
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:12,999
including Shifu and the others.
It's....it's all gone, Po.

599
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:15,729
Everything, everyone.
- Everyone?

600
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:19,229
Everyone.
-How's my restaurant ?

601
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:23,469
We'll talk later.
- And now he's on his way here.

602
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,389
He's after you, Po.
He's after all pandas.

603
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:30,299
How long do we have ?
-Not long.

604
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:32,589
Please tell me you've mastered chi.

605
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:35,389
Dad, dad.
-Here, take the baby. OK, who belongs to this one?

606
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:37,879
You need to teach me the secret chi technique now.
-No, no.

607
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:41,129
I'm afraid you need more time.
Everyone, go get your things.

608
00:53:41,129 --> 00:53:43,519
Let me hand you that.
- I don't have more time. I need to learn it now.

609
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,009
Sorry, you're not ready.

610
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:47,899
OK, pack everything.
-I am ready.

611
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:50,799
Not quite
-What are you talking about? I've done everything you've asked.

612
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:54,369
I mastered napping, sleeping in hammocks
, hot tubs.

613
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:56,359
I am totally involved with my panda parts

614
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:59,469
Now why won't you show me ?
- Because I don't know it.

615
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,059
You what ?

616
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:05,809
I don't know it, OK?

617
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:08,449
No one does.
Maybe we used to but...

618
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:11,399
But not anymore.
-You lied ?

619
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:13,249
No, I ...

620
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:18,129
Yes.
- Why ?

621
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:23,629
To save your life. I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for youu

622
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,179
What am I supposed to do ?

623
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:29,139
Just let that happen?
- Yes, I'm the dragon warrior.

624
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,699
Facing maniacs, that's my job.

625
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,639
But because of you
I left the valley unprotected.

626
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,649
I left my friends unprotected.

627
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:39,739
And now they're all....they're all....

628
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,519
And you would have been, too.

629
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:47,589
I lost you once.
I am not going to lose you again.

630
00:54:48,649 --> 00:54:50,269
I can't.

631
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,469
You just did.

632
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:10,849
Mom, pick me.

633
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:22,399
Po, I'm so worried for you that I can't
even enjoy being right about everything.

634
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:25,519
Now run, run, run, as fast as
those chubby legs can go.

635
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,729
Run? There's nowhere to run.
-What are you going to do?

636
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:35,029
I'm gonna stay and fight that monster.
-Po, he may be a monster but he's still your father.

637
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,279
Not him, Kai.
-No

638
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:26,699
Hungry?
-No, I..... not really.

639
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,249
Well, maybe just one.

640
00:56:29,959 --> 00:56:34,179
You know, you weren't the only one
who was lying.

641
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:39,499
I didn't really come along because I was worried
Po would go hungry.

642
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:43,209
I was worried about you.
- Worried that I'd go hungry?

643
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:48,129
No, I was worried you'd steal Po from me.
-I'd what ?

644
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,649
I know. That was crazy.

645
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:57,179
But I realized having you in Po's life
doesn't mean less for me.

646
00:56:57,399 --> 00:56:59,379
It means more for Po.

647
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:05,199
Well I'm not in his life.

648
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:09,089
Not any more.
- Your son got mad at you.

649
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,349
Welcome to parenthood.
- You don't understand

650
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:15,699
I lied to him.
He'll never forgive me.

651
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:20,819
I lied to him for twenty years.
He still thinks he came from an egg.

652
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:25,439
Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

653
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:37,009
Look, he's hurt.

654
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,749
He's confused
and he still has to save the world.

655
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:45,379
He needs the both his dads.

656
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,269
This isn't going to work.
- It has to.

657
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,139
You 're not thinking straight.
- I am.

658
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:09,269
You're not.
- I am

659
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:10,749
No
Yes, I am

660
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:14,809
I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.

661
00:58:14,899 --> 00:58:17,379
But he hasn't seen what
I can do.

662
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,349
The Wuxi finger hold?
- That's my best move.

663
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:28,839
I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger, and then
Skadoosh. Back to the spirit realm.

664
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:30,879
He has an army of jade warriors.

665
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:34,439
Everything they see he sees
so there's no sneaking up on him.

666
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,429
You will never get close enough.
- It's gonna work.

667
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:41,949
He can only be stopped by a master of chi.

668
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:46,159
Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the chi chi chi.
Chi this. Chi that. Chi chi chi chi.

669
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:49,949
I'm not a master of chi. OK?
I don't know if I'm the dragon warrior.

670
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,519
I don't even know if I'm a panda.
I don't know who I am.

671
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:59,179
You're right.
There's no way I can stop him and his army.

672
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,489
Unless you had an army of your own.

673
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:12,789
You?
-Not just me.

674
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,319
Us.
-All of us.

675
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:28,959
I finally found my son
after all these years.

676
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:33,419
It's gonna take a lot more than the end of the
world to keep us apart.

677
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:37,439
But you don't even know kung fu.
-Then you will teach us.

678
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:42,289
What? I can't teach you kung fu.
I couldn't even teach Tigress.

679
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:45,479
And she already knows kung fu.

680
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:51,359
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

681
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:55,349
But you gotta believe me.
We can do this.

682
00:59:55,379 --> 01:00:00,219
We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you.

683
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:04,119
What did you just say?
- We can do this?

684
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:04,919
No.

685
01:00:04,919 --> 01:00:07,569
We can learn kung fu?
-After that.

686
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:08,689
We can be just like you?

687
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,049
Yes.
-We can?

688
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:12,049
No, you can't.

689
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:15,789
But you don't have to be.

690
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:18,929
That's what Shifu meant.
I don't have to turn you into me.

691
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,239
I have to turn you into you.
-That doesn't make any sense.

692
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,719
I know.

693
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:28,469
Thanks, dads.
-You're welcome?

694
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:31,019
I'm gonna do something I never thought
I'd be able to do.

695
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,929
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

696
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:39,519
You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best you you can be.

697
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:42,249
So who are you?
What are you good at?

698
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,529
What do you love?
What makes you you?

699
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:50,849
Yes, good.
Good, again.

700
01:00:53,729 --> 01:00:55,729
Good, again.

701
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:57,299
Good, good, good, again.

702
01:00:57,299 --> 01:01:01,449
Huh?
- Stripy baby, stripy baby.

703
01:01:02,299 --> 01:01:04,989
Faster, faster.
Roll those ribbons.

704
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:10,419
Hug that log you, hug that log like it's the
last time you're ever gonna hug it. Goodbye forever.

705
01:01:10,419 --> 01:01:13,639
Higher, and a little more to the
left this time. You can do it.

706
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:18,589
I don't wanna see any of these
hit the ground.

707
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:32,049
Wait, wait, stripy baby.

708
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:35,099
Good, try it with this.

709
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,469
Now try it with these.

710
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:45,449
Good, now try it with these.

711
01:02:19,743 --> 01:02:21,793
They are ready.

712
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:25,563
What?

713
01:02:25,573 --> 01:02:29,063
OK pay attention cause I might gonna
go over this ten more times.

714
01:02:29,463 --> 01:02:32,023
The only entrance to the village is here.

715
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:37,083
The dumpling squadron will take position here
while the cookie squadron will take position here.

716
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:40,513
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

717
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:45,473
Alright OK.
The noodle squadron will...

718
01:02:50,503 --> 01:02:54,763
OK OK, anyway,the important thing to remember is that
this is the spot where...

719
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:01,143
OK, I saw that coming.
If you only remember one thing,

720
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:04,593
it's just distract the jombies until
I get close enough to put the

721
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:07,353
Wuxi finger hold on Kai. Got it?

722
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,533
Pandas on three. One, two, three
panda, you guys...

723
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:13,643
Never mind. I'll teach you that later.

724
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,069
I wish I could have thought
you this, son.

725
01:03:54,229 --> 01:03:57,089
It's OK, dad. I'm....

726
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:04,049
He's here.

727
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:33,139
That's what I call a dramatic entrance.

728
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:40,339
Haha, you must be the dragon warrior.

729
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:43,039
And you must be Kai.

730
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,959
Beast of vengeance, maker of widows.

731
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,049
Yes, finally.

732
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:53,759
Thank you, almost makes me wanna spare your life.
-Oh, you wanna spare me?

733
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:58,129
How about you spare me the chitchat ?
Let's do this.

734
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:02,909
I'm going to take your chi then the chi

Oh, you pudgy little...

739
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:18,529
Round them all up.

740
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:36,109
Oh no, it's true.
You guys have all been turned green.

741
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:38,869
Except for you, Mantis, you were already green.

742
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:43,149
Now ?
- Wait for the signal.

743
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,329

744
01:05:57,129 --> 01:05:58,049

748
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,219
Sorry, Crane.

Spring roll squad
Time for some takeout.

750
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,989
Over here, Mr. jombie.

751
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:39,169
I don't know who you are either.

752
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:40,679
Noodle squad.

753
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:47,399
Get ready to dance with danger.

754
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:51,999
Sweet.

755
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:06,329
Stripy baby

756
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,639
Do it.
- You're mean.

757
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:19,819
Fire.

758
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,679
Fire in the hole.

759
01:07:27,859 --> 01:07:28,969
Yes

760
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,579
All right kids.
You got it guys.

761
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,219
Oh no, master Shifu.

762
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,439
I can't hit Shifu.

763
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,729
I can.
- And so can I.

764
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:48,949
Double dad defense

765
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:50,279
Left, dad
-Right, dad.

766
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,109
Thanks dad.

767
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,349
Back at you then.

768
01:07:52,879 --> 01:07:55,999
We've got this, son.
- Go, dads.

769
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:06,059
We got 'em now.
- Stop, stop, enough.

770
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:16,619
Let's finish this.

771
01:08:17,019 --> 01:08:18,519
That's our boy.

772
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:37,859
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to
the spirit realm. Skadoosh.

773
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:44,469
OK, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time. Skadoosh

774
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:46,989
Skadoosh, skadoosh, skadoosh. What the ?

775
01:08:47,139 --> 01:08:49,229
Hold on, wait. It's working.

776
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:52,969
No, no.

777
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,119
No, it's not. Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

778
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,969
Too bad. It only works on mortals.

779
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:08,039
And I am a spirit warrior.

780
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:09,619
Come

781
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:56,669
Son
-Po

782
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:03,869
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Run, run.

783
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:21,179
So Oogway, this was the one destined
to stop me?

784
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:26,279
I will have his chi
and then all of theirs.

785
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,609
And you...

786
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:50,069
You really thought you can
send me back to the spirit realm ?

787
01:10:55,519 --> 01:10:57,669
You are just a stupid mortal.

788
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:01,809
It only works on mortals.

789
01:11:03,419 --> 01:11:06,139
You're right.
I can't send you there.

790
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:10,239
But I can take you there.
What's that?

791
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:12,479
What ?

792
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:14,469
Po
- Son

793
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:16,439
Skadoosh

794
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:18,249
Son

795
01:11:18,769 --> 01:11:20,179
No

796
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:44,119
What happened?
Where is Po?

797
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,829
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

798
01:11:47,989 --> 01:11:49,509
No.

799
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:53,649
He saved us
but who's saving him?

800
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:02,869
Whoa, the spirit realm.
It worked.

801
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:04,689
Get off me, you...

802
01:12:05,269 --> 01:12:07,669
You brought me back?

803
01:12:08,169 --> 01:12:10,759
Don't blame me. I tried to finish this
in the regular realm.

804
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:13,219
And we'll finish it here.

805
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:49,409
Come on, son.
Fight.

806
01:12:56,759 --> 01:13:00,289
We have to help him.

807
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:03,169
Everyone gather around.
That's it. Come in close.

808
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,739
Come on.
We can do this.

809
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,759
Po, you taught us who we were meant to be.

810
01:13:21,589 --> 01:13:23,409
A father.

811
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,889
A friend.
- A dumpling kicker.

812
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:33,539
A lethal fighting machine.
-A huger.

813
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:37,709
A nunchuck chick.

814
01:13:37,969 --> 01:13:39,689
Stripy baby.

815
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,179
A family

816
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,509
Sweet.

817
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:31,959
Who are you ?
- I've been asking the same question.

818
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:38,639
Am I the son of a panda ?

819
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:42,119
The son of a goose?
A student ?

820
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:43,929
A teacher ?

821
01:14:44,999 --> 01:14:48,029
Turns out, I'm all of them.

822
01:14:57,139 --> 01:15:01,089
I am the dragon warrior.

823
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:03,879
Get it?
See the giant dragon ?

824
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:07,919
Get ready to feel the thunder.

825
01:15:08,049 --> 01:15:10,209
This is awesome.

826
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,129
Belly gong.

827
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,929
Butt slap.

828
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:45,629
Perhaps a bit of lunch
cause I'm starving.

829
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:06,089
Let's do this.

830
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:11,459
Heads up.

831
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:30,569
It took me five hundred years
to take Oogway's chi.

832
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:34,149
I will have yours if it takes me
five hundred more.

833
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,959
Chtity chitty chat chat, chitchat.

834
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:51,249
You want my chi so bad?
Then take it.

835
01:16:58,469 --> 01:17:02,319
Yes, the power is mine.

836
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:10,269
Wait, no. It's too much. That's too much. No

837
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:16,739
No

838
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,549
Where'd he go?

839
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:39,199
We're back.
-Bestie.

840
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,199
I'm still green. It didn't work.

841
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:43,609
Oh wait, that's my normal green.

842
01:17:43,749 --> 01:17:46,549
Stripy baby
- Not a baby, not a baby.

843
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:50,059
What about Po ?

844
01:17:50,059 --> 01:17:52,759
Have you seen Po?
-No, he's not here?

845
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:55,719
Po.....Po

846
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:58,659
Why isn't he back ?

847
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:12,599
Dragon warrior.
-Oogway ?

848
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:17,889
I can't believe it.

849
01:18:17,889 --> 01:18:21,509
Whoa, you're extra shiny.
- As are you.

850
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:25,819
I know, right ? It's like the best cape ever.
When I run with it, then it looks really cool.

851
01:18:25,819 --> 01:18:28,139
It suits you.
You've grown.

852
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:32,209
Yeah, I gotta lay off the panda buffet.
- Grown up.

853
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:37,029
As I hoped you would
when I sent the message to your father.

854
01:18:37,059 --> 01:18:41,439
You sent the universe mail ? Whoa

855
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:44,649
Yes because the universe needed you.

856
01:18:47,379 --> 01:18:51,859
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

857
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:56,449
But how'd you know I could ?
- On the first day we met...

858
01:18:56,489 --> 01:19:00,549
I saw the future of kung fu.

859
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:05,079
And the past

860
01:19:07,019 --> 01:19:10,849
I saw the panda
who could unite them both.

861
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:13,839
That is why I chose you, Po.

862
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:17,729
Both sides of the Yin and Yang.

863
01:19:18,589 --> 01:19:22,019
And my true successor

864
01:19:24,619 --> 01:19:28,889
Me? I can't take that
- Yes, take it.

865
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:31,119
I have a bigger one.

866
01:19:32,249 --> 01:19:36,299
I mean, you're enlightening everything
I'm just....

867
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:40,159
Really?
- Yes.

868
01:19:50,649 --> 01:19:53,019
Now what we do?

869
01:19:53,019 --> 01:19:57,619
Hmm, you tell me.
-No Oogway, don't go.

870
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:00,669
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

871
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:07,039
Oh right.
-It's you who must decide whether to stay or go.

872
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:10,949
Wait, I can go back?
-Who knows ?

873
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:13,629
I've never tried.

874
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:44,019
Po
- You can fly.

875
01:20:49,169 --> 01:20:54,309
Dad, dad, dads.
-Son.

876
01:20:56,259 --> 01:21:00,839
Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again.
- We thought we lost you.

877
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:05,589
No, you saved me.
You all did.

878
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:09,469
Now come on over here.

879
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:11,259
Hugs

880
01:21:14,189 --> 01:21:18,849
Master Shifu.
- The student has truly become the tea....(cher)

881
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:23,889
Wait, where did you get that ?
- Oh this. Oogway gave it to me in the spirit realm.

882
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:28,099
Of course he did.
- I think I mastered chi.

883
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:31,969
Of course you did.

884
01:21:32,979 --> 01:21:34,859
Can you teach me?

885
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,649
Ready

886
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:10,809
Monkey, help me.
- Greeny baby.

887
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:13,009
Get off me.

888
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:20,439
Hello

889
01:22:31,149 --> 01:22:32,359
Skadoosh

890
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:42,099
Panda asthma
