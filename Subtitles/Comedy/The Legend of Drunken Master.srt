1
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,492
Declare all valuables to Customs.

2
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:38,323
ltems undeclared will be...

3
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,988
...confisticated plus a 1000% fine.

4
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,362
Fei-hung, delcare the ginseng to Customs.

5
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:43,558
Dad, we've to pay at least...

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,431
...a duty of 50 yen.

7
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:46,492
Right.

8
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,161
Let's pass by hiding it...

9
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:49,637
...inside our pants.

10
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,436
They won't search him,

11
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,967
taking it for hernia only.

12
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,111
The idea...

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,704
Outrageous, outrageous!

14
00:00:58,782 --> 00:00:59,749
lt won't work.

15
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,807
You've got nothing but lousy ideas.

16
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:03,409
The Northern Army has imposed...

17
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:04,351
...heavy duties.

18
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:04,944
Right.

19
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,919
That's most unfair.

20
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,651
Nothing in this world is fair.

21
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,716
One travelling must avoid as much as possible.

22
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,418
Declare it.

23
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,228
Who's he? Why's he so snobbish?

24
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:23,203
Who's he?

25
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:26,709
Don't you know British Counsul is privileged?

26
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:29,644
You don't pay duties...

27
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,976
...if you become a Counsul.

28
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,003
Exempt from duties?

29
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:32,605
Right.

30
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,117
Watch out!

31
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:48,194
What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:51,689
Get up, get up!

33
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:54,026
What the hell are you up to?

34
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,761
He was knocked down.

35
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:57,970
Sorry.

36
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,170
Why have you given away...

37
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,801
...such a big ginseng?

38
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:02,469
To avoid tax!

39
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,774
l'll get it back in a minutes.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,074
Let me have another fall then.

41
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:05,375
What?

42
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,406
By putting everything in,

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,382
l don't have to pay tax.

44
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:09,851
Coming.

45
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,153
What's wrong with him.

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,314
Epilepsy Attack.

47
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:16,825
Tso, get up!

48
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:18,119
Set him free!

49
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,430
Dad, l'll pay tax in front.

50
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:27,231
Take care.

51
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,767
Don't jostle.

52
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,274
Follow the queue!

53
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:42,348
Catch it, master.

54
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,579
Come quick!

55
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,725
These kids really are OK.

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,395
Put it aside.

57
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,959
A pickpocket!

58
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,432
Stolen my dad's wallet.

59
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,896
Fei-hung.

60
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:08,739
Stay where you are!

61
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,801
Fei-hung, don't chase him!

62
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,040
Come up.

63
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,147
Fei-hung, remember what i've taught you.

64
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,655
You can't win over a local boy.

65
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't chase a desperate thief, understand?

66
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,055
But he stole your money.

67
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,750
Forget it, as there's no loss.

68
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,695
Remember, the important thing in life is...

69
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,222
Forgive while you can.

70
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,027
Remember it.

71
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:32,396
l forgot.

72
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:55,117
Checkmate!

73
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,157
Again.

74
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,355
A man shouldn't renege.

75
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:02,130
How should l move now?

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,759
Think, think it over.

77
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,202
Dad, look, many trees.

78
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,673
That tree's big!

79
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,472
Already gone.

80
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:16,712
Come on.

81
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,372
Can l concede the loss?

82
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,409
Use your brains.

83
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,350
What? Can't move now.

84
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,622
Are you okay?

85
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,864
How did you catch?

86
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,526
Sorry, old gentleman.

87
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,329
Young man, be careful in playing ball.

88
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,137
Thank you.

89
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:48,744
Have you thought it over?

90
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:49,806
Come on.

91
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,181
How come it's ''go'' chess?

92
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,942
l can't beat you.

93
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,704
Don't go away, vendor.

94
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:35,990
Dad, you don't like this.

95
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,856
Let me go down to buy roast chicken for you.

96
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:41,562
Just wait. A vendor will come in a minute.

97
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,531
No, we must go down to get a nice roast chicken.

98
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,533
Right, right.

99
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,562
You yearn for a chance to move around.

100
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:48,662
Why make an excuse? go then.

101
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:49,466
Go, go.

102
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,532
Don't cause any trouble.

103
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:54,873
Yes.

104
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,569
Be sure to come back early!

105
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,786
Master, what class is the compartment?

106
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,297
Why are the cattle here too?

107
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:17,060
lt stinks like hell!

108
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,609
lt's just another world.

109
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:29,174
The weather in the northest is OK.

110
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,405
l like it.

111
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:32,180
This is first class.

112
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:34,808
The number of foreigners says it all.

113
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,177
What are you doing?

114
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,415
Looking for a friend.

115
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:41,581
Could you possible have friends here?

116
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:42,488
Right, right.

117
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,058
Yes.

118
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,921
You can't go in anyway.

119
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:44,823
Can't we just have a look?

120
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:45,918
No. Go away!

121
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,890
Go away, or i'll report you!

122
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,331
Master, what now?

123
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,264
Let's try something.

124
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:52,798
Really?

125
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:53,563
Of course.

126
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:04,440
Master, the next step?

127
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:05,742
See how i do it.

128
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,477
What are you doing?

129
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,016
What's wrong?

130
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,886
The ducks have fled!

131
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,153
Chase them!

132
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,626
Throw away the poultry quick!

133
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,298
Get back the poultry quick!

134
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,679
Sorry.

135
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,716
Hitting me?

136
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:51,587
A thief.

137
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:58,028
Sorry, i'll clear it up right away!

138
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,467
Stop!

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,474
What are you doing?

140
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:15,415
Halt!

141
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,420
A thief beating people!

142
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,261
Henchman!

143
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:30,390
What?

144
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:34,635
Have a bowl of tea.

145
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,330
Move and i'll stab you!

146
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,526
Henchman!

147
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,137
Don't run

148
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,071
First, i'm not a henchman.

149
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:49,669
Second...

150
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:53,213
i've already conceded to you.

151
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,580
Who cares? i won't lose.

152
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,143
You mule, what do you want?

153
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,979
Simple, just apologise to me.

154
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:03,318
Apologise to you?

155
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,319
Of course, you've misunderstand me.

156
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,218
OK, sorry.

157
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,415
And let me box you on the ear.

158
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,257
Ducking? Again.

159
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,858
Hit me if you can!

160
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,669
Don't say i'm bullying you!

161
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,769
Ok, i'll play along.

162
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:28,700
Come on.

163
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:29,334
Come on.

164
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:49,563
Drunken boxing.

165
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,294
Sure, you think i'm getting dizzy?

166
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,898
OK, come on.

167
00:11:59,008 --> 00:11:59,770
Come over.

168
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:00,934
Come over.

169
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:01,944
Come over.

170
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:06,540
Well, wait till you get sober first.

171
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,018
Uncle Tsao, God Serving Wine.

172
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,881
Cripple Li, Elbows Whirl and Knees Hit.

173
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:23,398
Any such blow is drunken boxing?

174
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,501
it's Holding a Jar. New to you?

175
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:30,431
Fairies Littering Petals.

178
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,453
What's this?

179
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,755
it's Drunk on the Battlefield.

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,332
Don't worry, stand up.

181
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,864
This hero's kung fu is OK.

182
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,967
Young man, your skills are not bad either.

183
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,808
But your drunken boxing...

184
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:11,909
faultless?

185
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,940
No, not powerful enough

186
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,417
and can't kill.

187
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,042
What?

188
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,077
My drunken boxing can't kill?

189
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,817
Let's go on.

190
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,119
You're running out of time.

191
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,058
What?

192
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:26,992
i'm young and strong. l've lots of time.

193
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,087
The train's leaving.

194
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,962
Who cares?

195
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,200
Stay!

196
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,697
The train!

197
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,340
Wait for me. i can't keep up.

198
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,782
Your hand, come on, quick!

199
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,390
Thank you.

200
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:57,983
Have you got back your stuff?

201
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,404
Ginseng?

202
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,479
Get up, all of you!

203
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,813
Get down the luggugae for inspection!

204
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,446
Hurry up!

205
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:30,916
Morning.

206
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:32,489
What's up, please?

207
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,386
The British Council has lost something,

208
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,988
so everyone has to be searched.

209
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:36,889
Have a check.

210
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:37,795
Yes.

211
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,867
Closely!

212
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:43,264
Open your luggage, be quick!

213
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:47,740
What's this!

214
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:48,901
Lingtzu.

215
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,104
And that?

216
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,579
Bear gall.

217
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:59,181
What's that? Show me.

218
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:00,450
Ginseng.

219
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,182
And that?

220
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,915
Deer foot ribs.

221
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:08,321
And that?

222
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:09,262
Deer tail.

223
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:10,959
Checked. And that box?

224
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,395
That box...

225
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:13,960
Lingtzu.

226
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,401
That box, not this.

227
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:16,029
That box?

228
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,503
That box behind you.

229
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,767
Ginseng, and you've already seen it!

230
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:19,900
Open it.

231
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,270
Show him.

232
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,071
All medicine.

233
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,339
Open it.

234
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,676
Open it!

235
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,150
Sir, he's my friend...

236
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,278
...in a legit business.

237
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,914
He's never been away. No need to search.

238
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:35,752
Who are you?

239
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,118
What have you got to say?

240
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,032
Sorry.

241
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,604
His dad is a General in Northeast.

242
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,738
His dad's a general,

243
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,336
and this is his territory.

244
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,705
Check the next compartment.

245
00:15:58,781 --> 00:15:59,247
Go forward.

246
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,213
Let's go.

247
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,015
This young man's quite capable.

248
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,386
Fei-hung, follow his example.

249
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,516
Fei-hung, put aside the ginseng.

250
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:18,800
You said the jade seal's missing?

251
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,196
The Emperor's jade seal...

252
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,704
...is like the crown of England.

253
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,398
Understand?

254
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,238
Everything combined here...

255
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,005
...is not as valuable.

256
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,774
The British Empire's premier is my friend.

257
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,179
i promised to put...

258
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:35,740
the jade seal symbolsing...

259
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:37,911
the power of Chinese Emperor...

260
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:40,979
into the London Museum of Art.

261
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:44,453
i don't care how you're going to do it.

262
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,017
i want it back.

263
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:46,993
Yes, sir.

264
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:49,030
Sir, i know who's taken it.

265
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:49,996
go and find it!

266
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:50,861
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,761
Right.

268
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,035
The workers at the steel factory...

269
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,538
...refuse to work at night.

270
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,370
Anything you can do about it?

271
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:00,340
Don't worry.

272
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:02,276
i'll get someone to convince them.

273
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,302
They'll nicely return to work at night for sure

274
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:05,141
Go then.

275
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,044
Yes.

276
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,289
The ancestor be blessed.

277
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,302
All of a kind!

278
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:31,172
Thank you, Patriarch.

279
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,471
Come on, pay up.

280
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,500
Cut off the nonsense and pay.

281
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:37,068
For treatment tell him to see Luk-Ah-choi.

282
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:39,637
Pay.

283
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,376
My luck's beat you all.

284
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,044
Pay, pay.

285
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,886
One make leads to a series of others.

286
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,924
Madam, Master's back.

287
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,483
Good, why fuss?

288
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,355
Master's back!

289
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,394
Master.

290
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,358
What's taken you so long?

291
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,496
i didn't hear it inside.

292
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,007
Let me.

293
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:16,274
Master, you're back.

294
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,808
Any hardship on the journey?

295
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,343
No, no.

296
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:22,023
Mother.

297
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:27,088
No mahjong game?

298
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,823
Nonsense!

299
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,496
I told you repeatedly...

300
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,660
...not to treat when i am out.

301
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:36,170
Master, you preached a doctor's...

302
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,900
...parental love too.

303
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,874
I couldn't stand...

304
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,535
...by doing nothing about a dying person.

305
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,239
lf i did, you'd blame me.

306
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:46,842
Have they lost much?

307
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,008
Yes, yes.

308
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,180
Need my help?

309
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,315
Gynaecology only.

310
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,720
i alone can cope.

311
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,224
Fei-hung, you've been away long.

312
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:57,520
Now serve incense to mothers shrine.

313
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,460
Wash your hands before you do it.

314
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,121
Don't laugh.

315
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,028
Get a ladder for him to do it.

316
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,657
Yes.

317
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,633
Did you water the plants regularly?

318
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:07,966
Yes, master.

319
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,109
Mother.

320
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,280
The chips.

321
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,151
Fei-hung.

322
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,317
What are you doing?

323
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:31,518
Nothing.

324
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,649
Go and serve incense.

325
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,099
Get up. Go now, go.

326
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,464
This is mine.

327
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:41,799
It's mine, it's on my chair!

328
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,808
What are you doing?

329
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,571
Behave yourself.

330
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,183
Remember to come again for treatment.

331
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:57,718
Yes.

332
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:58,753
Don't forget.

333
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:01,722
Madam Wong.

334
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:02,382
Mr. Chan.

335
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,618
Is Master Wong back?

336
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,557
Yes, he's inside.

337
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:07,721
What about the ginseng i told him to buy for me

338
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:09,390
He has got it. This way, please.

339
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,592
Master, Mr. Chan's here to get the ginseng.

340
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,464
Mr. Chan, you've come...

341
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,560
To get the ginseng?

342
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:15,728
What are you doing?

343
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:16,634
I'm going in to get the ginseng.

344
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:17,228
Yes.

345
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,237
Go quick.

346
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,971
Mr. Chan, l've bought you a big ginseng.

347
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,534
Sit a while. Let's chat after l've serve incense

348
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:24,610
Sorry for the trouble.

349
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,408
Mr. Chan, let me...

350
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:26,573
...bring you a cup of tea.

351
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,513
Good, thank you.

352
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,550
What's the matter with you? Where're you going?

353
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,053
If master knows the ginseng's lost,

354
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:32,883
I'll be finished.

355
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,478
You won't.

356
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:34,682
Fei-hung.

357
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:36,054
What are you two doing?

358
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,492
Mom, come here, come here.

359
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,426
Mom, we're finished.

360
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,987
The ginseng was replaced on the train.

361
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:44,892
Tso, you're finished.

362
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,594
Look.

363
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:49,034
Mom, what shall we do now? Do something.

364
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:49,935
OK?

365
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:50,768
Coming.

366
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,306
Go and get a cup of tea for Mr. Chan.

367
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:52,807
What? Get tea?

368
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,398
Get tea

369
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:54,066
l get tea and you try something.

370
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:54,734
Do, as i told you.

371
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,640
Go, go.

372
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,008
He gets the tea. What about me?

373
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,946
Come. What is it behind you?

374
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:00,906
A staircase.

375
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:01,915
And above the stairs?

376
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:02,575
The medicine storehouse.

377
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,276
And inside the storehouse?

378
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:03,909
A box.

379
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:04,918
And inside it?

380
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:06,079
Ginseng. Thank you, madam.

381
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:07,679
It's poison.

382
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:08,381
What do you mean?

383
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:10,687
Stop making fun of me, madam.

384
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,051
Better let me handle it.

385
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:20,134
Mr. Chan, have tea, please.

386
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:20,861
Thank you.

387
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:34,009
Dad, have tea.

388
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:35,741
Mr. Chan.

389
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:36,648
Why serve tea now?

390
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,653
To show mom my filial piety to you.

391
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:39,449
You...

392
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,716
A big ginseng, isn't it?

393
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,350
A rare genus of super quality...

394
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,257
...appears only once in a blue moon.

395
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:47,888
Just put it in boiling water.

396
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,830
After taking it, you assured...

397
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:52,925
...of potency and youth.

398
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,734
Why have you brought a carrot?

399
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:57,837
What?

400
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,964
Carrot?

401
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,541
Doesn't it look like ginseng?

402
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,373
No.

403
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,137
l was going to tell you it's carrot,

404
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,671
and a big carrot.

405
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,944
it neutralises...

406
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,043
...other tonics.

407
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:12,576
Don't take it within 3 months...

408
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,282
...after taking ginseng.

409
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:15,517
Understand?

410
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:16,854
All right now.

411
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:21,425
Mr. Chan, my wife really is considerate.

412
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,090
She showed you the carrot,

413
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,497
just to warn you against...

414
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:27,559
taking carrot within 3 months...

415
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:29,264
after taking ginseng.

416
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:31,303
Why doesn't it look like it?

417
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,399
I didn't see it.

418
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:35,306
Nor did i.

419
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:36,936
i didn't see it either.

420
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,378
Fei-hung, what are you doing?

421
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,505
i really didn't see anything.

422
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:40,845
Mom, does it look like it?

423
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,012
Yes, very much.

424
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,518
Brat, where did you steal it?

425
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,516
Dad's plant.

426
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,079
You're finished, but never mind.

427
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:49,886
Blame it on Tso.

428
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:50,516
Good.

429
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,789
Blame me again? My goodness!

430
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,020
Tso.

431
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:56,660
Come in quick. Let me help you.

432
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,068
Are you all right? Did you trip?

433
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:01,200
it looks like it.

434
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,032
Of course.

435
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:05,968
Fei-hung's dad, come over.

436
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:07,375
Sorry.

437
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:08,098
Please.

438
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:08,973
Sorry, Mr. Chan.

439
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:09,636
Good.

440
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:10,904
What happened?

441
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:14,507
Come on, come over.

442
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,812
Why are you acting so furtively?

443
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,513
I want to consult you on something.

444
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:20,579
Fei-hung's grown now,

445
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:22,385
he must be lonesome.

446
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:23,584
What then?

447
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,421
Do you feel that...

448
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,586
Mr. Chan, your ginseng.

449
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:27,886
Still wet?

450
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,327
Just unearthed.

451
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:30,524
Mr. Chan, my dad...

452
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,124
...got it hard.

453
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,397
He said it's wild ginseng.

454
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,301
it's to be taken only after being put...

455
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:36,702
...in a rice container for 3 days.

456
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,205
To bring him a...

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,831
...small brother or sister?

458
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:40,501
No hurry, let's talk about it later.

459
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,975
Why not?

460
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,637
Your master Lu Ah-choi's birthday is coming.

461
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:45,236
It's just passed.

462
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,907
He'll have his birthday again next year.

463
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:47,812
That's for next year only.

464
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:48,542
Mr. Chan.

465
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:49,515
No, no.

466
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:52,882
Ginseng has to be put on the chest...

467
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,752
...to get some human breath.

468
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,690
Rember, take it only in 3 days.

469
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,157
And don't forget...

470
00:23:58,193 --> 00:23:59,057
tomorrows fund-raising assembly.

471
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:00,083
Master Wong.

472
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:01,254
i must take my leave.

473
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,856
Have you seen the ginseng?

474
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:03,693
Yes.

475
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:04,197
Satisfied?

476
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,498
Yes, yes.

477
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:05,999
Very satisfied!

478
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:06,999
Let me see you out.

479
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,967
No, let Fei-hung do it. Where's he?

480
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:10,801
Let me. Please, please.

481
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,931
Goodbye.

482
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:12,939
Take care.

483
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:13,532
The Militia want you...

484
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,543
...to be their coach.

485
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,044
They ask if you're interested.

486
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:17,873
i've already given them my word.

487
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:18,810
l know you did.

488
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,642
Mom.

489
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:20,977
Mr. Chan has left.

490
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,876
What do you want to tell me?

491
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,044
I need your advice.

492
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,383
Should we to ask for...

493
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,751
...a 30-years deposit in advance?

494
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,278
Forget it. You're tired. Talk about it tomorrow

495
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:28,812
Go in and retire.

496
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,221
Dad, go in and retire.

497
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:31,815
How long am i going to live?

498
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,157
Frankly,

499
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,823
if they do pay you a 30-year deposit,

500
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:37,331
that's a good thing.

501
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,230
Why pull a long face?

502
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,996
lf dad should see that plant...

503
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:43,594
Just throw the pot away.

504
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,101
One more thing.

505
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:46,197
What's it?

506
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:47,434
If Mr. Chan takes the fake...

507
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,944
...ginseng after return.

508
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,669
Let's wait till he is sick.

509
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,508
Wish he could really wait for 3 days.

510
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,351
Just for some water. Be back soon.

511
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:02,117
Hurry up

512
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,849
Hurry up

513
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:04,089
Time for dismissal. No bells

514
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,353
Deliver the coffee before ringing the bell

515
00:25:06,928 --> 00:25:09,192
Fo Sang, my stove's going out. Stoke it

516
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:10,825
In a moment

517
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:18,236
Uncle Hing, take care

518
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:19,433
So i noticed

519
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:23,845
Time for dismissal

520
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:24,846
Ring the bell

521
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,378
So much hurry!

522
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,480
Coffee time

523
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,389
Off now.

524
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:47,732
Bells to start work!

525
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:48,961
You're...

526
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:50,004
Nonsense.

527
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:52,532
I'm the new foreman.

528
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,040
Do as i tell you!

529
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:01,714
What happened?

530
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:02,477
What's wrong?

531
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:03,415
Isn't it time to be off?

532
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,317
Today, that's no way to curry favor.

533
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:06,115
Right.

534
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:06,745
Right, we're already off.

535
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:07,812
Why did you clock-in?

536
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:09,423
He is...

537
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,792
The new foreman told me to do it.

538
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:15,962
The new foreman?

539
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,899
What a waste letting...

540
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:20,834
...the factory go idle?

541
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,166
So we're working overtime.

542
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,796
4 hours' overtime each night...

543
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,771
...for a month.

544
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:25,465
Hear me?

545
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,804
What? One month?

546
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,366
One month?

547
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:30,843
Quiet, everybody!

548
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:33,374
Well, Mr. Smith,

549
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,212
We'll work over time,

550
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,342
if you agree to pay us overtime.

551
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,851
Right, we must've overtime pay.

552
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,250
We've already paid you overtime pay.

553
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,381
The free board...

554
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,585
...and lodging we provided you...

555
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,423
already cover the overtime pay 
don't they?

556
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:48,656
Understand? Quiet!

557
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,055
Mr. Smith, free board and lodging...

558
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,361
are precondition.

559
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,129
We won't work overtime...

560
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:55,261
...if you don't pay for it.

561
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:55,928
Right, we won't work.

562
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,268
Let's go.

563
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,670
Halt!

564
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:03,806
You won't work overtime
 the 1st day of my appointment.

565
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:05,745
It means not giving me face.

566
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:07,043
That's not true.

567
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:08,379
It's a matter of principle.

568
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,043
Who'd work overtime without extra pay?

569
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:10,975
Let's go.

570
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:16,355
Don't!

571
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:17,857
Why not?

572
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:23,590
All back to work, hear me?

573
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,130
Stand back, all of you!

574
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,573
Keung.

575
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:44,848
Are you going to work or not?

576
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,217
Who dares to disobey?

577
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,354
Henry, you're great!

578
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:50,716
Are you convinced now?

579
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,886
They've to work.

580
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,140
Well, you go on with practice.

581
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,150
The racket! it disturbs my sleep

582
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:23,214
Any way to buy up that plot

583
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,350
The land is owned by Po Chi Lam gym

584
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:26,758
He just won't sell

585
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:29,320
Damn! i must get rid of him

586
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:30,692
Sure

587
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,011
Fun, are'nt you tired of working alone?

588
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:53,043
Why not let someone help you?

589
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:54,749
Don't you agree?

590
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:57,418
Getting help?

591
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,984
No female dares to kill snakes like i do.

592
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:01,586
And i can't afford...

593
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,689
...to pay wages to a man.

594
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,199
So i prefer to be alone.

595
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,435
Right you are.

596
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,198
But a female...

597
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:10,898
...may suffer...

598
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,203
...without the care of a man.

599
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,709
Why not let me teach you kung fu...

600
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:17,268
...to protect yourself?

601
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:19,540
I like nothing but drunken boxing.

602
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:22,377
What good is it? 

603
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,645
Come to Sha Min tonight.

604
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,449
and i'll teach you Tsai Li Fu boxing!

605
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:28,488
I prefer drunken boxing.

606
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:33,057
What's there to see? Back to work!

607
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,831
So many are waiting to buy fish. Are you blind?

608
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,932
How much?

609
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:43,795
Drunken boxing beat Tsai Li Fu? l chop!

610
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:44,896
Master Tsan.

611
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:47,169
Wong Fei-hung.

612
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:48,640
Half fish, minced,

613
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:51,237
and a fish head, please.

614
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,737
Which half?

615
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:56,149
Snake gall is good for the eyes,

616
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:57,981
suits elderly people best.

617
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:58,542
Fun.

618
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,143
Boiled snake soup.

619
00:29:59,254 --> 00:29:59,913
Fun.

620
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:01,646
Fei-hung.

621
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:02,917
You snake has fled!

622
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,982
Never mind. What do you want?

623
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,960
Give me 3 snake galls and one pheasant.

624
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:08,360
I've already reserved them for you.

625
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,628
Thank you.

626
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:14,464
Which half do you want?

627
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:17,232
It makes no difference.

628
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:18,134
Fei-hung,

629
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,936
they say your drunken boxing is OK.

630
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:20,703
Thank you.

631
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,573
Teach me a few moves when you've time.

632
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:23,406
OK.

633
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,948
I won't mince fish today.

634
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,313
Never mind. I'll do it at home myself.

635
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:31,819
Just do it as i told you. Stop nagging.

636
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:32,979
I want it right away.

637
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:35,980
Fei-hung, when will you teach me drunken boxing?

638
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,524
What good is drunken boxing?

639
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,389
It's so sissy.

640
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,486
Wong Fei-hung, you've spoken the truth.

641
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:44,565
Why don't you ask Tsan to teach you Tsai Li Fu?

642
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,793
What good is your Tsai Li Fu?

643
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:49,664
At least it's better than drunken boxing?

644
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:53,304
Never mind him, Fei-hung.

645
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,899
When will you teach me drunken boxing?

646
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,772
Fun, don't you prefer...

647
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,507
Tsai Li Fu to drunken boxing?

648
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,972
Pupils, don't you agree?

649
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:02,506
Yes.

650
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,244
Sure.

651
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:07,477
It depends on who's the master.

652
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:12,151
My Tsai Li Fu will beats your 
drunken boxing.

653
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,923
If l lose to you.

654
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,362
I'll pay for the fish and fish head...

655
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,491
...you bought today.

656
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,467
Tsan, isn't that a deal?

657
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:23,334
Yes, it's a deal

658
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,538
Master Tsan, I'm afraid...

659
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:30,237
...i may hurt the passers-by.

660
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:32,438
Let them be the witness then.

661
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,608
Neighbors, ladies and gentlemen.

662
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,242
I, fishmonger Tsan, will have...

663
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,549
...a fight with Wong Fei-hung.

664
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:41,953
Be our witness.

665
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:42,955
Come on.

666
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,949
Don't worry, just a token fight.

667
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:46,927
Go ahead.

668
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,746
Why don't you use drunken boxing?

669
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:32,804
Good!

670
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,991
Great, Fei-hung, you've won.

671
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,859
No, i drew with...

672
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:57,827
...Master Tsan.

673
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,160
Right. Again.

674
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:02,892
Master Tsan.

675
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:04,427
Coming.

676
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:05,803
Mom wants me.

677
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:08,300
Excuse me. My mom wants me.

678
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:09,241
Fei-hung.

679
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:10,611
Your fish.

680
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:12,305
Well, how much?

681
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,210
It's my treat.

682
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:14,270
Thank you.

683
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:19,044
All right now. it's a draw.

684
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:20,247
Buy anything you want.

685
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:21,414
Go.

686
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:23,515
Getting your food free?

687
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:24,582
Didn't you fight?

688
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:25,353
No?

689
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,791
You may get hell from your
 dad again if you did.

690
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:28,488
How can we afford...

691
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,724
...to get the ginseng?

692
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:30,924
Just sell my diamond necklace...

693
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:31,954
...from your dad.

694
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,659
No way.

695
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:33,597
Why not?

696
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:34,693
You're finished if he...

697
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,328
...takes the fake ginseng.

698
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:37,605
Thank you, mom.

699
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,038
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

700
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:45,379
He's the man wanted by Counsul.

701
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:47,308
You follow him.

702
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:48,975
I'll bring men, OK?

703
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:50,182
Yes.

704
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,778
Wong Kei-ying sells his wife's...

705
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:55,516
...jewelry only in emergency.

706
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,614
Try to cut down the price, understand?

707
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,851
Yes, what a nagger.

708
00:33:57,992 --> 00:33:59,050
Let's go.

709
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:02,589
Is the drought so serious?

710
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:04,689
The province...

711
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:06,791
...is known for infertility.

712
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,496
There's no harvest and no rainfall.

713
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:10,629
How can it not be serious?

714
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:14,073
My friend told me one whole family there...

715
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:15,700
shares one pair of pants only.

716
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:17,267
Who wears it then?

717
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:18,972
Any member that goes out.

718
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,708
Mr. Chiu, so you're here.

719
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,110
Sorry, i'm late.

720
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,239
Mr. Chiu.

721
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:24,283
Don't mention it.

722
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:25,385
Sorry.

723
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:26,111
Don't mention it.

724
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,615
Don't you have an appointment...

725
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,054
...with my wife in ABC Cafe?

726
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:31,284
Are you one player short again?

727
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,485
No, i'll help you to raise funds.

728
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:35,962
Aren't you coming with me?

729
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,827
Right, i'll try to get a donation from Tsan.

730
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:39,399
Go quick, don't keep them waiting.

731
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,594
OK.

732
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:41,669
Excuse me, Dad.

733
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:42,795
Stay.

734
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:44,067
Don't cause trouble.

735
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:45,701
I won't.

736
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:47,104
This way.

737
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:50,906
Go and bring men.

738
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,340
Since everyone's here,

739
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,283
please explain the procedure.

740
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:58,615
Good. This...

741
00:34:58,686 --> 00:34:59,516
Since Po Chi Lam's in trouble, we must...

742
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,579
...answer Master Wong's request for donation.

743
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:03,113
Please don't misunderstand.

744
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:04,556
The donation is not for Po Chi Lam.

745
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:07,026
It's for the relief of draught victims.

746
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:09,495
The donation goes to whoever's in trouble.

747
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,896
We're all Chinese, right?

748
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,161
Don't come over unless i tell you to.

749
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:13,723
Hurry up!

750
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:14,631
Has anybody disclosed this?

751
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:15,226
No.

752
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:15,928
And you?

753
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:16,766
I didn't.

754
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:18,032
Don't frame me.

755
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,972
Whoever revealed it gets his face punched in.

756
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,030
You'll get it for sure.

757
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,939
Luckily...

758
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,410

don't begrudge it. Produce it.

773
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:57,637
Did you see what it was?

774
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:58,371

775
00:35:58,446 --> 00:36:00,209
...an expensive item she tried to sell.

776
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:02,439

Listen, don't wear it to show off.

782
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:10,853
You may ruin me.

783
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:11,619
Don't worry,

784
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:12,352
I'll enjoy it at home only.

785
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:13,121
When will be our game?

786
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:15,594

787
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,094

Luckily you ran fast.

794
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:00,606
Fei-hung, great, you've got it back!

795
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:03,376
My dear son!

796
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:04,168

You've hit me.

803

Sorry.

804
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:18,554
You can't get over by saying 'sorry' only.

805
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:19,821
What do you want then?

806
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:23,091
Kneel down and kowtow to say 'sorry'.

807
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:23,888

Never mind them.

810
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,526
They're birds of the same feather.

811
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:29,263
Nonsense, bitch!

812
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:30,831
No one has called me...

813
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:32,100
...that for a long time.

814
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,164
You couldn't escape our attention.

815
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,401
You exchanged eyes...

816
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:35,136
...with that man.

817
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,234
You look wretched...

818
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:38,336
...even in a foreign suit.

819
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:40,045
You're hitting my mom!

820
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,713
Mom, are you OK?

821
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:44,682
Hitting my son?

822
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,483
Mom, is it serious?

823
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,216
Don't dream of leaving her if you...

824
00:37:49,257 --> 00:37:50,815
...don't apologize on your knees.

825
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,953
You're really going too far.

826
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,091
What did you say?

827
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:56,096
Act.

828
00:37:56,531 --> 00:37:57,088

Fight, fight.

831
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:02,594
What happened to your mouth?

832
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,398
It's all right.

833
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:11,373
My necklace is in that wallet.

834
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:12,936

949
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,708
Why did you sell the diamond necklace?

950
00:44:57,785 --> 00:44:58,251
Who's got any diamond necklace?

951
00:44:58,285 --> 00:44:59,149
Mr. Wong.

952
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:01,518
Why hide Po Chi Lam's financial trouble?

953
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:03,682
Why raise funds under the pretext of relief?

954
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:05,589
Po Chi Lam's all right.

955
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:08,661
Keep the money in custody.

956
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:11,591
Don't drink anymore.

957
00:45:11,632 --> 00:45:12,326
Fei-hung.

958
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:13,833
He's deadly drunk.

959
00:45:14,134 --> 00:45:14,930
Mrs. Wong.

960
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,262
Don't drink no more!

961
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:18,162
Mr. Wong.

962
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:19,365
Let's help him back.

963
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,937
You get the wine...

964
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:21,599
Let me help you.

965
00:45:21,642 --> 00:45:23,269
Why are you standing there?

966
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,399
Go home.

967
00:45:24,945 --> 00:45:26,845
Yes, master.

968
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,478
Goodbye.

969
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:29,641
They're gone.

970
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:30,342
Go now.

971
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:31,446
Me, too.

972
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:34,813
Where's he going?

973
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:40,250
What's there to see? Follow him!

974
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:42,819
A bunch of fools!

975
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:44,387
You're not any good either.

976
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:45,725
You meant to tell on me?

977
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:47,859
You meant to tarnish our image.

978
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:50,363
You brat!

979
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:51,701
Now everybody thought l raise money...

980
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:54,708
...under the pretext of relief!

981
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:55,707
Are you broke?

982
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:57,506
You're even selling my jewelry.

983
00:45:58,078 --> 00:45:59,511
Who's selling it?

984
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:00,843
l showed it to Fa as an example only.

985
00:46:00,881 --> 00:46:02,109
because she...

986
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,548
...likes the pattern.

987
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,048
Don't deny.

988
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:06,484
Mr. Chiu's wife asked him...

989
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,215
...for money to buy it.

990
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:09,882
Did you lose much on mahjong games?

991
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:12,852
Fa could've lied to her husband...

992
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:14,155
...to get the money.

993
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:15,821
You only believe others, not me.

994
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:17,262
Is there any justice?

995
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:19,764
Mom, you're OK, you have a way.

996
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:20,731
Be on your knees properly!

997
00:46:20,935 --> 00:46:23,563
See how drunk you are!

998
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:24,931
Kneel properly!

999
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,200
I told you not to use...

1000
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,104
...drunken boxing or fight.

1001
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:28,608
But you're disobedient.

1002
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:29,870
You do it your way?

1003
00:46:30,244 --> 00:46:31,438
You're drunk, you hit your own dad!

1004
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:34,504
I'll kill you.

1005
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:39,111
Why are you hitting your son?

1006
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:40,450
He helped me only because i got beaten.

1007
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:41,886
You prefer to let me be killed...

1008
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:44,083
...than have him use drunken boxing?

1009
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:45,924
Like mother...

1010
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,927
...like son!

1011
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:47,950
I don't let him use drunken boxing...

1012
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:49,428
...for his own good only.

1013
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:51,520
What's wrong with that?

1014
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:52,964
You expected him to stick to that...

1015
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,763
...old medicine shop all his life?

1016
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:58,132
You really make my temperature rise!

1017
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,707
You never learn!

1018
00:47:11,986 --> 00:47:13,146
Who made a mess of this...

1019
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:14,745
...pot of mine?

1020
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:15,413
Oh, i forgot to...

1021
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:17,219
...fling away that pot!

1022
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,315
Tso.

1023
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,821
You're responsible.

1024
00:47:22,196 --> 00:47:23,925
Well,

1025
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:26,364
why fuss over such a triffle?

1026
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:31,363
Master, why get so excited?

1027
00:47:31,405 --> 00:47:34,169
I ruined the plant.

1028
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:36,870
I sold the necklace because l lost in gambling.

1029
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,434
And i forced him to use...

1030
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:39,673
drunken boxing.

1031
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:41,681
And i made him drink as he did.

1032
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:43,512
Curse me!

1033
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,848
Kill me, i asked for it!

1034
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:48,418
Don't go too far!

1035
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:49,420
Don't just take the blame...

1036
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:50,855
...yourself for everything!

1037
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:51,982
You resent it?

1038
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:53,687
Beat me!

1039
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,822
Don't think i daren't lay hands on you!

1040
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:59,059
OK.

1041
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:04,297
Why cry? l haven't done anything.

1042
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:08,736
Come on, beat me!

1043
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:13,042
Kill me, and be a man!

1044
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:16,045
Hitting my own wife, why not?

1045
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,743
I'll kill...

1046
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:19,819
Just kill me!

1047
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:22,822
One body with two lives of the Wongs!

1048
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,948
What?

1049
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,558
Are you pregnant?

1050
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:30,089
Why on your knees?

1051
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:32,527
Come. Get up!

1052
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,026
You told me to kneel.

1053
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:35,296
And i'll do it accordingly.

1054
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:36,893
I kneel, kneel.

1055
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:38,962
Well, i'm sorry, all my fault!

1056
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:42,567
Great, i'm going to have a small brother!

1057
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,604
Get up, come on!

1058
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,235
Leave me alone! Keep away!

1059
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:47,280
I crouch!

1060
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:48,073
Watch out!

1061
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:49,280
Don't!

1062
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:50,043
Put me down!

1063
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,741
OK.

1064
00:48:51,351 --> 00:48:53,182
I hate you! i'll back-somersault!

1065
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,379
Don't!

1066
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:55,350
My fault!

1067
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:56,617
Put me down!

1068
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:57,653
All my fault!

1069
00:48:57,724 --> 00:48:59,282
I'll spin one full circle.

1070
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:04,189
Keep cool, it was all my fault!

1071
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:06,357
Tso, get a chair for madam

1072
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,367
Qucik

1073
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,932
My wife, sit down, please!

1074
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:15,031
My fault again.

1075
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:17,269
Are you all right?

1076
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:19,345
You missed me.

1077
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:22,740
Only an accident. Get up!

1078
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:28,277
You did it deliberately.

1079
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:29,813
Nothing wrong with your belly?

1080
00:49:29,857 --> 00:49:31,347
Don't touch me!

1081
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:34,794
It's all right.

1082
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,295
Thank God!

1083
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,363
Master,

1084
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,660
Mrs. Chan wants to see you on urgent business.

1085
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:43,897
Take a rest.

1086
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:48,206
Dad's OK, he's as sophiscated as ever.

1087
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:49,140
Nonsense!

1088
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:51,268
Master Wong.

1089
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:52,938
Mrs. Chan, what is it?

1090
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,414
Master Wong, look.

1091
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:58,475
This is not ginseng.

1092
00:49:58,619 --> 00:49:59,881
I showed it to another doctor,

1093
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,649
and he said it's a poison plant.

1094
00:50:01,688 --> 00:50:03,519
I knew you wouldn't cheat me with an imitation.

1095
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,115
I'm afraid you've been fooled.

1096
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:07,423
Luckily, my husband took only half of it.

1097
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:10,760
He's now only half alive.

1098
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:12,187
What are you doing?

1099
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:13,062
Time for you...

1100
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,125
...to repay my favor now.

1101
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:16,431
Beat it for me.

1102
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:19,065
Sorry.

1103
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:21,404
Uncle Ho, go get the antidote Lingtzu.

1104
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:23,409
Boil it and feed it to Mr. Chan.

1105
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:24,705
He'll be all right in time.

1106
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:27,104
Master Wong, l've come to...

1107
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:29,172
...tell you about it only.

1108
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:30,215
I won't disturb you any more.

1109
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:30,978
Sorry.

1110
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:31,642
Goodbye.

1111
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:33,377
Sorry.

1112
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:39,948
Who did it?

1113
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,896
Master, young master did it.

1114
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:52,062
Not my fault.

1115
00:50:57,611 --> 00:51:00,341
Don't you know this...

1116
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,007
...could be fatal?

1117
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:05,116
And you've ruined...

1118
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:06,949
Po Chi Lam's reputation.

1119
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:11,020
Mom, the ginseng grown by dad...

1120
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:12,255
I'll kill you!

1121
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:17,426
Brat, I'll kill you!

1122
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,428
lmitation ginseng kills, don't you know?

1123
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:23,533
He knew it for sure.

1124
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,434
I sold the diamond necklace...

1125
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,063
to buy a ginseng only.

1126
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,402
A slip of the tongue!

1127
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,644
To evade payment of duty.

1128
00:51:31,678 --> 00:51:33,202
Your son hid the ginseng in someone...

1129
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,407
...else's luggage and it got lost.

1130
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:36,939
To evade tax for me? Outrageous!

1131
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:40,420
I may be poor, but l'm honest.

1132
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:43,617
Dishonesty is worse than starvation.

1133
00:51:43,657 --> 00:51:45,056
Now you've brought...

1134
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:46,684
...this way!

1135
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,091
You want to drink?

1136
00:51:49,129 --> 00:51:50,926
l'll let you drink it now.

1137
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:01,338
Drink it, drink it like hell, come on!

1138
00:52:07,848 --> 00:52:10,578
Drink it like hell!

1139
00:52:20,894 --> 00:52:23,294
How dare you fight back?

1140
00:52:24,998 --> 00:52:28,126
I've brought you up for nothing.

1141
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,659
Get out of my sight!

1142
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:33,571
You're not my son!

1143
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,337
Get out!

1144
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:42,607
Get out!

1145
00:52:42,649 --> 00:52:43,980
Get out!

1146
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:46,752
Stop it, master!

1147
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,446
Stop it, master!

1148
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,955
Get out!

1149
00:52:52,326 --> 00:52:54,624
Fei-hung.

1150
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:56,526
Fei-hung.

1151
00:52:56,596 --> 00:52:58,564
Get out! You're not my son!

1152
00:52:58,598 --> 00:52:59,656
Stop it!

1153
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:00,358
Get up!

1154
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,900
Master.

1155
00:53:04,004 --> 00:53:07,269
Master, stop it, please!

1156
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:13,068
Master, don't.

1157
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:15,343
Master.

1158
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:25,156
Are you out of your mind? He's your dad!

1159
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:29,318
Get out!

1160
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,323
Fei-hung.

1161
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,831
Tso, after him!

1162
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:40,767
Tso.

1163
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,105
There!

1164
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:54,345
Catch.

1165
00:53:55,222 --> 00:53:56,154
Thanks for the trouble.

1166
00:53:56,223 --> 00:53:57,383
Don't mention it.

1167
00:53:58,759 --> 00:53:59,748
Boss, here you are.

1168
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:00,554
Thank you.

1169
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:01,820
Same as usual

1170
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:03,556
Please be seated. i'll be with you right away.

1171
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:08,098
Fei-hung, your dad wouldn't let you loose,

1172
00:54:08,135 --> 00:54:11,400
this is to protect the image of Po Chi Lam.

1173
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:14,172
I see a generation gap.

1174
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:17,370
Let me toast my dad. Drink!

1175
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:18,273
No, we won't continue.

1176
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:21,474
Don't drink after this. 
It's bad for the health.

1177
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:23,409
Name a song.

1178
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:25,877
I want to name a song.

1179
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:27,919
What will you name, sir?

1180
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:32,756
Dad's nice. i'll sing it myself.

1181
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:36,555
Dad's nice.

1182
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:37,923
Good.

1183
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:46,863
No one's better than dad.

1184
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:51,640
His child's like a straw.

1185
00:54:51,678 --> 00:55:00,017
lf i misbehave, he boxes me on the ear.

1186
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,848
Egad!

1187
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:04,787
No one's better than dad.

1188
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:09,421
He takes his son for a sandbag.

1189
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:18,428
Punches, kicks, yes. Embraces, never.

1190
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:22,765
No one's better than dad.

1191
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:26,609
A pity i never knew.

1192
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:28,375
Look, it's that guy.

1193
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:30,142
So that's him

1194
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,343
His drunken boxing is terrific.

1195
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:36,449
Well, let me take him on.

1196
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:46,531
It's deep night, don't awake others!

1197
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:49,633
What are you doing?

1198
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,031
None of your business,

1199
00:55:52,072 --> 00:55:53,300
none of your business either!

1200
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,967
Whoever interferes will be beaten.

1201
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:56,441
Run quick!

1202
00:55:56,943 --> 00:55:59,138
Stand back, or you'll be beaten too!

1203
00:55:59,179 --> 00:55:59,645
Keep away!

1204
00:55:59,746 --> 00:56:00,440
Keep away!

1205
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,448
Why don't you play?

1206
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,156
I'd like to try your drunken boxing.

1207
00:56:16,263 --> 00:56:20,495
Dad won't let me fight it.

1208
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:24,860
Watch out, he is joking.

1209
00:56:34,514 --> 00:56:37,244
What's wrong? They say it's terrific!

1210
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:42,349
Wong Fei-hung?

1211
00:56:42,822 --> 00:56:43,652
Excuse me.

1212
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:45,020
Why hit him?

1213
00:56:45,692 --> 00:56:47,626
Nothing for you.

1214
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:55,191
Stop him from getting closer.

1215
00:56:55,502 --> 00:56:57,231
Henry, you said...

1216
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,362
...it's terrific?

1217
00:56:58,405 --> 00:56:59,929
How come?

1218
00:56:59,973 --> 00:57:01,167
He wasn't like that today.

1219
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:02,572
Ask them and you'll be convinced.

1220
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:03,438
Right.

1221
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:17,889
Why hit me?

1222
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:20,484
isn't your drunken boxing powerful?

1223
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,788
Show me.

1224
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:24,193
You call that drunken boxing?

1225
00:57:24,664 --> 00:57:26,131
Take his life right now!

1226
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:29,799
Mad? With so many around,

1227
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:31,804
just teach him a lesson.

1228
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,175
King of Drunken Boxing?

1229
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:40,041
Wong Fei-hung.

1230
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:40,942
Something wrong.

1231
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,981
Over there, Master Wong.

1232
00:57:43,016 --> 00:57:43,505
Thank you.

1233
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:44,845
What's wrong?

1234
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,214
Fei-hung.

1235
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:52,849
He even gets dizzy.

1236
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,525
His dad.

1237
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:57,157
What did you say?

1238
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,871
Don't be sorry.

1239
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:17,883
When young,

1240
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:20,613
we ran around naked too.

1241
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:22,554
If i had been present,

1242
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:24,819
this might not have happened!

1243
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:31,728
Young master, don't be sad.

1244
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:35,226
Let me tell you some good news.

1245
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:36,235
All girls in the city...

1246
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:38,737
...yearn to marry you.

1247
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,603
Are you happy now?

1248
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:46,040
Don't cry. Come on, wipe your face.

1249
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:47,404
Where's my dad?

1250
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:48,707
In the garden.

1251
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:54,048
Fei-hung never forgets he once...

1252
00:58:54,087 --> 00:58:55,315
...won with drunken boxing.

1253
00:58:55,355 --> 00:58:57,482
I've my reasons for not letting him use it.

1254
00:58:57,557 --> 00:58:59,855
There's nothing wrong with drunken boxing.

1255
00:58:59,926 --> 00:59:01,359
You to drink to use it though,

1256
00:59:01,394 --> 00:59:02,452
and you get drunk easily.

1257
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,360
Let alone fighting, 
you can't even stand properly.

1258
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:05,693
He get's into trouble because of this.

1259
00:59:05,732 --> 00:59:06,630
Don't drink so much then.

1260
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:08,600
No, he must drink a proper portion,

1261
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:11,035
before it becomes effective.

1262
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:13,539
He gets powerful but feels no pain when beaten.

1263
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:14,471
So it gives the wrong...

1264
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:16,566
...illusion of being powerful.

1265
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:17,473
A drinker knows...

1266
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,772
...he can't stop drinking.

1267
00:59:18,812 --> 00:59:20,507
Is it worth being...

1268
00:59:20,547 --> 00:59:21,912
...a drunkard to use this move?

1269
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:24,313
Water floats but also capizse boats.

1270
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,409
A good thing must have
 something bad in it.

1271
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:29,149
Yet a righteous fighter like Fei-hung.

1272
00:59:29,189 --> 00:59:31,521
should be excusable for drinking a bit more.

1273
00:59:31,624 --> 00:59:33,558
Master, your words are...

1274
00:59:33,593 --> 00:59:35,026
...too profound for me.

1275
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:35,618
Why?

1276
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:37,152
What is ''excusable''?

1277
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:38,357
How does ''water floats, also capsizes boats''?

1278
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:40,992
How much drink is a proper portion?

1279
00:59:55,582 --> 00:59:58,847
I won't drink any more.

1280
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:10,723
You're grown.

1281
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:12,732
Get up, shame on you.

1282
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:14,290
go and thank your two friends now.

1283
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:16,529
Come on, thank them.

1284
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:29,815
Is he naughty?

1285
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:31,476
Don't touch him. He's asleep.

1286
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:33,042
Good.

1287
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:52,564
Come again for treatment tomorrow.

1288
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:56,298
Does Wong Fei-hung live here?

1289
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:57,274
What if he does?

1290
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:58,469
I want to get something from him.

1291
01:00:58,545 --> 01:01:00,342
What's it at this late hour?

1292
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:02,005
I can't tell you.

1293
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:08,587
Did those men send you here?

1294
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:14,086
Skirt kick!

1295
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,785
Don't misunderstand.

1296
01:01:14,894 --> 01:01:15,986
You old dog!

1297
01:01:16,062 --> 01:01:16,756
What did you say?

1298
01:01:29,342 --> 01:01:30,331
Have you had enough?

1299
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:44,748
You're hitting my mom?

1300
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:46,725
Fei-hung, let me help you.

1301
01:01:50,129 --> 01:01:51,756
He's hitting my belly.

1302
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:57,568
Dad, help!

1303
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:58,498
Come on!

1304
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:02,472
Did you get hurt?

1305
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:03,634
I lied only to make dad fight.

1306
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,176
You brat!

1307
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:05,370
Fei-hung, he's...

1308
01:02:12,218 --> 01:02:12,912
Fei-hung.

1309
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:13,680
Stay where you are!

1310
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,548
Stay where you are!

1311
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:15,883
We'll join to kill you!

1312
01:02:15,955 --> 01:02:17,422
I told you not to move.

1313
01:02:18,057 --> 01:02:18,955
I told you not to move!

1314
01:02:19,459 --> 01:02:20,118
OK.

1315
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:22,116
Are you all right?

1316
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:25,195
I'm Wong Kei-Ying. And you?

1317
01:02:25,298 --> 01:02:27,664
You're the coach of the Militia.

1318
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,964
I'm Fu Wen-chi.

1319
01:02:30,136 --> 01:02:34,266
The last decorated...

1320
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:35,239
...Manchu officer?

1321
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,433
It's nice seeing you.

1322
01:02:36,509 --> 01:02:37,134
Go in.

1323
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:37,676
OK.

1324
01:02:37,744 --> 01:02:38,267
Please.

1325
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:38,969
Come.

1326
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:39,801
Please.

1327
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:40,971
Please.

1328
01:02:43,116 --> 01:02:45,084
Mom, what did dad say?

1329
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:46,483
Damn the...

1330
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:48,009
...military honours.

1331
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:49,180
Don't you understand?

1332
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:51,080
You won't understand no matter how i explain.

1333
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:53,481
Everything's in a mess.

1334
01:02:54,494 --> 01:02:55,222
Have you found it?

1335
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:55,693
No.

1336
01:02:55,762 --> 01:02:56,786
Search closely.

1337
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,861
Fei-hung, have you got it?

1338
01:02:58,932 --> 01:02:59,899
No.

1339
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,158
Where has it gone?

1340
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:03,429
Finished! Finished if it can't be found.

1341
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:04,731
Tso.

1342
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:09,639
What are you doing?

1343
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:12,471
It's hot. l'm keeping cool over here.

1344
01:03:13,413 --> 01:03:16,041
You've a good sense of humor.

1345
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:19,976
Tso.

1346
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,584
Where's that stone i brought back?

1347
01:03:23,623 --> 01:03:24,612
What stone?

1348
01:03:24,857 --> 01:03:26,290
What's this?

1349
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:27,417
i don't know.

1350
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,720
is it the one l brought back?

1351
01:03:28,795 --> 01:03:29,591
i don't know.

1352
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:34,192
i've found it!

1353
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,029
You took it away while i was using it.

1354
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:37,900
Mr. Fu,

1355
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:39,268
you came from Beijing to Canton,

1356
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:41,899
and got back the jade seal.

1357
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,340
The jade seal is a Chinese Royal emblem.

1358
01:03:43,376 --> 01:03:44,809
It mustn't be taken away by foreigners.

1359
01:03:44,844 --> 01:03:46,209
Right you are.

1360
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:47,404
Sir.

1361
01:03:47,447 --> 01:03:48,505
There have so far been over...

1362
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:49,879
...a dozen Emperors in China.

1363
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,850
Missing one jade seal is not too serious.

1364
01:03:51,884 --> 01:03:53,579
If you tolerate the plunder of a jade seal now,

1365
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,280
tomorrow he may...

1366
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,812
...pull down the Great Wall.

1367
01:03:57,857 --> 01:04:01,315
Then our children will have to go aboard...

1368
01:04:01,361 --> 01:04:04,330
...to see Chinese treasure.

1369
01:04:04,364 --> 01:04:07,822
Don't you know why the Allies...

1370
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:09,562
...invaded Beijing?

1371
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:12,799
To seize the large territory of China.

1372
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:14,932
Would they restain themselves...

1373
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,805
...if you don't collect yourself?

1374
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:19,607
It's but natural that might wins.

1375
01:04:19,645 --> 01:04:22,170
You won't win respect without spines.

1376
01:04:22,215 --> 01:04:24,581
Anyone gets bulled if he bullies himself,

1377
01:04:24,617 --> 01:04:25,777
understand?

1378
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:27,984
I do. Thanks for your guidance, sir.

1379
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:29,146
Come on, drink.

1380
01:04:29,255 --> 01:04:30,187
Let's drink.

1381
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:36,895
What happened? Why so quiet?

1382
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:37,759
Right.

1383
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,525
They left without saying a word.

1384
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:41,928
Let me go and see if Tsan has come.

1385
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:47,201
Where's everybody in the street?

1386
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:56,578
Chop them, kill them!

1387
01:05:01,087 --> 01:05:03,351
What a crowd. Fei-hung, you got first.

1388
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:10,788
I'll lead.

1389
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:10,016
Fei-hung, grasp it.

1390
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:16,952
Go, sir.

1391
01:06:36,682 --> 01:06:38,240
How's the situation?

1392
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:39,340
No problem.

1393
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:41,080
We The Ax Gang...

1394
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,610
...never miss.

1395
01:06:42,655 --> 01:06:44,452
So much the better.

1396
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:47,918
Fei-hung.

1397
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:52,226
Come on!

1398
01:07:50,189 --> 01:07:51,121
Sir.

1399
01:08:06,205 --> 01:08:07,570
Undress.

1400
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,130
Undress now!

1401
01:08:09,642 --> 01:08:10,540
OK.

1402
01:08:14,313 --> 01:08:15,644
Catch!

1403
01:08:59,358 --> 01:08:59,915
Follow me!

1404
01:09:00,693 --> 01:09:01,853
After him!

1405
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:09,401
Run!

1406
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:20,407
What are you doing?

1407
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,140
No boat today. Why stand there?

1408
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:24,240
Go.

1409
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:25,284
Come quick!

1410
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:27,510
Sir.

1411
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:45,899
Stop chasing!

1412
01:09:46,005 --> 01:09:46,801
Go.

1413
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:48,671
Sir.

1414
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:51,072
Sir.

1415
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:55,574
Sir.

1416
01:09:56,015 --> 01:09:57,642
Help him up quick!

1417
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:00,045
Are you all right?

1418
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:01,411
Are you all right?

1419
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:04,583
Sir.

1420
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:05,749
Sir. Are you all right?

1421
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:06,721
Sir.

1422
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:08,520
Sir.

1423
01:10:08,627 --> 01:10:10,185
Sir.

1424
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:11,687
The jade seal...

1425
01:10:11,764 --> 01:10:13,391
Don't worry, sir, I'll get it back for you.

1426
01:10:13,432 --> 01:10:14,865
We'll get it back for sure.

1427
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:19,233
Forget it. You can't beat them.

1428
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:20,295
Sir, hold on.

1429
01:10:20,339 --> 01:10:21,306
I'll help you back to Po Chi Lam.

1430
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,238
My dad will treat you.

1431
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,071
Don't die. He'll help you for sure.

1432
01:10:25,311 --> 01:10:25,834
Sir.

1433
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:26,536
Sir.

1434
01:10:26,612 --> 01:10:27,374
Wake up!

1435
01:10:27,413 --> 01:10:28,345
Sir.

1436
01:10:28,447 --> 01:10:29,471
Sir.

1437
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:33,982
What's on your mind?

1438
01:10:35,855 --> 01:10:37,220
Nothing.

1439
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:56,633
Tsan.

1440
01:11:56,702 --> 01:11:57,669
Fei-hung.

1441
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:01,506
Why didn't you tell me you would come here?

1442
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:02,700
Neither did you.

1443
01:12:08,714 --> 01:12:09,646
Have you found the jade seal?

1444
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,309
I'd have left if l had found it. Come.

1445
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:21,652
It's pitch dark. Have you brought fire?

1446
01:12:21,694 --> 01:12:22,524
Yes.

1447
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:23,789
Light it quick!

1448
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,496
Welcome.

1449
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:05,400
You want to get back this.

1450
01:13:06,338 --> 01:13:08,738
You really are too naive.

1451
01:13:08,774 --> 01:13:10,867
I've already taken photos of you.

1452
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,845
Intrusion into a consulate means invasion.

1453
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:16,006
 I can punish you any way l like.

1454
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:18,141
Kill us if you've the guts.

1455
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:35,693
Good.

1456
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:40,162
Do you understand what i said?

1457
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:41,228
Yes.

1458
01:13:48,213 --> 01:13:50,010
We planned to buy the land...

1459
01:13:50,049 --> 01:13:51,209
...of Po Chi Lam, but failed.

1460
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,617
Now we've thrown out those boxers

1461
01:13:54,653 --> 01:13:57,816
Right, Po Chi Lam has been in power for too long

1462
01:13:57,856 --> 01:13:59,881
Now it's our turn.

1463
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:01,916
Send someone to Po Chi Lam,

1464
01:14:01,961 --> 01:14:04,828
and tell him his son sneaked...

1465
01:14:04,863 --> 01:14:06,194
...into our consulate illegally.

1466
01:14:06,265 --> 01:14:07,323
and see what he says.

1467
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:08,890
Only if he agrees to sell the land...

1468
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:10,196
...of Sha Min to us cheap,

1469
01:14:10,235 --> 01:14:11,702
we'll free his son.

1470
01:14:11,737 --> 01:14:13,602
And we can sit back and relax.

1471
01:14:15,107 --> 01:14:16,699
He really is foolhardy.

1472
01:14:16,742 --> 01:14:18,642
A consulate is foreign territory.

1473
01:14:18,677 --> 01:14:21,669
Any intruders are shot on sight.

1474
01:14:21,714 --> 01:14:23,147
I'll go and talk...

1475
01:14:23,182 --> 01:14:23,648
...with them.

1476
01:14:23,682 --> 01:14:25,013
Sit down!

1477
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:26,142
You think it's so easy?

1478
01:14:26,185 --> 01:14:27,049
It's already vexing enough...

1479
01:14:27,086 --> 01:14:28,815
...to have a son captured.

1480
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:30,285
They merely wanted to be heroes.

1481
01:14:30,322 --> 01:14:31,914
They're not criminals.

1482
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:33,254
It was all your fault.

1483
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:35,089
You taught him patriotism

1484
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:37,361
You lack the dignity of a mother.

1485
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,294
Are you blaming it on me?

1486
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:41,731
Try to do something, I beg you.

1487
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:42,699
I can't.

1488
01:14:42,768 --> 01:14:44,702
Nor can i.

1489
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,230
The truth is obvious.

1490
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:49,434
The British are after the land of Sha Min.

1491
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:50,499
You mean giving it...

1492
01:14:50,542 --> 01:14:51,907
...away to them?

1493
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:54,606
If he wants to be a hero, let him,

1494
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:56,512
and don't take him for a son.

1495
01:14:56,849 --> 01:14:59,818
If you won't help your son,

1496
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:01,376
I'll beg his mother to.

1497
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:08,418
Sister, your son's in trouble

1498
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,951
and now none wants to help him.

1499
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:13,328
Please show me your divine powers.

1500
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:15,492
Release them.

1501
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:28,738
OK, release them.

1502
01:15:40,659 --> 01:15:42,126
Are you all right?

1503
01:15:42,194 --> 01:15:43,957
Your mom's over there.

1504
01:15:46,298 --> 01:15:47,856
Master Wong.

1505
01:15:50,402 --> 01:15:51,300
Mom.

1506
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:53,462
They've beaten you badly.

1507
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,803
I'll be OK mom

1508
01:15:56,241 --> 01:15:57,230
Auntie.

1509
01:15:57,409 --> 01:15:58,876
Master, are you all right?

1510
01:15:58,911 --> 01:16:00,742
Yes, only a few bruises.

1511
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:02,440
Master, where are we moving to?

1512
01:16:02,481 --> 01:16:03,641
What do you mean?

1513
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:06,082
Master Wong has sold the land in Sha Min.

1514
01:16:06,118 --> 01:16:07,449
What?

1515
01:16:08,187 --> 01:16:09,552
What has dad done?

1516
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:11,350
To help you, Master Wong did it.

1517
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,857
He sold the land...

1518
01:16:12,891 --> 01:16:14,916
...cheap to the consulate.

1519
01:16:16,161 --> 01:16:19,324
Fei-hung, I covered up for you each time,

1520
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,594
but not now.

1521
01:16:21,633 --> 01:16:22,964
You like to...

1522
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,366
...butt in?

1523
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:27,099
I regret not having taken dad's advise.

1524
01:16:27,272 --> 01:16:30,207
It's not too late for you to repent now.

1525
01:16:30,242 --> 01:16:33,177
Learn a lesson...

1526
01:16:33,212 --> 01:16:36,511
...and forget the past.

1527
01:16:36,582 --> 01:16:38,447
Take it as a lesson.

1528
01:16:38,484 --> 01:16:41,282
Go back.

1529
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:48,757
When will they be sailing for HK?

1530
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:51,756
In 10 days.

1531
01:16:52,598 --> 01:16:53,792
Have you completed production?

1532
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:55,128
No problem.

1533
01:16:55,501 --> 01:16:56,763
Good.

1534
01:16:56,935 --> 01:16:58,459
Close the factory...

1535
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:00,062
...for the time being lay them off.

1536
01:17:00,105 --> 01:17:02,198
After the shipment leaves,

1537
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:03,469
find cheaper workers.

1538
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:04,509
Yes.

1539
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:11,849
They always force us to work overtime.

1540
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:14,614
If we refuse, they beat us up.

1541
01:17:14,653 --> 01:17:16,814
Now they dismiss us...

1542
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:19,119
...without paying.

1543
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:21,217
and we have...

1544
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,284
...to starve.

1545
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:24,192
There are no good foreigners.

1546
01:17:24,329 --> 01:17:25,523
Tsan, what happened?

1547
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:26,655
Let's talk about that later.

1548
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:28,063
The one who hit us is the foreman...

1549
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,761
...of the steel factory.

1550
01:17:29,802 --> 01:17:30,894
Right.

1551
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:33,068
Tsan, forget it.

1552
01:17:33,105 --> 01:17:34,629
The less trouble the better.

1553
01:17:34,673 --> 01:17:36,834
What? That kid's cocky.

1554
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,843
He beat us if we refused to work OT.

1555
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:40,469
And he stops our work at will too.

1556
01:17:40,512 --> 01:17:42,878
Look, they've promised us nothing.

1557
01:17:43,148 --> 01:17:45,343
How could the factory have suddenly closed?

1558
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:46,406
I've lately noticed they've...

1559
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:47,850
...been acting sneaky.

1560
01:17:47,886 --> 01:17:51,117
They msut be up to no good.

1561
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:54,619
Fei-hung, what now?

1562
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,787
Go with Uncle Hing...

1563
01:17:56,829 --> 01:17:57,386
...see what's happened.

1564
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:58,987
Is there really something fishy?

1565
01:17:59,398 --> 01:18:01,195
Then we'll try to do something, okay?

1566
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:02,164
Let's go.

1567
01:18:18,217 --> 01:18:20,185
Looks valuable.

1568
01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:20,981
Why's the curio hidden...

1569
01:18:21,019 --> 01:18:22,816
...in the steel for shipment.

1570
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:23,912
I'll go and tell them.

1571
01:18:23,956 --> 01:18:24,980
Go quick.

1572
01:18:56,755 --> 01:18:57,983
Go quick.

1573
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:06,220
Quick.

1574
01:19:06,298 --> 01:19:06,855
Go quick.

1575
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:07,490
Go.

1576
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:11,029
This way.

1577
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:13,426
Get them!

1578
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:18,569
Run quick!

1579
01:19:19,511 --> 01:19:21,103
Leave me alone!

1580
01:19:36,995 --> 01:19:38,223
Shit!

1581
01:19:40,265 --> 01:19:41,926
Young master, we're leaving.

1582
01:19:43,602 --> 01:19:44,967
Go into hiding!

1583
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:47,400
Bye.

1584
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:48,701
Madam, we're leaving.

1585
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,537
Good, take care on the journey.

1586
01:19:51,209 --> 01:19:52,198
Mind your belly.

1587
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:53,471
I will.

1588
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:55,577
Fei-hung.

1589
01:19:56,848 --> 01:19:57,837
Dad.

1590
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,508
Keep on writing.

1591
01:19:59,551 --> 01:20:01,143
You know what to do.

1592
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:02,811
I'll remember what you said.

1593
01:20:02,854 --> 01:20:04,048
I'll visit the drought zone for a few days.

1594
01:20:04,423 --> 01:20:07,085
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

1595
01:20:07,526 --> 01:20:08,857
Take care now that...

1596
01:20:08,894 --> 01:20:09,986
...you're pregnant.

1597
01:20:10,095 --> 01:20:11,027
I will.

1598
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:12,028
i must leave.

1599
01:20:14,099 --> 01:20:16,693
Master, i want to have a word with you.

1600
01:20:16,735 --> 01:20:18,566
If it's a boy,

1601
01:20:18,603 --> 01:20:19,968
call him Wong Tai.

1602
01:20:20,038 --> 01:20:20,527
Yes.

1603
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:21,869
lf its a girl, call her Wong Fei.

1604
01:20:22,574 --> 01:20:23,973
OK.

1605
01:20:24,209 --> 01:20:26,006
You're only 4 months' pregnant, still early.

1606
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:27,636
It may be premature.

1607
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,271
It's taboo.

1608
01:20:29,314 --> 01:20:30,246
I'll be away for a few days only.

1609
01:20:30,282 --> 01:20:31,044
Good.

1610
01:20:31,316 --> 01:20:33,944
Fei-hung, remember.

1611
01:20:34,019 --> 01:20:35,247
Yes.

1612
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:36,379
Master Wong, time to leave.

1613
01:20:36,455 --> 01:20:37,149
Coming.

1614
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:39,622
I'll rein Fei-hung in.

1615
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:41,523
Take good care on the road. Come back early.

1616
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,527
Take care.

1617
01:20:43,428 --> 01:20:44,827
You may come out.

1618
01:20:49,434 --> 01:20:51,493
They really ship away the Chinese treasure.

1619
01:20:51,536 --> 01:20:53,367
Wonder how Uncle Hing's.

1620
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:54,530
I've got him involved.

1621
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:55,403
Don't be silly.

1622
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,702
No Chinese would tolerate...

1623
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:59,711
...seeing treasures being shipped away.

1624
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:01,109
What now, mom?

1625
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:03,379
Come with me.

1626
01:21:03,749 --> 01:21:05,580
Mom, where are you going?

1627
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:07,049
Beat the bastard!

1628
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:09,042
Dad said...

1629
01:21:09,121 --> 01:21:10,816
Madam, you're pregnant.

1630
01:21:11,723 --> 01:21:14,419
Only 4 months, nothing serious.

1631
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:16,820
Auntie, we told Master Wong...

1632
01:21:16,862 --> 01:21:19,422
...nothing would happen to you.

1633
01:21:19,731 --> 01:21:22,063
Right, that son of the bitch is lucky.

1634
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,034
Tell Fun to get helpers.

1635
01:21:24,102 --> 01:21:25,729
Fine, I'm on my way.

1636
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:28,399
See you at the bridgehead.

1637
01:21:29,274 --> 01:21:30,332
Fei-hung, let's go.

1638
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,034
Come.

1639
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:33,638
We're leaving.

1640
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:34,201
Take care.

1641
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:34,768
Yes.

1642
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,540
If anything happens to me,

1643
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:37,070
take care of my dad.

1644
01:21:37,115 --> 01:21:38,639
Daon't say things like that!

1645
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:39,513
One without ambitions...

1646
01:21:39,551 --> 01:21:40,916
...is not my worthy son!

1647
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:42,180
I'm Going.

1648
01:21:42,654 --> 01:21:44,178
Fei-hung.

1649
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:47,358
Don't ever come back if you get beaten.

1650
01:21:49,795 --> 01:21:51,524
Yes, mom.

1651
01:21:53,965 --> 01:21:55,796
Protest unreasonable closure,

1652
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:57,495
demand reasonable compensation!

1653
01:21:57,536 --> 01:21:59,299
Protest unreasonable closure,

1654
01:21:59,337 --> 01:22:00,497
demand reasonable compensation!

1655
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:03,133
Don't get carried away

1656
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:32,464
What are you doing here? Go away!

1657
01:22:32,537 --> 01:22:34,801
Hand over the treasure or we won't let you go

1658
01:22:34,873 --> 01:22:35,737
Bullshit!

1659
01:22:35,974 --> 01:22:36,804
"Bullshit"
Fuck You

1660
01:22:36,842 --> 01:22:38,469
Hand over Uncle Hing quickly...

1661
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,943
...or we'll get nasty.

1662
01:22:40,011 --> 01:22:41,342
So what?

1663
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:49,181
Throw them out!

1664
01:22:56,361 --> 01:22:56,725
Don't move!

1665
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,319
Don't shoot!

1666
01:23:21,753 --> 01:23:24,881
Fei-hung, come and rescue Uncle Hing!

1667
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:01,292
Come on!

1668
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,501
Fei-hung.

1669
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:04,375
Don't.

1670
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:06,708
Go and rescue Uncle Hing.

1671
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:08,107
I know where he is.

1672
01:26:08,186 --> 01:26:09,619
Good. Keep an eye on him.

1673
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:21,989
Wong Fei-hung's rushing in!

1674
01:26:22,033 --> 01:26:22,692
Stop him!

1675
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:23,529
Yes.

1676
01:26:42,253 --> 01:26:43,550
Wait.

1677
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:45,979
Don't you know what you're doing?

1678
01:26:46,024 --> 01:26:47,753
He's helping foreigners ship away...

1679
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,157
...China's treasure. Why help him?

1680
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:53,887
State treasure? What about our empty stomachs?

1681
01:26:53,932 --> 01:26:56,264
Others will do it if they don't.

1682
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:57,859
I won't let you do it.

1683
01:26:58,002 --> 01:26:59,867
Have you got the guts?

1684
01:26:59,904 --> 01:27:01,201
We saw through...

1685
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:03,469
...you, when we beat you.

1686
01:27:03,508 --> 01:27:06,272
Didn't that consulate beating hurt enough?

1687
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:07,243
I want to try it again.

1688
01:27:07,312 --> 01:27:11,009
Fine, I'll get you carried away horizontally.

1689
01:27:11,416 --> 01:27:12,940
Too much talk.

1690
01:27:12,984 --> 01:27:14,451
Go kill him.

1691
01:27:14,519 --> 01:27:15,451
Act!

1692
01:27:16,855 --> 01:27:18,049
Act!

1693
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:18,814
Come on!

1694
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:52,618
Finish him off!

1695
01:28:27,492 --> 01:28:28,481
Come on!

1696
01:29:22,113 --> 01:29:24,013
Drag him over, quick!

1697
01:30:57,475 --> 01:30:59,739
Drunken boxing.

1698
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:03,310
Just so-so.

1699
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,080
Come on.

1700
01:31:30,575 --> 01:31:32,372
I can also use my fists.

1701
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:52,111
Water floats but also capsizes boats

1702
01:32:53,491 --> 01:32:55,459
Now you are beyond help

1703
01:34:51,776 --> 01:34:53,641
Jump to it

1704
01:34:55,079 --> 01:34:56,512
Damn you

1705
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,621
Mr. Wong, thank your son for his efforts...

1706
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:29,649
...to protect a national antique.

1707
01:38:29,693 --> 01:38:31,627
You really are a good father.

1708
01:38:31,729 --> 01:38:33,560
General, we might as well tell you.

1709
01:38:33,597 --> 01:38:35,326
Master taught Fei-hung...

1710
01:38:35,366 --> 01:38:38,062
...drunken boxing.

1711
01:38:38,102 --> 01:38:38,796
Really?

1712
01:38:38,836 --> 01:38:40,167
So your drunken boxing is even more powerful?

1713
01:38:40,204 --> 01:38:41,193
Yes, thank you.

1714
01:38:41,238 --> 01:38:43,172
Like father like son.

1715
01:38:43,808 --> 01:38:45,070
Where's Fei-hung?

1716
01:38:45,176 --> 01:38:46,336
General,

1717
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:48,537
to demonstrate his boxing,

1718
01:38:48,579 --> 01:38:50,137
Fei-hung wrongly drank industrial...

1719
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:52,342
...alcohol affecting his eyes.

1720
01:38:52,983 --> 01:38:55,213
But the doctor said it can be treated.

1721
01:38:55,252 --> 01:38:56,116
He's so active,

1722
01:38:56,153 --> 01:38:57,848
he'll be sorry if he can't see anything.

1723
01:38:57,888 --> 01:38:59,651
This is only a temporary symptom.

1724
01:38:59,757 --> 01:39:00,781
Over here.

1725
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:02,017
Take photos.

1726
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:04,786
Let's go in to see him.

1727
01:39:04,862 --> 01:39:05,351
Good, good.

1728
01:39:05,429 --> 01:39:06,088
Please, please.

1729
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:07,028
Hang it up.

1730
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,294
He's here.

1731
01:39:19,677 --> 01:39:20,735
What's he doing?

1732
01:39:20,778 --> 01:39:22,006
Practicing blind boxing.

1733
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:26,406
Master, The doctor said..said....

1734
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,441
He said the alcohol not only ruined his eyes,

1735
01:39:28,486 --> 01:39:29,976
but his brain too.

1736
01:39:29,977 --> 01:40:00,977
