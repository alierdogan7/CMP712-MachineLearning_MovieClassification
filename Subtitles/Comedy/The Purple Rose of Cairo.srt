is proud to present, Miss Kitty Hayne.

175
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:23,562
Ours could be a different sort of love affair

177
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,484
Mmm.

178
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,989
I think our poetic little archeologist
is about to make a discovery.

179
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,158
Well, ain't life swell.

180
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,410
Hey, open the champagne.

181
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,080
I feel like getting plushed to the scuppers.

Ah, miss, could I have the check, please?

185
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,683
Come on, the man wants his check.

186
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,518
Oh, sorry.

187
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,895
Sorry.

188
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,689
So what were you thinking about?

189

Oh, a penthouse, the desert...

190
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,903
- Oh, God.
- Kissing on a dance floor.

191
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,698
So, you did
go to the movies last night after all.

192
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,991
The people were so beautiful.

193
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,160
- They spoke so cleverly...
- Really?

194
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,745
...and they do such romantic things.

195
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,163
- Listen, well, I mean...
- Ah, I'm sorry I missed it.

196
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,081
The one they've got
playing Tom Baxter, he was so cute.

197
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,499
Hey, you want to go
to the movies after work?

198
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,584
Yes, I'd love to.

199
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,668
- I'd love to see it again.
- Let's go then.

200
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,171
Come on, what is this, a social club?
I got a sink full of dirty dishes.

201
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,214

You have yourself quite a place here.

205

You know, I still can't get over
the fact that 24 hours ago,

206
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,814
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

that glass of champagne at the Copacabana.

I'm home, Monk.

213
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,171
What are you doing home so early?

214
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,839
I thought I said you can go to the movies.

- No, you're drunk.

Uh, what do you mean drunk? I'm not drunk.

That stuff you made
yesterday was delicious.

- What's going on?
- I'm moving out.

Now what are you talking about?
What's wrong?

234

What? Because of before?

235
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,455
Because of Olga? Is that it?

236
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,832
Because that would be funny.
That would be ridiculous

237

out of yourself than you usually are.

I always warn you first,

00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,451
I was in an Egyptian tomb.

341
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,369
I didn't know any of you wonderful people,

342
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:07,168
and here I am now. I'm on the verge
of a madcap Manhattan weekend.

343
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,005
My God, you must really love this picture.

344
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,674
- Me?
- You've been here all day,

345
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,218
and I've seen you here twice before.

346
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,387
- You mean me?
- Yes, you, you. You've...

347
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,015
This is the fifth time you're seeing this.

348
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,601
(WHISPERING) Henry, come here, quickly.

349
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,770
- I gotta speak to you.
- (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)

350
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,106
(SCREAMS)

351
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,066
HENRY: Listen, old sport,
you're on the wrong side.

352
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,234
Tom, get back here,

353
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,693
- we're in the middle of a story!
- Leave me alone.

354
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,654
I want to have a look around.
You go on without me.

355
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,405
- HENRY: We can't continue with the story!
- Who are you?

356
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,532
(STAMMERING) Cecilia.

357
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,117
I'll go get the manager!

358
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,160
Let's get out of here
and go somewhere where we can talk.

359
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,829
But you're in the movie!

360
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,789
Wrong, Cecilia, I'm free!

361
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,668
After 2,000 performances
of the same monotonous routine, I'm free!

362
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,837
- HENRY: Call Father Donnelly.
- Tom!

363
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,382
I don't understand. What's going on?

364
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,758
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

365
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,553
You've seen the movie five times.
I'm Tom Baxter.

366
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,222
Poet, adventurer, explorer,
of the Chicago Baxters.

367
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,390
Well, yes, I know you're Tom Baxter.

368
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,350
You wind up with Kitty Haynes,
the nightclub singer,

369
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,893
- but still, I don't...
- Not anymore, I don't have to.

370
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,896
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm out before the wedding. I'm free.

371
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,189
Don't you have to marry her?

372
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,941
Not while I'm here and she's up there.

373
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,693
Don't you want to? She's so beautiful.

374
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,486
She's not for me. She's too bony.

375
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,655
Kitty Haynes, the nightclub singer, is bony?

376
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,323
I need a place to hide!

377
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,076
Look, I'm never going back,
now that I've met you.

378
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,121
A place to hide? A place to hide?

379
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,582
What's happening? What's going on?

380
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,834
Tom's left. He just walked right out.

381
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,794
I don't know how he did it. I can't get out.

382
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,920
This is just disgusting.

383
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,423
I am an heiress
and I don't have to put up with this!

384
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,883
He left the picture?

385
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,010
Oh, my gosh. Well, don't panic.

386
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,179
Just stay up there and keep calm.

387
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,305
Keep calm?

388
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,431
Are you crazy?
What do you mean, "keep calm"?

389
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,141
- Somebody call for a priest?
- Thank God you're here.

390
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,226
- Wait a minute, this is the second reel.
- That's the point.

391
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,145
- I'm not on till later.
- Tom's gone.

392
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,688
Can't you go on? There's an audience.

393
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,065
RITA: How?
Tom was the linchpin of the story.

394
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,567
That's right! Whoever you are, you see, sir,

395
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,651
although this is basically my story,

396
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,653
- Tom moves the exposition along.
- What do you mean, your story?

397
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,738
It's not your story,

398
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,698
it's the story
of a man's quest for self-fulfillment.

399
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,742
- It's the story of a complex, tortured soul.
- Oh, stop that...

400
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,327
It's story of the effect of money
on true romance...

401
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,453
I don't think money comes into it.

402
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,663
...my upbringing, my wealth,
my private schools.

403
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,874
I'm the one who marries royalty.

404
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,250
- I'm the one...
- Nobody cares...

405
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,793
A humble kid...
What do you mean, they don't care?

406
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,171
They wouldn't
sell a ticket if it were your story.

407
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,173
(ALL ARGUING)

408
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,800
- Stop arguing.
- RITA: And do what?

409
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,719
Maybe you should just
turn the projector off.

410
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,763
No! No! Don't turn the projector off!

411
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,681
No! No, it gets black and we disappear.

412
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,642
- Calm down...
- Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

413
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,310
Easy, my son. We're all in this together.

414
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,897
Yes, but you don't
understand what it's like to disappear

415
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,815
and to be nothing, to be annihilated.

416
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,859
So don't turn the projector off.

417
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,694
Miss Rita, your bath is ready.

418
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,655
- Not now, dear.
- Well, what's going on?

419
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,031
- Come in and sit down, Delilah.
- Be quiet, Delilah.

420
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,157
Well, what's he doing here?

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,576
- Have a martini.
- He's not supposed to be here till reel six.

422
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,662
- We know that, Delilah.
- What the hell is going on?

423
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,871
Is somebody trying to hustle me?

424
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,081
They're not trying to hustle you.

425
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,044
TOM: Hey, I know what this is,
it's an amusement park!

426
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,922
CECILIA: Yeah, it's usually pretty dead
around here until summer.

427
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,424
I know exactly what an amusement park is,

428
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,718
- and what goes on. I do!
- Well, good.

429
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,137
It's written into my character.

430
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,764
Remember, I invite Kitty to Luna Park,

431
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,391
but she prefers just to stay home and talk?

432
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,018
- Oh, yes.
- So, it's in me!

433
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,521
Oh, too bad nothing's open. I'm starved!

434
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,939
- Oh, you are?
- Well, yeah,

435
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,358
I, uh, left the movie
before the Copacabana scene.

436
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,110
- So that's when I usually eat.
- Oh, wait a minute,

437
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,570
what am I thinking?
Look, here, I've got a whole bag of popcorn.

438
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,489
- You can have that.
- Oh, wow.

439
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,491
Also, I have a Milky Way bar you might...

440
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,160
- No, that's, popcorn is...
- You might want it later.

441
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,579
Boy!

442
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,707
So that's what popcorn tastes like.

443
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,377
I've been watching
people eat it for all those performances.

444
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,671
When they rattle
those bags, though, that's, uh...

445
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,964
- That's not...
...kind of annoying.

446
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,300
I still don't understand what's going on.

447
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,884
I wanted to meet you.

448
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,511
Don't tell me you
didn't see me looking at you

449
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,179
just out of the corner of my eye.

450
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,973
When Kitty Haynes
was doing her nightclub number?

451
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,976
Oh, wait a minute,
I did, I remember seeing you kind of...

452
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,936
You were looking
off to the side, somehow, but...

453
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,272
- Sure.
- I never thought it was to me.

454
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,899
Yeah, when we
take the drive to that little country inn?

455
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,901
When I propose to Kitty?
I was looking at you.

456
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,279
Oh, no, Kitty
looked so beautiful in that black dress.

457
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,573
Oh, no, she's nothing compared to you.

458
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,326
What are you talking about? I'm nothing.

459
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,369
Like hell you are. You are fetching.

460
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,455
- Fetching?
- Fetching.

461
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,041
Dad liked to use that word
about Mom back in Chicago.

462
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,418
"Man!" he'd say, "You're rather fetching."

463
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,711
(GIGGLES)

464
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,755
Dad was a card.

465
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,090
I never met him.
He died before the movie begins.

466
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,635
I have to confess.
My eye did always go to you

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,930
- up on the screen. Really.
- Really?

468
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,517
Even when I'm around Detective Sims
and Henry Adams, the playboy.

469
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,103
Yes, even though
you're not the main character,

470
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,646
you're the one you look at.

471
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,982
You don't think I'm the main character.

472
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,943
Oh, I didn't mean it that way. No!

473
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,780
I think you were positively essential.

474
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,282
In fact, every time
I saw the movie I kept thinking,

475
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,284
"Tom Baxter's so handsome."

476
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,369
(CHUCKLING)

477
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,125
Shouldn't you be getting back?

478
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,128
I want to live.
I want to be free to make my own choices.

479
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,798
Right now,
the country's not in such great shape.

480
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,385
- What do you mean?
- Well, we're in the middle of a depression.

481
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,136
Everybody's very poor...

482
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,473
I got plenty, look at this!

483
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,353
But, they need you.
The story doesn't work without you.

484
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,855
Cecilia, I'm in love with you.

485
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,233
I'm married...

486
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,151
Happily?

487
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,738
I really should get back home.
I have to cook dinner.

488
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,490
Just slip away from your husband tonight.

489
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,158
Meet me here. I'll wait for you.

490
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,786
I want to learn
about the real world with you.

491
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,246
I can't.

492
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,622
Well, look at it this way.

493
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,166
How many times
is a man so taken with a woman

494
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,210
that he walks off the screen to get her?

495
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,091
Okay, okay, let's not panic. We're all adults.

496
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,843
Bored of sitting around.
I'm a dramatic character.

497
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,010
I need forward motion.

498
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,470
Here comes the Countess and Larry.

499
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,763
Where is everybody?

500
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,473
Weren't we meeting at the Copacabana?

501
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,016
- HENRY: Tom's gone.
- What?

502
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,685
- He left the film.
- What?

503
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,270
The bum walked out on us.

504
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,772
(STAMMERING) But the Copa

00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,391
But I created the character.

673
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,851
That's my point.

674
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,520
As your agent, I would hate to see
anything happen to your career,

675
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,896
now that it is starting to move.

676
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,189
- What, like, like, like what?
- Who knows?

677
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,732
There's a double of you on the loose.

678
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,402
What's he up to?
Is he robbing banks? Is he raping broads?

679
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,195
- But, is he?
- Who knows?

680
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,364
Look, the last thing we need

681
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,533
- is for you to get a...
- Shh.

682
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,327
The last thing we need
is for you to get a reputation

683
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,496
- as somehow difficult.
- But I'm not, it's not my fault!

684
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,125
Raoul Hirsch already said,
if you can't control your own creation,

685
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,960
- nobody's going to risk a picture on you.
- Oh, my God!

686
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,045
There goes...
I mean, I worked so hard to make him real.

687
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,547
- Yeah, well, maybe you overdid it.
- Jeez!

688
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,007
- I'll sue my dialogue coach, that louse.
- Look,

689
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,217
you've got to fly down there
and check into this, quick.

690
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,636
Right now, it's only one movie house,
but who knows?

691
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,471
I can't, I'm afraid to fly.

692
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,516
Gil, this is the scandal of all time.

693
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,603
You know what happened
to Fatty Arbuckle's career?

694
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,605
- I'll fly. I'll fly.
- Good.

695
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,983
This is how they drink champagne in Cairo.

696
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,361
I never had champagne before.

697
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,323
- I feel... It makes me feel silly.
- It's supposed to.

698
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,657
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

699
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,950
The check, as you requested, sir.

700
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,201
Ah.

701
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,287
Ah! It's so much!

702
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,122
- Oh...
- I hope found it to your liking, sir.

703
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,499
- It was superb.
- Oh, it was. It was wonderful.

704
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,710
My compliments to the chef.

705
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,463
And, uh, keep 20% for yourself.

706
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,257
No, make that 30%.

707
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,967
Yes, quite amusing.

708
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,012
- What is?
- The fake money.

709
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,348
Fake money?

710
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,059
Is it, uh, play money, sir, or stage money?

711
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,022
Keep 30% for yourself,
and stop looking so serious.

712
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,858
I'll get the Maitre D'.

713
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,986
Tom, that's not real money.

714
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,490
Well, what do you mean it's not real money?

715
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,367
Oh, my God.

716
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,328
Uh, do you have any money?

717
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,372
No. What are we going to do?

718
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,624
We're going to have to make a run for it.

719
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,877
No, I can't run.
My ankles are bad from waitressing.

720
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,046
Just get up. Follow me.

721
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,104
TOM: Quick, get in the car.

722
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,858
Tom, this is not our car!

723
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,527
We don't have a car. We came by foot.

724
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,445
- It doesn't go.
- Well, of course, it doesn't go.

725
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,655
There's no key.

726
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,031
I just, hey, I don't understand.

727
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,616
- This is how I always go in the movie.
- Oh, Tom,

728
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,994
this is real life.
They don't start without a key!

729
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,829
- They don't? Let's go.
- No!

730
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,580
- Hey, you two, get back here!
- They're leaving.

731
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,832
You can't run out on these checks.

732
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,083
They're a couple of deadbeats.

733
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,668
Get back here, right now!

734
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,965
TOM: I'm sorry about the money.
I had no idea.

735
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,842
CECILIA: Oh, that's okay.

736
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,137
It's not going to be so easy
to get along without it in this world.

737
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,347
TOM: Oh, I guess I have to get a job.

738
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,974
But that's not going to be so easy, either.

739
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,934
Right now, the whole country's out of work.

740
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,936
Well, then we'll live on love.

741
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,105
We'll have to make some concessions,
but so what?

742
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,649
- We'll have each other.
- That's movie talk.

743
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,235
You look so beautiful in this light.

744
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,945
But you're not real.

745
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,874
Was that real enough for you?

746
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,795
You kiss perfectly.
It's what I dreamed kissing would be like.

747
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,881
Come away with me to Cairo.

748
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,965
Cairo?

749
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,677
We'll live in the desert.
It will... Oh, the blue-gold light of sunset

750
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,596
- falling over your hair and the...
- Look, I'm sorry.

751
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,807
I'm a little tipsy. I... From the...

752
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,652
- Where's the fade out?
- What?

753
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,323
Always when the kissing gets hot and
heavy, just before the love-making,

754
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,866
there's a fade out.

755
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,868
Oh, then what?

756
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,538
Then, then we're making love
in some private, perfect place.

757
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,334
Oh, that's not how it happens here.

758
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,337
- What, there's no fade out?
- No...

759
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,424
But when you kissed me,
I felt like my heart faded out,

760
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,262
and I closed my eyes
and I was in some, some private place.

761
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,807
How fascinating.

762
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,101
You make love without fading out?

763
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,769
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
- Yes.

764
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,855
Well, I can't wait to see this.

765
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,651
Listen, I can't...

766
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,861
I'm not that kind of girl.

767
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,613
I'm married.

768
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,367
Cecilia,

769
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,411
it's clear how miserable
you are with your husband,

770
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,708
and if he hits you again, you tell me.

771
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,211
I'd be forced to knock his teeth out.

772
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,338
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

773
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,798
He's big.

774
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,842
Well, I'm sorry.
It's written into my character to do it,

775
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,051
so I do it.

776
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,514
Listen, I think I better go home now.

777
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,057
- It's late.
- Okay.

778
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,517
It's been a whirlwind of a day.

779
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,726
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

780
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,228
What are you gonna do?

781
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,273
Um, I'll just... I'll sleep here at the carousel.

782
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,568
And walk around, drink in the night air.

783
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,113
Enjoy my freedom, and dream of you.

784
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,499
You got in late last night.

785
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,710
Oh, yeah, you were out like a light.

786
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,753
I took a hot bath to relax me.

787
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,589
You want to get me a cup of coffee?

788
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,257
Oh, yeah, sure.

789
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,093
There was some big
deal going on over at the movie house.

790
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,928
A big crowd when I went to buy cigarettes.

791
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,097
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I couldn't get the story straight.

792
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,933
There's some guy
who ran out the side exit with a customer.

793
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,811
- Who?
- Oh, a woman, a guy, uh, an actor.

794
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,563
I don't know what
the hell the cop was talking about.

795
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,606
He didn't know.

796
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,400
Well, they don't know who the woman was?

797
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,903
Some woman dragged out in the dark.

798
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,030
They got those real geronimos
at the movie houses.

799
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,282
See, that's why
I don't like you staying out so late at night.

800
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,909
(STAMMERING) I know. I couldn't help it.

801
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,161
The Lorenzos didn't get back till late.

802
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,287
I couldn't leave.

803
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,623
- Well, I hope you got paid overtime.
- Oh, sure.

804
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,958
Oh, good, good. Let's have it.

805
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,628
(STUTTERING) They, uh...
They didn't have any cash.

806
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,796
I'll have to come back for it later today.

807
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,257
Cecilia, I told you
to get paid, uh, in cash, didn't I?

808
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,636
Well, I know, but all they had was big bills,

809
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,137
and, um, you know, I was getting late,

810
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,222
- so I thought I better leave.
- Yeah, well,

811
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,057
- they're going to fork it over today, right?
- Oh, they will.

812
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,141
Yeah, yeah, sure.

813
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:12,270
Leave something to you,
you can bet you're going to get fouled up.

814
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,986
You have no idea where he went?

815
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,489
Mr. Hirsch, this is awful for us.

816
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,907
- Really difficult.
- Think of me,

817
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,742
my reputation, my career!

818
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,786
First thing we've gotta do,
is we gotta keep it contained.

819
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,995
- Yeah.
- The word's out already.

820
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,163
We gotta keep the crisis local.

821
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,624
I know the two reporters in town.
They're old friends.

822
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,667
- Maybe I could talk to them.
- Fine,

823
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,002
a couple of bucks
spread around town will buy us some time.

824
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,212
Don't worry about a thing...

825
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,464
I mean, we're all so lost.

826
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,548
HIRSCH: I know it's rough.

827
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,384
I just want the whole cast to know

828
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,262
how much I appreciate
your staying up there on the screen.

829
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,014
I hope you're not
going to hold this against me, R.H.

830
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,475
You created the part of Tom Baxter, Gil.

831
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,768
The facts are undeniable.

832
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,437
I want to go too.
I want to be free! I want out!

833
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,648
I'm warning you, that's Communist talk!

834
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,316
We're gonna
have to pull the film out of the theater

835
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,277
and you're going
to have to make good my receipts.

836
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,028
You mean, you're thinking of pulling the film

837
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,446
because a minor character is missing?

838
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,448
A minor character? Would you listen to her?

839
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,826
You know, he may not have the most lines,

840
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,411
but the plot turns on Baxter.

841
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,289
I deliberately played him
with a cheerful bravado.

842
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,832
Who cares how you played him?

843
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,916
- He's minor.
- That's right.

844
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,376
I would just like to get my hands on him.

845
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,044
Right when my career was taking off.

846
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,046
He could be raping
that woman he abducted.

847
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,966
And he's got my fingerprints,
my exact prints!

848
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,719
You know what
they get for rape in a small town,

849
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,846
especially by a man in a pith helmet?

850
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,682
If this is the start of a new trend,
our industry's as good as dead.

851
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,728
The real ones want their lives fiction,
and the fictional ones want their lives real.

852
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,396
Does anybody know who that woman was?

853
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,565
No. It was all so crazy, nobody noticed.

854
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,110
Just two doughnuts
and a container of coffee to go, please.

855
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,237
GIL: Right now, it's chaos.

856
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,532
Well, how can rumors
be circulating at the Brown Derby?

857
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,035
It just happened! Well, squash it, Herbie,

858
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,786
I got a career on the line.

859
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,540
Look, I'll call you the minute I hear.

860
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,044
Oh, excuse me.

861
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,420
(GASPING) What are you doing here?

862
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,006
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't have a pencil,
or I'd give you an autograph.

863
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,091
Where did you get those clothes?

864
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,844
- Pardon me?
- Your clothes, where did you get them?

865
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,263
Uh, a little store on Sunset and Vine.

866
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,890
What are you talking about?

867
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,683
What are you talking about?

868
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,934
Excuse me.

869
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,937
I just bought you these. Two doughnuts.

870
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,774
- For me? Well, thank you very much.
- Yeah. A container of coffee.

871
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,941
I hope you enjoy my next movie.

872
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,070
But, do you, I thought
you were going to stay hidden at the park.

873
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,446
What park?

874
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,864
Tom, what's the matter with you?

875
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,117
- You're acting so peculiar.
- Tom? No, no. I'm...

876
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,995
Wait a minute! Come here.

877
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,414
What's come over you?

878
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,291
I'm not Tom. I'm Gil Shepherd.

879
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,001
- I play Tom.
- What?

880
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,920
- How do you know Tom?
- You're Gil...

881
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,255
- Oh, my God. I don't believe it.
- Yeah.

882
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,966
You're Gil... I've seen you in lots of movies.

883
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,136
- Look, where's Tom?
- Oh! Broadway Bachelors, right? Right?

884
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,722
- Yeah, yeah, well, you know...
- Honeymoon in Haiti?

885
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,516
- Done about six.
- You were a scream.

886
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,267
- Well, thank you.
- (EXCLAIMING)

887
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,894
Thank you very much. That's...

888
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,146
I try to do one a year,
you know, just to keep...

889
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,649
Where's Tom?

890
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,942
Why?

891
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,194
Well, he's my character. I created him.

892
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,405
Well, didn't the man
who wrote the movie do that?

893
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,657
Yes, technically.

894
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,784
But I made him live. I fleshed him out.

895
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,579
But you did...
You did a wonderful job. He's adorable.

896
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,790
(CHUCKLING) Thank you very much.

897
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,167
(SIGHING) What's your name?

898
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,710
Cecilia.

899
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,087

Where is he?

902
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,592
- Why?
- Has he done anything wrong?

903
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,760
Wrong, like what?

904
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,972
Has he stolen anything
or attacked any females? You?

905
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,517
No, gosh, no, no, he's as sweet as can be.

906
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,811
Well, I played him sweet.
I was well reviewed.

907
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,354
Well, it comes across.

908
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,940
Good. Look, I gotta speak to him.

909
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,650
You're not upset with him?

910
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,152
Well, a little, yes,

911
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,612
but I know if I spoke to him,
we could straighten everything out.

912
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,322
Oh, I don't know.

913
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,366
Please, I have a right.

914
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,743
Well, it has to be secret.

915
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,204
He doesn't want to have
to go back into the movie.

916
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,082
- He doesn't?
- No, he loves being free.

917
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,918
- He's having the time of his life.
- Oh, my God.

918
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,880
Would you take me to him? Trust me.

919
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,174
Please.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Monk, somebody saw your wife last night
at the Dine and Dance Joint.

922
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,150
Oh, sure, she's there every night
with the Rockefellers.

923
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,319
Uh, she was with this crazy-looking guy

924
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,905
- wearing an explorer's hat and britches.
- Come on.

925
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,364
Britches?

926
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,242
You know, you're nuts.
She was baby-sitting.

00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,078
Right. I guess you know it all.

- Cecilia, I dreamed of us in Cairo.
- Tom. Tom...

00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,897
- I brought Gil Shepherd.
- Gil... Gil Shepherd.

932
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,107
- I play you in the movie.
- You do?

933
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,235
How dare you run away!

934
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,736
This is disconcerting.

935
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,614
Oh, I'll show you
the meaning of disconcerting.

936
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,949
I'm trying to build a career!

937
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,992
Yeah, well,
I don't want to be in the film anymore.

I'm in love with Cecilia.

Mr. Shepherd, you said you weren't angry.

940
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,373
You can't do this to me. It's my best role.

941
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,083
I've been critically acclaimed for this.
It's my very...

942
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,709
I'd say it's because of the way I do it.

943
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,754
No, no, no, because of the way I do it.
I'm doing it, not you.

944
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,465
It's me, not him. I mean, isn't that obvious?

945
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,300
Well, then, how do you
explain that here I am?

946
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,010
Well, because
I took you from the printed page,

947
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,887
and I made you live.
I fleshed you out, just like...

948
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,890
- So, I'm living.
- Yes, but for the screen only, please.

949
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,642
- And as soon...
- I want my freedom.

950
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,644
I don't want another one of me
running around the world.

951
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,312
I mean, I can
just imagine what he's been up...

952
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,106
Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

953
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,482
Yes. Frankly, I am afraid...

954
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,692
But, you created me.

955
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,610
All right, look, be reasonable here.

956
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,737
I'm starting to build a career.

957
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,614
Is life up on the screen so terrible that you...

958
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,617
I want to be with Cecilia.
I'm in love with her.

959
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,953
Will you tell him to go back?

960
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,746
Tell him that you don't love him.

961
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,914
Tell him you can't love him.

962
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,082
He's fictional!

963
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,334
You want to waste your time
with a fictional character?

964
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,670
I mean, you're a sweet girl.
You deserve an actual human.

965
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,422
But Tom's perfect.

966
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,798
Yeah, but he's not real.

967
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,718
What good is perfect if the man's not real?

968
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,428
I can learn to be real.

969
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,305
It's easy. You know, there's nothing to it.

970
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,098
Being real comes very naturally to me.

971
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,434
Can't learn to be real.
It's like learning to be a midget.

972
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,852
It's not a thing you can learn.

973
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,937
Some of us are real, some are not.

974
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,315
I say I can do it.

975
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,941
I'm not going to stay here
and argue with you.

976
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,192
I'm gonna go back to town.

977
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,362
I'm going to call my attorney,
the Actors' Union.

978
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,615
I won't take this lying down.

979
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,577
Nor will Raoul Hirsch, nor the police,

980
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,662
nor the FBI.

981
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,166
Yes, yes, we found him.

982
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,209
Gil Shepherd found him,

983
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,587
but he refuses to get back on the screen.

984
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,672
R.H. is very upset.

985
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,176
No, no, we can't force him. It's not a crime.

986
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,053
We need a plan.

987
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,888
Yeah, the press is on our side.

988
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,599
It took a few bucks,
but they're going to keep it quiet for now.

989
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,352
Uh, what? Really?

990
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,773
The Tom Baxter character
in a movie house in Chicago

991
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,900
has been forgetting his lines.

992
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,361
I just got a call from the manager.

993
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,946
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the bathroom.

994
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,907
On the floor, weeping.

995
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,663
I mean, you do...
Aren't you at all even worried?

996
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,248
Well, what about
Raoul Hirsch and what, the FBI?

997
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,417
No, Cecilia,
if I can be with you, I'm never going back.

998
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,002
- But I, you know...
- No more buts.

999
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,213
I said I was going
to learn about the real world with you.

1000
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,506
Show me.

1001
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,887
(INAUDIBLE)

1002
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,720
TOM: It's beautiful.
But I'm not sure exactly what it is.

1003
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,099
Oh, this is a church.
You do believe in God, don't you?

1004
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,976

1005
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,732
Mmm, the reason for everything,
the, the world, the universe...

1006
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,816
Oh, I think I know what you mean.

1007
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,152
The two men who wrote, uh,
The Purple Rose of Cairo.

1008
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,155
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine,
the writers who collaborate on films.

1009
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,491
No, no, I'm talking
about something much bigger than that.

1010
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,203
No, think for a minute.
A reason for everything.

1011
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,498
Otherwise, it'd be
like a movie with no point,

1012
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,833
and no happy ending.

1013
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,501
So there you are!

1014
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,628
I'm looking for you.

1015
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,714
Monk, I, um...

1016
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,761
This is my husband. This is Tom Baxter.

1017
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,972
Adventurer, explorer, the Chicago Baxters.
I'm charmed to meet you.

1018
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,141
So you wear the britches.

1019
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,768
CECILIA: What did you want
to talk to me about?

1020
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,604
I heard you were out on the town last night.

1021
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,024
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I admit I didn't tell the truth about that,

1022
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,027
but things have
been so strange the last 24 hours...

1023
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,403
You know what I told you I'd do to you

1024
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,780
- if you ever lied to me?
- Monk, don't hit me.

1025
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,948
Obviously, your marriage
has come to an impasse, sir.

1026
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,533
And you keep out of this.

1027
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,827
- Monk, let's just talk.
- No, you're coming home with me!

1028
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,412
- Can't we talk?
- Perhaps you don't understand, sir,

1029
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,538
but I'm in love with your wife.

1030
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,123
Close your yap, jackass.

1031
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,208
Now let's go. You're in for a lesson...

1032
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,210
You're failing to understand, sir.

1033
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,377
She's not coming with you.

1034
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,630
- Oh, she's not, huh?
- No, you take your hands off.

1035
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,715
No man will hit the woman I love,
nor any woman.

1036
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,219
- Beat it! Beat it. I'm gonna take you apart!
- Stop it!

1037
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,012
- He's got a terrible temper.
- And you, go home.

1038
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,307
Sorry, it's written into my character.
Courage.

1039
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,600
Stop it!

1040
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,194
- Come on.
- Stop it! What are you doing?

1041
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,415
Time for the old one-two.

1042
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,000
(GRUNTING)

1043
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,587
Hope he's had enough.

1044
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,298
Sorry, pal. Sorry about the rough stuff.

1045
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,508
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1046
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,926
Let me give you a hand. There's a...

1047
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,429
(GRUNTING) God, it's not fair. Oh!

1048
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,853
Tom! What are you doing?

1049
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,564
- You're coming home with me now.
- No, I'm not!

1050
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,606
What'd you say?

1051
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,650
No, I'm going to stay
and see that Tom's okay.

1052
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,943
- I...
- You're a bully, Monk.

1053
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,986
I gave you an order.

1054
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,863
I don't care. I'm tired of taking your orders.

1055
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,072
You could've killed him.

1056
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,658
All right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1057
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,742
- I hit hard.
- You can't just...

1058
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,995
You can't just
go through life beating people up.

1059
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,080
Look, I'm telling you one more time.
Are you coming with me?

1060
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,540
No, I'm not.

1061
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,376
I'm telling you one more time. You coming?

1062
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,795
- No! No, I'm not!
- Come on!

1063
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,633
The hell with it. I need a beer anyway.

1064
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,468
I'll see you later.

1065
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,056
Oh, are you okay?

1066
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,475
Oh, oh, yeah. I'm fine.

1067
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,727
You're not even marked.

1068
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,645
Your hair is in place.

1069
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,480
No, no. I don't get hurt or bleed.

1070
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,607
Hair doesn't muss.

1071
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,817
It's one of the advantages
of being imaginary.

1072
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,569
- (CHUCKLES)
- You were very brave.

1073
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,406
Yeah, well, I had him, too,
till he started fighting dirty.

1074
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,534
That's why you'll never
survive off the screen.

1075
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,996
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood right up to him.

1076
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,664
You inspired me.

Oh, Cecilia, look, I got to speak to you.

1080
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,979
Oh, listen, I've had a crazy morning.

1081
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,273
- I'm still shaking.
- Look, I don't know what to do, all right?

1082
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,775
I've struggled my whole life.

1083
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,069
And now I'm
finally beginning to break through

1084
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,946
and my whole career's
going right down the drain.

1085
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,490
You don't have to worry about that.

1086
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,368
You'll always be a great movie star.

1087
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:20,122
Oh, well, that's very nice of you to say,
but technically, I'm not really a star yet.

1088
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,251
(CHUCKLING) Cecilia, you know, I mean,
I try to carry myself like one.

1089
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,338
You know, I do the best I can
as far as that, but star?

1090
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,091
Phew! That's a big word, isn't it? Star?

1091
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,969
Yeah, uh, no, no.

1092
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,428
No, star, no, no.

1093
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:39,100
And you're not just a pretty face,
you're also a peach of an actor.

1094
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,686
Really, I've seen you. I've seen you a lot.

1095
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,562
You've got something.

1096
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,564
- Is that your opinion?
- Sure.

1097
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,400
And I see all the movies.

1098
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:51,153
You've got, oh, how can I describe it?

1099
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,241
You've got a magical glow.

1100
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,743
(CHUCKLING) Oh, boy. Oh, oh.

1101
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,414
To hear that from a real person,
that is just...

1102
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,165
(EXHALING) It's not
one of those movie colony bimbos,

1103

Would you get over here
and sit down, please?

1105
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,881
Oh, you know, you can take it from me.

1106
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,425
You're not just a flash in the pan.

1107
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,928
No, you know, it'd be very easy
for me to trade on my looks.

1108
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,054
- Just, like that.
- Oh, sure.

1109
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,764
But I have some serious acting ambitions.

1110
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,933
You should. You should.

1111
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,270
You, you know...
I think you're great in all the funny movies.

Thank you.

1113
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,814
Really, I was thinking you should,

1114
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,316
you should
play some of the more heroic parts.

Well, you know, well, you could play...

1118
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,783

like, Daniel Boone, or someone...

- Lindbergh! Oh...
- Oh!

1120

- You'd be wonderful as Lindbergh.
- My God!

1121
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,456
- You are a mind reader.
- We had the same thought?

1122
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,208
- Really?
- I am on the verge of signing for that part.

- No! Really?
- I'm, I am! I can taste it.

Oh, you'll be wonderful.

1125

- Well, thank you.
- Oh, there's something inside you that...

1126
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,510
You have that
same kind of lone heroic quality.

00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,138
You're exactly right.
Everyone has been telling me not to...

- You are right.
- Don't you listen.

Basically, I have been a loner my entire life.

Well, sure, anyone can see that.

1131

Uh, come on, no, of course not.

00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,128
I'll bet. You want to come along with me?

1170
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,422
Where to, Emma?

1171
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,675
Where I work.
I think you might have a good time.

1172
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,846
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.

1173
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,431
I may be able to help.

1174
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,935
EMMA: Hi, girls. This is Tom.

1175
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,187
Hi there, ladies.

1176
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,771
Don't you all look enticing?

1177
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,523
I know what you want.

1178
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,776
You want to be the great white hunter
and you want me to be the tiger.

1179
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,071
(CHUCKLING) Uh, I don't get it.

1180
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,740
You will if you can afford it.

1181
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,617
I met Tom out at the amusement park.

1182
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,702
Oh, no, that's, uh, my hat.

1183
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,497
Uh, yes, I was, uh...
I was thinking about something.

1184
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,459
- I can imagine.
- Two of us at the same time?

1185
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,461
You know, I was
thinking about some very deep things.

1186
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,298
About God and his relation
with Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.

1187
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,967
And, I was thinking about life in general.

1188
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,303
The... The origin
of everything we see about us.

1189
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,973
The, uh... The finality
of death and how almost magical

1190
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,518
it seems in the... In the real world as, uh...
As opposed to the world of

1191
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,479
celluloid and flickering shadows.

1192
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,272
Where did you find this clown?

1193
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,483
For example, the miracle of birth.

1194
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,777
Now. I suppose
some of you lovely ladies are married.

1195
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,570
- Not anymore.
- No?

1196
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:07,243
Then, the absolutely
astonishing miracle of childbirth

1197
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,621
with all its attendant feelings
of humanity and pathos.

1198
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,331
I stand in awe of existence.

1199
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,626
- Do you want to tie me up?
- Tie you up?

1200
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,002
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

1201
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,422
(LAUGHING) Oh, that's very funny.
She's very funny.

1202
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,300
That's a nice sense of humor.
The absurd non sequitur.

1203
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,344
- What... What's your name, sweetheart?
- Martha.

1204
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,638
That's the same name
as the Ambassador's wife.

1205
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,015
Well, why didn't you
bring the Ambassador by?

1206
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,850
Well, he... He's still up on the screen.

1207
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:36,021
But, do you share my sense of wonderment
at the very fabric of being?

1208
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,067
The smell of a rose,
real food, sensuous music.

1209
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,027
I've got a child.

1210
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,195
- You do?
- Mmm.

1211
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,948
Oh, I see. You're a widow.
Uh, oh, poor thing.

1212
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,492
I got two kids and he's
right about giving birth.

1213
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,036
It is a beautiful experience.

1214
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,165
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I lost it.

1215
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,167
Sorry to hear that, Emma.

1216
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,044
It always makes me cry to think about it.

1217
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,588
Oh, there, there, now.
You'll have another chance.

1218
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,800
Come on, I'd be surprised
if all you ladies weren't married soon.

1219
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,385
Especially by the way you dress.

1220
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,429
It's so seductive to a man.

1221
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,389
Do you like these stockings, Tom?

1222
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,058
- Oh, they're just divine.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1223
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,853
What kind of a club is this, anyhow?

1224
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,564
God, Tom, you're a scream.

1225
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,357
He's terribly sweet.

1226
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,485
He is. I wouldn't mind doing him for nothing.

1227
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,654
Me neither, plus he's cute.

1228
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,989
Okay, you can count me in.

1229
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,241
Come on, Tom,
we're going to take you into the bedroom

1230
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,618
and give you an experience
you'll never forget.

1231
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,995
- And it's on us.
- Oh.

1232
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,580
I came here for a new experience.

1233
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,458
Well, now you're going
to get a champion roll in the hay.

1234
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,667
What? There's hay in the bedroom?

1235
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,171
(LAUGHING) You ever
been to a brothel before?

1236
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,424
- What's a brothel?
- You must be kidding.

1237
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,928
- A brothel, a bordello, a whore house.
- I'm not following.

1238
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,766
We go to bed with you
and make love and you pay us.

1239
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,644
Only because you're so sweet,
we want to treat you to a party.

1240
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,523
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1241
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,694
Boy, this doesn't
ring a bell with anything I know.

1242
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:10,949
Oh, come on, buddy.
You know about making love, don't you?

1243
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,576
I can't make love with you.

1244
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,036
Don't tell me you don't like women.

1245
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,288
Or you were wounded in the war.

1246
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,832
No, no, I'm in love with someone else.

1247
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,044
We're not talking about in love,
we're talking about making love.

1248
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,589
- But, I love Cecilia.
- Well, so what? Marry Cecilia.

1249
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,132
This is just for fun.

1250
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,051
Oh, I couldn't do that, Emma.

1251
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,345
Ladies, my, my gracious!

1252
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,890
Nah, uh, look, don't think I'm
not appreciative of your offer.

1253
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,184
Though, I must say,
the concept is totally new to me.

1254
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,939
But, I'm just... I'm hopelessly
head over heels in love with Cecilia.

1255
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,482
She is all I want.

1256
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,276
My devotion is to her, my loyalties.

1257
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,947
Every breath
she takes makes my heart dance.

1258
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,741
This guy just kills me.

1259
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,994
Are there any other guys like you out there?

1260
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,415
CECILIA: Lawson's Music Store.

1261
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,000
This store has been here since I was a kid.

1262
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,503
Yeah. I wish I could play an instrument.

1263
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:09,007
That's my other ambition in life,
is to be a great classical violinist.

1264
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,635
Thousands cheering me night after night.

1265
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,262
I can play the ukulele.

1266
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,180
- You can?
- Uh-huh. My father taught me

1267
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,974
before he ran away.

1268
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,355
I'm Alabamy bound

1269
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:27,359
There'll be no heebie jeebies hanging 'round

1270
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,113
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth

1271
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,282
All I'm worth

1272
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,535
To put my tootsies in an upper berth

1273
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,537
Just hear that choo-choo sound

1274
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,705
Whoo-hoo!

1275
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,542
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground

1276
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,212
And then I'll holler
'cause the world will know

1277
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,714
Here I go

1278
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,885
I'm Alabamy bound

1279
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,052
Whoa.

1280
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,972
I'm Alabamy bound

1281
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,682
That was just wonderful.

1282
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,850
- Oh.
- That's wonderful.

1283
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,685
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, I was never... It's like a dream.

1284
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,728
(PIANO PLAYING)

1285
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,854
Oh, listen.

1286
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,980
I love my baby...

1287
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,232
My baby loves me

1288
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,236
I don't know nobody as happy as we

1289
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,822
She's only 20

1290
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,449
And I'm 21

1291
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,577
We never worry

1292
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,537
We're just having fun

1293
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,665
Sometimes we quarrel

1294
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,210
And maybe we fight

1295
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,048
But then we make up the following night

1296
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,967
When we're together

1297
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,094
We're great company

1298
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,722
I love my baby

1299
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,766
And my baby loves me

1300
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,145
- That was wonderful. Oh, you...
- Aw, that was, you know...

1301
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,230
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1302
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,023
Well, oh, after
the Lindbergh movie you should do...

1303
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,067
- The phone.
...a musical, really.

1304
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,902
Do you think...
You know, I did a one-bit in one once.

1305
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,820
I know, I saw Dancing Doughboys, sure.

1306
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,239
(LAUGHING) Dancing Doughboys?

1307
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,532
- You remembered.
- Yeah, that was great.

1308
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,076
I remember you turned
to Ina Beasley and you said,

1309
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,620
"I won't be going south
with you this winter."

1310
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,288
That's exact... Right, right!

1311
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,667
"I won't be going south
with you this winter. We have a little, uh,

1312
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,794
"score to settle
on the other side of the Atlantic."

1313
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,505
"Does this mean
I won't be seeing you ever again?"

1314
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,674
"Well, ever is a long time."

1315
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,134
"When you leave, don't look back."

1316
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,887
(CHUCKLING) You remember that...
You remember it perfectly.

1317
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:23,225
And then... And then
I took her in my arms, and I kissed her,

1318
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,644
knowing it was for the last time.

1319
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,108
God, you're beautiful, Cecilia.

1320
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,610
Was it fun? Kissing Ina Beasley?

1321
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,279
Oh, it was just, you know, it's a movie kiss.

1322
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,780
You know,
we professionals, we can put that...

1323
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,490
That stuff on just like that.

1324
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,701
It looked like you loved her.

1325
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,005
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my goodness!

1326
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,799
Feel my heart.

1327
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,634
- Uh, I... I...
- (EXHALES)

1328
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,679
I have to... I should...
Thank you so much for the ukulele.

1329
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,514
Oh, well, don't be offended.
I didn't mean to...

1330
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,976
Oh, no. I'm not offended.
I'm just, uh... I'm confused.

1331
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,313
I'm married.
I just met a wonderful new man.

1332
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,356
He's fictional, but you can't have everything.

1333
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,191
Look, can I see you later?

1334
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,235
No, no. I'm meeting Tom.

1335
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,072
My own creation plagues me.

1336
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,284
- Anything happening out there?
- Not a thing.

1337
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,036
Life is amazing, isn't it?

1338
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,038
One little minor
character takes some action...

1339
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,164
Minor?

1340
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,665
...and the whole world
is turned upside down.

1341
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,958
COUNTESS: What if he never comes back?

1342
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,044
We just drift until they shut the projector.

1343
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,170
- Will you shut up?
- Now calm down, calm down.

1344
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,254
And stop that!

1345
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,881
- He'll be back. I feel it.
- Was she always like that?

1346
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,049
I don't want to sit around and wait.

1347
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,884
- That's exactly what they want.
- Who?

1348
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,761
- The bosses.
- Oh.

1349
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,387
Look at us!

1350
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,515
Sitting around,
slave to some stupid scenario.

1351
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,770
Meanwhile, the fat cats in Hollywood
are getting rich on our work!

1352
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,231
- Stop it!
- Studio heads, writers, movie stars!

1353
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,525
Uh, but we're the ones who sweat!

1354
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,694
We're the characters
on the screen, not them.

1355
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,779
You're a Red!

1356
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,447
I say unite, brothers,

1357
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,324
unite and take action!

1358
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,284
Why don't you shut up and sit down?

1359
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,161
- What possible action...
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1360
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,245
Shut up, will you?

1361
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,122
What if all this
is merely a matter of semantics?

1362
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,540
How can it be semantics?

1363
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,418
Well, wait a minute.
Let's just re-adjust our definitions.

1364
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,671
Let's redefine ourselves as the real world,

1365
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,382
and them as the
world of illusion and shadow.

1366
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,426
You see, we're reality, they're a dream.

1367
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,595
You better calm down.

1368
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,807
You've been up on the screen,
flickering too long.

1369
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,435
REPORTER: It's confirmed.
LAWYER: It is?

1370
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,770
LAWYER: I was afraid this might happen.

1371
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,854
REPORTER: The Tom Baxter character

1372
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,439
tried to leave the screen in four theaters.

1373
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,402
St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and Detroit,
and he almost made it in Detroit.

1374
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,654
- It looks bad.
- The movie houses in those towns

1375
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,988
are in a state of pandemonium.

1376
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,407
There's no way to keep the lid on it.

1377
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,325
I see lawsuits, hundreds of lawsuits!

1378
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,119
We better pull the picture out of release.

1379
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,454
- What, in those towns?
- No, everywhere.

1380
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,498
Something's obviously
gone very wrong here,

1381
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:55,711
and the best course of action
is to shut down, take our losses

1382
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,714
and get out of this mess
before it really gets out of hand.

1383
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,632
Sure, can you
imagine hundreds of Tom Baxters

1384
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,842
flying around wild?

1385
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,636
Right, and you
responsible for every one of them.

1386
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,098
Well, the best thing to do is to quit
while there's only one of them out there.

1387
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,349
But what do we do about him?

1388
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,101
We've got to get him back in the picture.

1389
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,854
Then we turn off the projector,
and burn the prints.

1390
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,021
And the negative.

1391
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,816
What a shame. It was such a good picture.

1392
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,901
I missed you. You're late.

1393
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,029
I'm sorry,
I just... I came as quickly as I could.

1394
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,991
- I love you.
- Oh! Oh, thank you.

1395
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,911
Tom, my feelings are so jumbled.

1396
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,414
Oh, I know, I know.
You're married, and you're old-fashioned,

1397
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,874
and I'm a whole new idea.

1398
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,501
But the truth is you're unhappily married.

1399
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,253
And I'm gonna take you away from all this.

1400
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,422
Yeah, I know you love me.

1401
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,383
Cecilia, I do love you.
Don't you share my feelings?

1402
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,343
Well, I... That's just it.

1403
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,722
(STAMMERING) You're some
kind of phantom.

1404
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:52,017
Look, I don't want
to talk any more about what's real

1405
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,395
and what's illusion. Life's too short
to spend time thinking about life.

1406
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,564
- Let's just live it.
- Live it how?

1407
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,524
Well, we'll begin with dinner.

1408
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,235
Oh, well, listen.
No, I've only got a few dollars.

1409
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,528
Well, we're not gonna use your money.

1410
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,863
Well, that's all we have!

1411
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,490
Unless you've done something.

1412
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,159
Well, say no more.
The moon will be full, the stars will be out,

1413
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,327
and we're going stepping.

1414
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,788
- But we're broke.
- Leave that to me.

1415
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,108
It's him! Tom, you're back!

1416
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,569
I want you to meet my fiancée, Cecilia.

1417
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,112
This... Oh, well, you know all these people.

1418
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,906
It's not possible!

1419
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,741
I'm in the world of the possible.

1420
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,911
Yeah? Well, you better get back
in the story, you little weasel!

1421
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,871
Ah! You anticipate me.

1422
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,458
- Follow me!
- FATHER DONNELLY: Saints preserve us.

1423
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,543
Trust me.

1424
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,419
LARRY: He just comes and goes
like he pleases.

1425
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,838
Come on.

1426
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,881
- Where am I?
- But she can't be in here.

1427
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,383
- Why not?
- Come on.

1428
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,009
- I feel so light!
- Cecilia, my money is good up here.

1429
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,678
- You've got too much money.
- Like I'm floating on air!

1430
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,971
But it'll upset the balance.

1431
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,764
- It sure does.
- What's the difference? He's back, isn't he?

1432
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,932
I told you he'd be back.

1433
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,642
Can we get on with the plot now?

1434
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,269
How can we with her here?

1435
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,771
But she's here with me,
and I'll sock any man in the jaw

1436
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,897
who makes her feel unwanted.

1437
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,567
- Well, it's about time you got back here!
- Right!

1438
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,735
Now we finally go to the Copacabana.

1439
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,404
None of us have eaten in ages.

1440
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,864
Good, I'm bringing a guest.

1441
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,408
Well, won't Kitty Haynes be surprised.

1442
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,373
- Table for seven, please, Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,542
- Seven?
- Seven.

1444
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,128
That's impossible. It's always six.

1445
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,046
We have an extra.

1446
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,631
Seven, Arturo.

1447
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,676
This person?

1448
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,224
So let's not speak of love sublime

1449
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,729
Because time brings on a breakup

1450
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:08,236
There'll be no tears
and no emotional scenes

1451
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,323
To spoil my makeup

1452
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,994
And when the end comes

1453
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,163
I'll take up the slack

1454
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,581
Would you like some more champagne?

1455
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,416
Oh, thank you.

1456
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,585
Listen, Tom,
I don't know what they're charging you,

1457
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,546
but those champagne
bottles are filled with ginger ale.

1458
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,381
- That's the movies, kid!
- Shh.

1459
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,301
Oh, I don't care. I love every minute of it.

1460
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,684
Every Sunday, Monday

1461
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:46,524
One day at a time

1462
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:53,657
Let's take it one day at a time

1463
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,994
Let's take it

1464
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:05,043
One day at a time

1465
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,840
MAN: Bravo! Bravo!

1466
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,682
Thank you, thank you.

1467
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,394
- Who are you?
- Oh, no, I'm... I just... I came with Tom.

1468
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,396
You sing so beautifully.

1469
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,315
What the hell is this?

1470
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,984
We're supposed to meet and marry.

1471
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,152
- Who's the skirt?
- My fiancée.

1472
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,404
- What?
- Oh, no, wait...

1473
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,197
- HENRY: He met her in New Jersey.
- What is this?

1474
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,907
Kitty, she's real.

1475
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,288
- (SCREAMS)
- COUNTESS: Kitty!

1476
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,708
Quick! Pour... Pour ginger ale on her!

1477
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,001
What's all the fuss about?

1478
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,794
Uh, nothing, nothing, Arturo.

1479
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,338
- We were just leaving. Come on. Let's go.
- Leaving? Leaving where?

1480
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,923
Hey, I'm all mixed up!

1481
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,591
I'm gonna show Cecilia the town.

1482
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,885
Are we just chucking out the plot, sir?

1483
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,430
Exactly. It's every man for himself!

1484
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,141
Then I don't have to seat people anymore.

1485
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,351
I can do what it is I've always wanted to do.

1486
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,519
What's that?

1487
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,603
Hit it, boys!

1488
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,188
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1489
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,822
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

1490
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,555
I had such a wonderful time.

1491
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,973
Me, too.

1492
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,017
Where are all the others?

1493
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,979
Oh, I don't know.
Well, probably just still dancing away.

1494
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,234
Why? Does it matter?
I wanted to get you alone.

1495
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,194
It's so beautiful here.

1496
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,032
Oh! The white telephone.

1497
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,200
Oh...

1498
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,037
I've dreamed of having a white telephone.

1499
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,164
Your dreams are my dreams.

1500
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,624
My whole life, I've wondered

1501
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,335
what it would be like
to be this side of the screen.

1502
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,963
You see that city out there waking up?

1503
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,465
That's yours for the asking.

1504
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,551
My heart's beating so fast!

1505
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,767
GIL: Cecilia!

1506
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,563
Gil! What are you doing here?

1507
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,398
Well, I... I came in here to think.

1508
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,899
What are you doing here?

1509
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,527
I took her on a date, all right?

1510
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,195
Now, can't you just leave us alone?

1511
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,364
No, I can't leave her alone.

1512
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,533
I'm jealous.

1513
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,118
You're jealous?

1514
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,202
Well, what do you want me to say?

1515
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,913
I can't get Cecilia out of my mind.

1516
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,748
Gil, do you mean that?

1517
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:34,460
Oh, for God's sake,
would you go back to Hollywood? Please.

1518
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,172
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit it, Cecilia.

1519
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,883
You know, you said I had a magical glow?

1520
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,094
But that's you, you're the one that has one.

1521
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,890
And even though we've just met,
I know that this is the real thing.

1522
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,934
You can't be in love with Cecilia.
She's in love with me.

1523
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,270
I'll tell you what, why don't you
turn around and re-enter the film?

1524
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm never going back!

1525
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,607
I can't believe it, they're at it again.

1526
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,942
Tom, will you get back up here?

1527
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,111
See, there you go, Tom.
You're ruining everything.

1528
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,696
You are!
You're the one who's ruining everything.

1529
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,364
You know, if it wasn't for me,
there wouldn't be any you!

1530
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,991
Don't be so sure! I could've been played

1531
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,910
by Fredric March or Leslie Howard!

1532
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,705
You're wrong. The part's
too insignificant to attract a major star.

1533
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,249
- Insignificant!
- Like hell it is! What are you talking about?

1534
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,751
Minor character?
I am not a minor character!

1535
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:15,919
What do you mean, a minor character?

1536
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,212
Jeez!

1537
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,631
You know, I haven't
been able to think of anything since we met.

1538
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:23,468
I just, I have to have some time with you
to show you what real life can be like

1539
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,262
if two people really care for each other.

1540
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,057
Last week, I was unloved.

1541
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:33,478
Now, two people love me,
and it's the same two people.

1542
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,647
Go with the real guy, honey. We're limited.

1543
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,857
Go with Tom. He's got no flaws.

1544
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,318
Go with somebody, child,
'cause I's getting bored.

1545
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,112
She's gonna marry me.
You're just... You're wasting your time.

1546
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,198
Will you get back on the screen?

1547
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,533
I'm trying to tell Cecilia I'm in love with her.

1548
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,995
I love you.
I'm honest, dependable, courageous,

1549
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,081
romantic and a great kisser.

1550
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,249
And I'm real!

1551
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,000
LARRY: Let's go, Cecilia!

1552
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,628
Choose one of them
so we can settle this thing.

1553
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,673
The most human of all attributes
is your ability to choose.

1554
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,132
Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1555
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,677
If she chooses Tom,
how are we gonna end the story?

1556
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,136
We'll be stuck here forever.

1557
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,681
Father Donnelly can
marry us right here in the movie house.

1558
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,015
No, that won't stand up in court.

1559
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,350
The priest has to be human.

1560
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,936
The Bible never says
a priest can't be on film!

1561
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,397
No, uh, I'm already married!

1562
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,274
Come away with me to Hollywood.

1563
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,609
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1564
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,861
Do something impulsive
for once in your life.

1565
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:28,283
I mean, just throw your stuff in a valise
and come away with me. Really.

1566
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,867
(CHUCKLING) And don't forget that ukulele.

1567
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,536
What ukulele?

1568
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,121
Look, I love you.

1569
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:37,208
I know that only happens in movies,
but I do.

1570
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,298
Tom?

1571
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,093
Cecilia, you're throwing away perfection.

1572
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,679
Don't tell her that! We need Tom back!

1573
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,306
It's so romantic.

1574
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,640
Oh, women!

1575
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,891
(SIGHS)

1576
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,730
Well, I'm crushed, I'm devastated. It's...

1577
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,650
Tom, try to understand.

1578
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,486
You'll be fine.

1579
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,157
In your world, things have a way
of always working out right.

1580
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,867
See, I'm a real person.

1581
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:16,164
No matter how tempted I am,
I have to choose the real world.

1582
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,751
I loved every minute with you.

1583
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,921
And I'll never forget our night on the town.

1584
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,926
Goodbye.

1585
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:44,442
HENRY: Well, you're better off with us,
old sport, you really are.

1586
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,778
JASON: Can we get on
with The Purple Rose of Cairo, please?

1587
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,030
COUNTESS: If anyone wants me,
I'll be in reel six.

1588
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,699
- Kitty's waiting for you.
- DELILAH: Lord have mercy!

1589
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,786
What a day! What a day!

1590
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,819
So, your explorer friend's okay?

1591
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,612
I saw him walking around town with you.

1592
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,740
Yeah, he's okay. No thanks to you.

1593
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,991
I didn't mean to be so rough on him.

1594
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,701
It's just that
I get jealous when it comes to you.

1595
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,995
- Do you?
- Christ, you know I do.

1596
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,081
I know I treat you rough. It's my way.

1597
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,834
- It doesn't mean I don't feel for you.
- Oh.

1598
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,838
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

1599
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,048
- Here we go again.
- You don't feel for me, Monk.

1600
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,633
All you feel for is yourself!

1601
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,387
Your beer, your card games, your women!

1602
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,681
Okay, I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

1603
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,183
- No, I'm not kidding...
- It's too late, Monk. It's too late, I'm going.

1604
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,018
I should have left a long time ago.

1605
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,521
I would have,
except I was scared of being alone.

1606
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,772
So what now?

1607
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,191
You found some chump
who's filling your head with big ideas?

1608
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,777
No, no, I got a chance to change my life.

1609
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,863
- I'm moving to Hollywood.
- All right, now listen, Cecilia,

1610
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,532
I said I was sorry
about being rough with your friend,

1611
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,616
but let's shape up!

1612
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,285
- It's too late, Monk!
- Look, like hell it...

1613
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,703
I said like hell it is!

1614
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,205
And don't be giving me
that big-headed stuff, you hear?

1615
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,790
Because I'm the guy
that can slap you down!

1616
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,958
Go ahead and hit me, Monk!

1617
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,793
Just go ahead and hit me!

1618
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,253
- I'm leaving anyway!
- Yeah, well,

1619
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,213
this never would have happened
if you didn't meet that guy.

1620
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,257
That's probably right,
and we would have just gone on

1621
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,469
the same way till we were too old
to even hope for something better.

1622
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,972
But I did meet him!
I did meet him, and I have feelings for him!

1623
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,725
- And he has for me!
- What about me?

1624
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,395
I still care for you, Monk,
if you can believe that.

1625
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,273
But out of the blue,
for the first time in my life,

1626
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,399
somebody's in love with me!

1627
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,902
No, but you just met each other.

1628
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,614
Love at first sight
doesn't only happen just in the movies.

1629
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:55,948
Hey, Cecilia, don't go.

1630
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,909
You hear me?
I said don't go! Now wait a minute.

1631
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,495
- Don't! I said... I said don't go!
- So long, Monk.

1632
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,622
- You stay here, you hear?
- You take care of yourself.

1633
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:05,666
Oh, yeah? All right, well, go, go!
See if I care.

1634
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,043
Go, see what it is out there!

1635
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,171
It ain't the movies! It's real life!

1636
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,089
It's real life, and you'll be back!

1637
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,592
You mark my words! You'll be back!

1638
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,787
Cecilia, what are you doing here?

1639
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,748
- Meeting Gil Shepherd.
- They all gone.

1640
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,083
They...

1641
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,793
What do... What do you mean?

1642
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,962
Went back to Hollywood.

1643
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,338
Gil, too?

1644
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,298
Mr. Shepherd, yeah.

1645
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,468
As soon as Tom Baxter
went back up on the movie screen,

1646
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,178
he couldn't wait to get out of here.

1647
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,139
He said this was a close call for his career.

1648
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,685
I think he's gonna play Charles Lindbergh.

1649
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,235
Don't forget, Cecilia,

1650
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,154
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers start today.

1651
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,853
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1652
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:56,777
And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak

1653
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:02,450
And I seem to find the happiness I seek

1654
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:09,373
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1655
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:14,545
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1656
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:21,719
And the cares that hung
around me through the week

1657
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,058
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

1658
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,065
When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1659
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,235
Oh, I love to climb a mountain

1660
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,447
And to reach the highest peak

1661
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:45,076
But it doesn't thrill me half as much

1662
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,871
As dancing cheek to cheek
