1
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,536
And they buried him in the hole.

2
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,440
Worked tão hard in benefit
Of the baseball for boys.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,748
- I Will Speak with the Committee.
- We Will Go amanhã?

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,155
It based in a Very Real Rumor.

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,470
1963 already is arriving!

6
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,376
Everything began in the end of year
of 1962, in my people of...

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,282
Pasadena, Califórnia.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,308
When this man and
This woman puied to bed.

9
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,179
He had only 21 and she 42.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,726
Happy New Year!

11
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,125
'They SAY FOR THERE'
'It translated by Ivoglo'

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,098
6 Months afterwards finished that
ventures, when the youth...

13
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,793
If puied to bed with another one person.

14
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,928
Não was an anyone.
The unique daughter of that woman.

15
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,169
And for that the things were complicated
maís, three days afterwards...

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,634
The daughter be married another man.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,236
Nobody knew to
Ventures of the fiancée.

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,273
Nobody, clear, except its mãe.

19
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,844
That could have been the end
Of the story, but não was him.

20
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,381
In the following spring
It published a book.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,122
The author was a colleague
Of studies of the youth.

22
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,029
Não of the that married, of another.
Already know...

23
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,363
What puied to bed with the mãe and the daughter.

24
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,835
The names were changed,
but that não avoided that...

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,430
Pasadena did what
Better it knows to do.

26
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,031
Intrigue.

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,067
- Puied to bed with the son of its friend.
- They Say that was Mary Beth.

28
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,780
- With the boy Bianchi.
- Mary Beth não has a daughter.

29
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,352
Não, but his son is a homosexual.

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,780
But by não have
suspicion...

31
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,087
the interest in the scandal
Early it was dispelled.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,323
Guess who came drunken
To the club the past week?

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,703
After everything, alone era a book.

34
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,535
Again, be able to have
It been the end of the story.

35
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,974
But afterwards, in 1967,
Inaugurated itself a film.

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,970
By God, lady Robinson!

37
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,908

00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,221

40
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,249
- AND?
- You try seduce me, Ms. Robinson.

41
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,488

00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,259
And was as well as the secrets

00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,697
Of Pasadena come back immortal.

44
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,176
And since então the people in Pasadena

Benjamín Braddock...

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,006
And who is to true Ms. Robinson.

47
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,209
Everything this occurred there is
More or less 30 years.

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,587
And what that is going to have with me?

49
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,615
For it answer that, have
That know who I was.

50
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,318
Which, in the winter of 1997,
Was something that I não knew still.

51
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,457
For it be sincere, I have state
Dealing with that all my life.

52
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,364

Não was turbulence.
It looked somewhat mechanical.

- It is a classical turbulence.
- OK. Não was pilot.

60
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,297

With the blue water.

Não we have a mãe. And não
It I helped to choose the dress!

00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,196
And necessary somewhat old, and
somewhat new, and somewhat blue...

00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,494
Não I believe that Annie expects that

109
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,098

00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,465
- Contain of the tunnels?
- Tunnels?

132
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,492
There are some tunnels next month the

00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,366
When we passed by car by them.

135
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,069

139
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,381
because my father treats as a
infant, and when leave...

140
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,445
Of the tunnel will be unconscious.

Episodes of journeys, especially
The Europe. Good subject.

147
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,343
- Relaxes, everything will leave well.

As it can be a league
professional and cause to team...

- It is its first time in Pasadena?

There is an old one dictated: "Nobody is born in Them
Angeles, all of vão to Los Angeles".

172
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,152
But it was been born in Angeles,

They ignore during 100 years.

Even if return,
Already não são the Rams.

00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,747
Beyond the more, it will take three
Competitive years.

00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,453
Second estão the things today in day...

It do him, I should do him alone.

555
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,932
Never this it said you, but there is
A film based in my family.

556
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,938
It is grave. '' Titanic''.

00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,503
A little bit one changed, não
Had no boat neither nothing.

558
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,539
But a time I posed
Nude for a chart.

559
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,719
OK. Takes this.

560
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,746

It finds him and leaves of stayed confused

564
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,597
It is my fiancée, and não imports
Who you light to the altar.

565
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,742
Jeff, I have your telephone!

566
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,915
OK. Good. ''Oi, mister Burroughs.

567
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,192
I believe that you can be my father.''

568
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,221
We hear to speak very
Today about ''Revoluções''.

569
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,358
To revolução informative
That approaches.

570
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,661
To revolução of Internet
That approaches.

571
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,637
And Ché Guevara used to describe...

572
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,139
it used to describe to revolução
as a change in the coração.

573
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,583
Excuse, this confêrencia is alone
For participants that itself inscribed.

574
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,119
And for the press.

575
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,148
I am of the press! I am!

576
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,461
As know, Ché studied Medicine.

577
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,431
And when a man of science
it speaks in these we will have...

578
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,491
an itself question that is
Exactly what has in lie.

579
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,828
As I am a biographer or enthusiast
Of the Ché, I have my theories.

580
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,805
I believe that spoke of something that perhaps
Saw many times in its life.

581
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,370
The mystery of the recuperação.

582
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,407
The moment in that sick,
Despite of everything, is going to live.

583
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,020
It forget the suffering
And it oblige to be cured.

584
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,816
That era a revolução for Ché.

585
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,353
It do that the inimaginável
Appear for pure will.

586
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,033
Ladies and riders, to
revolução of the Internet...

587
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,503
Não is going to come.

588
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,530
Already arrived.

589
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,841
They are going to assure the
Domain ''lagosta.net''.

590
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,245
If they organize the market,
They are able to be done both you sew.

591
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,287
It knew this about good spring,
Team and Warner vão melt.

592
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,458
That will change to the world.

593
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,192
This is to third company
multimilionária that was created and sold...

594
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,691
In less of ten years. Has
Problems with the commitments?

595
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,596
There are two theories with regard to that
By example...

596
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,000
the people believes that my caste of concentração
it is demasiada short...

597
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,745
for the details of the day by day,
that alone interests me in the ação.

598
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,607
And to another one theory is...

599
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,885
Which was the question?

600
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,914
And now that is going to happen?

601
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,950

Better of everybody. I treated
straightly with Ken Patterson...

609

Love, which she chose.

Não I am a girl! You have
A son! It is a bastard!

941
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:53,956
This não is '' THE Graduate'',
It is a soap opera.

942
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:56,658
Calms itself. There is an explicação simple.

943
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:59,691
It is adopted?

944
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:02,537
- Não.
- Então you are a bastard.

945
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:05,563
I am a bastard woman.
We did somewhat a lot, a lot wrong.

946
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:08,973
- Não is my biological son.
- Necessary of a lot therapy.

947
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:11,745
That? That said?

That neither is my son
Biological neither it is adopted.

949
01:05:15,918 --> 01:05:19,183
Mine first wife, Cintia,
Will want to have sons. And I não...

950
01:05:19,388 --> 01:05:22,380
It could do that by her.
We use an alternative approach.

951
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:25,184
- A giver.
- A giver?

952
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:27,559

não is my son, but...

01:05:27,596 --> 01:05:30,360
its mãe and I choose não
It say. And it would stay grateful itself...

954
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:31,957
It did the even.

955
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,993
Correctly.

956
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:38,730
- But it is sterile?
- Não, I lay.

957
01:05:39,942 --> 01:05:43,605
I invented everything for be able to
Put to bed me with my daughter.

958
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:46,838
That kind of man believes that I am?

959
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,485

01:06:24,587 --> 01:06:27,579
And it is a good pilot.

967
01:06:31,193 --> 01:06:34,185

968
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:39,691
It accepted your excuses.

969
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:53,004
Hopefully não be your father.

970
01:06:55,518 --> 01:06:58,316

971
01:06:58,354 --> 01:07:02,154

Was very drunken. Não I remember of nothing.

980
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:24,143
Não is an excuse, but but or less yes.

981
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,740
- Jeff, I love you.
- Não say that.

982
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:29,342
Não say that.

983
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:32,377

984
01:07:32,421 --> 01:07:35,879

It signifies nothing for you.

985
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:40,862
Jeff, I have a lot fear.

986
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:43,888
