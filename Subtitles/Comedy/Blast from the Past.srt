01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,775
- Please excuse this interruption.
- Oh, brother.

1184
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,986
Eve, I don't mean to be rude,
and, Cliff, please excuse me...

1185
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:24,156
but, Eve,
isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?

1186
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,825
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1187
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,744
And legs. Legs, butt and hair.

1188
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,080
- And shallow as well?
- Shallow?

1189
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,998
EVE: Adam, why don't you go home?

1190
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:36,085
- Go back to the hotel.
- Yeah, before I kick your ass.

1191
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,297
I must warn you, Cliff,
I do know how to defend myself.

1192
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:42,091
Oh, do you?

1193
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,427
- Agh!
- Stop it, you two.

1194
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,303
Nice move, really.

1195
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:49,473
Yeah, Eve's right.
Maybe we shouldn't fight in here.

1196
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:51,392
I agree.

1197
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,729
- Ugh.
- Adam.

1198
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,273
I'm sorry. He was gonna....

1199
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,483
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.

1200
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,486
I mean, fighting's pretty immature
when you think about it.

1201
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:06,866
- It certainly is.
- Eve, I'm leaving.

1202
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:09,535
- That's probably a good idea.
- Eve, I'm sorry.

1203
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,121
- Oh!
- Gah.

1204
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,834
Well, good night, everyone.

1205
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,463
- ADAM: Eve...
- EVE: I'm leaving too, okay?

1206
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:21,797
And you know what?

1207
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,049
If you want help, ask Troy,
because I quit.

1208
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:29,221
This is ridiculous.
You're ridiculous and I'm ridiculous.

1209
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,811
I'll buy you another Rob Roy,
huh, champ?

1210
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,938
Rob Roy for the gentleman.

1211
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,738
Well?

1212
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,740
He go back to the hotel?

1213
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:51,160
- Um, he might have.
- What does that mean?

1214
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,746
That means
that we did not leave together.

1215
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,372
Well, who did he leave with?

1216
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,501
- What's that to you?
- I'm his pimp.

1217
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:01,337
He left with those dancers, didn't he?

1218
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,547
You're the psychic.

1219
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,884
Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.

1220
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,887
- Those sluts.
- Yeah.

1221
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,973
Then again,
who isn't a slut these days, huh?

1222
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,227
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

1223
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:17,853
To bed?

1224
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:19,897
Sure, to bed.

1225
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,441
I'm not the one
that's in love with the guy.

1226
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,777
- What? Oh.
- Mm-hm.

1227
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,447
Now, hold on. Hold on just a minute.

1228
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,367
In the first place,
I do not fall in love with weirdos...

1229
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,702
who I've only known
for four or five days.

1230
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:34,954
Yes, you do.

1231
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:38,290
And I don't fall in love with grown men
who collect baseball cards.

1232
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,542
Yes, you do.

1233
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,877
Or pee in their pants
when they see the ocean.

1234
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,880
- Yes, you do.
- Or have perfect table manners.

1235
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:47,299
You know, I asked him about that.

1236
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,386
He said good manners
are just a way of showing people...

1237
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,137
that we have respect for them.

1238
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:55,516
I didn't know that. I thought
it was a way of acting superior.

1239
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:58,435
- Oh, you know what else he told me?
- What?

1240
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,272
He thinks I'm a gentleman
and you're a lady.

1241
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,735
Well... Well, consider the source.

1242
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,405
- I don't even know what a lady is.
- I know.

1243
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,157
I thought a gentleman
was somebody that owned horses.

1244
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:16,287
But it turns out the short and simple
definition of a lady or a gentleman...

1245
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,747
is someone who always tries
to make sure...

1246
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:22,835
the people around him or her
are as comfortable as possible.

1247
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,337
Where do you think
he got all that information?

1248
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,966
Oh, from the oddest place. His parents.

1249
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,468
I mean, I don't think
I got that memo from mine.

1250
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:34,513
Now I suppose
he's trying to make those dancers...

1251
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:37,349
feel as comfortable as possible.

1252
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,352
No. He didn't go home with them.

1253
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:47,026
Well....

1254
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,485

No!

She swept him out of the room
whispering French sweet nothings.

No, not Sophie, not Sophie.
Don't tell me that.

So, what you gonna do,
go to her place and kick the door in?

- I'm really sorry.
- What are you doing here?

You're supposed to be
on San Vicente Boulevard...

having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie.

- I know, and I'm really sorry.
- I'm limping.

What if this is for life?

- I know.

- I know.

- I didn't mean to scare her.
- Of course you didn't.

EVE: Used to be up here
with the coffee. Why don't...?

1279

That's because you're a nice boy...

- Steady.

Did you go to Sophie's?

1295

Of course.

1296
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,672
And?

1297
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:17,760
- She was hospitable.
- Hospitable?

1298
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,845
Huh.

1299
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:26,852
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be.

1300
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:32,608
So I left as politely as I could,
and I found a taxi...

1301
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:36,820
and I told the driver to bring me here
instead of back to the hotel.

1302
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:43,827
There is a song that Mr. Como sings...

1303
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,954
called "On the Street Where You Live."

1304
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:47,623

[SINGING] I have often walked
Down this street before

But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

Several stories high

Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

1311
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:22,699
It's a song about a young man
who's overjoyed...

1312
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:26,870
just to be standing
in front of the house...

1313

In 1962, when the bomb
was dropped on Los Angeles...

1321
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,809
my parents were in our fallout shelter.

1322

That's where I was born.

My father worked on it secretly
for years.

1326
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:46,283
When he had to, he used contractors,
but always from out of state...

1327
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,660
and always for only a portion
of the job.

1328
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,330
He told them it was a
secret government experiment...

1329
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:52,748

Now, my dad's not a liar...

but in this case,
he felt he had no choice.

1332
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,338
Of course, it had to be kept a secret.

Miss Eve Rustokov.

1516
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:59,969
- Mrs. Webber.
- Hello.

1517
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,846
- Mr. Webber.
- Hello.

1518
01:41:02,514 --> 01:41:05,433
Adam's told me
such wonderful things about you.

1519
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,102
Oh, well, excuse us, please.

1520
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:12,190
- We haven't entertained a guest in...
- Quite some time.

1521
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:15,193
Oh, Eve, what can I offer you?

1522
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,863
- Mom, Eve and I have to go.
- Oh, Adam, you just got here.

1523
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:22,366
I can't explain now, but I want you
to set the locks for two months.

1524
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:25,620
You've got enough of everything.
We'll be right back to get you.

1525
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,747
But I don't understand.

1526
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:31,125
And I'm asking you to trust me
without understanding why.

1527
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:34,879
- In that case, of course.
- Of course, son.

1528
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:38,341
- They really are wonderful parents.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1529
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,886
Oh, Adam.
Could you at least stay for dinner?

1530
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:44,764
- Well, we do....
- You must.

1531
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:48,935
Perfect.

1532
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,020
Now, tell me if you've heard this one.

1533
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:53,356
Duck walks into a drugstore.

1534
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:58,486
This gravy is an old favorite of Calvin's.
Now, Eve, the platter is down there.

1535
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,696
Would you get that, honey?

1536
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:04,951
The sperm swims toward the egg. Pop.

1537
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,577
- Into the egg.
- But why?

1538
01:42:06,745 --> 01:42:08,329
Because it must.

1539
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:13,084
- But why?
- Because it's out there.

1540
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:17,421
I don't mean to be nosy,
but are you and Adam dating?

1541
01:42:17,589 --> 01:42:19,632
Yeah, we are.

1542
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:24,053
And I'm from Pasadena.

1543
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,347
[LAUGHS]

1544
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:30,935
EVE:
And you thought your parents were weird.

1545
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:35,273
It's truly amazing what you can get
done when you have unlimited funds.

1546
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:39,610
Do you know you can have whole
houses built in just a matter of months?

1547
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:42,196
It's like the Garden of Eden,
don't you think?

1548
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,158
EVE: All you have to say is this:
"I don't care what it costs."

1549
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:48,452
Of course, you've gotta really mean it,
which no one ever does.

1550
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,664
It took a while
to convince Archbishop Melker...

1551
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,207
that Adam wasn't God...

1552
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,751
and he was pretty broken up
about it too.

1553
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:59,839
Until I showed him my plans
for Los Angeles' hottest nightspot.

1554
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,299
It's my goddamn malt shop.

1555
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:03,968
- Let's figure out what's gonna happen.
- Okay.

1556
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:07,471
Now, I want the whole ownership
of everything downstairs, all right?

1557
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:10,433
- Well...
- I want one of my guys at the door.

1558
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:17,857
EVE: Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
up to the surface very slowly...

1559
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:21,360
make them very comfortable,
and then break the bad news to them...

1560
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:24,822
that there was no nuclear holocaust.

1561
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,338
HELEN: Oh, Adam.

1562
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:55,019
Oh, son.

1563
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:03,444
Okay. And here you go. Careful.

1564
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,827
It's hot.

1565
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,537
Careful.

1566
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:21,087
EVE: Have you ever in your life seen a son
who did more for his parents?

1567
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,507
This is beautiful.

1568
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:28,719
- It's absolutely beautiful.
- Yeah.

1569
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:34,517
Well, we seem to have everything,
but, you know...

1570
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:39,230
it's not much different
from the fallout shelter.

1571
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:44,610
No, Calvin, this is different,
believe me.

1572
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:47,530
[SIGHS]

1573
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:52,159
This is great, son.

1574
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,539
By the way....

1575
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:02,461
Eve, her last name, Rustokov,
that's not Russian, is it?

1576
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:05,673
No, it's, uh, Ukrainian.
Her grandparents immigrated.

1577
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,887
Dad, I don't know
how to tell you this...

1578
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:15,182
and I was gonna wait for a while
to do it, but, um....

1579
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:21,480
Dad, there was no bomb.
A plane crashed in our back yard.

1580
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,358
I looked it up in old newspapers.

1581
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:27,320
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1582
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:30,406
The Soviet Union collapsed
without a shot being fired.

1583
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,074
The Cold War's over.

1584
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:38,414
That's what everyone believes?

1585
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:40,374
Oh, yes, sir.

1586
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:42,001
And it's true.

1587
01:45:43,211 --> 01:45:47,465
What, the Politburo one day said:

1588
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:50,968
"We give up"? Ha-ha-ha.

1589
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,221
Yes, that's kind of how it went.

1590
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:57,600
My gosh, those commies are brilliant.

1591
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,643
You have to hand it to them.

1592
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:02,480
"No, we didn't drop any bombs.

1593
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:06,817
Oh, yeah, our evil empire has collapsed.
Poor us."

1594
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:11,155
I'll bet they even asked the West
for aid.

1595
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,656
Right?

1596
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:15,368
Um, I think they did.

1597
01:46:15,577 --> 01:46:18,829
Oh, boys. Dinnertime.

1598
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:20,081
Pot roast.

1599
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,086
[CHUCKLING]

1600
01:46:25,253 --> 01:46:26,921
I'll tell you.

1601
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,800
Funny guy.

1602
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,678
- Don't tell your mother.
- No, okay.

1603
01:46:34,846 --> 01:46:38,015
EVE: Adam says that
this is simply how things work.

1604
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:40,518
First the parents
take care of the children...

1605
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:43,270
and then the children
take care of the parents.

1606
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:46,524
He says historically,
that's how it works.

1607
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:49,193
Damn commies.

1608
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,700
EVE: Whenever Adam gives me
such obviously incorrect information...

1609
01:46:56,868 --> 01:47:01,831
I just smile, slap him on the knee,
and look out the window.

1610
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,374
Why spoil his dreams?

1611
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:07,503
They're such wonderful dreams.

1612
