like, more than a friend.

509
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:47,471
Uh, Miss Vaughn, do you like
anybody in class more than a friend?

510
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,269
[WHISPERS] No.

511
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,482
Ask her if she would ever
go out with somebody from class.

512
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,567
- No!
- Just do it!

513
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:06,698
Um, Miss Vaughn, would you ever
go out with anybody from class?

514
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,451
Uh-huh.

515
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,371
Uh-huh.

516
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:15,832
You see, Ernie, grown-ups like
to go out with other grown-ups.

517
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,253
- What about Billy?
- You're more of a grown-up than Billy.

518
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,922
- I'll give you a grown-up.
- What was that, Ernie?

519
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:26,301
[HIGH-PITCHED] Nothing.
See you tomorrow in class, Miss Vaughn.

520
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,470
You blew it!

521
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:38,772
Hey, I dare you to throw
your sandwich at the bus driver.

522
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,234
[CHILDREN] Do it. Come on.

523
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,113
Hey!

524
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,699
Hey, who threw that?

525
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,203
I'll turn this damn bus around.

526
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:58,125
That'll end your precious little
field trip pretty damn quick, huh?

527
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,420
Bullshit.

528
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,389
Hey, I'm tryin' to score points with
the teacher today. Don't screw it up!

529
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:15,642
I dare you to touch her boobs.

530
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,854
Touch her boobs? That's assault, brother.

531
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,235
Ya double-dare me?

532
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,703
Miss Vaughn, how long till we get there?

533
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:38,582
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Probably about two minutes.

534
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,878
Sorry about that.
Damn guy drives like an animal.

535
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:47,257
That's all right, Billy.
Why don't you go back and sit down now?

536
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,593
- OK.
- I double-dare you.

537
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,304
Da... I... Accident...

538
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,556
Mistake... Tit...

539
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,142
- Go sit down now.
- Yes.

[CHILDREN GIGGLE]

541
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,986
Yeah, here we go again.
Another treat from the road.

542
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:11,907
Grand, ripe banana.
Trick of the day. Great...

543
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,748
[WOMAN] What is a horseshoe?
What does a horseshoe do?

544
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:22,084
Are there any horse socks?

545
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,253
Is anybody listening to me?

546
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:27,256
Anyways, I am sorry about
what happened back there,...

547
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,676
but you have to admit,
I've been tryin' to be good lately.

548
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:34,137
Well, you're not the first person
that's tried to grab my chest.

549
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,975
I'm trying not to hold you to a higher
standard than the rest of the students.

550
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,853
Although maybe I should.
You are, what, 50?

551
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:45,983
No, but the other kids look up to me.
I don't want them to think I'm a coward.

552
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:50,946
Don't worry about it. Next week you're
gonna have another teacher to annoy.

553
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:55,742
I don't want to annoy another teacher,
Miss Vaughn. I want to annoy you.

554
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:59,830
- Miss Vaughn!
- Somebody stole all our lunches.

555
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:02,916
Who would steal 30-bagged lunches?

556
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,260
I'll tell you who took those lunches.

557
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:15,637
That damn sasquatch.

558
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,934
Well, I guess that's it.
OK, everybody! Back on the bus!

559
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,980
- Hey, what's with Ernie?
- I don't know. I'll be right back.

560
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,526
Hey, Ernie, what's up?

561
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,654
Nothing.

562
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,284
You fallen in love
with the wall or somethin'?

563
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,495
- I had an accident.
- An accident. What does that mean?

564
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:41,914
Ooh!

565
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,541
Oh, I know. OK. Uh...

566
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,798
Don't worry, buddy. You hang tight.
I'll be right back.

567
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:02,476
Hey, look, everybody! Billy peed his pants!

568
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:07,439
Of course, I peed my pants. Everybody
my age pees their pants. It's the coolest.

569
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,358
- Really?
- Yes!

570
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:13,320
You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.

571
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:16,865
- Wow.
- Hey, man, Ernie peed his pants too.

572
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:19,993
All right!

573
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,460
If peeing your pants is cool,
consider me Miles Davis.

574
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,837
Oh!

575
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:34,716
That was the grossest thing
I've ever heard in my life! Let's go!

576
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,135
Get on the bus here.

577
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,388

if you know what I mean.

583
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,667
No, you don't.

584
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:13,505
Well, not me personally, but a guy I know.
Him and her got it on.

585
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,674
Whoo-ee!

586
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,552
No, they didn't.

587
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:21,138
No, no, no, they didn't.

588
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:25,184
But you can imagine
what it'd be like if they did, right? Huh?

589
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:35,569

Good, great, grand, wonderful!

- Billy is on the right track.
- He's on track all right.

609
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:16,461
He's headed right down the toilet.

610
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,215
Easy.

611
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:23,802
You still don't think he's gonna make it?

612
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:28,265
Trust me, Carl, baby.
I know he's not gonna make it.

613
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,851
Would you excuse me for a second?

Who?

616
00:47:56,335 --> 00:48:00,255
You know, that was really sweet,
the way you helped Ernie out yesterday.

617
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,509
He would have done the same for me.

618
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,595
So what's it like being back in school?

619
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,264
I don't know. I kinda feel
like an idiot sometimes.

620
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,518
Although I am an idiot,
so it kinda works out.

621
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,980
Is it just you and your dad in here?

622
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:21,902
Well, actually, no. There's Juanita,
and some maids and butlers and stuff.

623
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,155
And people who work for my dad
are always stoppin' by.

624
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,701
And my friends are always sleepin' over,
even when I didn't ask 'em to.

625
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:32,913
- Sounds like a hotel.
- It kinda is. It can be distracting.

626
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,541
That's why I moved out here.

627
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:49,346
Wow.

628
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,474
This is where I've been spending
most of my time lately.

629
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:55,102
Not exactly roughing it, are you?

630
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:03,986
Those are, uh...
They come with the tent, so...

631
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:13,704
Oh, wow. A Tale of Two Cities.
I don't think we're up to that one yet.

632
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,332
I can understand nine words
in that book now.

633
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:24,464
So, it's, um... the last day of third grade.

634
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:29,428
And you have the teacher,
alone, in your tent.

635
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,806
What do you wanna do?

636
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,020
Well, I can think of three things
I'd like to do.

637
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:42,441
One would involve some ice cubes
and a nine-iron.

638
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:47,029
- Two would include a buffalo.
- Really?

639
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:52,534
Live or stuffed.
Preferably stuffed, for safety's sake.

640
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:55,662
Three: we'd bring back
some of those ice cubes,...

641
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,916
but switch it over to a pitching wedge.

642
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,169

00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:07,299

This is Veronica, my teacher. That's Carl.

00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:16,600
Very pleased to meet you.
Bill, I think Eric is up to something.

646
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:19,520
- Who's Eric?
- He works for my dad too.

647
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:22,564
He gets the company if I screw up.
He's a douchebag.

648
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:27,194
He made some menacing comments to me,
and then he did that little weasel laugh.

649
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:31,490
- Yeah. How does that laugh go again?
- You know. [LAUGHS]

650
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,077
- Very good. It sounded just like him.
- Thanks.

651
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,205
Well, I'm sure he's got
something up his sleeve.

652
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,957
- Thanks, buddy.
- No problem.
