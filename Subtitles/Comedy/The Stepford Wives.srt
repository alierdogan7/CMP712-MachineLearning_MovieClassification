1
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,223
Ladies and gentlemen, l would
now like to introduce

2
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,525
a legend in our industry.

3
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,402
She's the most successful president
in the history of our network

4
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,905
and for the past five years has
kept us at the very top of the ratings.

5
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,704
She's our maverick, our wild card,

6
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,972
and today she's gonna take us
right to the edge.

7
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,548
Please welcome a giant, a genius

8
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:45,350
and the hardest-working person
in television: Joanna Eberhart.

9
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,519
Way to go, Joanna!

10
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,533
Thank you all so much. Thank you.

11
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,232
Joanna!

12
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:07,106
That feels good, especially coming
from such a fantastic group of people

13
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,510
from all across our great nation,
our network affiliates.

14
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:15,154
Give yourselves a great big hand.
You deserve it.

15
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,281
And l want
a big, fat Christmas bonus.

16
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,085
Just kidding, but not really,
because...

17
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,162
...l am so excited, l am so on fire,
l am so guts-and-glory passionate

18
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,866
about what l am about to show you.

19
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,365
So get ready, because
on Monday nights

20
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,870
the whole world will be watching
a man, a woman and a buzzer!

21
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,250
Are you ready
for the final gender challenge?

22
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,616
- Who makes more money?
- l do.

23
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,690
Who enters lronman triathlons
every year and wins?

24
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:54,917
l do.

25
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,824
Who secretly wishes they were
married to a hot, sexy lesbian?

26
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,389
- l do!
- l do!

27
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,794
lt's Tara!

28
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,299
And...

29
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,973
...on Thursdays...

30
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,773
No, this is not just a TV show.

31
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,110
No, this is a breakthrough,
a breakout, a break-all-the-rules

32
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,583
and bring-on-the-Emmys
mega-smash!

33
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,218
Yes!

34
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,918
Can l present to you this planet's
ultimate reality phenomenon?

35
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,289
<i>I Can Do Better!</i>

36
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,379
<i>We wiII aII be right there</i>
<i>as happiIy-married coupIes</i>

37
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,845
<i>are fIown first cIass to</i>
<i>a tropicaI isIand paradise</i>

38
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,781
<i>where they wiII be compIeteIy</i>
<i>surrounded by professionaI prostitutes.</i>

39
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,549
<i>And at the end of the week...</i>
<i>WeII, Iet's take a peek.</i>

40
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,920
Well, it's been a week, and Hank,
our personnel manager from Omaha,

41
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,654
has spent the entire seven days
with Vanessa,

42
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,833
our call girl and exotic dancer.

43
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,625
Yeah, it's been amazing.

44
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,162
And l'll admit we've had some fun
in the hot tub and all.

45
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,307
But you wanna know something,
Billy?

46
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,442
All we did was talk...

47
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,905
...because l love my wife...

48
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,315
...and the only place l want to be
is back in Omaha with my Barbara.

49
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,050
Tough break, Nessa.

50
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,154
And Barbara, you spent Monday
with Rocky,

51
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,586
our bodybuilder and male escort,

52
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,419
Tuesday through Thursday
with the entire cast

53
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,721
of the XXX film <i>Hung Jury</i>,

54
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,094
and you spent
the entire weekend with Tonkiro.

55
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,408
And now it's time for the final
decision. Barbara, it's yours to make.

56
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,172
ls it gonna be Omaha?

57
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,910
Or ''Oma-hunks''?

58
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,086
Well...

59
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,118
...before l came on this show
l only had sex with one man,

60
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,848
and that was usually Hank.

61
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,221
l love Hank deeply and forever
with all my heart,

62
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,127
and l would never do anything
to hurt him.

63
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,062
But l can do better!

64
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,746
The battle of the sexes,
as old as time but as--

65
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,813
Why?

66
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,685
- Excuse me?
- Why did you do it?

67
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,880
Oh, my God, it's Hank
from <i>I Can Do Better!</i>

68
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,184
Hank, everyone.

69
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,392
No, stop it.

70
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,133
l love Barbara. l had a family.
l had a life.

71
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,031
Hank,

72
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,207
l know it hurts.

73
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,172
Love isn't easy.

74
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:02,710
Relationships aren't easy,
not for anyone.

75
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,383
But now you know the truth
about Barbara,

76
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,384
and you are gonna move on
with your life.

77
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,523
And you're gonna meet
someone wonderful,

78
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,125
and America is gonna love you.

79
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,304
Yeah. l've got a great idea
for another hot new show.

80
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,872
Well, tell it to us.

81
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,542
lt's called...

82
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,210
- ...<i>Let's KiII AII the Women.</i>
- He's got a gun!

83
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,489
- Joanna, are you all right?
- l am great.

84
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,458
Raring to go. The police were
sensational. And not a scratch.

85
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,099
- You haven't heard?
- About what?

86
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,034
That man, Hank.
Right before he tried to kill you,

87
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,767
he went to see his ex-wife
and five of her new boyfriends.

88
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,445
- He did?
- He shot all of them.

89
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,080
The wife is in critical condition,

90
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,147
and four of the guys
are on life support.

91
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,840
- Tonkiro?
- He's fine.

92
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,078
- Thank God.
- So you know what this means.

93
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,851
Of course.

94
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,618
We pay for all of their medical
treatment, every penny.

95
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,796
We get them the very best therapist,
childcare, rehab,

96
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,592
whatever they need, and then
we fly them to New York, first class,

97
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,927
for a prime-time special,

98
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,162
<i>Hank and Barbara:</i>
<i>Let the HeaIing Begin.</i>

99
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,301
You're not listening.

100
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,976
We can't wear this. The lawsuits
alone may bankrupt the network.

101
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,545
And all your new shows, the whole
lineup, the affiliates won't touch them.

102
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,581
We have shareholders.

103
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,582
We can't let you sink the network.

104
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,617
But we wish you only the best.

105
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,322
Of course.

106
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,330
Thank you for being so classy
and taking this so well.

107
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,224
Joanna, we just wanted to say
that this is so not fair.

108
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,732
Goodbye, everybody!

109
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,238
All the best!

110
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,802
Jo?

111
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,000
Walter.

112
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,370
- What happened?
- Well,

113
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,672
you've had a complete
nervous collapse.

114
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,879
And the doctors say there's a lot
of work to do,

115
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,349
but you're gonna be just fine.

116
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,546
Oh, and Pete made this for you.

117
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,859
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- lsn't it?

118
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,259
And l wanted you to know
that the minute l heard the news,

119
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,401
l called the network and l quit.

120
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,071
- You did that for me?
- Of course.

121
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,104
l know l was only a vice president,

122
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,005
but l could never work
for those people,

123
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,340
not after the way they treated you.

124
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,808
Oh, Walter...

125
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,315
And do you remember what today is?

126
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,680
lt's our anniversary.

127
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,758
Oh, Walter...

128
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,191
...l'm so sorry.

129
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,967
Maybe that man who tried
to shoot me, maybe he was right.

130
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,229
Maybe l've become the wrong kind
of woman.

131
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,840
Maybe l've made all
of the wrong decisions.

132
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,910
Could we get away and start over?

133
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,811
And get it right, our marriage?

134
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,057
- But why are we moving?
- To Connecticut?

135
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,488
We're moving so that we can all
kick back and have a great new life

136
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,495
in this beautiful new town.

137
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,349
- Name?
- Kresby.

138
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,044
- Welcome to Stepford.
- Thanks.

139
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,162
- What do you think, guys?
- Cool.

140
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,733
- Good.
- Honey?

141
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,806
Hello, everyone. l'm Mrs. Wellington.

142
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,017
Welcome to Stepford.

143
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,244
l'm with Stepford Realty.
We spoke on the phone.

144
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,719
- You must be Walter.
- So nice to meet you in person.

145
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,515
And the little ones.

146
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,988
l bet you're Pete.

147
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,851
- Duh.
- Pete.

148
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,661
And he's every bit as handsome
as his dad.

149
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,362
Thank you.

150
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,764
And Kimberly, aren't you just
the cutest little bug's ear.

151
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:05,993
Bugs don't have ears.

152
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,530
lsn't she sassy, and a little sad.

153
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,971
And this must be Joanna.

154
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,409
- Electroshock?
- But she's doing great.

155
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,215
Hello, little Energizer.

156
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,948
The minute Walter called, l knew
this was the perfect house for you.

157
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,160
lt's the top of the line
here at Stepford Estates,

158
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,694
and it's got everything
an American family could ever need.

159
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,132
- And may l present to you...
- Look at this.

160
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,060
- This is amazing.
- ...the great room.

161
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,598
l call it cozy.

162
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:48,136
And it's also a smart house. Now,
this controls the security system.

163
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,844
- <i>AII secure.</i>
- lt talks to the refrigerator.

164
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,422
<i>We need juice, we need juice,</i>
<i>we need juice.</i>

165
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,288
The system also monitors
all the commodes.

166
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,965
Where it will test your urine
for blood sugar, protein and body fat.

167
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,967
<i>FIush toiIets.</i>

168
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,430
lsn't that great, kids?

169
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,903
- l'm gonna go check my room.
- Me too.

170
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,670
Now, Walter,
will you be commuting?

171
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,344
No.

172
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,178
No, Joanna and l both
left the network.

173
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,350
Oh, look, it's the puppy.

174
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,751
Robo Rover 3000. Come on, boy.
Come on, come on, come on.

175
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,235
Joanna.

176
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,902
The town is over 200 years old.

177
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,870
lt was founded by George Washington,
and Martha just loved it.

178
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,840
Stepford is Connecticut's
family paradise.

179
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,209
lt has no crime, no poverty
and no pushing.

180
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,414
What is that? Up on the hill?

181
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,454
Well, that's
our Stepford Men's Association.

182
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,186
Where all our wonderful guys can get
together and stay out of our hair.

183
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,462
Am l right?

184
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,466
- Where do the women go?
- To the Simply Stepford Day Spa.

185
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,948
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Claire.

186
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:46,216
l would like you all to welcome
our newest citizen to Stepford: Joanna.

187
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,853
Good morning, Joanna.

188
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:55,265
- Are we ready to work out?
- Oh, yes.

189
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,163
Places and poles, please.

190
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,546
Wait, you work out dressed like this?

191
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:15,584
Well, of course. Whatever we do,
we always want to look our very best.

192
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,621
l mean, why, imagine if our husbands
saw us

193
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,984
in worn, dark, urban sweat clothes

194
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,561
with stringy hair
and almost no makeup?

195
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,095
Oh, good heavens.

196
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,630
Now,

197
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,870
today you are in for a special treat

198
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,197
because we are working on a series
of exercises

199
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,172
which l've personally invented,
based on simple household tasks.

200
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,638
l call my program Clairobics.

201
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,780
Because her name is Claire.

202
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,883
All right, now it's time to slim
and scrub.

203
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,919
Let's all be washing machines.
And...

204
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:57,984
And...

205
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,995
Come on, Joanna.

206
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,932
Spin cycle, ladies, and...

207
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,265
And...

208
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,999
And...

209
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,608
And...

210
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,284
- Sweet.
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Who's the man?

211
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,748
You the man.

212
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,980
Thank you, dear.

213
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,130
Walter?

214
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,821

215
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,330

00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,265

- Nice to see you.

218
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,700
Come on in.

219
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:21,174
<i>Hear ye, hear ye. Come one,</i>
<i>come aII, and happy Fourth of JuIy.</i>

220
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:25,406
<i>At 1:30 wiII be the chiIdren's</i>
Stars and Stripes<i>, face painting...</i>

221
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,016
lsn't this great?

222
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,449
A real old-fashioned town picnic.
Can't get this in Manhattan.

223
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,486
Which is why we're gonna stay
exactly ten minutes.

224
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,250
We're gonna make an appearance,
and then we're gonna get out of here.

225
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,294
Kids, l'm really sorry about all of this,
but let's try and have fun.

226
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,164
Mom, it's a picnic.

227
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,491
- Chill.
- Go ahead, go ahead, have fun.

228
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,360
Ten minutes?

229
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,128
Walter, you just don't get it.

230
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,739
These women are like
deranged-flight-attendant friendly.

231
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,275
- They're gonna be all over me.
- Joanna!

232
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,275
Here we go.

233
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,416
- Oh, Joanna.
- Joanna, hi.

234
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,921
- Hi, Walter.
- Hi.

235
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,989
- You look great.
- l love you in khakis.

236
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:11,459
They're new, a little experiment.

237
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,223
Now l know why they call it
Banana Republic.

238
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,925
Excuse me. Excuse me!

239
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,469
Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.

240
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:24,704
Excuse me. Excuse me.

241
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,408
Excuse me.

242
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,642
Am l the only one who finds all of this
more than a little disturbing?

243
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,542
We are celebrating
our nation's birthday,

244
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,546
but there are almost no
African-Americans,

245
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,844
no Native Americans,
no Asian Americans,

246
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,783
and... Oh, my God.

247
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:42,324
Hey, you're Joanna Eberhart.
You got such a raw deal.

248
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,119
Aren't you Bobbie Markowitz?

249
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,729
l love your books, especially
the last one. What was it called?

250
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,694
lt was about your relationship
with your mother.

251
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,597
- <i>I Love You But PIease Die.</i>
- Hey, baby. Baby.

252
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:55,067
Look what l did, look.

253
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:59,234
Happy Fourth of July, everybody.

254
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:01,377
Excuse me.

255
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,275
- Yes, he's my husband.
- Hey Kresbo-Man.

256
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,882
- Hey, Dave.

257
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,950
- Men's Association.
- That place.

258
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,246
- Did you finish the laundry?
- No, l finished a chapter.

259
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,946
- Did you make the sandwiches?
- Did you?

260
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,351
- Where are the kids?
- What kids?

261
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,583
Our kids.

262
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,420
- Hey, are you two OK?
- We're fine.

263
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,290
- Come on, l need a cookie.
- See what l mean?

264
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:23,797
Jerry... Jerry, it's a bake sale,
an actual bake sale.

265
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,561
lt's like some heavenly diorama
at the Smithsonian

266
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,636
in the Hall of Homemakers.

267
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:32,536
Oh, no. No, stop it.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

268
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,075
That is not cobbler.

269
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:37,372
Roger, could we...? Could we reel it
in, like, a couple of hundred yards?

270
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,207
How do you ladies keep your figures?

271
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,647
ls there just a huge vat
of cobbler vomit somewhere?

272
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,047
- But worth it?
- Roger.

273
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,312
Oh, l'm sorry.

274
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,555
- That is...
- This is fabulous.

275
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,158
Jerry thinks that l overdo,
you know, everything.

276
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,955
Excuse me, aren't you
Roger Bannister?

277
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,654
The amazing architect
from <i>The Times</i>?

278
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,197
Oh, thank you. This is Jerry Harmon.

279
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,663
- Hi.
- Corporate attorney.

280
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,496
But he's getting the help
that he needs.

281
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,762
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

282
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,031
- We're new.
- Oh, my God, Joanna Eberhart.

283
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,709
- l love the shows.
- Oh, thank you.

284
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,707
And Bobbie Markowitz.
Love the books.

285
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,881
Jerry, how did this happen?
Where did you come from?

286
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,175

287
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,544

Everything isn't always

She's dehydrated.

339
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:28,577
- Dehydrated? Are you crazy?
- Jo. l'm sorry about this, Mike.

340
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:33,914
Joanna. Joanna, this is
a very special moment.

341
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:36,484
- l would like you to meet...
- Mike Wellington.

342
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,314
My husband.

343
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,615
- Oh...
- And you must be the famous Joanna.

344
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,020
You're even prettier
than in the newspapers.

345
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,787
- They don't do you justice.
- Excuse me, that woman is very sick.

346
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,658
Thank you. l should be going
with her.

347
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:50,834
She'll get all the help she needs.
Trust me, little lady.

348
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:01,670
That woman had a seizure,
and she was practically levitating.

349
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:05,280
And l have told you five million times
l phoned Herb.

350
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,416
He said that Sarah is fine.

351
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,086
She just needed some fluids,
just like Mike said.

352
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,620
- She was sparking, Walter.
- She was dancing.

353
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:17,225
Then why wasn't there
a doctor anywhere? And why...?

354
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,563
Why...?

355
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,560
Walter! Walter!
And why did everyone

356
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,532
just automatically listen
to that Mike person?

357
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,932
And why, why was everyone
just standing there?

358
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,971
You mean why weren't they
just listening to you?

359
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,675
- That's not what l'm saying!
- Jesus Christ, Joanna!

360
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,813
- What?
- You were fired,

361
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:40,142
your kids barely know you,
and our marriage is falling apart.

362
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,115
And your whole attitude
makes people want to kill you.

363
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,982
lt makes people try to kill you.

364
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,555
That's what we're doing here.

365
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,022
The people in this town
have been nothing

366
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,458
but friendly and welcoming
and wonderful to you.

367
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:56,324
And you've been nothing but snide
and suspicious.

368
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,997
And on top of that, at the picnic
you humiliated me.

369
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:00,397
Well, l can't do it anymore.

370
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:05,064
l can't keep fighting you for every
inch of everything. Game over.

371
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,302
- Marriage over.
- Oh, no!

372
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,312
- No!
- No what?

373
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,309
Please don't go.

374
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:14,814
- Why not?
- Because you're right.

375
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:21,456
Wait, l'm sorry. l don't think
l heard that. What did you just say?

376
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,196
l said, you're right.

377
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:27,889
About?

378
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,557
About everything.

379
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,901
About me.

380
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,830
Do you know why l signed on
at the network?

381
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,864
Because l thought that if l was
around, l could help you lighten up.

382
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,404
You did?

383
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,038
Yeah, l did. What was that
one show called?

384
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,711
<i>I Can Do Everybody</i>?

385
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:20,984
See, that's what l mean.
l wanted to make you laugh.

386
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,515
That's so sweet, but l...

387
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,094
l was busy. l was running
a network, Walter.

388
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,797
You were so busy that we haven't
made love in over a year.

389
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,594
- l know. l...
- Well, l miss you.

390
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:44,036
But l've always loved you
so much. l...

391
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,041
You know that.

392
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,505
Why?

393
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:53,272
Because... Because...

394
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,386
...you're goofy, and you're...

395
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,357
You're handsome, and you're...
You're...

396
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,259
You're my Walter.

397
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,195
And because when
you play computer chess

398
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,161
you do that little...

399
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,302
- You do that little victory dance.
- l do not. l don't do that.

400
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,200
- Yes, you do.
- No, l don't.

401
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,637
But if l'm not the smartest

402
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,010
and the best of the best
and the most successful,

403
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:29,549
then l don't know, who am l?

404
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,987
You wanna find out?

405
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,120
How?

406
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,055
First of all, we're in the country now,
so no more black.

407
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:42,755
- No more black? Are you insane?
- You heard me.

408
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,798
Only high-powered, neurotic,
castrating,

409
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:48,301
Manhattan career bitches wear black.
ls that what you wanna be?

410
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:52,001
Ever since l was a little girl.

411
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,537
Do l really look OK?

412
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,715
Can l be honest?

413
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:05,514
- You look kind of like Betty Crocker.
- l know.

414
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,320
- At Betty Ford.
- <i>We need miIk.</i>

415
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:10,891
- <i>We need miIk. We need miIk.</i>
- Thank you.

416
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:13,653
Look, l'm trying to make
an effort to change.

417
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,832
l mean, last night my husband
was a different person.

418
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:19,434
He was strong, he was forceful,
he was commanding.

419
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,127
Like your refrigerator.

420
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,999
Well, nobody said it was gonna
be easy being a homemaker

421
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,732
and a stay-at-home mom.

422
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,405
lt's the toughest job
in the world, right?

423
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:30,637
Well, that may be, but these
Stepford women,

424
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,214
- they're a whole other dimension.
- Oh, like yesterday,

425
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,851
that poor lady, Sarah Sunderson.

426
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,577
Walter said she's fine.

427
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,813
But you said she was shooting off
sparks from her ears.

428
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,514
- Now, that's the first sign.
- Of what?

429
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,454
Cheap jewelry.

430
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:46,722
- We should go see her.
- Why?

431
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,024
Because we need to be supportive.

432
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,224
That's how people behave outside
of Manhattan.

433
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,765
They care about each other.

434
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,528
l mean, if you were in New York
and one of your neighbors got sick

435
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,070
- what would you do?
- We'd call her.

436
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,742
- To see if she was gonna die.
- So we could get the apartment.

437
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,911
Let's go. Up. Up. Up.

438
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,079
Sarah?

439
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:11,847
- Yoo-hoo.
- Yoo-hoo? ls she in there?

440
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,421
- What are you doing?
- lt's open.

441
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,819
- That's amazing.
- So sweet.

442
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,687
And so trusting.

443
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,929
Roger.

444
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,532
Roger.

445
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:27,602
- Look at this place.
- Wow.

446
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,172
- Sarah?
- Sarah?

447
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,179
Roger.

448
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,314
Oh, Herb.

449
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:46,713
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

450
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,324
- Make me beg!
- Yeah!

451
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:53,054
Oh, l'm so lucky!

452
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:55,556
- Oh, my God.
- ls that a DVD?

453
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,200
No, it's them.

454
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,996
Oh, you're the king!

455
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:06,306
Yes!

456
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,850
- l'm going up there.
- Why?

457
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,494
- Roger!
- l want some.

458
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,324
- Roger.
- Roger.

459
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,871
- Baby, grab me some nachos.
- Yes, dear.

460
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,579
What's this?

461
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,380
- Roger, put it down.
- What? Oh, come on.

462
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,556
- Roger.
- Why does it say Sarah?

463
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,019
Roger, you should put it down now.

464
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:56,988
- Let's get out of here.
- This isn't our house.

465
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,889
Oh, stop. Would you just quit?

466
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,264
- We have to, Roger.
- For God's sake, we're trespassing.

467
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:04,263
We have to get out of here.

468
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:06,595
- Put it down. Come on.
- OK, let's try and use this.

469
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,068
We have to go.

470
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,481
l'm so embarrassed.

471
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:31,525
l'm mortified. l'm famished.

472
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,792
- Bobbie.
- Yeah?

473
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,733
- Are you making anthrax?
- Excuse me.

474
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,235
l've been busy. My new book.

475
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,532
But can't you hire someone
to clean?

476
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:45,935
Someone brave?

477
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,737
Dave says l got to do it myself,
like Sarah Sunderson.

478
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,938
- Oh, could you believe her?
- But, darling, her home is spotless.

479
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,143
And she's having incredible sex
in the middle of the day

480
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:56,546
with her husband.

481
00:35:56,753 --> 00:35:59,586
Well, l'm sorry, but my shrink says
l need creative chaos.

482
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,088
- My therapist says l need boundaries.
- My doctor said l need

483
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,022
enough electricity to jumpstart Vegas.

484
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,220
- You ever done Zoloft?
- Kid stuff.

485
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,832
Xanax. l worship Xanax.
l'm old-fashioned.

486
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,934
l like Prozac with a Viagra chaser.

487
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,128
You're up, and you're up.

488
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,900
- Oh, Roger.
- Viagra.

489
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,306
Hey, is there something that you
need to tell us?

490
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,380
Well... Sharing.

491
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,278
OK. OK.

492
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,820
Jerry and l have been
in couple's counseling...

493
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,048
...for over a year...

494
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,092
...and finally... Finally, l just couldn't
take it anymore.

495
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,264
l howled,
''You've become a gay Republican.''

496
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,365
And he said,
''What's wrong with that?''

497
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,330
l said, ''What's wrong with that?

498
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,505
''That's like wanting to be gay
with a bad haircut.''

499
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:50,002
Exactly.

500
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,176
So the counselor suggested
that we move to the 'burbs.

501
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,175
- To find a balance.
- We moved here as a last resort.

502
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,144
Court order. Don't ask.

503
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,216
OK. l know this is unthinkable,

504
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:06,879
but what if we could actually learn
how to be happy...

505
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,821
...without Paxil
or compulsive overeating?

506
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,395
What if we actually gave
this whole thing a try for real,

507
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:16,190
the whole Stepford thing?

508
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:38,281
- Hey, yeah!
- Only one can survive.

509
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:41,321
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

510
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,686
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

511
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:48,263
- <i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>
- Come on, Kresbo baby.

512
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:49,693
- <i>Zeus! Zeus!</i>
- Rip her bra off!

513
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,891
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

514
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,228
Yeah!

515
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,897
- Yeah!
- Zeus rules the universe!

516
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:03,435
And Ted owes Walter
20 big ones!

517
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,081
Ah, to be a man.

518
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,888
So, Walt,

519
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:16,158
you and Stepford,
it seems like a real match.

520
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,026
l'll say. l mean, the town
and the houses. This place.

521
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:24,359
Well, it's like a dream. lt's like...

522
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,695
Like the way life was meant to be.

523
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,137
And all of your wives.
Oh, my God.

524
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:35,471
Oh, my God. They're so... So...

525
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:37,470
Sweet?

526
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,273
Sizzling?

527
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,814
Super fine?

528
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:05,468
Well...

529
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:10,174
We are all so thrilled to be here
at the Stepford Book Club,

530
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,575
l can't tell you.

531
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,517
Now, l have just finished
the third volume

532
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,211
of Robert Caro's
<i>Life of Lyndon Johnson</i>,

533
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:23,792
and l am dying
for the next installment.

534
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,022
Well...

535
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,563
That's all marvelous,
but today we are going to discuss...

536
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:35,534
Well, it is probably the most important
book any of us will ever read.

537
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:39,539
Yes, it is provocative,
but it is also inspiring.

538
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:44,808
The Heritage Hills Special Edition
Golden Deluxe Treasury

539
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:48,484
of <i>Christmas Keepsakes</i>
<i>and CoIIectibIes.</i>

540
00:39:57,894 --> 00:39:59,088
This book said to me,

541
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:03,665
''Let's celebrate the birth
of our Lord Jesus Christ with yarn.''

542
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,566
Now, Bobbie, we all realize you're
probably feeling a bit uncomfortable

543
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,400
with this week's book
because you're...

544
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,338
- Oh, what's the word l'm looking for?
- New?

545
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,011
- Scared?
- Cranky?

546
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,575
- Jewish.
- Same thing.

547
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:21,580
But the Heritage Hill series
is very inclusive.

548
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,718
ln fact, there is a whole chapter
about Hanukkah.

549
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,783
l just love the chapter on pinecones.

550
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,426
They're not just for wreaths
and centerpieces.

551
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:35,223
You can use pinecones to create
a very special Yuletide menorah.

552
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,263
Your pinecone snowman
could be Jewish.

553
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,059
Just add one of those little beanies.

554
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,863
Or maybe l could just use
hundreds of pinecones

555
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,267
to spell out the words ''Big Jew''

556
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:48,843
in letters 1 5 feet tall
in the snow in my front yard.

557
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,878
That's a wonderful idea.

558
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,748
- Oh, yes, yes.
- That's very wonderful.

559
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,946
- Yes.
- She's so smart.

560
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,854
l love the idea of creating
a life-sized Santa Claus,

561
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,620
- all out of pinecones.
- OK, l love that.

562
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,930
l'm going to use a pinecone in
my nativity as the baby Jesus.

563
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:14,230
And l'm going to attach
a pinecone to my vibrator

564
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,669
and have a really merry
Christmas.

565
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,676
<i>Here comes Santa CIaus</i>
<i>Here comes Santa CIaus</i>

566
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:24,403
<i>Right down Santa CIaus Lane</i>

567
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:28,909
<i>He's got a bag that's fiIIed with toys</i>
<i>For the boys and girIs again</i>

568
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,646
<i>Hear those sIeigh beIIs jingIe jangIe</i>
<i>What a beautifuI sight</i>

569
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:36,417
<i>So jump in bed, cover up your head</i>
<i>Because Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

570
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:39,117
- Who?
- <i>Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

571
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:43,531
Joanna, how is she fitting in?

572
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,064
Well...

573
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:48,431
OK...

574
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,137
l'm among friends, right?

575
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,329
- Of course.
- Yeah.

576
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:52,769
So...

577
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:56,637
Joanna and l had this big talk,

578
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,371
and we were really open
with each other.

579
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:02,313
l mean, we really got it all out.

580
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,918
And l think from now on...

581
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:08,084
...she's gonna be very, very different.

582
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:16,088
You think Joanna's
really going to change?

583
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:19,758
Yes, l do. Absolutely.

584
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,132
And how long
have you been married?

585
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:34,546
- Ted!
- Yes.

586
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,844
Don't you owe Walter $20?

587
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:44,719
That's absolutely right, l do.

588
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,223
Babe!

589
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:57,363
Yes, darling?

590
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,543
Walt, sit down.

591
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,712
l need 20.

592
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,818
- You know my PlN.
- Of course.

593
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:00,965
She gives singles.

594
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,003
Are these all for day camp
tomorrow?

595
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,436
l just want you to be proud of me,
honey.

596
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,239
Dad, watch this.

597
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:43,241
Ball.

598
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,808
- Aren't robots cool?
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,620
May l speak to the man
of the house?

600
00:44:53,156 --> 00:44:55,249
- Snot-butt.
- Funkmaster Markowitz.

601
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,484
- Stone-cold Thriller Killer Kresbo.
- Cupcakes, anyone?

602
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,526
- Cupcakes!
- Cupcakes.

603
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,061
Hey, right on time.

604
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:03,857
Jo, these are smoking.

605
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,262
- Why don't you make stuff like this?
- Why don't you?

606
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:09,094
Because l have a penis.

607
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,872
- We should get moving.
- Yeah, we got a meeting.

608
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:16,273
- At the Men's Association.
- When will you be home, honey?

609
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,907
When l'm home.

610
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:44,001
Call a sitter.

611
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:54,309
Bobbie, are you sure about this?

612
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:57,645
We're not spying. We're just visiting.

613
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:00,721
Fellas, l can't tell you
how happy we are

614
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,255
to welcome all of this new blood.

615
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,154
- You said it, Mike.
- That's right.

616
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,988
l love, love this space.

617
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,593
lt's very Ralph Lauren meets
Sherlock Holmes.

618
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,392
lt says, ''l have taste and a scrotum.''

619
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:13,796
- Roger, you promised.
- What?

620
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,937
- Whore.
- Bore.

621
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:17,701
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.

622
00:46:17,907 --> 00:46:20,671
Jerry, you're gonna find that
Stepford is very open-minded.

623
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:23,209
- Oh, yeah.
- We welcome you and your partner,

624
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,846
just like any other couple.

625
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,345
Absolutely. Any other.

626
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,210
- That's right.
- Girlfriend.

627
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,848
Miss... Miss Thing.

628
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:37,620
- To Stepford!
- Stepford!

629
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:41,429
You bet.

630
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:43,121
Yeah.

631
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:48,135
Damn. Come on, let's go.

632
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,806
You think this is all right,
sneaking around?

633
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:52,372
Add it up.

634
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:56,375
All the women around here
are perfect sex-kitten bimbos.

635
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,207
All the men are drooling nerds.

636
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,610
- Doesn't that seem strange?
- Not to me.

637
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,786
- Why not?
- l work in television.

638
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,080
Oh, come on.

639
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:08,847
You know, Walter,
l think Joanna is right.

640
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:11,151
- l think Stepford is the answer.
- She's a great gal.

641
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,386
Or she will be.

642
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:21,800
- Come on, help me up.
- We shouldn't be here.

643
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,496
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a chicken.

644
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:28,404
- l should be home with my cupcakes.
- Why?

645
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:31,079
Because you only made
5,000 of them?

646
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:35,377
- We're trespassing.
- Only if we get caught.

647
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,851
Damn, l can't see a thing.

648
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:40,545
Oh, there's the light.
There it is.

649
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,987
No, Bobbie.

650
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,006
This is like some alien freak show.

651
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,304
Why? They're just family portraits.

652
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,775
Yeah, that's what l said.

653
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,179
The lights.

654
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,918
We should get out of here.

655
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:22,163
Should we run?

656
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:29,664
Oh, my God.

657
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,006
Clarice?

658
00:49:06,142 --> 00:49:08,474
- Hi, girls!
- Roger!

659
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:10,111
You scared us.

660
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:12,247
- What are you doing in here?
- What's going on?

661
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,349
Do they have hookers or old <i>PIayboy</i>s
or cable porn?

662
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:17,781
Oh, please.
They barely have throw pillows.

663
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,016
- They're coming.
- The menfolk.

664
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,125
- Call us.
- OK.

665
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:27,024
Rog?

666
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,623
What was it?
Did you see anyone?

667
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,028
Not a soul.

668
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:36,330
But what's back here anyway,
in all of these rooms?

669
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:38,131
Storage? Sweaters?

670
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:39,740
Bodies?

671
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,579
- Jerry.
- Do you see that door on your left?

672
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,278
Check it out.

673
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,143
Oh, boy.

674
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,682
Why, l can't see anything.
lt's dark.

675
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,255
Use your flashlight.

676
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,690
l feel like Nancy Drew in
<i>The Mystery of the Mid-Iife Crisis</i>.

677
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,664
What am l looking for?

678
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:09,833
Look down.

679
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,450
Jerry?

680
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:32,185
Roger!

681
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:34,823
Roger!

682
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,522
- Bobbie.
- Roger!

683
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,965
- Bobbie?
- Roger!

684
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:45,399
Roger said there was nothing going on
at the Men's Association.

685
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:47,576
Well, then why doesn't he
answer the phone?

686
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,574
- lt's been two days.
- Bobbie.

687
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,747
Roger!

688
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,848
Roger!

689
00:50:57,153 --> 00:51:01,249
lsn't that his favorite shirt,
the Dolce & Gabbana?

690
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:07,719
The Guccis.

691
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,296
- And the Versace.
- Maybe he's donating them.

692
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,832
To what? The gay homeless?

693
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,135
He loved this.

694
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,034
His program from <i>Hairspray</i>.

695
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,210
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

696
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,344
Viggo.

697
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,727
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
l'm Jerry Harmon, and l...

698
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:49,371
l know l'm pretty new here,
but already l feel so at home.

699
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,704
Why did Jerry ask us
to meet him here?

700
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:56,974
Proud that l can introduce Stepford's
brand-new candidate for state senate.

701
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:02,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Mr. Roger Bannister.

702
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:03,851
What?

703
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,087
He's wonderful.

704
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:22,197
Thank you.

705
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:24,729
Thank you so much.

706
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:27,999
You may very well ask, what are
my qualifications for higher office?

707
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:33,513
Well, l believe in Stepford, America
and the power of prayer.

708
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:36,947
Values l've discovered thanks
to my partner,

709
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:40,554
in life and in the Lord,
Jerry Harmon.

710
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,318
Roger. Roger.

711
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,759
Yes. ls there a question?
Mrs. Markowitz?

712
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:52,792
So you two are happy now?

713
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:55,596
More than ever. Because now
l know that being gay doesn't mean

714
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,832
a guy has to be effeminate
or flamboyant or sensitive.

715
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:01,839
- l'm no sissy.
- No.

716
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:03,671
- Way to go, Roger!
- That's a man!

717
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,077
- Roger?
- Yes. Mrs. Walter Kresby.

718
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:09,751
Roger, l don't understand.
You were out there, you were Roger.

719
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,351
And now...

720
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,317
Now you're different.
Your hair, your clothes.

721
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,492
- You're like someone else.
- People change.

722
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:18,455
You can't stop Stepford.

723
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:22,529
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

724
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:26,031
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

725
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:29,329
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

726
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,838
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

727
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,533
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

728
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:39,044
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

729
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:41,910
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

730
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,609
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

731
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,687
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can't stop Stepford.</i>

732
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,323
So that's why we have
to leave Stepford?

733
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:51,789
- l'm not following.
- OK.

734
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:56,590
Before, Roger was witty
and stylish and ironic.

735
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,562
- And l'm sure he still is.
- No.

736
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,635
Now he's making speeches
in a Brooks Brothers suit.

737
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:03,668
Hey, there's lots of ways to be gay.

738
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:07,001
Don't try to make him
into a stereotype.

739
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,670
Bobbie is right,
and she's leaving too.

740
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,747
This place does something to people.

741
00:54:14,383 --> 00:54:18,149
All of the women are always busy
and perfect and smiling,

742
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:20,185
and all of the men are always happy.

743
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:24,348
- And that's a problem because...?
- Because it's not normal, Walter.

744
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,859
lt's... lt's not the world. lt's not us.

745
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:31,226
And l'm picking up our kids
from camp right now,

746
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,335
and we're getting out of here.

747
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,396
With or without you.

748
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,594
<i>Secure.</i>

749
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:02,864
You'll never change, will you?

750
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,564
Not really.

751
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:07,463
Open the door.

752
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:16,336
<i>UnIock front.</i>

753
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:18,712
And you're right.

754
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:24,108
About what?

755
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:30,248
lf you're that unhappy,
then we should move.

756
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:32,950
Maybe head back to the city.

757
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:35,626
We could leave tomorrow.

758
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:38,665
Thank you.

759
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,631
Thank you.

760
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:23,469
What do you got there? Huh?

761
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,276
Sweetcakes?

762
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,387
lt's 4 a.m. What are you up to?

763
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:44,047
Just recipes for tomorrow.
l like to get a head start.

764
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,024
- On what?
- Apple pie. Bobbie recommended it.

765
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:49,129
l'll be right up.

766
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,635
Walter?

767
00:57:55,337 --> 00:57:56,895
Babe?

768
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:23,923
Bobbie? Bobbie!

769
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:28,199
Oh, my God.

770
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,245
Bobbie?

771
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:56,461
Good morning, Joanna.

772
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:01,931
lsn't it a lovely morning?

773
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:05,571
That's a pretty color.

774
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:06,866
- Mom!
- Mom!

775
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,067
Good morning, my precious ones.

776
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:12,873
And thank you for leaving
your requests on my e-mail.

777
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,245
Adam, you wanted
peanut butter and jelly, no crusts,

778
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,613
a Snickers bar and a Rolex.

779
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,812
Ben, here's a whole-wheat burrito,

780
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:24,459
a soy protein shake and three pieces
of German chocolate layer cake.

781
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,753
- From scratch?
- Of course.

782
00:59:26,962 --> 00:59:29,522
And, Max, you get bacon,
lettuce and tomato

783
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,529
on a lightly-toasted
sesame seed bagel.

784
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,201
But what about my action figures?

785
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,869
There's Mace Windu and Amidala.

786
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,163
- Where's Boba Fett?
- They were out.

787
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,171
- Mom!
- Here's $500.

788
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:42,836
All right.

789
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:45,206
Bye, Mom. Bye, Joanna.

790
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:48,110
Oh, they grow up so fast.
l think l'll have three more.

791
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,945
Bobbie, listen to me.
What have they done to you, huh?

792
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:53,883
What have they done to you?
ls it drugs?

793
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:57,547
ls it brainwashing?
Come on, hey, talk to me.

794
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,228
Of course, but only for a minute.
Then l have to get to work

795
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,454
on this pigsty. Coffee?

796
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,565
No, no coffee. Bobbie, Bobbie.

797
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,565
Last night l went online, all right?
And l found out,

798
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,738
all of the women here,
they used to be big deals,

799
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:10,963
l mean, big deals.

800
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:13,437
CEOs, executives, judges.

801
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:16,543
Sarah Sunderson,
she used to run an airline.

802
01:00:16,745 --> 01:00:18,872
With that perfect skin.

803
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:21,208
No. No, no, no.
She didn't used to look like that.

804
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,078
- None of the women did. They...
- Coffee?

805
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,816
Coffee? No. No coffee.

806
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:30,082
Bobbie. Bobbie. This isn't you.

807
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:33,826
That's right, Joanna. This isn't me.

808
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:36,122
lt's a whole new me.

809
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,961
l'm happy and l'm healthy
because l understand

810
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,160
- what's important in life.
- Yes.

811
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:43,599
- Your new book.
- That's right.

812
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,933
That's what's important,
my new cookbook.

813
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:49,702
And my husband and my family
and making a perfect home.

814
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,937
lt's a lesson every gal needs to learn.

815
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,273
Especially you.

816
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:56,610
l'm your friend, Joanna.
l'm going to help you.

817
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,343
- You need me.
- You stay away from me.

818
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,919
You're driven.

819
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:02,386
- Well, sometimes.
- And you're selfish.

820
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:05,159
- You wanna rule the world.
- No.

821
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,797
l can fix you. l can change you.

822
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:13,492
What...have...they...done to you?

823
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:15,701
Let's get busy.

824
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,404
Answer the phone.

825
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:23,544
Hello, is...? ls this the day camp?

826
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:24,974
Oh.

827
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,344
Yes, this is... This is Joanna Eberhart.
l would like to speak to my children.

828
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:32,645
l'm coming to pick them up
right now.

829
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:36,413
What?

830
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,354
Walter!

831
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,765
Walter, where are you?

832
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,060
l know you've got the kids.

833
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:49,601
Pete, Kimberly!

834
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,535
Oh, boys.

835
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:57,563
Welcome.

836
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,555
Where are my children?

837
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,922
- They're perfectly safe.
- Where are my children?

838
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:23,126
- You'll see them soon.
- Where's Walter?

839
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:31,965
How could you do this?

840
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:36,709
Ever since we met,
you've beaten me at everything.

841
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,311
You're better educated.

842
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,611
You're stronger, you're faster.

843
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:43,148
You're a better dancer,
a better tennis player.

844
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,352
You've always earned
at least six figures more

845
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:47,454
than l could ever dream of.

846
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:49,483
You're a better speaker,

847
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,989
a better executive.

848
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:54,887
You're even better at sex.
Don't deny it.

849
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,631
l wasn't going to.

850
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,597
Well, don't l get anything?

851
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,962
You got me.

852
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:03,204
No, l got to hold your purse.

853
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:06,431
l got to tell the kids
that you'd be late again.

854
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,167
l got to tell the press
that you had no comment.

855
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,743
l got to work for you.

856
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:12,004
With me.

857
01:04:12,214 --> 01:04:14,114
Under you.

858
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,078
All of us.

859
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,719
We married wonder women.

860
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,786
Supergirls.

861
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:23,981
Amazon queens.
Well, you know what that makes us?

862
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,795
Smart, worthy, lucky.

863
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:29,759
We're the wuss.

864
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,160
The wind beneath your wings.

865
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:34,096
Your support system.

866
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,793
- We're the girl.
- And we don't like it.

867
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:37,335
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, that's right.

868
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,131
- You're damn right.
- Yeah. That's right.

869
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:41,571
And is this your answer,
to kill us?

870
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:45,235
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
We help you. We perfect you.

871
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,108
By turning us into robots?

872
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,351
Does any fraction of these women
still exist?

873
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:53,680
Of course. Almost everything.

874
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,517
- Shall we show her?
- Show me what?

875
01:04:56,725 --> 01:05:01,662
lt's a promotional thing l've been
working on for when we go global.

876
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:05,125
Walter, l don't think you've seen this.

877
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:20,310
<i>Some guys ask, how do we do it?</i>

878
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:23,712
<i>In Iayman's terms,</i>
<i>it's reaIIy pretty simpIe.</i>

879
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:25,853
<i>Come on aIong.</i>

880
01:05:32,694 --> 01:05:35,891
<i>First, we take a gIoomy,</i>
<i>dissatisfied woman.</i>

881
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:40,831
<i>Then, in a very private experience</i>
<i>between husband and wife,</i>

882
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:45,666
<i>he gentIy pIaces her in our</i>
<i>femaIe improvement system.</i>

883
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,272
<i>It's fuIIy automated.</i>

884
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,446
<i>And then, abracadabra.</i>

885
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,808
<i>Her transformation begins.</i>

886
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:57,349
<i>First, we Iocate her brain.</i>

887
01:05:57,552 --> 01:06:00,544
<i>We insert a few nanochips.</i>

888
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,018
<i>Then we program them.</i>

889
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:05,685
<i>AIso, we add</i>
<i>some secret, speciaI ingredients.</i>

890
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:11,328
<i>To avoid any accidents,</i>

891
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:14,764
<i>her husband is kept</i>
<i>at a comfortabIe distance.</i>

892
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,835
<i>Safety first.</i>

893
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:22,537
<i>FinaIIy, we enhance her,</i>

894
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:26,874
<i>to fit the ideaI Stepford Wife</i>
<i>specifications.</i>

895
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:28,049
<i>And...</i>

896
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,716
<i>...voiIa!</i>

897
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,281
<i>Everything is copasetic.</i>

898
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,322
<i>WeIcome to the future.</i>

899
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,832
lt's a painting again.

900
01:06:50,772 --> 01:06:52,672
l should explain. You see,

901
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,269
my real name isn't Mike.

902
01:06:55,477 --> 01:06:57,741
lt's just a nickname
from where l used to work.

903
01:06:58,113 --> 01:07:00,604
- Where?
- Microsoft.

904
01:07:01,149 --> 01:07:02,980
- NASA.
- Disney.

905
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:04,686
AOL.

906
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,410
ls that why the women
are so slow?

907
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:07,922
Joanna.

908
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:11,589
ls this what you really want?

909
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,028
Women who behave like slaves,

910
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:17,824
women who are obsessed
with cleaning their kitchens

911
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,000
and doing their hair,

912
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,829
women who never challenge you
in any way,

913
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:24,699
women who exist
only to wait on you hand and foot?

914
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,571
- Yeah.
- That sounds good to me.

915
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:28,572
Joanna, you're a brilliant woman.

916
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:30,802
Surely you can appreciate,
at the very least,

917
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,446
the genius of the concept.

918
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:35,844
Picture, if you could streamline
your spouse,

919
01:07:36,618 --> 01:07:39,781
if you could overhaul
every annoying habit,

920
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,649
every physical flaw,

921
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:45,122
every moment of whining
and nagging and farting in bed.

922
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,851
lmagine...

923
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,823
...if you could enjoy
the person you loved,

924
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,727
but only at their very best.

925
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:57,231
And the only reason for your anger,

926
01:07:57,806 --> 01:08:01,037
your resentment, your rage
is really very simple.

927
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:04,244
You're furious
because we thought of it first.

928
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,743
While you were trying
to become men,

929
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:07,881
we decided to become gods.

930
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:10,885
Let me ask you something,

931
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:14,749
these machines,
these Stepford Wives,

932
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,514
can they say, ''l love you''?

933
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:18,993
Mike.

934
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,419
Of course.

935
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:21,857
Fifty-eight languages.

936
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:25,930
But do they mean it?

937
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:56,859
Enjoy.

938
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,630
Walter.

939
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:58,790
Walt.

940
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:12,869
Joanna. Right here.

941
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:01,054
- Sarah.
- Claire.

942
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:11,931
- Marianne.
- Charmaine.

943
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,863
- Roger.
- Roberta.

944
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,506
Oh, Mike!

945
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:04,747
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

946
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,286
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

947
01:12:15,797 --> 01:12:17,526
Good evening, everyone.

948
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:19,063
What a delight to see

949
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:22,894
all of our wonderful wives
and their happy, happy husbands.

950
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:27,063
Tonight is truly the highlight
of our year because tonight

951
01:12:27,275 --> 01:12:31,473
we honor our very newest citizens
of Stepford.

952
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,478
ln my opinion, they are
the cream of the crop in couple

953
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,147
that proudly proclaims Stepford

954
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,319
the American way of love.

955
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,011
Now...

956
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,414
...l'd like to ask my wonderful woman,
my lovely wife,

957
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:16,021
my bride, my best friend,

958
01:13:16,424 --> 01:13:20,121
to join me in a glorious
midsummer night's waltz.

959
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:38,705
Yeah.

960
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:14,245
ls everything perfect?

961
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:15,814
Everything.

962
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,981
- Mike.
- Yeah.

963
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:20,449
Darling.

964
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:25,389
- My pleasure.
- lt's an honor.

965
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:31,061
- Champagne?
- Allow me.

966

973
01:16:18,172 --> 01:16:20,834
So, Joanna,
are you enjoying Stepford?

974
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:24,534
Oh, yes. The town is so splendid.

975
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,340
Everyone is so kind.

976
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:31,116
And then, of course, there's you.

977
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,154
Me?

978
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,457
And it's simple really.

979
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,726
Honey, grab me another Scotch.

980
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,927

Mike!

993
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:16,288
Mike, there's something...

994
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:20,551
...unspeakable going on
in the ballroom.

995
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,161
You have to come right now.

996
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:24,854
lt's an apocalypse!

997
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:35,943
What did you do to us?

998
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,710
- Mike!
- Mike!

999
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,141
Men, control your wives.

1000
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,214
Control your wives.

1001
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:49,619
lt's not working!

1002
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,892
This is not Stepford.

1003
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,227
Mike, what's happening?

1004
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:06,466
l was in the garden,
and l was dreaming of your...

1005
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:08,801
Your smile and your after-shave.

1006
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,809
And l realized...

1007
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:14,978
...l can do better.

1008
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,428
- Walt.
- She's not a robot.

1009
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:29,730
- What?
- What?

1010
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,193
What, she's not a robot?

1011
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:32,927
She never was.

1012
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,235
Wait a second.

1013
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,372
- l couldn't do it.
- What?

1014
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,847
Why not?

1015
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:49,609
Because she's not a science project.

1016
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:52,547
Because l didn't marry something
from RadioShack.

1017
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,022
That's a shame.

1018
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:56,987
No.

1019
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,286
That's a man.

1020
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,130
l thought you were ready.

1021
01:20:09,303 --> 01:20:12,568
l thought... l thought you were ready.
l thought l knew you.

1022
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,966
You're a disgrace.

1023
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:20,437
To everything this town stands for.

1024
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,644
To the future.

1025
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:25,750
That's right, that's right. Tell him.

1026
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,115
You're gonna have to pay for that.

1027
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,585
Don't you touch him.

1028
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,059
No!

1029
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,798
He's a Stepford Husband?

1030
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:19,802
An angel.

1031
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:23,543
Now he's just...

1032
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:27,603
...spare parts, thanks to you.

1033
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:30,545
But what are you?
Are you a person or a machine?

1034
01:21:31,118 --> 01:21:32,449
l'm a lady.

1035
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:35,053
A real lady?

1036
01:21:35,256 --> 01:21:36,484
- Every inch.
- Wait.

1037
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,159
Wait, a real, real lady?
Are you a human being?

1038
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,796
Yes, and l may very well be
the only decent human being left.

1039
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:45,465
- ln Stepford?
- ln the world!

1040
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,192
She's fabulous.

1041
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:51,531
All of this, Mike, the wives, Stepford,
this was all your idea?

1042
01:21:51,739 --> 01:21:54,765
Yes.
All l wanted was a better world.

1043
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:59,640
A world where men were men
and women were cherished and lovely.

1044
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:03,078
Does anyone have a screwdriver?

1045
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:05,146
She's nuts.

1046
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:17,121
A world of romance and beauty,

1047
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:21,495
of tuxedos and chiffon,
a perfect world.

1048
01:22:21,702 --> 01:22:23,727
But you were married to a robot.

1049
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,196
The perfect man.

1050
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:29,575
And all l wanted was to make you,
all of you...

1051
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,939
...into perfect women.

1052
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,976
We don't need to be perfect.

1053
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,740
How could you do this to us?

1054
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:38,851
Because l was just like you.

1055
01:22:39,053 --> 01:22:41,419
Overstressed, overbooked,
under-loved.

1056
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:46,790
l was the world's foremost
brain surgeon and genetic engineer.

1057
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:51,624
l had top-secret contracts
with the Pentagon, Apple and Mattel.

1058
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:52,958
l was driven.

1059
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:54,634
Exhausted.

1060
01:22:54,835 --> 01:22:58,134
Until late one night,
l came home to find...

1061
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:01,434
...Mike.

1062
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:05,135
With Patricia.

1063
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,314
My brilliant...

1064
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,713
...blond...

1065
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:15,721
...2 1 -year-old research assistant.

1066
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:18,016
lt was all so...

1067
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,224
...ugly.

1068
01:23:24,098 --> 01:23:28,330
Then early the next morning,
as l gazed across the breakfast table

1069
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:32,165
at their lifeless bodies, l thought...

1070
01:23:32,373 --> 01:23:34,568
...''What have l done?''

1071
01:23:34,775 --> 01:23:37,141
But more importantly...

1072
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,314
...what l could do to make the world
more beautiful?

1073
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,309
l had the skills.

1074
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,117
But l needed help
to realize my larger vision.

1075
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,480
And so l made...

1076
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:50,781
...Mike.

1077
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:54,456
Because he was someone
other men would listen to.

1078
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:57,227
And then l asked myself,

1079
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:02,869
''Where would people never notice
a town full of robots?

1080
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,538
''Connecticut.''

1081
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,369
So l decided
to turn back the clock,

1082
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,102
to a time before overtime,

1083
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,042
before quality time,

1084
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:16,216
before women
were turning themselves into robots.

1085
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:19,675
- Back off!
- Sorry.

1086
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:22,551
Why didn't you change the men too?

1087
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:23,724
That's next.

1088
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,782
You're insane.

1089
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:32,027
l'm in love with a waltz
and a town...

1090
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:36,527
...and a man.

1091
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,654
So, Joanna, you produced
the hard-hitting documentary,

1092
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,691
<i>Stepford: The Secret</i>
<i>of the Suburbs.</i>

1093
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:37,693
And won... Five Emmys, was it?

1094
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:39,058
Oh, six.

1095
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:41,530
- She's shy.
- And so humble.

1096
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:44,932
And, Bobbie, your ordeal
has lead to a bestseller.

1097
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:46,629
You know, l just can't hold a grudge.

1098
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,468
So l've written my very first
book of poetry.

1099
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:52,544
And it's all about hope
and communication

1100
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:53,974
and the healing power of love.

1101
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:55,443
What is it called?

1102
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:57,640
<i>Wait UntiI He's AsIeep,</i>
<i>Then Cut It Off.</i>

1103
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,752
- lt's a page-turner.
- l cried.

1104
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,387
Now, Roger, good news.

1105
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,080
You ran and won.
You're in the state senate.

1106
01:26:04,558 --> 01:26:06,458
- lndependent.
- Next stop, the White House.

1107
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,561
- Yes, this country needs highlights.
- That's our hero.

1108
01:26:09,763 --> 01:26:11,822
And, Jo, Walter really came through
for you,

1109
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:16,594
so how's your marriage now?
ls everything just perfect?

1110
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:17,771
No way.

1111
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,167
But we're doing just great.

1112
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:21,966
Because, um...

1113
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:25,411
Because now, now we know for
sure that it's not about perfection.

1114
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,173
Perfect. Perfect doesn't work.

1115
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:30,043
What about
all those other husbands?

1116
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,652
Are they still angry? Do they still want
all these women to be robots?

1117
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:35,446
Of course. Men are pigs.

1118
01:26:35,656 --> 01:26:39,057
They're disgusting, they're frightened,
repulsive little rodents.

1119
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,887
But we're trying to help them,
right, Bobbie?

1120
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:43,791
- Right.
- Yes, we're trying to reeducate them.

1121
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,158
And where are they?

1122
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:47,730
Oh. Oh, they're still in Stepford.

1123
01:26:47,935 --> 01:26:49,664
Under house arrest.

1124
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:56,843
Hey, you guys.

1125
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:58,773
Which aisle is quilted paper towels?

1126
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:01,243
lf l don't get the right kind,
my wife's gonna kill me.

1127
01:27:01,448 --> 01:27:03,313
Oh, aisle three. And l need...

1128
01:27:03,517 --> 01:27:06,077
No talking, keep shopping.

1129
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:35,077
