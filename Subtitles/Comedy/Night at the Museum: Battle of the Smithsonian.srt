00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,214
<i>Larry: What if this
was your house?</i>

3
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,841
<i>Power's out. Lights are dead.</i>

4
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,051
<i>Your little ones in their bunk
bed down the hall, crying out...</i>

5
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,470
Children: Mommy! Daddy!
Come quick! I'm scared!

6
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,723
- <i>Larry: You need to get there, and fast.</i>
- Coming, honey! Daddy's coming!

7
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>You'll need a weapon. But first,
you'll need a flashlight.</i>

8
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,311
<i>But you're in the dark!
What are you gonna do?</i>

9
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,313
<i>How are you gonna find
it? I'll tell you how.</i>

10
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,148
The glow-in-the-dark flashlight!

11
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,818
That's right, folks! I'm Larry
Daley of Daley devices,

12
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,154
and we're gonna spend the
next paid-programing block

13
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,488
rocking your world.

14
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,407
And I brought along
a friend to do it.

15
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,492
George foreman,
ladies and gentlemen!

16
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,869
(Crowd cheering)

17
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,414
Fantastic, Larry, fantastic!
Isn't he fantastic, America?

18
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,839
But, seriously, isn't it true
that just two years ago,

19
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,508
you were working as a night
guard at some dusty museum?

20
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,345
That is true, two-time world
heavyweight champ George foreman.

21
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,641
I was just a regular Joe with
a flashlight and a dream.

22
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,768
You mean a regular Larry.

23
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,353
(All laughing)

24
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,447
But what's no joke is you're
CEO of Daley devices,

25
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,285
creator of such indispensable
items as the super big dog bone!

26
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,955
You like that one?

27
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,414
The unlosable key ring!

28
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,124
Larry: Oh, yeah, that
little Chestnut!

29
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,377
And now your latest
breakthrough...

30
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,253
Say it with me, America!

31
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,090
All: The glow-in-the-dark
flash-light!

32
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,553
Whatever the household crisis, this
is Daley devices. Can I help you?

33
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,098
Gina, give this back to Stewart.
I don't trust his maths, okay?

34
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,766
That guy called again. Again?

35
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,853
Lar! Huge news! We got
the Wal-Mart meeting.

36
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,564
- No! When?
- Yeah. Three days.

37
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,828
Okay, all right. We got
a lot of work to do.

38
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,112
Well, okay, did you just hear me
say "wal" and "mart" together?

39
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,697
Yeah! I know, it's huge.

40
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,782
So just take a second
to be happy about it.

41
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,575
(Sighs) All right. Hey!

42
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,035
You're totally making fun of me.

43
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,520
No, let's hold off on the victory
parade till we close, okay?

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,081
You got it.

45
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,499
And when does he want to meet?

46
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,983
They want Friday
morning, 10:00 A.M.

47
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,722
Okay, then, you know
what? Cancel that pitch

48
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,036
for the electric saw thing
with the propeller, all right?

49
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,450
I just want to focus
on this. Okay.

50
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,227
Just this. My daughter's
birthday, cancelled!

51
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,648
You can go home. I'm gonna
be pretty late, okay.

52
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,108
Driver: Okay, boss.

53
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,917
Hello! Excuse me!
Unauthorized personnel!

54
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh! If it isn't our very
own Mr. success story.

55
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,298
Come for one of your
nostalgia tours?

56
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,782
I haven't seen you
for a few months.

57
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,803
Yeah, I've been busy.
What's going on here?

58
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,973
Progress, so they tell me.

59
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:37,438
The future. Behold, natural
history, version 2.0.

60
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,231
(Warbled whirring)

61
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,156
<i>Welcome to the museum of natural
history, where history comes to life!</i>

62
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,075
<i>Step up, ask your question.</i>

63
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,577
<i>Then let the next little boy
or girl have their turn.</i>

64
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,624
Okay, where were you born?

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,043
<i>Right here in New York
city, on twentieth street.</i>

66
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,296
<i>October 27th, the year
of our lord 1858.</i>

67
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,340
<i>(Warbled speech)</i>

68
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,761
Blah, blah, blah. History,
history. Learning, learning.

69
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,055
Changing America, one
child at a time.

70
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,392
That's great. So you're adding
some new interactive exhibits?

71
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,355
No, Mr. Daley, not adding.
Replacing the old exhibits.

72
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,898
Where are they going?

73
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,024
Away.

74
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,902
We're getting rid of all this
junk. The dioramas, the waxworks,

75
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,862
even some of the
shabbier animals,

76
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,697
like this scrawny little monkey.

77
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,575
You should be careful.
He's a Capuchin.

78
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,536
It's a monkey.

79
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,539
He's a rare breed. He's a
Capuchin. He's not just a monkey.

80
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,834
"Monkey", then. I said
"monkey". Why be specific?

81
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,086
When you're throwing away a monkey,
you don't need the Latin name.

82
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,712
Are you throwing him away
or are you moving him?

83
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,507
What are you, the
primate garbage police?

84
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,050
Let it go, baby.

85
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,427
- Whose idea was this?
- Me, of course.

86
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,388
I'm in charge. Me and the board.

87
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,806
Mainly the board.

88
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,142
Anyway, why do you care?

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,978
No, it's just that
people love this stuff.

90
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,273
(Scoffing) People, Mr.
Daley, love "what's next?"

91
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,733
You should know that. You left.

92
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,819
My situation changed.
My business took off...

93
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,572
Yeah, you became a success. So
would I, if I was a night guard.

94
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,907
So where are these guys going?

95
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,452
Deep storage. Federal archives.

96
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,581
- Where's that?
- Washington, D.C.

97
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,666
The Smithsonian.

98
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,376
There's got to be
something that we can do.

99
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,340
It's done! They leave
tomorrow morning. It's over.

100
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,062
(Doors clanging shut)

101
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,002
Hey.

102
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,630
Hey, buddy, how you doing? Huh?

103
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,089
How you doing with all this?

104
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,759
Oh. You want what's
in here? Huh?

105
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,164
You think I got
something for you?

106
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,721
You think I got a
little rope? Huh?

107
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,724
Think you're stronger
than me, huh? Whoa!

108
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,267
Is that all you got, huh?

109
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,685
(Growling)

110
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,937
(Grunting)

111
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,772
(Exclaiming)

112
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,652
(Panting)

113
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,913
Lawrence! Good to see you, lad!

114
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,498
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

115
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,625
The guardian of
Brooklyn has returned!

116
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Hey, Ahk. Look, McPhee told me
what's going on around here.

117
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,380
- I had no idea.
- Indeed.

118
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,924
A lot has transpired, Lawrence,
since your last visit.

119
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,259
One would say that...

120
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,593
(Cell phone vibrating)

121
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
- Larry: Just...
- Cricket.

122
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,517
Jedediah: Hey, Bocephus!
Little help over here!

123
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,437
Hey.

124
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,191
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

125
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,777
Jedediah: Well, lookee here.

126
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,363
If it ain't Mr.
Big-in-the-britches himself,

127
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,824
come back just in
time to see us off!

128
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,201
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look, I don't
even know how this happened.

129
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,452
(Cell phone vibrating)

130
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,039
Yeah. Yeah, real mystery
how this happened.

131
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,584
Maybe the answer's on that magic
buzzing box there in your hand!

132
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,921
You weren't here, Gigantor!
That's how it happened!

133
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,298
Ain't no mystery!

134
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,342
(Sighs) The fact is, Larry, there's no
one else here to speak on our behalf

135
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,635
during business hours.

136
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,013
None, none, dumb-dumb.

137
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,472
(Cavemen grunting)

138
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,642
Hey, guys! It's okay!

139
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,145
I'll call the board in the morning,
all right? I got some pull now.

140
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,147
I'll handle this. We're
gonna be okay here.

141
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,566
"We"? Did you hear that?
You hear daydream Johnny?

142
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,528
There ain't been a "we" ever since you
put us on the "pay no mind" list.

143
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,905
And that's a cold
place to be, boy.

144
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,241
Larry, what's done is done.

145
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,038
Even the glory of Rome
had to come to an end.

146
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,334
Would you please not look dramatically
off into the middle distance

147
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,058
when you say that? It
makes me feel worse.

148
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,212
I don't know what
you're talking about.

149
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,424
Where are you looking? Where are
you looking? I'm over here.

150
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,970
Just a bit of wall.

151
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,764
Look, guys, maybe
it won't be so bad.

152
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,557
(Speaking foreign language)

153
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,850
Yes, you make a good point.

154
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,894
But this is the Smithsonian
we're talking about here.

155
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,062
(Chattering)

156
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,772
Dexter, you don't know that.

157
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,485
You're missing the point, Gigantor!
They're shipping us out!

158
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,945
Larry, I know you're trying
to make us feel better.

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,907
I can see that you're
genuinely slightly bothered,

160
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,076
but it's never going
to be the same.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,661
All of us here, together,
in this place.

162
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,247
It ain't never gonna
be home, boy.

163
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,999
(Exclaims)

164
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:53,796
Jedediah, please! Lawrence, these
are emotional times for all of us.

165
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,673
But it is our last
night as a family,

166
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,593
and I don't want to see it
squandered in self-pity.

167
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:05,391
So who will join me for one final
stroll through these hallowed halls?

168
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,309
(Grunting)

169
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,020
- Do you want to go for a walk?
- No.

170
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,607
I'm just gonna squander
it in self-pity.

171
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,776
Teddy: My dear, shall we?

172
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,572
(Trumpeting)

173
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,140
Safe journey, my love.

174
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,020
Hey, Dexter, want
some help there?

175
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,272
(Chattering)

176
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,607
(Groaning)

177
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, come on, man. No
hard feelings, all right?

178
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,946
It's gonna be fine.

179
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,698
(Dexter laughing)

180
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,325
It's almost dawn, Lawrence.

181
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,038
Yeah. So, where's
your crate, Teddy?

182
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,957
I won't be making this
journey, Lawrence.

183
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,711
It seems myself, Rexy, and a
few of the signature exhibits

184
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,380
will be staying here for now.

185
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,716
Without the tablet?

186
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,386
In truth, Lawrence,

187
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,518
Ahkmenrah's tablet will be
remaining here with him.

188
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,271
What?

189
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,065
They're going without
the tablet, my friend.

190
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,568
I'm afraid this night
is their last.

191
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,447
You didn't tell them.

192
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,701
Sometimes it's more noble to tell a
small lie than deliver a painful truth.

193
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,343
Are you gonna be okay?

194
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,094
I shall do my best.

195
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,057
And who knows?

196
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,977
Sometimes the greatest change brings
about even greater opportunity.

197
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,562
Look at you, Lawrence.

198
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,399
You left this place and created
quite a life for yourself.

199
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,820
Yeah, I guess so.

200
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,406
I should hope you'd do more
than guess, my friend.

201
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,993
You're a captain of industry.
The world at your fingertips.

202
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,879
It seems to me you have
everything you wanted.

203
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,914
Yeah, no, I know.

204
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,501
No, you don't. If I may, lad,

205
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,629
allow me to offer you
one piece of advice.

206
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,133
The key to happiness, to
true happiness, is...

207
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,718
(Cell phone vibrating)

208
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,137
Hang on one sec. I just gotta...

209
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,432
I got this Japanese deal.

210
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,812
No, okay, I'm turning
this off. I'm sorry.

211
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,981
The key to happiness?

212
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,827
I'll see you, Teddy.

213
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,523
So they're gone? There's
nothing you can do?

214
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,969
I wish there was, man. I'm
telling you, I tried everything.

215
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,486
I talked to McPhee,
I called the board,

216
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,405
but they shipped them
out this morning.

217
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,032
This is a lot of food, dad.

218
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,743
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna
come by. I thought I told you.

219
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,030
We just have to go over a
couple of little work things.

220
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,955
So you're working tonight.

221
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
I used to work every
night, remember?

222
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,876
That was when you had the
coolest job in the world.

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
(Phone ringing)

224
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,130
Yeah, well, "cool" doesn't pay for
your <i>Guitar God VI</i> or whatever.

225
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,214
Hello?

226
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,133
<i>Gigantor! It's me, Jedediah!</i>

227
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,719
- <i>Octavius: Hold! Hold!</i>
- Jed?

228
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,179
<i>Never surrender!</i>

229
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,598
Jed, what are you... how
did you dial the phone?

230
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,142
Long story! That brazen little
monkey stole the tablet,

231
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,353
and now we're in a
world of hurt, boy!

232
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,605
- What's going on?
- Kahmunrah!

233
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,566
- Kahmunrah?
- Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

234
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,735
- And trust me, not a friendly!
- Octavius: Never!

235
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,487
I repeat, not a friendly!

236
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,572
- Is that Attila, jed?
- <i>Jedediah: I don't know how much longer</i>

237
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,074
- <i>we can fight them off! No!</i>
- Jed? Are you okay?

238
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,575
- <i>Let go of me! Help!</i>
- Hey, jed.

239
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,619
- <i>Let go! No, you let go of me! Help!</i>
- Jed?

240
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,496
(Dial tone droning)

241
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,414
What was that about?

242
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,046
I don't know.

243
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,383
Here, come on. Gonna drop
you off at your mom's.

244
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,509
What's going on, dad?

245
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,135
I'm gonna go find out.

246
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,932
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the federal
archives are in the Smithsonian.

247
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,475
Where exactly am I going?

248
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,771
That's the thing, dad. The Smithsonian
is actually 19 different museums.

249
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,564
They're laid out around
the national mall,

250
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,275
from the capitol to
the Lincoln memorial.

251
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,487
They got everything there. There's
actually some really cool stuff.

252
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,782
Nicky, please focus. Which
museum are the archives in?

253
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,452
Not in, under. It looks like it runs
underneath the entire Smithsonian.

254
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,746
So if ahkmenrah's
tablet is down there...

255
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,332
The biggest museum in the
world is coming alive.

256
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,042
<i>What is exactly is
your plan here, dad?</i>

257
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,252
Don't worry about it.

258
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,461
You have no plan, do you?

259
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,798
Now, Nicholas, I have a very
good, highly thought-out plan.

260
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,049
You have no plan.

261
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,217
Yes, I have no plan.

262
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,677
I'll call you when I'm in.

263
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,312
Here you go. Thanks.

264
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,623
Welcome to the biggest
museum in the world.

265
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,667
I know, right? It's a trip.

266
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,879
How about these planes dangling from
the ceilings, huh? Pretty weird.

267
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,686
Hi, excuse me. Could you tell me how
to get to the federal archives?

268
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,927
Of course. Just be a historical document
worthy of storing for all eternity.

269
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,554
(All laughing)

270
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,347
I'm kidding. He's
not a document.

271
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,727
I'm sorry, sir, the archives are
underground, and they're a secure area.

272
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,522
Really? Like, totally
secure? Okay, thank you.

273
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,341
<i>Woman: (On pa) Ladies
and gentlemen,</i>

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,236
<i>the museum will be
closing in one hour.</i>

275
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,613
Kahmunrah.

276
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,541
Hey! What are you doing?

277
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,835
No touching.

278
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,044
No, I wasn't gonna touch it.

279
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,130
You're moving in with
some I.T.T., bro.

280
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,382
I.T.T.? That's "intent
to touch" ', homey.

281
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,551
No, I wasn't. You're not
allowed to go over the...

282
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,716
What, are you gonna kiss it?

283
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,012
All right, sorry.

284
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,306
Put your hand on it and touch
it. 'Cause I stand there

285
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,058
and I wait all day for a little
girl like you to come in

286
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,228
and put her precious nail-polished
nails all over the exhibits.

287
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,153
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought
we lived in a free country, so...

288
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
- No, we don't.
- No?

289
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,735
It's the United States of don't touch
that thing right in front of you.

290
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,486
I just want to... I'm allowed
to look at it here, okay?

291
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,932
See what happens
when you touch it!

292
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,365
So you're threatening me?
You're threatening me, Brandon?

293
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,326
- It's "Brundon."
- Excuse me?

294
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,911
- "Brundon"!
- "Brundon"?

295
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,662
- "Brundon."
- "Brundon."

296
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,415
What, did they run out of u's
on your nameplate maker?

297
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,833
I don't know, did
they run out of jokes

298
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,800
at the interesting-joke
store that you shop at?

299
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,087
Sorry, it looks like
"Brandon", but...

300
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,131
I'm not here to be your speech
therapist. It's "brundon"!

301
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,841
- "Brundon." Okay...
- You never heard of the name before?

302
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,259
"Brundon"? No.

303
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,596
Look up most popular baby
names in 1984. "Brundon."

304
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,349
Okay. Are you threatening
me, brundon?

305
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,768
I don't know, Princess
Jasmine. Am I?

306
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,270
Oh, wow. Lunabeam
nine-volt. Yeah.

307
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,688
Wonderful piece
of hardware, huh?

308
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,440
- That's their title, lunabeam nine.
- Great.

309
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,026
I prefer the Maglite led
myself, but that's just me.

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,028
- Do me a huge favour.
- What?

311
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,613
Shove your hands
into your pockets,

312
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,115
put your attitude way down,

313
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,992
and, also, be nice to people.

314
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,620
Great. But could I just
ask you one thing?

315
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,455
- Yeah.
- Okay, so just to be clear,

316
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,790
so, I can't do this, right?

317
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,708
Okay, that's actually crazy.

318
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,502
Did you just make a decision
to possibly end your life

319
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,628
earlier than you were expecting?

320
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,004
I'm gonna hit you
with the flash-light.

321
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,167
- Now you are threatening me.
- Okay. Do not touch it!

322
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,716
- Don't touch me.
- Do not touch it!

323
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,134
- Do not touch it!
- Don't touch me!

324
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,469
I'll touch you with my
flash-light all day.

325
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,137
No, your flash-light is
meant to illuminate.

326
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,723
I will literally rent a camper,

327
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,368
and we will drive across America
with my flash-light on your chest.

328
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,311
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

329
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,063
Want to see what happens
when I do it one more time?

330
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,067
- Let's see what happens.
- Watch you do nothing.

331
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,984
Let's watch you do
nothing when I do this.

332
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,153
(Whispering)
Seriously, Brandon...

333
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,406
- Brundon.
- Brundon,

334
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,241
you do not know who
you're dealing with.

335
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,827
You think you know what it
means to be a guard, huh?

336
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,079
Trust me, you don't know
the meaning of the word.

337
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,207
I have seen things that
you could not imagine.

338
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,834
Like what kind of stuff?

339
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,043
I'm not gonna tell you.

340
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,920
- But you're gonna drop the flash-light...
- The way you said it,

341
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,839
it sounded like you were
gonna say something cool.

342
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,924
Yeah, well, you don't
get to hear it.

343
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,551
Drop the flash-light.

344
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,845
(Exhales)

345
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,686
We cool?

346
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,272
That's actually pretty
cool, what you just did.

347
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,690
Thank you.

348
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,608
No hard feelings?

349
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,361
- All right? Sorry.
- Okay.

350
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,526
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have...

351
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,615
No. It takes two opposing forces
to cause friction, and...

352
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,340
And you're just doing
your job, all right.

353
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,536
Take it easy, man.

354
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,746
Yeah!

355
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,123
That guy's great.

356
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,097
(Beeps)

357
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,878
Okay, buddy, I'm in.

358
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,046
Great. Where are you?

359
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,673
<i>Larry: (On phone) The north east corridor
of the castle, just off the commons.</i>

360
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,725
I need you to talk
me to the archives.

361
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
<i>Okay.</i>

362
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,928
At the end of the
hall, turn right,

363
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,173
and there should be a stairwell
coming up on your left.

364
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,016
- Got it.
- Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

365
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,852
Those underground tunnels connect
a bunch of different buildings.

366
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,521
- <i>It could get complicated.</i>
- We'd better hurry,

367
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,523
we only got 28 minutes
till sundown.

368
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,608
<i>When you get down to B level, you
want to take another left...</i>

369
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,734
(Static crackling on cell phone)

370
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,611
Nick? Hello? Nick?

371
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,946
<i>Dad! Can you hear...</i>

372
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,447
Nick, you're... Nick!

373
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,056
(Buzzing)

374
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,726
<i>Man: (On pa) ID, brundon.</i>

375
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,395
(Imitating brundon) Hey.

376
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,729
<i>Later, dude.</i>

377
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,022
All right. Yeah.

378
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,326
All right. Where are you guys?

379
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,462
Oh, my god.

380
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,540
You little troublemaker. I'm
gonna deal with you later.

381
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,123
No. No! No, no, no!

382
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,543
(Shouting in foreign language)

383
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,553
(Speaking foreign language)

384
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,181
(Speaking French)

385
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,435
No, English. English, perhaps.

386
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,313
I'm sorry, who are you?

387
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:16,277
I am kahmunrah, the great
king of the great kings,

388
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,739
and from the darkest
depths of ancient history,

389
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,743
I have come back to life!

390
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,120
Uh-huh.

391
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,708
Perhaps you did not
hear what I just said.

392
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:36,255
I am a centuries-old Egyptian
Pharaoh. I was dead,

393
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,802
but now I have
come back to life!

394
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,472
Yeah, no. I heard that. I
got that. Welcome back.

395
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,769
(Stammering) Who are you?

396
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,980
Larry Daley. Daley devices?

397
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:57,193
It's up in New York. It's funny,
I know your brother, Ahkmenrah.

398
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,486
- Do you?
- Yeah.

399
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,407
He knows baby brother.
The favourite son.

400
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,491
Yeah, good kid.

401
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,992
Isn't he just?

402
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,121
You know, mother and father always
gave him the best of everything,

403
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,457
and I do mean everything. They
even gave him the throne.

404
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,335
The throne which was
rightfully mine!

405
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,212
He never mentioned that.

406
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,755
I'll just bet he didn't.

407
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,967
Well, now begins the
era of kahmunrah,

408
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,220
because I have come back to...

409
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,180
Never mind, just
hand me the tablet.

410
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,507
Jedediah: Don't give it to
him, gigantor! Keep him away!

411
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,060
Silence! Silence
in there, please!

412
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,187
Don't make me come in there!

413
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,314
Jedediah: No! I
won't be muzzled!

414
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,609
Look, that tablet
is more powerful

415
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:43,197
than you, Larry Daley of Daley
devices, can possibly imagine.

416
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:47,326
Bringing things back to life
is just a parlour trick.

417
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,621
With it, I shall unlock the
gate to the underworld

418
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:54,333
and bring forth my army
from the land of the dead.

419
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,378
So, if it's not too
much trouble...

420
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,213
(Shouting in foreign language)

421
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,258
hand it over.

422
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,387
Okay, here you go.

423
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,515
Wise decision.

424
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,018
(Giving command in
foreign language)

425
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,396
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought
you wanted the cube, but...

426
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,440
(Giving command in
foreign language)

427
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,568
The cube?

428
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,655
The cube of Rubik.

429
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:33,122
All right, what is this
cube of Rubik, then?

430
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:38,169
The cube. You know, the one that
turns all who oppose you to dust?

431
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,172
(Stammering) That one?
Whatever. I thought...

432
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,336
It was my bad, 'cause...
You know what? By the way,

433
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,967
your brother didn't want
to mess with it, either.

434
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,385
Yeah, he wanted to
play it safe, too.

435
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,514
Just, you sort of struck me as a
next-level sort of guy, so I was...

436
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,390
(Shouting in foreign language)

437
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,976
I am not my brother, Larry.

438
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,564
I will kill you and your friends
in the blink of an eye.

439
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,858
(Giving command in
foreign language)

440
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,278
Now take me to this
cube of Rubik.

441
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,658
Larry: Here it is. Open it.

442
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,173
(Roaring)

443
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,634
(Soldier screams)

444
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,094
(Roaring)

445
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,147
Come back here! Come back
here with my tablet!

446
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,816
I still have your friends!

447
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,360
(Shouting in foreign language)

448
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,328
(Screeching)

449
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,459
Whoa!

450
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,669
(Roaring)

451
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,963
(Grunting)

452
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,513
(Soldiers clamouring)

453
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,099
(Custer whooping)

454
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,018
(Bugle sounding)

455
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,773
- Take the wheel!
- What?

456
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,360
I said, take the wheel! Oh, we're
in it now! I love it! I love it!

457
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,487
Just keep her straight,
I'll handle the rest.

458
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,615
Now, charge!

459
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,748
Okay, so what's the plan here?

460
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,542
We're Americans! We
don't plan, we do!

461
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,377
Now hold on!

462
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,254
(Soldiers exclaiming)

463
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,465
(Custer laughs)

464
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:58,351
See that? Act first, think
later! Works every time!

465
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,810
You're in good hands!

466
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,648
General George a. Custer of the
fighting U.S. 7th cavalry,

467
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,358
at your service.

468
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,776
(Exclaiming)

469
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,194
(Grunts)

470
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,114
I'm good, I'm good!
Fly, you fool!

471
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,327
(Tires screeching)

472
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,959
What's the rumpus, Ace?

473
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,378
Look, lady, could you
get out of the way?

474
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,089
Lady? Who are you calling
lady? The name is Amelia.

475
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,256
(Tire deflating)

476
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,133
(Soldiers clamouring)

477
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,139
Amelia Earhart! Perhaps
you've heard of me?

478
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,017
Oh, right. You're a
famous pilot or whatever.

479
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,812
Pilot? I was the first
woman to fly the Atlantic!

480
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,522
First woman to receive
the flying cross,

481
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,608
first woman to fly across the
48 states in a gyroprop.

482
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,528
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent
look of alarm off your kisser,

483
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,824
I was wondering if you might be so
kind as to tell me exactly where I am.

484
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,284
You're in a museum. Or,
actually, under it.

485
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,162
And I'm in kind of a dangerous
situation right now,

486
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,707
so you might not want
to be anywhere near me.

487
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,169
- Wow, you're fast.
- What's your name, fly-boy?

488
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,005
My name is Larry Daley.

489
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,967
Well, Larry Daley, in case
you weren't listening,

490
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,177
I'm not one to shy
away from danger.

491
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,681
How about Spears? Are you one
to shy away from Spears?

492
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,307
(Soldiers shouting)

493
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,894
Let's ankle, skipper! Now
we're gonna have some fun.

494
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,652
Ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, bingo!

495
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,863
(Sighs)

496
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,531
Like a golden fleece.

497
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,035
All right, troops, when
your enemies captured me,

498
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,288
they made themselves
my enemies as well.

499
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,750
Big mistake. Big mistake.

500
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,127
(Grunting excitedly)

501
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,546
All right, here's the plan.

502
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,050
On the third bugle blast, I shall
loudly announce, "attack!"

503
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,261
(Exclaiming in surprise)

504
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,476
At which point, we will
all jump out of this box

505
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,771
and attack.

506
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,194
Boom.

507
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,239
Mind bomb. What do you think?

508
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,244
You, Sacaja...

509
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,537
That is not my name.

510
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,664
- Sacajamea.
- No.

511
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,000
- Sack-in-a-box.
- No.

512
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,168
Cinco de Mayo.

513
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,836
I know you are a
famous general...

514
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,962
That's all right,
that's all right.

515
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,255
I'm a person, just like you.

516
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,509
But won't yelling,
"attack!" Alert the enemy

517
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,093
that we are about to attack?

518
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,929
What?

519
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,722
(Chuckling)

520
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,227
Uh...

521
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,356
Yeah, I guess so.

522
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,197
You're quite the popular
fellow, Mr. Daley.

523
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,782
Why don't you just skedaddle?

524
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,826
I can't skedaddle. My friends
are being held down there.

525
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,620
I got to go get them. I got
to find another way down.

526
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,417
Wow.

527
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,172
(Children laughing)

528
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,174
This is new.

529
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,430
(All screaming)

530
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,559
Hey, it's all right. I
don't want to hurt you.

531
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,352
I don't think it's you they're
afraid of, Mr. Daley.

532
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,774
(Soldier shouting in
foreign language)

533
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,072
Trade you. Thanks.

534
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,993
Back off! Just back off!

535
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,829
I will fork you!

536
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,664
How about you, huh?

537
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,210
Never send a boy to
do a woman's job.

538
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,005
I spent two weeks spear-hunting
with a tribe in Micronesia.

539
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,967
The Micronesians had
much slower reflexes.

540
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,972
Come on!

541
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,058
(Big band music playing)

542
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,560
(Crowd cheering)

543
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,356
Man: It's over! It's
over! It's all over!

544
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,691
(Woman laughing)

545
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,654
Well, this is one humdinger
of a hootenanny.

546
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,163
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

547
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
(Cell phone ringing)

548
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,208
Wow, four bars in 1945.

549
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,835
- Hello?
- <i>Dad, finally!</i>

550
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,761
I've been studying these
plans to the archives.

551
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,213
Looks like once you get
down the stairwell...

552
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,257
Oh, I'm way past the
stairwell, Nicky.

553
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,468
- So you found everyone?
- Sort of.

554
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,472
What is that flibberty-widget
you are talking to?

555
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,472
- Who's that?
- It's Amelia Earhart.

556
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,223
You found Amelia Earhart?

557
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,475
I... hey!

558
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,435
Wait a minute!

559
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy,
what's your hurry?

560
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,980
Didn't you hear? The war's over!

561
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,732
Sorry. These guys
are chasing me.

562
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,652
What? What am I looking
at, Mardi Gras?

563
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,236
What unit are you from?

564
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,072
I'm from Brooklyn.

565
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:07,451
What? Are you serious? I'm
from Flatbush! Hey, fellas!

566
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,745
These so-and-so's are trying
to rough up my pal here

567
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,163
just 'cause he's from Brooklyn!

568
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,998
- Thank you!
- You got it! Fight!

569
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,420
Hey, mister! You forgot your...

570
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,715
What the heck is this thing?

571
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,432
(Shouting in foreign language)

572
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,560
Excuse me. Mind
if I get in here?

573
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,025
Any time you're done, Mr. Daley.

574
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,945
- Call me!
- Thank you for that.

575
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,349
So you're quite the smooth
operator, aren't you, Mr. Daley?

576
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,949
Quick!

577
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,702
(Soldiers shouting)

578
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,579
(Thudding)

579
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,709
- That actually worked.
- What's next?

580
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,253
Look, nothing personal, but I'm kind
of in the middle of something here

581
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,838
that's not really your fight.

582
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,631
It's because I'm a
woman, isn't it?

583
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:06,427
No, it's because I've got this ancient
raised-from-the-dead evil Pharaoh guy

584
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,555
who's willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet

585
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,889
so he can rule the world.

586
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,017
So it is because I'm a woman!

587
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,462
- Look, I...
- No, you look, Mr. Daley!

588
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem!

589
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,356
- Lost in what?
- Black and white photo, you boob!

590
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,608
Now listen, and listen
good. I can help you.

591
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,695
I want to help you, and not because
I like you, which so far I don't,

592
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,365
but because I smell adventure,
and, damn it, I want in.

593
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,953
Okay. Don't blame me if
something happens to you.

594
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,997
I should be so lucky.

595
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:40,586
I am kahmunrah. I am half god,

596
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,839
once removed on
my mother's side,

597
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:48,469
rightful ruler of Egypt,
future ruler of...

598
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,013
Well, everything else.

599
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,183
Now, I have lost some men.

600
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,855
So, I am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan

601
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,940
of conquering this world.

602
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,193
Ivan the terrible.

603
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,322
Napoleon Bonaparte.

604
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,407
And young al Capone.

605
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,533
Yeah.

606
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,911
Some of the most despicable,

607
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,414
most feared leaders
in all of history.

608
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,583
Gentlemen,

609
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,712
really, it's just fantastic
to meet you all.

610
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,297
- And us, too.
- And me, you.

611
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,216
All I ask is your allegiance,

612
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,677
and in return, I
offer you the world.

613
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,180
Literally. Are there
any questions?

614
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,183
Yeah, I got one. How come
you're wearing a dress?

615
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,811
This is not a dress.
This is a tunic.

616
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,314
It was the height of fashion
3,000 years ago, I assure you.

617
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,108
Are there any other questions?

618
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,945
Da. This dress you're wearing,

619
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,280
do we have to wear
one of these, too?

620
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:51,615
(Stutters)

621
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,284
Were you not listening? I
just told Mr. Capone here

622
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,036
that this is not a dress.

623
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,790
It is, in fact, a tunic.
Very big difference.

624
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,668
Are there any other questions?

625
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,629
Any questions not
about the dress?

626
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,714
Tunic?

627
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,384
All right, then.
Moonlight is wasting,

628
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,677
and the time is short.

629
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,970
Short?

630
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,889
Why do you look at me
when you say "short"?

631
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,351
(Stammering) Sorry.
It slipped out.

632
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,482
Da. If we are talking
about world domination,

633
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,401
then of course, I am interested.

634
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,238
But first I want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting.

635
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,908
People always say, "Ivan the
terrible, he's so terrible."

636
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,744
"I'm so scared of
Ivan. He's bad news."

637
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,664
When in fact, the
correct translation is.

638
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,584
"Ivan the awesome."

639
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,336
Ivan the awesome?

640
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,006
It's not really
as catchy, is it?

641
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,925
I mean, "Ivan the terrible",
that really pops.

642
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,679
But I wasn't terrible. In fact, I
was quite an effective leader.

643
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,433
Duly noted. Now, I'd like to
wrap up the old meet-and-greet

644
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,852
by asking you
gentlemen a question.

645
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,271
Are you with me?

646
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,190
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- <i>Oui.</i>

647
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,691
Da, but...

648
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,028
Then bring Larry Daley
of Daley devices

649
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,072
and the golden tablet
of Ahkmenrah to me!

650
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,703
Amelia: We'll get you back
down to your chums, Mr. Daley.

651
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,372
You won't get lost
following Amelia Earhart.

652
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,497
(Soldiers speaking French)

653
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,958
Quick, get down.

654
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,835
(Animal growling)

655
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,381
Well, well, Mr. Daley, I quite
like the way you're holding me.

656
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,552
No. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

657
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,638
Oh, please, stop beating
your gums, Mr. Daley.

658
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,003
You haven't been able to take
your cheaters off my chassis

659
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,642
since the moment we met.

660
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,061
I literally didn't
understand one word of that.

661
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,396
(Harp music playing)

662
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,190
(Speaking French)

663
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,318
Is it just me or is
there music in the air?

664
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,987
<i>(Singing) ♪ ...My baby,
we can make it shine ♪</i>

665
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,906
<i>(Shushing) ♪ we can
take forever.. ♪</i>

666
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,825
You! Little flying
angel things! Quiet!

667
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,495
They're cupids, Mr.
Daley. Gods of love.

668
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,413
Great. Gods of love,
would you shut up?

669
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,290
Please shut up. We're
trying to hide.

670
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,211
<i>(Rapping) ♪ yeah! More
than a woman! Yeah! ♪</i>

671
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,381
No, don't change
the arrangement,

672
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,841
it's not about the
arrangement. Quiet! Shh!

673
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,510
<i>Cupid: ♪ kick the
chorus, y'all! ♪</i>

674
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,262
<i>♪ More than a woman ♪</i>

675
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,639
<i>♪ yo, show me what you
got, ♪ ♪ night guard! ♪</i>

676
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,057
All right, come on. Let's go.

677
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,768
<i>♪ More than a woman to me ♪</i>

678
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,354
<i>♪ more than a woman ♪</i>

679
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,773
<i>♪ she's more than a woman ♪</i>

680
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:41,118
And so, the little tiny man who could
not be a smaller or shorter mouse

681
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,203
runs into the claws
of the giant cat!

682
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,288
(Snarls)

683
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,748
Wow, you're really hung up
on the height, aren't you?

684
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,754
- No, it's not about height, see...
- Yes, you are.

685
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,873
You're saying I'm a little
mouse, you're a giant cat.

686
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,546
(Hissing) I am the giant cat.

687
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,880
No offence, I just...

688
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,883
You're Napoleon. There's a
complex named after you.

689
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,094
You're famous for being
little, and it's true. Look.

690
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,763
Oh, you naive American man-boy.

691
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,725
Look. Neither of us are gonna
be jamming any time soon, right?

692
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,144
So it's not like we should...
It's not even an issue.

693
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,270
(Speaking French)

694
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,813
It's not about height
or something else.

695
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,732
It's a plan. It's
a brilliant plan.

696
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,943
- So it was a plan.
- Snazzy manoeuvre, emperor.

697
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,655
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

698
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,867
Now, if your boyfriend would
kindly come with me...

699
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,368
I'm not her boyfriend.

700
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,080
- Not her boyfriend.
- No.

701
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,874
Just friends?

702
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,834
Oh.

703
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,378
Larry: Yeah, friends.

704
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,547
- Acquaintances. Friends.
- Hmm. Oh.

705
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,634
Were you guys, like,
friends in college

706
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,179
and just afraid now to both
ruin your relationship

707
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,639
by telling the other person that
you want to be more than friends,

708
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,266
that you like-like each other?

709
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,938
One more time? I'm sorry.
I didn't catch the...

710
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,441
Were you guys, like,
friends in college

711
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,360
and now both afraid to
ruin your relationship

712
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,196
by telling the other person that
you want to be more than friends,

713
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,323
that you like-like each other?

714
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,158
Oh...

715
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,827
- No.
- No?

716
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,788
I just love the nitty-gritty
of relationships.

717
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,039
All us French do.

718
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,665
- Great.
- <i>Yes. Amour!</i>

719
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,000
- Now.
- Yeah?

720
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,419
- This way, or you die.
- Yes.

721
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,797
(Shouting command in French)

722
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,883
Wait, I'm coming with you!

723
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,135
No! Our fight is not with you.

724
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,476
So you gotta bet a second
time. All right. Okay.

725
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,605
(Sighs) My hair is currency
in certain parts of Europe.

726
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,192
It's true. Currency, like
gold or paper money.

727
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,195
The Duomo was purchased
with just one locket.

728
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,655
(Softly) Listen up, Kemosabe.

729
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,575
This rodeo clown wouldn't know
a flapjack from a flyswatter.

730
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,953
Now, Gigantor's out there
risking his hide for us.

731
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,996
The least we can do is
give him some help.

732
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,498
Some big help.

733
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,793
But we can't very well do that if
we're stuck in here, now, can we?

734
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,212
We need to escape.

735
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,464
What's a flapjack?

736
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,967
It's like a biscuit or a scone.

737
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,593
Chest bump?

738
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:04,970
(Grunts) Yeah.

739
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,305
Then deadly. Watch.

740
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,392
Guard your cards,
okay? Now you bet.

741
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,061
Okay, now you got to
throw some cards down.

742
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,399
- Ready?
- Ready.

743
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,609
Say something. Say anything.

744
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,695
This is no fun.
You're supposed to...

745
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,283
- Hey! What are you two doing out here?
- Octavius, go!

746
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,826
You, make a run for it,
I'll hold them off!

747
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,494
I will not leave you!

748
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,873
Ain't no time for your Roman
melodrama! Now, get! Go!

749
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,791
Old Jedediah will be fine.

750
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,356
Henchman: Now, you're
in real trouble.

751
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,550
Why, these aren't
real rubies at all.

752
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,802
Ruby slippers indeed.

753
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:46,928
(Glass shatters)

754
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:50,682
But, whoever you
are, Archie bunker,

755
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,019
you had one comfortable throne.

756
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,313
Henchman: Hey, boss.

757
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,649
Caught this one trying to escape
through a rust hole in the crate.

758
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,568
One of his little
friends got away.

759
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,197
Oh, please. What damage
could they possibly do?

760
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:09,201
Why, they're no bigger than a little
grain of couscous. Aren't you?

761
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,536
You know, two words come to
mind when I hear you talk.

762
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,080
"Delusional" and "weirdo".

763
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:18,001
And if I had to say a
third, "goofy". Just goofy.

764
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:22,005
Now you let old Jedediah out of
here or he's gonna get angry.

765
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,007
Well played, Jedediah!

766
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,802
(Sputtering) I'm sorry, I can't take
you seriously. You're just adorable,

767
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,514
even when you're threatening
me. It's hilarious.

768
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:34,726
Is it just me, or are these
guys unbelievably cute?

769
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,936
Now hold it a second, now.

770
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,730
Now, you have a right to keep me
as your captive, torture me, even,

771
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,233
but don't call me
cute! I ain't cute!

772
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:46,363
Steady, my friend! Just stay
alive! I will find you!

773
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,447
(Grunts)

774
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,241
(Exclaiming in French)

775
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,620
Gigantor. No!

776
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,500
Hello, Mr. Daley. Nice
to see you again.

777
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,713
Now, if you don't mind, I
shall take that from you.

778
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,674
Thank you.

779
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:11,304
Finally. Finally!
After 3,000 years,

780
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,100
my evil army of the damned,

781
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,478
my beautiful, beautiful army,

782
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:23,316
shall be unleashed!

783
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,784
(Sighs) I'm afraid that.

784
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:37,497
Mother and father may have slightly
changed the combination on me.

785
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,959
Wow, I guess this whole
unleashing-the-underworld thing

786
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,295
isn't really working
out for you, huh?

787
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,579
It must be really frustrating,

788
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
'cause you've waited
thousands of years

789
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,466
to come back from the
dead and everything,

790
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,928
and now you can't get it open.

791
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,890
Fear not, for I shall wait
a thousand more if I must.

792
00:48:56,017 --> 00:49:00,061
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'll be
standing here in a frustrated position,

793
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,773
frozen, and I'll walk out of here
with my buddies and that'll be that.

794
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,025
So, I got all night.

795
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,695
Really? All night? Well!

796
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,697
He doesn't.

797
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,916
Open that cage.

798
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,209
What are you doing?

799
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,086
Jedediah: No touching!
No touching!

800
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,630
Don't you manhandle me!

801
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,674
- Look, he's having a little tantrum.
- Jed?

802
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,885
Uh-uh! Don't you squirm!

803
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,054
Don't squirm. It'll
only be worse for you.

804
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,514
- Put him down!
- Don't be afraid.

805
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,224
I shan't hurt you.

806
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,185
Oops! I lied.

807
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,649
I don't think he has all
night at all, Mr. Daley.

808
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,153
From the looks of things, I'd say
he has a little over an hour.

809
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,905
Take me out of here!

810
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:57,702
You were the guardian! You
know all about this tablet.

811
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,997
You're obviously much more
clever than the rest of us.

812
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,166
You may or may not
know the combination,

813
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,503
but I am going to give you exactly
one hour to figure it out.

814
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,547
If you do not, I shall
kill your friends.

815
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,800
And please don't think
about escaping,

816
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,593
for I shall be watching you.

817
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,470
Look, I don't even
know how to begin

818
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,722
to decipher this thing,
all right? Really.

819
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:19,432
What a pity.

820
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:23,353
And your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow.

821
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,856
Ah, well. Tick-tock, Mr. Daley.

822
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,567
Your hour has begun.

823
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:34,447
Hey! You got this,
partner. I know you do.

824
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,326
Shoo!

825
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,833
You got this!

826
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,216
There you are! Are
you all right?

827
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,218
I've been worried sick!
Sick I tell you.

828
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,553
No, I'm fine.

829
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,054
So what's our next
move, partner?

830
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,807
I don't know. I just got to
get this tablet translated.

831
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,893
Oh, great! This guy again.

832
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,813
Look, buddy, we don't want
any trouble, all right?

833
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,649
(Waves crashing)

834
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,111
(Whistling)

835
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,574
(Exclaiming happily)

836
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,242
Hmm, look at that!

837
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,871
I guess our sassy Cephalopoda was just a
fish who didn't like being out of water.

838
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,707
He's not such a
ballywagger after all.

839
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,627
(Grunting)

840
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,963
Okay. Glad you're happy.

841
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,339
(Kissing)

842
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,767
Teddy: Hello? A
little assistance?

843
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,603
- Oh! Hey, Teddy! Perfect!
- Yes!

844
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,812
Maybe you could help us.

845
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,481
I'd love to help you,
but first things first.

846
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,900
My nose is so itchy,
it's driving me insane.

847
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,693
I hate to ask, but, as you see,

848
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,278
I'm missing a few body parts.

849
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,363
Could you please
give us a scratch?

850
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,573
Yeah, sure.

851
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,577
Oh, yes! That's exquisite.
Oh! A little over there...

852
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:03,870
- Yes!
- More?

853
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,206
Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, that's...

854
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,459
Sweet rutabaga pie,
that was divine.

855
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,544
Theodore Roosevelt,
at your service.

856
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,464
Twenty-sixth President of the
United States, rough rider,

857
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,028
founder of the national parks, and
a whole bunch of other stuff.

858
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,218
Have we met?

859
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,720
Oh, no, there's another Teddy.

860
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,138
We have one of you in New York.

861
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,391
Really? What's he
like, this other me?

862
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,686
He's pretty much the
same, except with...

863
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,855
Except what? Say it.
Except with a body?

864
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,148
Yes. He has a body.

865
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,399
Oh, dash it, the pain!

866
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,819
- And a horse.
- Excuse me!

867
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,571
We really need someone to translate
what's written on this tablet.

868
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,406
Do you read hieroglyphics?

869
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,158
Yes, I do, Missy.

870
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,993
That's a simple one.

871
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:48,122
Bird. Man with spear.
Sideways fish. Beetle. Vase.

872
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,834
Okay, and what does that mean?

873
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,003
It means, and this is
just a rough translation,

874
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,008
"a man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase."

875
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,012
"And there was also a beetle."

876
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,224
I don't think that's it.

877
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,017
That's just one
possible translation.

878
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,644
Another possible translation is,

879
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,688
"you will find the
combination you seek"

880
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,608
"if you figure out the secret at
the heart of Pharaohs tomb."

881
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,610
Okay, and what does that mean?

882
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,820
I don't know! What
am I, the sphinx?

883
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,114
"What's this? What's that?" Why
don't you ask New York Teddy?

884
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,575
I'm sure he'd love to get his grubby
little fingers all over that thing!

885
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,285
Probably let his
horse lick it, too!

886
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,745
Mr. Daley, we should be going
to the sculpture gallery.

887
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,591
I think there's someone there who
might have a better thought on this.

888
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,709
The fellow we're looking
for is just down here.

889
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:33,793
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

890
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,129
Hello, young lady.

891
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,716
Hey, excuse me. Could
we keep moving, please?

892
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,844
We certainly could, but then we
might miss a rare opportunity.

893
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,471
I mean, she is a
degas, Mr. Daley.

894
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,724
Okay, it's just I got a little
buddy stuck in an hourglass,

895
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,559
I got a pitch meeting at
Wal-Mart in the morning...

896
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,311
It would be great if we could...

897
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,021
He's right here.

898
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,940
I think he'll have
a thought on this.

899
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,776
Mr. thinker, we're sorry to
interrupt your contemplation,

900
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,070
but we really need to
figure out the secret

901
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,281
at the heart of Pharaohs tomb.

902
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,534
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

903
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,537
I'm thinking.

904
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,999
I'm thinking.

905
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,918
It's not happening with him.

906
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:16,920
Oh, wow.

907
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,381
You've gotta be kidding
me. Check that out!

908
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,009
(Giggles) Oh, yeah.

909
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,344
Hey! Hey!

910
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,095
Buddy! Over here!
This is serious.

911
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Apparently, it's a matter
of life and death.

912
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,270
I'll tell you what's a
matter of life and death.

913
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,018
That beautiful lady over there.

914
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,563
Hey, baby! Check out the gun
show going on over here!

915
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:36,981
Boom! Bang!

916
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,608
Fire-power!

917
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,069
He's certainly no Einstein.

918
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,988
- Biceps! Deltoids...
- Yeah.

919
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,157
Wait a minute. I saw
a bunch of those.

920
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,325
A bunch of what’s?

921
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,202
- Little Einstein.
- Where?

922
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,246
Over there, in air and space.

923
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,874
I gotta get over there.

924
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,501
What?

925
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,127
Nothing.

926
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,088
Okay. Then why are
you staring at me?

927
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,423
I don't wanna miss a moment.

928
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,175
All right, good, but we should
get going, 'cause we...

929
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,259
(Groans)

930
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,513
- Why?
- You talk too much, Ace.

931
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,936
I don't know why I
did that, Mr. Daley.

932
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,147
I just feel as if I've been asleep
for a long time and now, suddenly,

933
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,774
I'm awake.

934
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,901
(Shushing) I can explain that...

935
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,112
But really, I could. I really...

936
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,196
(Groans)

937
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:26,990
Again, why?

938
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,230
(All singing "my
heart will go on")

939
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,579
Great, you're back.

940
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,545
Okay. Yeah. Great.

941
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,756
Love theme from Titanic. Good,
but not really appropriate.

942
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,304
You don't let yourself enjoy
things much, do you, Mr. Daley?

943
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,350
Okay, you know what? It's
not really the song choice.

944
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,269
And by the way, you're
a little pitchy.

945
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,480
Well, I thought you were
amazing, and you look wonderful.

946
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,065
(Kissing noises)

947
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,067
Could you just fly away, please?

948
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,653
And so the adventure continues.

949
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,531
(Clattering)

950
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,826
What did I tell you? Enough!

951
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:24,297
You know, I do sort of feel
like a floating butterfly.

952
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,258
You are crazier
than a road lizard.

953
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,387
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard
that we're taking over the world

954
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,432
and they want in. I don't
know who they are,

955
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,894
but they're on exhibit
here, too, apparently.

956
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,938
I don't even know what they are.

957
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:46,152
I'm sorry, but we're all full up
in our axis of evil today. Sorry.

958
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,405
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

959
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,783
Hey, I could show
you how bad I am!

960
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,367
(Roaring weakly)

961
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,119
(Weakly) Fear me!

962
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,873
I'm sorry. I'm just
not buying it.

963
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:03,377
You don't seem very bad. You just
seem sort of vaguely grouchy to me.

964
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,671
Oh, boy.

965
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,673
(Breathing heavily)

966
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,051
What are you doing? What
is that? What is this?

967
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,386
What does it mean?
You've lost me.

968
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:16,140
Is that you breathing? Because
I can't hear myself think.

969
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,894
Can I make one suggestion to
you, my friend? Just simplify.

970
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,396
There's just too
much going on here.

971
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,274
You're evil, you're
asthmatic, you're a robot...

972
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,984
And what is the cape for?

973
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,654
Are we going to the
opera? I don't think so.

974
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,864
Sorry! Goodbye.

975
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,491
<i>Attention!</i>

976
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,451
He's leaving with the tablet!

977
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,703
Kahmunrah: Where?

978
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,498
Give me that.

979
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:45,086
He's not trying to figure out
the... he's trying to escape!

980
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,215
Go. Go! All of you! Kill him!
And bring me that tablet.

981
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,010
Come on, people! Let's go! Without
that tablet, we've nothing!

982
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,846
<i>Streltsy! Go!</i>

983
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,852
Thought you could get away,
didn't you, Larry Daley?

984
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,193
(All shouting)

985
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,862
Criminy, we're Jimmy-jacked.

986
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,072
- Jimmy-jacked? Really?
- It's the way I speak.

987
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,408
Yeah, I know, but that one
sounds made up, even for you.

988
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,579
"Oh, no, our path has been blocked by
bad people." What's the fun in that?

989
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,373
The point is, we're not getting
into the air and space right now.

990
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,542
- You're right. We are Jimmy-jacked.
- Jimmy-jacked.

991
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,377
Come on.

992
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,681
Octavius: They say a good
man rules this union.

993
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,601
I promised Jedediah
I would bring help,

994
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,103
and help I will bring.

995
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,943
Charge!

996
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,239
(Screaming)

997
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,410
(Continues screaming)

998
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,289
(Exhales)

999
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,875
(Panting) Misjudged
the distance.

1000
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,252
(Rustling)

1001
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,172
Who's there?

1002
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,679
Jupiter, protect me.

1003
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,351
(Sniffing)

1004
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,479
Remain very still.

1005
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,482
They can sense movement.

1006
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,026
(Chattering)

1007
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,445
Apparently, they can also
hear me talking to myself.

1008
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,822
(Grunting)

1009
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,658
I'm not a nut.

1010
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,953
No!

1011
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,664
(Clamouring)

1012
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,920
Larry: We should be okay
in here for a while.

1013
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,219
Amelia: So, how long have
you guarded antiquities?

1014
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,972
What? Oh, no, I don't
actually work at the...

1015
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,936
I just thought with the
fancy getup and all...

1016
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,059
No, I borrowed this.

1017
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:10,106
I mean, I was a guard back in new
York, but that was a while ago.

1018
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,151
So why did you leave?
Did you not enjoy it?

1019
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,861
No, I loved it. I just...

1020
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,823
Things sort of took off in a
different direction, so...

1021
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,992
So what do you do now?

1022
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,368
Well, I sort of...

1023
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,122
Well, I sort of design
products and sell them.

1024
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,332
- You're an inventor!
- I am.

1025
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,293
I am an inventor,
yeah. I invent stuff.

1026
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,086
Like the rocket ship?

1027
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,838
- No.
- The sea plane.

1028
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,006
The dirigible?

1029
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,716
No, not aircraft.

1030
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,593
Sort of like more
small-scale stuff, like...

1031
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:43,889
Well, the glow-in-the-dark
flash-light, that was mine.

1032
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,601
So this new job, do you like it?

1033
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,772
Yeah, I like it a lot.
It's exciting. It's...

1034
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,693
- What?
- I'm just confused, is all.

1035
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,987
If you're not excited by
it, why do you do it?

1036
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,656
I am excited by it.
I just said...

1037
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,199
I know what you said, Mr. Daley,

1038
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,619
but what I see in front of me
is a man who's lost his moxie.

1039
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,081
I have not lost my...

1040
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,250
I got my moxie.

1041
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,127
Do you know why I
became a pilot?

1042
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,088
I don't, no.

1043
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,673
For the fun of it.

1044
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,676
Why else would
anyone do anything?

1045
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,096
(Abraham groaning)

1046
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,806
Great Gatsby!

1047
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,308
(Pigeons cooing)

1048
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,895
Blast these pigeons and
their incessant cooing!

1049
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,898
- No! Mr. president! Sir!
- All right. Time to see the state...

1050
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,276
- Please don't get up!
- Of this great union! I always say,

1051
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:41,072
leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today.

1052
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,199
Sir, if you go out there, you're
gonna freak a lot of people out!

1053
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:47,078
Freak? I assure you,
sir, I am no freak.

1054
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,372
No, I didn't mean
you're a freak...

1055
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,582
Come here, little one.

1056
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,711
In fact, if anyone is freakish,
I'm afraid it's you, sir.

1057
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,048
The truth is, you
are very small.

1058
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,842
And I mean even for a
regular-sized human.

1059
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,678
What? Why would you
even say that?

1060
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,722
I must be honest.

1061
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,601
Right. Okay, honest Abe. Of
course. I'm sorry. Great.

1062
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,978
Come, now, Mr. president,
put the little man down

1063
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,314
and let's sit our Fanny back
in that throne of yours.

1064
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,901
You have a can-do attitude,
and I shall do as you ask.

1065
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,611
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1066
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,780
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1067
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:27,284
It's that very can-do spirit that has
defined this remarkable nation of ours.

1068
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,869
- Interesting story.
- They're coming.

1069
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,246
One night in Gettysburg...

1070
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,081
Mr. president, we're gonna
need you to hold still now.

1071
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,916
- What?
- Abraham, freeze!

1072
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,793
Freeze? I...

1073
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,129
(Soldiers clamouring)

1074
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,136
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1075
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,721
- Come on, let's get to air and space.
- If I may,

1076
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,974
you two make an adorable couple.

1077
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,225
Oh, no, we're not...

1078
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,977
No, we're not a... I
mean, we're not a...

1079
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,438
"We're not a... I
mean, we're not a..."

1080
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,898
Blah, blah, blah. I never lie!

1081
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,777
The truth is, you two
are adorable together.

1082
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,320
Thank you. Good night.

1083
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:08,868
Farewell, lovely lady
and small, little man.

1084
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,247
Amelia: Now let's see if we can
find these Einstein of yours.

1085
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,085
(Lock beeps)

1086
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,017
<i>(On radio) One giant
leap for a mannequin...</i>

1087
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,728
<i>Man 1: (On pa) D.C.,
this is air and space.</i>

1088
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,731
<i>We are back online and
fully operational.</i>

1089
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,865
The Tuskegee airmen are
on the march once again.

1090
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,952
Can you stop narrating everything
we're doing? Just live in the moment.

1091
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,581
The Tuskegee airmen are
living in the moment!

1092
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,082
- Miss Earhart?
- Yes.

1093
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,209
I wanna say thank you.

1094
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,335
What for, captain?

1095
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,712
A lot of people didn't think
we could fly, either.

1096
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,964
Thanks for clearing
the runway, ma'am.

1097
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,511
Race you to Paris?

1098
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:09,720
You're on!

1099
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,138
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey! No!
Not now! We gotta...

1100
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,474
- It's just a quick jaunt over the pond.
- No. Gotta find the Einstein.

1101
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,644
Come on, we gotta go. We
don't have time. Come on!

1102
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,063
Sorry, it's in the blood.

1103
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,398
There she is, Mr. Daley.

1104
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,692
Old Bessie, the old family bus.

1105
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,110
That gal took me
across the Atlantic!

1106
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,155
Okay. I think the Einstein
are over here, though.

1107
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,907
<i>Man 1: (On pa) This is mission
control. Flight check complete.</i>

1108
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,493
- Where'd you go? Where'd they go?
- <i>You are clear for launch.</i>

1109
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,036
Contact!

1110
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,038
<i>Man 1: (On pa) D.C.,
this is mission control.</i>

1111
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,917
No, no! No! <i>All systems go
and green for lift-off.</i>

1112
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,461
<i>Man 2: (On pa) Roger that.
We are green for lift-off.</i>

1113
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,297
No, we're definitely not green
for any kind of lift-off!

1114
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,091
I want a "go, no-go" for launch.

1115
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,176
I say no-go. Let's not go.

1116
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,344
Go!

1117
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,388
Go!

1118
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,140
- Go!
- No! No go!

1119
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,434
<i>Man 1: (On pa) Torquing
angles incoming.</i>

1120
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,603
Larry: Tone it down with the
torque. Torque it down.

1121
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,272
De-torque. De-torque.

1122
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,984
Commence ignition sequence.

1123
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,068
Roger that, flight.

1124
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,611
We have launch commit.

1125
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:09,863
- No. No, no, no!
- <i>Man 2: (On pa) Ten,</i>

01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,368
- Hey, that's mine.
- <i>No, we do not have commit.</i>

1128
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,371
<i>Repeat. We are decommissioning
the committal of the launch</i>

1129
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,416
<i>and it is now a
negatory launch phase.</i>

1130
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,127
<i>We are in a no-fly, no-go phase.</i>

1131
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,923
<i>That is a November-gorgon
phase of non-flying!</i>

1132
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:28,383
Fine!

1133
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:29,907
<i>And we're gonna say good night.</i>

1134
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,511
<i>Thank you. Good
work. Over and out.</i>

1135
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,764
- Larry: Sorry.
- Damn, that was disappointing.

1136
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,808
Man: Come on. I'll buy
you a cup of coffee.

1137
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,436
Hey, little space monkey.

1138
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,937
(Chattering)

1139
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,233
You're able. Okay,
good. How you doing?

1140
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,736
Yes, good. At ease. All right.

1141
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:52,990
You're a polite little
fella, aren't you?

1142
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,201
Hey, you happen to know where those
little Einstein bobble-head guys are?

1143
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,997
Mr. Daley! I found
your Einstein.

1144
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,915
Great. Hey...

1145
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,628
Gentlemen, we're trying to crack the
combination of this tablet doodad,

1146
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,213
and the writing here
says we'll find it

1147
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,759
if we figure out the secret at
the heart of Pharaohs tomb.

1148
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,677
(Laughing)

1149
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,597
That's an easy one. The
answer's in the question.

1150
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,932
- What does that mean?
- "Figure out".

1151
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,602
It's a figure! I.E., a number.

1152
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,521
And the Pharaohs tomb,
I.E. The pyramids.

1153
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,191
Don't you get it, kid? You're
looking for the secret number

1154
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,151
at the heart of the pyramids.

1155
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,945
Well, whistle me Dixie,
the answer's pi!

1156
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,866
- Pi?
- 3.14159265, to be exact.

1157
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,036
Yes! 3.1495265.

1158
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,206
No, no, no, 3.14159265.

1159
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,375
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

1160
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,461
I'm sorry, I can't tell. Is it
yes or no? Cause you just...

1161
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,254
I know it's hard,
could you just...

1162
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,673
don't touch the hair.

1163
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,508
Sorry, I can't tell
if it's up or...

1164
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,343
I'm a bobble-head, dummkopf,

1165
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,512
and that's the way, uh-huh,
uh-huh, we like it.

1166
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,596
All together, now!

1170
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,811
You know, we can't all
be Einstein, so...

1171
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,062
- I can!
- We are!

1172
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,689
- He is!
- Me, too!

1173
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,565
- Okay, all right.
- Einstein: Okay, here it is.

1174
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,110
- Can you slow it down a little bit?
- Okay.

1175
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,363
3.14159265.

1176
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,156
Okay. 3.14...

1177
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,324
I've got it.

1178
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,493
- Thank you, Mr. Einstein.
- Thank you.

1179
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,246
All right. Now,

1180
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,333
like the brilliant and
famous general that I am,

1181
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,502
I thought long and hard
about what you said,

1182
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:32,589
and I've come up with a brand-new
and improved battle plan!

1183
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:33,841
(Laughs)

1184
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,385
Okay.

1185
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,640
I will loudly announce
that we are not

1186
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,601
going to attack, and then...

1187
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,937
Wait for it.

1188
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:51,233
"What's the amazing Custer about to say
now? I hope he's my friend, or..."

1189
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,986
(Exclaims) We attack!

1190
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,321
(All laughing)

1191
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:01,535
Didn't expect your friend to
run off like that, did you?

1192
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,246
He's coming back, Ka-Ka-Ro.

1193
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,125
Sure as moon shines on a
mongoose, he'll be here.

1194
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,420
I would save my
breath if I were you.

1195
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,672
You don't have many left.

1196
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,178
We've got about 10 minutes
to get over there to jed.

1197
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:22,097
I think we make a good team,
perhaps more than a team.

1198
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,183
Um, wait, wait,
wait. Okay, wait.

1199
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,027
What's the matter? You
didn't like kissing me?

1200
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,980
No, I did. It was great. I mean, the
slapping hurt a little bit, but...

1201
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,107
So you don't like me, then.

1202
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,443
Of course I like you.
You're incredible.

1203
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,862
I think you're an amazing
person. You're...

1204
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,866
It's just there are certain issues
that would prevent us from...

1205
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,410
I just... you're not...

1206
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,204
I'm not what, Mr. Daley?

1207
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,043
Okay. You're made of...

1208
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,754
Made of...

1209
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:06,975
Wonderful things. You're made
of good, wonderful things.

1210
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:11,772
(Speaking French)

1211
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,191
Come on.

1212
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,989
Gentlemen, could you buy
us some time please?

1213
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,242
(Soldiers clamouring)

1214
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,664
It'll have to do.

1215
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:33,001
No! That's the first
plane ever made!

1216
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,754
It's made out of balsa
wood and paper.

1217
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,297
It's made out of
spruce and canvas

1218
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,383
and good old-fashioned
American ingenuity.

1219
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,969
Are you coming, or what?

1220
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,725
Out of our way!

1221
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:49,935
I don't think so.

1222
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,603
(Propeller whirring)

1223
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,021
They're getting away!

1224
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,606
(All clamouring)

1225
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,320
Hang on, Mr. Daley. Things are
about to get interesting.

1226
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,080
A lady pilot! Preposterous!

1227
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,915
Think again, boys!

1228
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,458
Oh, she's good.

1229
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:17,671
(All screaming)

1230
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,434
(Wire twanging)

1231
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,145
- Uh-oh.
- What? What? What uh-oh?

1232
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,397
One of the wires is jammed. I'm
going to have to loosen it.

1233
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,691
- Here, take the stick!
- No! I'm not gonna... no!

1234
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,318
I know you've got
moxie in you yet.

1235
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,988
Moxie doesn't fly planes! People who
have pilots' licenses fly planes!

1236
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,615
- Okay.
- She's all yours.

1237
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,994
I don't want it! I
don't want the stick!

1238
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:55,542
Don't look now, Mr. Daley, but
you're flying an aeroplane!

1239
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,764
Able! The doors!

1240
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,557
(Exclaims)

1241
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,267
(Chattering)

1242
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,526
(Alarm blaring)

1243
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,699
- Got it!
- Pull!

1244
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,287
Pull up!

1245
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:33,789
(Both screaming)

1246
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,335
(Exclaims)

1247
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,419
Yes!

1248
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,338
Godspeed, Amelia Earhart!

1249
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,839
Godspeed.

1250
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,755
Jedediah: Look a little
nervous there, Ramen noodle.

1251
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,049
'Cause for me, this is
like a spa treatment.

1252
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:30,637
Sand baths are really rejuvenating
for the skin. Exfoliates.

1253
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,764
Giving up yet?

1254
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,766
Not quite yet, no.

1255
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:39,604
In fact, let's see if
we can't make time fly.

1256
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,732
(Grunting)

1257
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,277
(Plane approaching)

1258
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,237
What is that funny sound?

1259
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,955
(Groans)

1260
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,625
(Amelia gasps)

1261
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,594
Stop!

1262
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,139
Right there, please, Mr. Daley.

1263
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,349
Well. Well, well, well!

1264
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,935
You certainly know how to
make an entrance, Mr. Daley.

1265
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,437
Time to recruit some backup.

1266
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,981
I hope for your little
friend's sake, here,

1267
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,442
that you also figured
out the combination.

1268
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,069
- Give me jed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1269
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,905
First, give me the combination
and hand over that tablet.

1270
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,615
I'll give you the tablet
and the combination

1271
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,366
when you release my friends
and give him back to me.

1272
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:37,329
I shall release what I want to release
the moment I want to release it.

1273
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,039
Great. And I'll release
what I want to release

1274
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,832
at the exact moment that I
want to release it, okay?

1275
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,627
Tell me the combination and
give me that tablet right now

1276
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,670
or I shall kill all
of your friends,

1277
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,548
starting with the little
shaggy-headed little cowman here.

1278
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,010
I ain't shaggy-headed! Gigantor,
let me take this guy!

1279
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,721
Don't worry, I got this handled. You
don't want to give me my friends,

1280
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,640
then you're not gonna get your
combination or your tablet.

1281
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,183
- All right, I'll tell you what.
- Good.

1282
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,144
They didn't call me kahmunrah
the trustworthy for nothing.

1283
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,897
Here you go. They didn't call
me kahmunrah the trustworthy!

1284
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,899
They called me kahmunrah
the bloodthirsty,

1285
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,611
who kills whoever doesn't give
kahmunrah exactly what he wants

1286
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,030
in the moment that he wants
it, which is right now,

1287
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:15,325
when I had also better get the
combination and the tablet!

1288
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,577
That's what they called you?

1289
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,912
It was shorter in Egyptian.

1290
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,705
Great, I'll give you the combination
after you give him back.

1291
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,834
How dare you? If you touch that
again, I shall kill you right now.

1292
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,544
- Okay.
- Do not touch this.

1293
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,837
This is a no-touching zone!

1294
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,463
Good. Well, then...

1295
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:32,592
Oh, my god! I can't believe you
reached across like that again!

1296
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:36,096
I can't even believe it! Oh,
god, I want to kill you right...

1297
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,056
If you didn't know
this combination,

1298
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,891
you'd be so dead right now,

1299
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,268
it would be unbelievable.

1300
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,978
Great, but I do know
the combination.

1301
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:47,149
Don't cross this
line with your hand!

1302
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:53,155
How dare you! If you speak
again, I'm going to kill you.

1303
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,739
Do you understand this?

1304
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,665
Don't say it! Oh, god, I
see you getting ready.

1305
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,910
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Oh, my god, don't say anything.

1306
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,121
I shall murder you
if you talk again.

1307
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:06,334
Now give me that tablet and
tell me the combination.

1308
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,254
Okay. After you give me jed
and release my friends.

1309
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,548
- You did all three!
- What?

1310
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,550
You spoke and you reached
your hand across!

1311
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,594
Look. I can talk to you
about this all night, okay?

1312
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:16,995
- How about this?
- Look, just give...

1313
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,347
How about I don't kill you right
now, like I really, really want to,

1314
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,474
and I give you
precisely five seconds

1315
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,269
to give me that tablet and
tell me the combination?

1316
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,939
We already got the
combination. It's pi.

1317
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:33,069
- 3.14159265.
- Einstein: No!

1318
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,779
- (Shushing) Hey.
- Sorry.

1319
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,824
So crazy hair here, he sang.

1320
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,578
Oh, did he sing! Like a canary.

1321
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,747
I'm sorry, Larry.

1322
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,874
Enough out of you! Remember
what happened last time?

1323
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,251
- That's enough.
- Einstein: Stupid man.

1324
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,130
You okay?

1325
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,757
Yeah, thanks.

1326
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,301
Must be a real bummer
for you, Larry,

1327
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:01,306
knowing that all of your Valiant
efforts were, in the end, for naught.

1328
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:06,394
What a terrible disappointment
you must be to yourself.

1329
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:11,566
(Humming)

1330
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,114
Kahmunrah: Do you hear
that humming sound?

1331
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,743
Do you know what that sound is?

1332
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,288
It's rhetorical.

1333
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:29,584
That is the sound of the end.

1334
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,215
(Chanting in foreign language)

1335
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,969
I'm sorry, jed.

1336
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,429
(Sighs) You did your
best, gigantor.

1337
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,641
Dadgum it, we almost
had him, too.

1338
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,936
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around
the last couple of years at the museum.

1339
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,188
Maybe none of this
would have happened.

1340
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,482
You don't get it,
do you, gigantor?

1341
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,985
I didn't call you 'cause
we needed your help.

1342
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,736
Sure, we were in
a little pickle,

1343
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,382
but it wouldn't have
been the first time

1344
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:01,032
I had to wrestle my way
out of a root sack.

1345
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,869
No, partner. I called you
'cause you needed us.

1346
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:09,082
That fancy suit you've been parading
around in these past couple years,

1347
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,251
that there's a hanging suit.

1348
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,212
All gussied up, but dead inside.

1349
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,172
That ain't you.

1350
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,634
- And I'll tell you another thing.
- Yeah.

1351
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,386
This night ain't over yet.

1352
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:25,265
This little midnight cowboy's
got some fight left in him.

1353
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,518
Something tells me you
do, too. Ho, now!

1354
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:47,704
(Einstein yells)

1355
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:02,260
Welcome to the new, extended
reign of kahmunrah,

1356
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,137
fifth king of Egypt

1357
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,973
and now the world!

1358
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:10,935
Horus, Ra, my
warriors, come forth!

1359
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:16,399
Send Larry Daley and his
friends to their doom!

1360
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,942
(Squawks)

1361
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:39,798
(Shouting in foreign language)

1362
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,842
Octavius: Halt!

1363
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,721
The mighty octavius
has returned!

1364
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:52,227
I ride on the back of nature's
most fearsome creature! I ride

1365
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,523
the squirrel!

1366
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,817
(Chattering aggressively)

1367
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,195
Forward now, my mighty steed!

1368
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,410
Whoa, girl! Easy.

1369
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,662
Do you wish to
surrender honourably?

1370
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,998
Or must this end with the
spilling of your blood?

1371
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,837
This? This is your big rescue?

1372
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,674
Oh, no. This is!

1373
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,265
(All exclaiming)

1374
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,729
What is that thing?

1375
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,940
The name is Abraham Lincoln.

1376
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,317
And you, sir, are in
a heap of trouble!

1377
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,485
Attack it!

1378
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,155
(Shouting orders in
foreign language)

1379
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,323
(Cawing)

1380
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,703
Disgusting half-pigeons!

1381
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,210
(Shrieking)

1382
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,799
Kahmunrah: No, no, no! Hello?

1383
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,218
Adiós, bird brains!

1384
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,012
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!

1385
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,097
Goodbye, strange bird men.

1386
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,183
Do not return to the underworld!

1387
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,268
Yes, yes, do go back
into the underworld!

1388
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,895
Thank you for
coming! Good night!

1389
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,062
Kahmunrah: No, no!

1390
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,741
Oh, this is awkward.

1391
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,869
It appears my work here is done.

1392
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:38,917
Just remember, son, a house divided
against itself cannot stand.

1393
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,294
(Glass shattering)

1394
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:42,754
Farewell.

1395
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:45,840
What now?

1396
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,467
You know, I'm not quite sure.

1397
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:52,263
I suppose we should probably
start by watching him die.

1398
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,768
<i>Streltsy!</i> Make him dead!

1399
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,729
(Bugle sounding)

1400
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,606
Now what?

1401
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,153
We are not going to attack right

1402
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,365
now!

1403
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,950
(All cheering)

1404
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,959
Get them!

1405
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,627
(All clamouring)

1406
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:43,356
Fear not, Larry! I
will help Jedediah!

1407
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,108
You come at them from behind!

1408
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,404
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm hiding.

1409
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,739
Hiding? What are you doing?
Come on, we need you.

1410
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,075
I'm a failure.

1411
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,868
Hey, no, you're not.

1412
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:58,705
Did you foolishly lead 208
Americans to their deaths

1413
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,498
at the battle of little bighorn?

1414
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:06,129
- No.
- No. Not good. Not good at all.

1415
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,255
That's not good.

1416
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,631
Sure, I talk a good game,

1417
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,008
but the truth of the matter is,

1418
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,509
I don't deserve these stars.

1419
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:16,347
I will always be famous
for my biggest failure.

1420
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,518
Hey.

1421
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,895
The past is the past, okay?

1422
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,357
Right now, this
moment, this night,

1423
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,694
this is what you're gonna
be remembered for.

1424
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,114
This is your last stand.

1425
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,541
(Whining)

1426
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,629
(Whimpering)

1427
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:51,966
They need a leader.

1428
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,551
Yeah, they need a leader.

1429
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,136
(Laughing)

1430
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,472
Yeah? You want to be
their leader, huh?

1431
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,308
- Yeah, I do.
- Let's do this!

1432
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,060
- All right?
- Yeah.

1433
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,478
Let's go!

1434
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,480
(Hooting)

1435
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,231
Not good!

1436
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:08,733
<i>Larry!</i>

1437
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:10,526
Hey, able!

1438
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:11,611
<i>I want to help!</i>

1439
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:12,820
Oh, great.

1440
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:14,614
<i>Who are you? This is my museum!</i>

1441
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,741
<i>Well, he's my human. Back off!</i>

1442
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,910
<i>You need all the help you
can get, jungle-dweller!</i>

1443
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:20,119
<i>Get over yourself space snob!</i>

1444
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,204
Guys! Hey, guys!

1445
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,208
This is not the time to
get into this, all right?

1446
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,751
Dexter, you know better.

1447
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,634
All right? That's what
happens when you do that!

1448
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:32,006
You get that.

1449
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,259
(Groans)

1450
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,761
(Both chattering)

1451
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,599
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

1452
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:45,144
Now, listen. You're
both proud Capuchin!

1453
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,822
You need to concentrate
on slapping the enemy!

1454
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,733
(Both laughing)

1455
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:52,985
Keep it together, all right?

1456
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,987
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1457
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,366
Jedediah! They need us!

1458
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,784
I ain't gonna make it!

1459
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,662
Afraid this cowboy's been
to his last hoedown.

1460
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:09,001
Octavius, remember me as I
was, wild, and free, and...

1461
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,046
No need for final words.

1462
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,048
- I'm not finished yet.
- Oh.

1463
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,934
I want to get to the story
of our relationship,

1464
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,302
the evolution from
enemy to friends.

1465
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,512
No!

1466
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:20,763
It'll make you cry!

1467
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:24,142
No! Because you are
going to live!

1468
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:29,814
(Screams)

1469
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,442
Whoo!

1470
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,571
Let's go to work.

1471
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:37,822
Have a sword.

1472
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,158
Sword!

1473
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,010
Octavius: Incoming!

1474
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,401
(Both grunting)

1475
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,196
(Speaking French)

1476
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,530
That smarts.

1477
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,828
You smack, you kick!
You smack, you kick!

1478
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:29,248
You smack, you kick!
Teamwork, fellas! <i>Wunderbar!</i>

1479
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,545
How you doing, fellas?

1480
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,047
Boom! Bam!

1481
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,760
(All clamouring)

1482
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,222
(Chattering)

1483
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,453
- Are you all right?
- Never better.

1484
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,705
Listen, when I give you the signal,
I want you to open the gate.

1485
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,374
I take it you have a plan.

1486
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,959
I'm gonna divide the house.

1487
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,420
(Speaking French)

1488
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,216
The tablet! Now!

1489
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,717
Okay, sure, you can have it.

1490
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,882
Just tell me who the boss
is and I'll give it to you.

1491
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,430
Or should I give it to kahmunrah?
He's your master, right?

1492
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,641
Nyet! He is not our master!

1493
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,351
Really? 'Cause he
acts like he is.

1494
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,436
But fine, just tell me who the
boss is and you can have it.

1495
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,939
Hey! That'd be me.

1496
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:39,443
This man is a peasant! I am the
only one here of noble birth!

1497
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,488
Really? 'Cause he's got more
medals and a bigger hat, but...

1498
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,615
Thank you. You might
got a lot of medals,

1499
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,326
but you put one of your little
child hands on that tablet again,

1500
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,246
it'll be the last thing them tiny
little mitts of yours ever touch.

1501
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,206
Why would you touch
little nippy?

1502
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,208
(Whistles)

1503
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:55,626
I can handle this, okay?

1504
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,796
You can handle nothing! You
can barely speak, you fool!

1505
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,048
You know what? No problem.

1506
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,800
I'll give it to
you. You see that?

1507
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,218
(Exclaims)

1508
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,554
(Screams)

1509
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,306
Capone: Oh, you're a
spunky little fella!

1510
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:17,899
Very clever, Mr. Daley, getting
them to fight amongst themselves.

1511
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,817
Yeah. I can't
really take credit.

1512
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:21,777
It was Abraham Lincoln's idea.

1513
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,238
You know, a house
divided can't...

1514
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,074
- Doesn't do well.
- Yes, well,

1515
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:30,870
you should have saved yourself
when you had the chance,

1516
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,749
because now I shall have
the tremendous pleasure

1517
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,500
of killing you myself!

1518
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:56,979
(Grunts)

1519
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,636
What are you?

1520
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,223
I'm the night guard.

1521
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,726
No!

1522
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,819
(All cheering)

1523
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,821
Victory is ours!

1524
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,740
Yeah!

1525
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,415
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about!

1526
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,375
(Laughs) Yeah!

1527
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,674
I'd say somebody
found his moxie.

1528
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,594
The battle of the Smithsonian.

1529
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,641
Perhaps the greatest battle
the world will never know.

1530
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,353
We'll know.

1531
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,358
Yeah.

1532
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:28,946
Oh, man, I got an hour till sunrise.
I got to get you guys back.

1533
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:33,034
Jedediah: In case you forgot, gigantor,
they don't want us there any more.

1534
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,493
Well, I do.

1535
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:40,875
Hey, think you could
hook us up with a ride?

1536
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:44,003
My pleasure, of course.

1537
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:48,299
Hang on a second. One last
thing I got to take care of.

1538
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,719
Come on, boy! Come on, come on!

1539
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:52,887
(Giant squid
exclaiming gleefully)

1540
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:54,138
Get in there!

1541
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,476
Feels good, right?

1542
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:05,483
You're welcome! Just get back
inside by sunrise, okay?

1543
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:22,124
These are promising
days, indeed.

1544
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,941
All right. Hey, come on, guys.

1545
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,943
Remember, stay with
your buddy, all right?

1546
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:50,111
(Cavemen grunting)

1547
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,570
Good, good.

1548
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,456
(Chattering)

1549
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,291
Well, you're back
where you belong.

1550
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,212
Yeah. Think so.

1551
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:13,717
(Sighs)

1552
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,512
I guess I should be going.

1553
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,680
Mmm.

1554
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,474
Hey, Amelia.

1555
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:25,729
That thing that I was trying
to tell you about earlier...

1556
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:31,068
There's not really an
easy way to put this,

1557
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,988
but, in the morning...

1558
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:36,157
I know what's coming, Mr. Daley.

1559
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:37,616
I've always known.

1560
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,078
But it doesn't matter.

1561
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:45,124
You've given me the adventure
of a lifetime in one night.

1562
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,671
And I have a feeling it's going
to be a beautiful sunrise.

1563
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,514
Have fun.

1564
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,108
Thanks.

1565
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,748
Hmm!

1566
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:06,163
I don't know about you fellas, but this
old cowboy just got to second base.

1567
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,251
Octavius: There she goes.

1568
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,535
Jedediah: Straight towards...

1569
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,713
Canada.

1570
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,549
She's heading to Canada.

1571
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,845
No, now she course-corrected.

1572
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:27,768
Here, head on downstairs, guys.

1573
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:29,311
- Jedediah: All righty.
- Octavius: Good night, Larry.

1574
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,854
Hey, boy, how's it going?

1575
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,234
Lawrence! Bless you for
bringing them back.

1576
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,028
And might I say, a hearty
well-done is in order.

1577
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:41,573
And may I also point out, they
cannot hide in the basement forever.

1578
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:43,284
Yeah. No, I think I
got that figured out.

1579
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,451
- Really?
- Yeah.

1580
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,370
Sun come, dumb-dumb.

1581
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,573
Our Moai friend is right. The
dawn will soon be upon us.

1582
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,083
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hmm?

1583
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,626
Remember the other night
you were saying something

1584
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:54,044
about the key to happiness?

1585
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:54,439
Did I?

1586
01:33:54,464 --> 01:33:55,847
You said, "the key
to happiness is..."

1587
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,299
And then the sun came
up and you froze.

1588
01:33:58,425 --> 01:34:00,217
- I think I got it figured out.
- Yes?

1589
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,013
It's doing what you love, isn't
it? With people you love.

1590
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:08,186
Actually, I was going to
say "physical exercise",

1591
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:09,601
but the love thing's good, too.

1592
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,358
Lawrence!

1593
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,568
Yeah.

1594
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,572
Welcome home, son.

1595
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,367
Thanks.

1596
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,009
Well, folks, the wait is over.

1597
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:43,886
After two months of renovation,

1598
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,681
tonight, the museum of natural history
reopens its doors to the public.

1599
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:50,142
As you can see, new
Yorkers are flooding in,

1600
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,770
eager to see just what
changes are in store.

1601
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:54,605
With its new,
extended night hours,

1602
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,441
we're told the museum will
be more lively than ever.

1603
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:10,662
- Well, well, well, well!
- Hey.

1604
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:14,124
I see the uniform still fits
after these long, long years.

1605
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,627
Yeah, yeah. Really hasn't
been that long, but...

1606
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:21,465
So, to what do we owe
this "triumphant" return?

1607
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,010
Not cut out for the "corporate"
jungle after all. Got fired.

1608
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:29,765
No, actually, I sold my company.

1609
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,810
The world doth move
in mysterious ways.

1610
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:35,729
One day, we've got to get
rid of everything old,

1611
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:41,860
the next, a rich, anonymous
donor gives a huge endowment.

1612
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:45,948
With a proviso, everything
stays the same. So...

1613
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,455
Well, not exactly the
same, obviously.

1614
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:52,938
No.

1615
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,958
Bully, lads and ladies, the
name is Theodore Roosevelt,

1616
01:35:56,042 --> 01:36:00,879
naturalist, rough rider and twenty-sixth
president of these great United States.

1617
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:04,508
Come along, lad. The
hunt is afoot. Lawrence.

1618
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,891
Hey, you dumb-dumbs
bring me gum-gum?

1619
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,061
(Speaking foreign language)

1620
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,565
(All laughing)

1621
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:24,069
My parents gave me this
tablet some 3,000 years ago,

1622
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:28,323
entrusting me with one of my
people's most prized possessions.

1623
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:29,950
Does it do anything?

1624
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,243
Do anything?

1625
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,370
Yeah. What's the point if
it doesn't do anything?

1626
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,622
<i>Tell 'em.</i>

1627
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:40,210
Actually, it has a magical power that
brings all the exhibits to life.

1628
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,753
No, really, what's it do?

1629
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,924
Nothing. It's just
for decoration.

1630
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,384
- (Whispers) I knew it.
- Mmm-hmm.

1631
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:52,389
This place is lame. This thing
doesn't even look real.

1632
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,601
Seriously, dude, these
animatronics suck.

1633
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:57,686
(Roaring loudly)

1634
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,521
(Screaming)

1635
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,525
(Trumpeting)

1636
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,487
- Mammoth?
- Yeah.

1637
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,030
Extinct!

1638
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,686
Today's technology is beyond me.

1639
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:10,782
I know. It's so lifelike.

1640
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Something else.

1641
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:14,995
You'll stick around a
bit longer this time,

1642
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,748
or you gonna run away again
when you get something better?

1643
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,355
- I'm gonna stay.
- Stay, for a long time.

1644
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:21,585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1645
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:27,382
Good. 'Cause, as night
guards go, you're...

1646
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:28,509
(Throat catches)

1647
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,886
- What?
- The best.

1648
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,722
Excuse me.

1649
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,271
You, the toddler! Don't
hug the displays.

1650
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:19,059
I'm sorry. Hi.

1651
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,144
I don't mean to stare. I just...

1652
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,648
You look a lot like
somebody I know, and...

1653
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:26,817
I get that a lot.

1654
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:27,652
Do you?

1655
01:38:27,677 --> 01:38:30,511
Yeah. I guess I have
that kind of face.

1656
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,864
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

1657
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,952
You're not by any chance related
to Amelia Earhart, are you?

1658
01:38:37,704 --> 01:38:39,079
- No.
- No.

1659
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,164
- No, I don't think so.
- Of course you're not.

1660
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:43,041
I mean, I don't
know. Maybe I'm...

1661
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,210
I just had to ask. I'm sorry.

1662
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:49,298
She was that woman who
flew across the pacific.

1663
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,216
- The Atlantic.
- Atlantic. Of course.

1664
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,802
First woman to fly across the Atlantic,
and she received the flying cross,

1665
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,512
first woman to do that.

1666
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:59,391
- That's very cool.
- Yeah, she was cool.

1667
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:10,402
Hey, you know what you should check
out is the the hall of miniatures.

1668
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:14,656
Could you take me there?
I'm always getting lost.

1669
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:21,038
Yeah, I know. Sure. Yeah,
I'll show you. Come on.

1670
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,206
Thank you.

1671
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,876
- I'm Larry Daley.
- Tess.

1672
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:42,601
(Exclaims)

1673
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,704
Woman: Joseph, time for dinner!

1674
01:40:02,789 --> 01:40:03,997
One second, ma!

1675
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:08,293
Joey Motorola, you get down
here for supper right now!

1676
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:11,922
I said one second, ma! I really
think I'm on to something here!
