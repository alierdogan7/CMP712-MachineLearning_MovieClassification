an old hackneyed expression...

159

you've got to start at the bottom.

160

- I'm at the bottom.
- That's a perfect place to start.

161

00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,473
I've had this conversation
in my head. This is beautiful.

177
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,805
- Did it always end this way?
- Yeah, it did.

178
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,471
I really believe this.

179
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,481
Once you get over
the initial shyness, you'll be O.K.

180
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,914
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,353
Hope it works
out for you, Rupert.

182
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,013
Thanks,Jerry.
Thanks a lot.

183
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,023
It's a pleasure
meeting you,Jerry.

184
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,525
Jerry. I'm a little short on cash...

185
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,028
but if you don't
mind just appetizers...

186
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,530
I'd love to take you
to dinner sometime.

187
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,067
I don't know my schedule.
Maybe we can.

188
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,568
O.K. Thanks,Jerry.
Thanks.

189
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,969
Jerry. Let me show you
a picture of my pride and joy.

190
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,742
That's good.

191
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,506
- Good, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

192
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,547
Hey,Jerry, take it.

193
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,981
Take it.
Go ahead, take it.

194
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,951
Consider it a gift.
It'll work for you.

195
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,049
I will.

196
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,317
Not that you
need the help.Jerry!

197
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,053
Seriously.
You ever want lunch--my treat.

198
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,062
Call my office.

199
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,256
O.K., O.K., O.K.

200
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,324
O.K.Jerry,you're a prince.!

201
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,849
Hey, Rupe,
before I forget...

202
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,385
I really appreciate you
meeting me for lunch.

203
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:16,320
I know how busy you are
and how tired you are.

204
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,058
What are friends for,Jerry?

205
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,390
Talking about schedule,
you're the one who looks tired.

206
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, I know.
It's the show.

207
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,062
The pressure, the ratings.

208
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,868
The same guests,
the same questions.

209
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,473
I'm just not
enjoying it anymore.

210
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:41,172
That's...the worst.

211
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,885
Listen, I...I really wish you
would think about it again.

212
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,718
Wait a minute.
You--you're starting again.

213
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,724
You're starting up again.

214
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,885
It's not that big a deal to think.

215
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,553
I'm asking you to think.

216
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,291
I'm thinking.
All I do is think day and night.

217
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,801
How can I not think about it?
We're here at lunch together...

218
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,303
which I knew is why
you invited me...

219
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,238
and I'm here eating
to get guilty with you, right?

220
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,242
I'm asking you to take
over the show for six weeks.

221
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,834
What's six weeks?

222
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,348
I'll give you anything,
but don't ask me to do six weeks.

223
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,010
I can't take over
the show for six weeks.

224
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,020
I can't even take over
my own life for six weeks.

225
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,522
You're asking for something
that's impossible! It's impossible!

226
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,955
- [Woman] Rupert.!
- Don't you understand--

227
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,049
What?

228
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,560
What are you doing
down there so late?

229
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,063
It's impossible!
I'm trying to tell you that.

230
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,292
What, you want me to cry?

231
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:38,133
There must be a way to work it out.
It's just six weeks.

232
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:41,230
Ex$cuse me. Um, Mr. Pupkin?
You think you could--

233
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:44,538
Yeah. Sure.
What's your name, dear?

234
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,046
- Dolores.
- Dolores? That was my father's name.

235
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,582
""To Dolores...

236
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,447
who sensed greatness.''

237
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,088
There you go, sweetheart.

238
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,091
- Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
- Don't mention it.

239
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,329
[Woman] Rupert.!
Rupert, who you talking to?

240
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:06,763
- Mom!
- What is it?

241
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,825
Please stop calling me!

242
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,867
It's terrific.
It's great.

243
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,535
There's only one problem, though.

244
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,239
He made--he made
you bigger.

245
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,713
Would you answer me?

246
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,216
All right!
You've got the six weeks!

247
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,878
Don't bother me!
I'll give you the six weeks!

248
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,751
What can I say?
You happy now?

249
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,346
You're a tough man, Rupe.

250
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:34,154
You got to be in this business.

251
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,353
Ha ha ha ha!

252
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

253
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,360
Ha ha ha ha ha!

254
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,515
[Telephone Rings]

255
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,690
[Ring]

256
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:14,694
[Ring]

257
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,861
Hello.

258
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,199
Hello. It's Masha,Jerry.

259
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,035
- Who?
- Did you get my note?

260
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:22,199
Who's this?

261
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,209
Masha.
Didn't you get the note?

262
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,211
I left it on the back seat...

263
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,713
before they dragged me
out of the car.

264
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:31,215
You know, those guys
really hurt me,Jerry.

265
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,218
How did you get this number?

266
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,220
Don't be angry with me,Jerry.

267
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,222
How did you get this number?

268
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,225
I don't know what else to do.
I've been calling your--

269
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,122
How've you been, Rita?

270
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,704
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

271
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,269
Rupert.

272
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,611
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

273
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,018
I brought you a little present.

274
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,049
Oh, yeah. I remember.

275
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,353
- Mr. Romance.
- Heh.

276
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,756
Put an aspirin in that.
It'll last longer.

277
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:55,400
So what are you
up to these days?

278
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,631
You're looking
as beautiful as ever, Rita.

279
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,639
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

280
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,901
You know...

281
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,909
it's funny, but I...I, uh...

282
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:08,174
- I voted for you ""most beautiful.''
- Did you? That's sweet.

283
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,239
I didn't have the nerve
to tell you then, but--

284
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,343
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's O.K. We're both adults.

285
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,854
Isn't that funny?
You know, when you're younger...

286
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,857
you're afraid to say those things,
but when you get older...

287
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,361
you can say those things
that you should've said
1 5, 20 years ago.

288
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,058
Isn't that the final irony of life?

289
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,395
Isn't it?

290
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,957
I guess.

291
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:36,040
Are you happy
in this place, Rita?

292
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,377
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

293
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,879
Oh, really? Like what?

294
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,881
Well...what are you
doing tonight?

295
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,883
What am I doing tonight?

296
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,317
- Ha ha!
- Yeah. What's so funny?

297
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:52,517
Isn't it just a little late asking me
for a date after 1 5 years?

298
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,221
Ha ha ha ha!
Really? Ha ha! Well...

299
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:01,062
Waiter?
Can I have a fresh one?

300
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,067
- Rita.
- Hmm?

301
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,262
Who is your favorite
movie star?

302
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,704
What is this,
some kind of a game?

303
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,571
You going to tell me
something about my character...

304
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,077
- my future?
- You'll see. Tell me.

305
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,114
Everybody has
a favorite movie star.

306
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,278
I better think of somebody,
or we'll never get out of here, right?

307
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,786
That's a little test.

308
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,914
Oh, let's see.
Marilyn Monroe.

309
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,454
Perfect.

310
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,636
""Talent Register,'' huh?

311
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,271
That's her name.

312
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,278
She signed this in New York...

313
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,280
during her publicity tour
for The Misfits.

314
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,612
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,618
She wasn't a great actress...

316
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,280
but she did have
a real gift for comedy.

317
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,414
You know,
she died tragically alone...

318
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:01,392
like many of the world's
most beautiful women.

319
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,190
I don't want to see
that happening to you.

320
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,092
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

321
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,402
- This?
- Mel Brooks. He's what
you call ""on funny.''

322
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,840
Others are just regular.

323
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,878
Oh, that's Sid Caesar.
He's remarkable.

324
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,879
I really like him.
He's great.

325
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,575
Woody Allen. Nice guy.
Personal friend of mine.

326
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,912
Of course he is.

327
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,078
Ha ha! No, he is.

328
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,315
Oh, that's Ernie Kovacs.

329
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:34,553
He was wonderful.
He was a...great comedian,
great innovator.

330
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,595
That was a great, great loss.

331
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,926
I bet some of these
are worth money.

332
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,990
Oh, yeah.
Especially this one.Just hold it.

333
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,443
- Who's this?
- Well,just take a guess.

334
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,105
- Huh. Looks like ""retard.''
- Ha ha!

335
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,877
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

336
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,779
That might be true,
Rupert, but who is it?

337
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,378
""R'' is the first letter.

338
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,822
Come on, Rupert,
who is it? I'm tired.

339
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,688
I'll give you a little hint.

340
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:11,863
- Oooo--
- Robert Redford.

341
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,866
Ha ha. No.
Ha ha ha ha.

342
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:19,234
No, no.
That's ""Rupert Pupkin.''

343
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,874
Rupert Pupkin.

344
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,946
I surprised you, didn't I?

345
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,414
Take this as a gift.

346
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:40,517
Take good care of that.
Soon everyone's going to want one.

347
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,185
Rupert, you have not changed.

348
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:46,197
Just a couple of hours ago,
you know who I was talking to?

349
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:49,200
- Guess!
- Your shrink?

350
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,860
Ha ha!
That's very funny.

351
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:54,497
No.Jerry Langford.
That's right. TheJerry Langford.

352
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,064
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.
Would you believe it?

353
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,804
And you know what?
Don't tell anyone yet...

354
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,905
but you're looking
at the new king of comedy.

355
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,644
- Ha ha ha ha.
- Why not me?

356
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,312
Why not? A guy can get
anything he wants...

357
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,218
as long as he pays the price.

358
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,123
What's so funny about that?
I mean, crazier things have happened.

359
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,957
You don't understand
what a shot on Langford means.

360
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,623
That's coast-to-coast national TV,
a bigger audience...

361
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:23,156
than the greatest comedians
used to play to in a whole lifetime.

362
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:27,171
A shot at a free ticket
on the comedy circuit.
My own comedy show--

363
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,173
The Rupert Pupkin Show.
Everything!

364
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,404
And all that leads
in one direction, Rita--Hollywood.

365
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,673
A beach house in Malibu
on the ocean.

366
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:37,181
And we'll keep a suite
at the Sherry.

367
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,683
Everybody stays there
when they make it big.

368
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,687
Up top so we can shout down,
""Hey, tough luck, suckers.

369
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,690
Better luck next time.''
Come on. What do you say?

370
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:48,693
It sounds wonderful, Rupert.
I wish you the best of luck.

371
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,628
But it's getting late,
and I'm a working girl.

372
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:54,962
- I got to go home.
- I--I don't get you!

373
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,468
Here I am,
offering you a way out.

374
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,471
Rita. Every king
needs a queen.

375
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,473
I want you to be mine.

376
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,213
This is a nice street.
Nice building.

377
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,943
- Thanks for your jacket, Rupert.
- Oh.

378
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,888
I guess you're entitled to come up
and have some coffee.

379
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,550
I wouldn't want
to impose, really.

380
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,150
- I know I can--
- What do you want?

381
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,819
What?

382
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,226
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

383
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,235
Rita, you still don't understand?

384
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:34,067
I love you. I want to
help change your life...

385
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,573
if you'll just
give me a chance.

386
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:42,511
What if I set something up
between me, you, and Jerry?

387
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,072
What if we went out
to dinner one night?

388
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,845
You know what's even better?

389
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,080
A summer house for a weekend.

390
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,985
He wouldn't want to meet me.

391
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,581
That's not true.

392
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,593
Jerry is a very nice guy.

393
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,595
He's a very, very nice guy...

394
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,597
and we had
a terrific meeting.

395
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,599
And you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

396
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,000
You have too little faith,
and you're a wonderful person.

397
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:10,033
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest?

398
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,168
O.K.?

399
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,075
O.K.

400
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,083
- Good night.
- Good night.

401
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,977
Go to sleep right away.

402
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,384
[Baby Crying]

403
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,122
I'll tell you, boy.

404
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,732
Hiya, Liza.
Good seeing you.

405
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,830
Jerola. Good seeing you.
Jerry. Don't get up.

406
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,602
Ahh, boy, I'll tell ya...

407
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:48,112
every time you come back
from a tour...

408
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,411
something must be in the air.
The tour really becomes you.

409
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,418
It's like you
become rejuvenated.
I don't know what it is.

410
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,919
Isn't that so, everybody?

411
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:58,422
Isn't that so?
Hey, hey, there.

412
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,482
Well, that is amazing.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

413
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,994
And I know.
You look wonderful, too,Jerry.

414
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,054
I wasn't leaving you out.

415
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:11,302
Bro? Yeah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

416
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,804
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha!

417
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,542
Oh,Jerry!
I love this guy!

418
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,044
Always coming up
with these great lines.

419
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,547
I love 'em. I love 'em.
You're wonderful.

420
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,049
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

421
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:29,053
Rupert.! The bus is here.!
It's early.!

422
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:32,056
Try to be on time for once.!

423
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,557
I can't believe this.

424
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,560
I got to go.
I got to catch a bus.

425
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,220
Jerry.
Take care of yourself.

426
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,891
Baby, be good.
Good luck in Rio.

427
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,266
Good morning, Rupert.

428
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,604
- Good morning.
- How are you?

429
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,940
- This is for you.
- Work.

430
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,081
- What time is it?
- It's 1 0:00.

431
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,210
1 0:00? Could I use the phone
for one second?

432
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:02,310
Is it local?

433
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,753
Sure.Just dial 9 first.
Make it short.

434
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,863
Hello.Jerry Langford, please.

435
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,196
Rupert Pupkin.

436
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:19,935
Thank you.

437
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,874
Yes. Uh, is Jerry there, please?

438
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,536
Rupert Pupkin. Yes.

439
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,880
Just tell him
it's Rupert calling.

440
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,540
He'll know what it's about.

441
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,219
Oh. Oh, he is?

442
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:37,721
Well, that's O.K.
I'm in a meeting myself.

443
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,191
Um,just tell him I called, O.K.?
Thank you very much.

444
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,387
And I'll call later.
Thanks. Bye.

445
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,158
Is that the Jerry Langford?

446
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,664
I'll see you, Roberta.

447
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,530
Yeah. Bye.

448
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:55,129
Hello.Jerry Langford, please.
Rupert Pupkin.

449
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:58,142
Yes. Rupert Pupkin calling
Jerry Langford, please.

450
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,145
Which? The first name
or the second name?

451
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,576
P-u-p-k-i-n.

452
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,514
It's often mispronounced
and misspelled...

453
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,017
so that's why--yes.

454
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,019
Yes,Jerry knows I'm calling.

455
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,021
He knows what it's about.

456
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,249
Oh, sure. Sure.

457
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,020
I see. I see.

458
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,721
I see.
Yes,you can call me.

459
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:21,027
I'll be here for
the next hour and a half.

460
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:26,765
I'm at my office,
and the number is J L5-43 21 .

461
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:30,534
Yo. Come on, man.

462
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,042
If you don't mind...

463
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,044
I am waiting
for a phone call.

464
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:36,546
It will only take a few minutes.

465
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,810
All of these phones don't work.

466
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,818
I am not making a phone call.

467
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,820
I am ex$pecting a phone call.

468
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,516
I'll show you how
to make a phone call.

469
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:49,220
Wait. Let me just slide
in here and make a call.

470
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,852
Let me just make a call!

471
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,658
Uh, it's important.

472
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,164
This phone don't work either.

473
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,498
Don't do that!
Don't do that!

474
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,265
[Siren]

475
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,534
Hold on a second.
Yes, sir?

476
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,035
Yes.Jerry Langford, please.

477
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:33,537
Your name, please?

478
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,038
Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

479
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:38,267
Rupert?

480
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:40,538
Pupkin. P-u-p-k-i-n.

481
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,547
People often misspell it
and mispronounce it.

482
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:49,053
There's a man here by the name
of Rupert Pumpkin.

483
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:51,419
He wants to see
Mr. Langford.

484
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:57,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Pumpkin...

485
00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:01,065
but Mr. Langford's secretary has
no record of your appointment.

486
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,329
Pardon me?

487
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:07,031
We have no record
of your appointment.

488
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,439
I don't have an official
appointment with Jerry...

489
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,000
but he did ask me
to call him personally.

490
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:16,514
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd just stop up.

491
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:19,015
I had trouble calling
for some reason.

492
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,574
The lines seemed to be busy.

493
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,348
He has no appointment.

494
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,185
Mr. Langford's secretary
wants to know...

495
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,191
what this is in reference to.

496
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,692
Mr. Gangetti, go right in.

497
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,352
Hello? Yes.Jerry and I...

498
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,863
discussed my being
on the show last night.

499
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,865
He told me to call. Yes.

500
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:38,391
Oh, sure. Sure.

501
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,064
- [Wham]
- I'm supposed to wait.

502
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,009
Is that cork?

503
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:21,841
I don't know what it is.

504
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,312
Is it dripping on you?

505
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,317
No. I was looking
at the patterns.

506
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:29,684
You know,
cork is good for sound.

507
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:34,456
- It's very quiet in here.
- [Telephone Rings]

508
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:35,618
Reception.

509
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:38,822
No. You've got an hour
before they come in.

510
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:42,355
No. He hasn't come back
from the meeting yet.

511
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:44,368
- Mr. Pipkin?
- Pupkin.

512
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:47,371
Sorry. I'm Cathy Long.
Can I help you?

513
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,873
- You are?
- I'm Bert Thomas' assistant.

514
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:52,034
He's our executive producer.

515
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,544
Sorry. I've already spoken
toJerry directly...

516
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,547
about my being on the show.

517
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:59,049
He said to talk to him
personally.

518
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,551
What is it exactly that you do?

519
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,054
- I--standup comic.
- Where are you working at?

520
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:05,487
I'm just working
on new material.

521
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:07,991
As soon as you
start working again...

522
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,496
call, and we'll send someone down
to check out your act.

523
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,655
Thanks for stopping by.

524
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:15,666
Jerry and I went over
all this last night.

525
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,167
Does Jerry know your work?

526
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:19,169
Yes. I don't think he does.

527
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:22,001
You have a tape
I could listen you?

528
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:24,668
A tape? Oh, naturally.
Whatever you'd like. Sure.

529
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:25,835
Drop by a tape.

530
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,847
I will. I can see
whyJerry would need that.

531
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,007
Nice meeting you.

532
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,516
Nice meeting you, too.

533
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,417
This is really what's right.

534
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:36,920
This is great.

535
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,922
This is--
See you again.

536
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,288
Nice talking to you.
Goodbye.

537
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:53,095
Rupert. Hey, Rupert.!

538
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,365
We've got to talk.

539
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,374
What happened last night?
Did Jerry say anything?

540
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,876
- Nothing happened.
- Did he talk about me?

541
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,378
No. He talked about me.

542
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,880
He must have said
something about me.

543
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,382
Nothing.
What could he say...

544
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,010
after what you did
in the car last night?

545
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,781
You must be really loving this.

546
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,790
Yeah. You were schmucko
supremo last night.

547
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,793
I'm the schmuck? Me?
You're wrong, buddy!

548
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,295
If I hadn't gotten
in that car last night...

549
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,297
you wouldn't
have had the chance...

550
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,334
to talk toJerry.
Keep that in mind.

551
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,562
Not to be cruel,
but we're nearJerry's building.

552
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:28,037
God forbid he
should see me with you...

553
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:31,405
becauseJerry and I have a real
relationship, no fantasy world.

554
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,410
After what you did last night...

555
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,912
I don't want
to see you anymore.

556
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,073
Fine! If that's what you want!

557
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,980
Yes. That's what I want.

558
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,483
Just get it to him!

559
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,077
I'm not giving him anything.
No way,Jose.

560
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,589
You're so friendly.
You give it to him.

561
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,090
We're having
a communication problem.

562
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,592
That's what you call it?

563
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,595
You're always bragging about
how you broke bread with Jerry.

564
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,755
Give it to him.

565
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:56,767
Just do this for me!
I've done things for you!

566
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,268
What have you done for me?

567
00:30:58,336 --> 00:30:59,928
What are you talking about?

568
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,097
How about Howard Johnson's?

569
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,336
I bought you food and coffee
night after night!

570
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,536
You're crazy.
You didn't get me anything.

571
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,704
- I bought my coffee.
- You never bought anything!

572
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,045
I did things for you
that no money can buy.

573
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,551
How about when
I gave you my spot?

574
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,554
I let you get
right next toJerry!

575
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,385
I waited for eight hours.

576
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,893
You were crying because
you wanted next toJerry.

577
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,053
You got next to him!

578
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,563
What about giving
you my last album...

579
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,064
of The Best ofJerry.!

580
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,567
I didn't even
ask you for money...

581
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:33,069
and I can't even pay my rent!

582
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:36,574
I live in a hovel.
You live in a townhouse!

583
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:40,577
O.K., you want to do that?
I got money for you!

584
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:43,580
I can't believe how long
I've hung out with you...

585
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,809
and listened to your tired,
stale, boring jokes.

586
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:48,114
- Here's $900. No! No!
- Be quiet.

587
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,381
Take this and give it toJerry!

588
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:53,754
This is the last time.
This is the last time.

589
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,383
When will he get it?

590
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,586
Because you're a wacko.

591
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,094
I'll know if you don't.!

592
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:00,757
I know where you
and Jerry are.!

593
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,426
I cover the waterfront!
Remember that!

594
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,368
What are you looking at?
Beat it.!

595
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:07,803
You scum.!
You're street trash.!

596
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,519
First of all, Miss Long...

597
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,078
thank you very much
for your help at the office...

598
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,386
and for passing this
ontoJerry.

599
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,825
I appreciate it
more than you know.

600
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,054
Jerry, before I begin...

601
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,563
thank you for listening
to this material...

602
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,066
and for the opportunity
you've given me.

603
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:39,069
Lots of people think
that people who've made it...

604
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:42,573
lose their feeling for
struggling young talent,
such as myself.

605
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,074
Now I know from experience...

606
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,076
that those people
are just cynics...

607
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,078
embittered by their own failure.

608
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,411
I know,Jerry, that you are
as human as the rest of us...

609
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,246
if not more so.

610
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:55,582
There's no point
in going on about it.

611
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:58,418
You know how I feel,
so let's get on with the show--

612
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,084
The Best of Rupert Pupkin.

613
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,389
Jerry, I've sketched out
this little outline...

614
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,258
to save you time.

615
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,524
It's a little introduction.

616
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:09,032
So close your eyes,
imagine it's exactly 6:00.

617
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,533
You're standing in the wings...

618
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,036
and we hear Lou Brown
and the orchestra...

619
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:16,267
strike up your theme song.

620
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,536
[Theme Song Plays]

621
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,544
And now, from New York...

622
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:22,546
it's theJerry Langford Show...

623
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,549
with Jerry's guests
Richard Pryor...

624
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:26,982
Ben Gazzara...

625
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:28,383
Elizabeth Ashley...

626
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:29,545
Carol Burnett...

627
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,215
and the comedy find
of the year...

628
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,723
making his television debut...

629
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,558
Rupert Pupkin,
the new king of comedy!

630
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,891
[Woman]
Rupert.! Rupert.!

631
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,828
-Are you crazy?
-Say hello...

632
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,332
What's wrong with you?

633
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,890
- People are sleeping.!
-Aw, Mom.!

634
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:44,900
Lower it.!

635
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,368
What's the matter with you?

636
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,567
Mom!

637
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,075
Take it easy.
Lower it.

638
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,576
I'm not going to lower it!

639
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,579
I have to do this now!

640
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,081
I don't mind you playing it...

641
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,582
but lower it.!

642
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:03,087
Now, you come on,Jerry,
and you do your monologue.

643
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,587
Then when the time comes...

644
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:07,022
this is how
I see you introducing me.

645
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,957
You could say
something like this.

646
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,461
Will you please give
your warmest welcome...

647
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:13,963
to the newest
king of comedy...

648
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:16,227
Rupert Pupkin!

649
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:18,963
[Applause]

650
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,471
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,473
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

652
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,473
[Laughter]

653
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,477
I was born in Clifton,
New Jersey...

654
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,978
which is north of...

655
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,480
[Loud Laughter]

656
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,482
Is there anyone here from...

657
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,984
[Loud Laughter]

658
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:38,988
But the fact is...

659
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,992
[Laughter Swells]

660
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:13,957
Mr. Pipkin...

661
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:17,119
Pupkin. You'll get it
right one of these days.

662
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,423
How are you?

663
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:19,929
I'll bet you have a tape.

664
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:22,831
- Right here.
- O.K. Got your name on it?

665
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,199
We'll listen and get
it back to you soon.

666
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,704
Thanks. When Jerry
finds a moment. Good.

667
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:28,966
When will that be?

668
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,601
Uh...Actually,
you can try me tomorrow.

669
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,612
- Tomorrow?
- I might know something by then.

670
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,978
- Otherwise, Monday.
- Monday? Hmm.

671
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,609
What I might do
is just wait here awhile.

672
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,119
MaybeJerry will find a minute.

673
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,122
You're really
just wasting your time.

674
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,125
We won't know anything
till tomorrow at the earliest.

675
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:50,821
I don't mind.
I'm not wasting my time.

676
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:53,830
I'm glad to do it.
It's important to me.

677
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,832
- It'll probably be Monday.
- Monday?

678
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,333
Monday.

679
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,503
Well, I'll still wait.

680
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,507
Really, I don't mind.
It's O.K.

681
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,668
Tell you what.

682
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:08,405
Why don't you try me
tomorrow afternoon for sure?

683
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,414
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

684
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,416
- What time?
- 4:30.

685
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,917
4:30. I'll be here.

686
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,919
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

687
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:19,013
- And thankJerry. O.K.
- I will.

688
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,657

00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:39,415
but you should keep
developing your act.

868
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:41,747
Test it
in a few live situations.

869
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,253
That would be very good for you.

870
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:46,255
There are clubs you can try.

871
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:49,019
When you start working
in one of those, call.

872
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:51,391
We'll send someone
to see you. Promise.

873
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:52,554
Thanks.

874
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,598
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

875
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,732
May I ask you a question?

876
00:45:58,803 --> 00:45:59,827
Yes.

877
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,166
Are you speaking forJerry?

878
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,330
Yes, I am.

879
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:03,930
He has complete faith
in our judgment.

880
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:05,976
I'm sorry to have
to say this...

881
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,806
and don't take it personally...

882
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:10,745
but I don't have faith
in your judgment.

883
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:13,249
I'm sorry that
you feel that way...

884
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:15,080
but there's nothing
we can do about that.

885
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:17,552
I'm afraid I'll have to
disagree with you again.

886
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:19,555
Well, that's your privilege,
Mr. Pupkin.

887
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:20,647
Would you excuse me?

888
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,419
I have a great
many things to do.

889
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:24,859
Miss Long,
when willJerry be back?

890
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:28,262
Mr. Langford won't be in
until very late this afternoon.

891
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,765
We mean what we say...

892
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:32,268
when we thank you
for coming...

893
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,770
and we mean it when we say...

894
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:37,171
you can call
when you start working.

895
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,333
All right? Goodbye.

896
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,569
Goodbye.

897
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:01,689
Ahem.

898
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,001
Is there anyone else
you'd like to see?

899
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,973
No. That's all right.

900
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:14,476
I don't mind waiting.

901
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,478
Which reminds me about
the man who waited so long...

902
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,018
he forgot what
he was waiting for.

903
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:24,486
Well, would you mind
waiting outside, Mr. Pupnick?

904
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:28,491
This is a reception area
and not a waiting room.

905
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,493
I understand.

906
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,006
You asked him to leave?

907
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:46,008
Yeah, but he won't go.

908
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,806
- What's his name?
- Rupert Pumpkin.

909
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:51,976
- Hi.
- Hi.

910
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:56,008
I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security
for the Langford Organization.

911
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:57,519
Let's go outside and talk.

912
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:58,680
Is this your bag?

913
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,189
Yes. I'm waiting forJerry.

914
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:02,691
- We'll discuss that outside.
- I know he's expecting me.

915
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,194
Listen, we'll talk
about that outside.

916
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:06,627
Please take your bag.

917
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:10,633
I'll explain company policy
to you on the way, O.K.?

918
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:12,965
I'm pretty sure
you understand...

919
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:15,471
that we have
certain rules here...

920
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,635
that are essential to
the smooth functioning
of our operation, right?

921
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,972
Right.

922
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:22,979
Right. Good.
I can just say--

923
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:24,139
Just listen, please.

924
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,978
And that without these rules...

925
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,486
we really wouldn't be able
to function at our best.

926
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:30,645
You follow my point?

927
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:32,655
I get the point except--

928
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:33,815
Please, Mr. Puffer, please.

929
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:34,983
No. After you.

930
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,492
After you, sir, please.

931
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,994
If I could just say thatJerry's--

932
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:39,995
Just listen.

933
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:41,497
I checked with Miss Long.

934
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,499
You do not
have an appointment.

935
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,001
Now, company policy is that
only authorized personnel...

936
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,506
and those persons with official
business with our organization...

937
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,507
are permitted on our premises.

938
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:55,602
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

939
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:22,638
Well, did you get it to him?

940
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,401
What?

941
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,943
Did you get my letter to him?

942
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:28,774
He's not in there, O.K.?

943
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:32,509
Now that you're in with him,
you can't do me a favor?

944
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,983
Don't bother.
Just give me the letter.

945
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,520
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in.

946
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:39,886
- Who?
-Jerry.

947
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,652
He's up there.
Want to see him?

948
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:45,821
That's impossible, because
they assured me that he was out.

949
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,329
And you believed them?

950
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:50,299
You're so naive.
I would expect that from you.

951
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,699
You're so inexperienced.
You're such a chump.

952
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,670
He went up there just now?

953
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:56,330
Of course. Go back up.

954
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:57,738
Assert yourself a little bit.

955
00:49:57,808 --> 00:49:59,207
He's up there right now.

956
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,422
Would you tellJerry
I'm here to see him, please?

957
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:15,890
I'm sorry. He's not in.

958
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,859
I happen to know that he is.

959
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:19,327
I'm sorry. He's not in.

960
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:22,365
O.K., you're putting your job
on the line, lady.

961
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,129
Security...

962
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,669
You, too.

963
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,139
[Telephone Rings]

964
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:51,924
Mr. Pupkin,
what are you doing here?

965
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,121
Mr. Pupkin.

966
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:55,493
Mr. Pupkin.

967
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,057
Shelly, get security
on the telephone.

968
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,441
There he goes.

969
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:10,212
Aah! Hold on, right.

970
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,807
Grab his other arm.
Hold on to him, right.

971
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:15,818
All right.
Right out the door.

972
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:16,978
Come on.

973
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,749
You wouldn't listen, eh?

974
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,813
Jerry,Jerry!

975
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:22,415
Nobody's going to help you.

976
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:25,462
You're going to have a lot
of explaining to do, Mr. Wirtz.

977
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:26,996
You had your warning, Krupkin.

978
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:29,157
My lawyer will be calling you.

979
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:32,066
Make sure
he gets my name right.

980
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,468
Say goodbye to our guest,
Miss Long.

981
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,403
Wait tillJerry hears about this.

982
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:39,340
Don't worry. I will mention
your name toJerry.

983
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,902
Now listen good, because
if we see your face again...

984
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,174
I--I understand.

985
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:46,182
We're going to call the police.

986
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,239
Thank you.

987
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,877
Thank you very much. Ha ha.

988
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,887
- Terrific.
- Thank you.

989
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,150
I suppose you got
the letter to him.

990
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:55,589
No. I'll get it later.

991
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,991
When?
You just got thrown out.

992
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,825
I didn't get thrown out
of the building.

993
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:04,299
Excuse me. I wasn't getting
thrown out of the building.

994
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,892
You're a constant embarrassment.

995
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:08,233
They walked me outside.
Just a moment.

996
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,239
You can't handle
the simplest thing.

997
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:11,774
I'll tell you something else.

998
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,902
I'm going toJerry's for the weekend.
He invited me.

999
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:16,411
That's how much you know.

1000
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,448
Do I look O.K.?

1001
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:20,483
You look wonderful.

1002
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,018
Does this look all right?

1003
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:23,450
That, I'm not sure about...

1004
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,919
but you look wonderful.

1005
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:26,216
What do you mean?

1006
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,655
What's wrong with it?

1007
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,988
I don't think you need it.
That's all.

1008
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,994
You don't think it looks nice?

1009
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:33,529
No. It looks wonderful.

1010
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:51,739
Hello.

1011
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:53,146
Hello. You must beJonno.

1012
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,309
Yes.

1013
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:57,182
My name is Rupert Pupkin.
This is Rita Keene.

1014
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,119
LetJerry know
that we're here.

1015
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,180
Mr. Langford ask you to come?

1016
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:05,854
Oh, no. We just thought we'd
drop in uninvited for the weekend.

1017
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:07,396
Oh, what a view.

1018
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:08,863
The blue bag is mine.

1019
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:10,729
But Mr. Langford's not here.

1020
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,530
Where is he?
Out playing golf?

1021
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:13,831
Yes.

1022
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:15,997
I hope he's finally
going to break 1 00.

1023
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:17,267
1 00?

1024
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:19,468
Perhaps better you come back.

1025
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,771
We'll just wait.

1026
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:23,472
But Mr. Langford's not here.

1027
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:25,811
No. That's O.K.
We'll just wait.

1028
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:28,010
It's O.K.
We don't mind waiting.

1029
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:29,382
Is this lovely?

1030
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:36,025
The table's only set for one.

1031
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:43,599
How you like it?

1032
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,100
I could live here.

1033
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:48,069
Mr. Langford,
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

1034
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:49,901
Uh, what's wrong?
Everything's wrong.

1035
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:51,804
There a couple over here.

1036
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,400
His name is,
uh, uh, Pumpkin.

1037
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,447
Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

1038
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:03,181
So, didn't you tell him
what time we'd be getting here?

1039
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:06,188
We didn't have time
to iron out the details.

1040
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:09,157
Yeah, but that butler
wasn't even expecting us.

1041
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:12,127
Jerry has more important
things to think about...

1042
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:14,595
than what he's going to
tell his houseboy.

1043
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,633
Oh, really?
Well, excuse me.

1044
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:22,429
He knows everything.

1045
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,974
He knows you're playing golf
and everything.

1046
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:27,840
He want to spend
a weekend over here.

1047
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,402
Yes, and you better come back.

1048
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,879
He's, uh,
he's touching everything.

1049
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:33,280
He's ruining the house.

1050
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,818
Hey, I'm getting
a heart attack already.

1051
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:37,285
Here's a famous one...

1052
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:40,187
with the youngest clown
in the world--Zippo.

1053
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:43,886
Remember this one with
Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

1054
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,191
- That's famous.
- I know.

1055
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:49,494
Here's a famous one when
he was a kid, 1 2 years old.

1056
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:50,965
Someone sent this in.

1057
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:54,094
It was part of the show--
""I knew you when'' section.

1058
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:56,639
Someone sent that in as a joke.

1059
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:59,676
Jerry shows it
to everyone on the show.

1060
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:04,339
If I should take a notion...

1061
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:07,281
Let's get a little life
in this place.

1062
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:08,841
It's like a funeral parlor.

1063
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,251
Rita, you should
really turn that off.

1064
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:14,256
You shouldn't put that on now.
It's not polite.

1065
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:16,053
How about a spin, handsome?

1066
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:18,560
I can't really dance
in the house.

1067
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:20,460
A little fun
never hurt anybody.

1068
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,963
What ifJerry walks in?

1069
00:55:22,032 --> 00:55:25,593
He'll be happy to see us
having a good time.

1070
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:28,661
You're his friend.
He won't mind.

1071
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,403
Ain't nobody's business
if I do

1072
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:36,543
Oh, one day...

1073
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,480
Wonder what the rest
of this place is like.

1074
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:42,245
Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

1075
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,152
Oh, that--no, Rita.
I wouldn't go up there.

1076
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:49,784
Rita, Rita, Rita,
I don't think it's a good idea.

1077
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,986
Rita.

1078
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,028
They're watching us.

1079
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:54,655
You don't have the right
to go upstairs.

1080
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,255
Rita, please don't go.

1081
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,269
[Doorbell Chimes]

1082
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:07,773
You going to open
the goddamn door?

1083
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:08,833
Mr. Langford.

1084
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,345
Standing out there eight minutes.

1085
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,678
What was with the door?
Jesus.

1086
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:14,046
Where are they?

1087
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,585
I was going to call the police.

1088
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:19,747
Hi,Jerry. Hi,Jerry.
How are you?

1089
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:21,757
We were just
freshening up upstairs.

1090
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:24,760
Rita, I want you to meet
the Jerry Langford.

1091
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:27,695
Jerry, I want you
to meet the Rita Keene.

1092
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:28,788
Come on down.

1093
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:31,629
That a girl.
Come on down.

1094
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:33,533
What's your pleasure,Jerry?

1095
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:38,373
It's kind of hot out there.

1096
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,239
I want something nice to drink.

1097
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,301
Jerry, what would you like?

1098
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:46,112
Jerry.

1099
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:49,516
Excuse us for taking the liberty,
but it's not every day...

1100
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:53,044
that a girl like Rita
meets a man like you.

1101
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:56,092
This is part of your success.
What can you do?

1102
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,626
How was your golf game?

1103
00:56:57,694 --> 00:56:59,127
Did you finally break 1 00?

1104
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,323
[Jonno] I told them
you were not here.

1105
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:02,626
[Rita] That's right. He did.

1106
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:05,167
They did,Jerry.
They were very helpful.

1107
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:08,864
We took an earlier train
because there wasn't
anything until after 1 :00.

1108
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:12,102
Anyway, I brought the work.
It's right here...

1109
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,439
all ready and set to go.

1110
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:15,978
So...

1111
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:19,876
where is everybody?

1112
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,383
What everybody?

1113
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,885
What everybody?
The guests,Jer.

1114
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,355
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

1115
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,824
You know I could
have you arrested?

1116
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:32,726
Ha ha ha.
He could have us arrested.

1117
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:37,199
Of course. There's no way that
we can prove that we belong here.

1118
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:40,293
When he comes up with an idea,
he's terrific.

1119
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,270
Really?
I never thought of that.

1120
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:43,772
You should have.

1121
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,740
We could set up a story...

1122
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:48,801
where you invite your friends
out for the weekend...

1123
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:52,280
and you throw them all in jail.
Ha ha ha.

1124
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:55,978
That's terrific.
That's terrific.

1125
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:58,350
What's the matter?
Lighten up.

1126
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:00,855
Let's work on that
after we work on this.

1127
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:02,357
How did you get here?

1128
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:04,791
Walked in the door.
What do you mean?

1129
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,226
What's the matter with you?

1130
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:07,695
How did you get here?

1131
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:09,493
I think you're upset.

1132
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,625
I'm going to leave
my material here.

1133
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:12,895
We'll talk later.

1134
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,437
You've got more important
things to worry about.

1135
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:17,473
We'll take a stroll
until lunchtime.

1136
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,408
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a moron?

1137
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:23,378
You know,Jerry,
I want to tell you something.

1138
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:24,913
Ordinarily,
I wouldn't allow anyone...

1139
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:26,881
to speak that way about Rita...

1140
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:29,578
but since it's you,
I know you're only kidding.

1141
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:31,086
He's a real character.

1142
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:32,815
Rupert.

1143
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:34,720
He's saying he wants us to go.

1144
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,156
No. He's not saying that.

1145
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:38,456
Jerry, tell her
you're not saying that.

1146
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:39,859
He's not saying that at all.

1147
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,329
Call the station,Jonno.

1148
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:42,990
Where you going, Rita?

1149
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:45,296
There'll be a cab here
in 1 0 minutes.

1150
00:58:45,368 --> 00:58:47,199
I'd appreciate if you'd use it.

1151
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,704
Why? You going someplace?

1152
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:51,138
You are.

1153
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:54,509
Did I say something wrong?

1154
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:55,875
'Cause if I did...

1155
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:58,380
could we chalk it up
to inexperience.

1156
00:58:58,448 --> 00:58:59,972
Rita?

1157
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,517
I have my stuff right here.

1158
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:05,077
We could do it
in a half an hour at the most.

1159
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:06,952
You'd have the afternoon
to yourself.

1160
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:08,957
I want you out of here.

1161
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:11,585
I want you out of here now.

1162
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,185
Is that plain enough?

1163
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,197
- I understand.
- Is that clear?

1164
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:16,823
Yeah, yeah,Jerry,
I understand.

1165
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,367
Look, you're tired.
That's O.K.

1166
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:20,460
I'm going to leave the stuff here.

1167
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,698
Let me know what you think.

1168
00:59:22,772 --> 00:59:24,239
Rupert, don't be so dopey.

1169
00:59:24,307 --> 00:59:26,207
The man is telling us to go.

1170
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:28,210
He's not.
Will you stop that?

1171
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,542
Mr. Langford,
I want you to know...

1172
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:31,979
Tell her she's wrong.

1173
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:34,482
I don't even know this guy.

1174
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,712
He told me you were friends.

1175
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:38,947
- Rita, Rita!
- I feel terrible about this.

1176
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:40,284
I'm so humiliated.

1177
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,086
If there's anything I can do
to make this up to you...

1178
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:45,093
Don't listen to her.
She wants to spoil everything.

1179
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,685
Come on, Rupert.
Let's go.

1180
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:48,094
Jerry--

1181
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,132
O.K., come on. Come on.

1182
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,395
Come on. Let's go.

1183
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:54,494
Sorry, Mr. Langford.

1184
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:55,970
Do you understand English?

1185
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,336
Take your things and go!

1186
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,672
I just want you
to listen to my stuff.

1187
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:02,177
Is that asking too much?

1188
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:04,770
Yes, it is.
I have a life, O.K.?

1189
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:06,315
I have a life, too.

1190
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:07,782
That's not my responsibility.

1191
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,819
It is when you tell me
to call you...

1192
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:12,480
I told you to call
to get rid of you!

1193
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:14,216
- To get rid of me?
- That's right.

1194
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:15,519
I can take a hint.

1195
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:17,287
If I didn't tell you that...

1196
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,089
we'd still be
at my apartment!

1197
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,527
So I made a mistake!

1198
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:22,087
So did Hitler!

1199
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:25,999
All right. This is the way it is
when you're famous.

1200
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:27,502
Do you understand now?

1201
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,094
That's how you guys are?

1202
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:30,503
No, not them. Me, yeah.

1203
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:33,565
That's how you are
when you reach the top?

1204
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,042
I was that way before.

1205
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:37,477
Now I know how
people like you are.

1206
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:38,980
Goodbye and good luck.

1207
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:40,914
And Jerry,Jerry...

1208
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:44,010
I just want to say
one more thing,Jerry.

1209
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,578
I'm glad what you did
to me today...

1210
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:49,216
because now I know
I can't rely on anybody.

1211
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:50,816

1385
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:49,895
I'm very pleased with it.

1386
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:51,194
The color's great.

1387
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:55,101
I like to see him
a little more casual for a change.

1388
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:58,538
This is a look
I like to see on him.

1389
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:00,007
Not so uptight.
Not so...

1390
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,010
I got to get started here.

1391
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:03,272
It's wonderful.
It's very good.

1392
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:05,837
- Be honest with me.
- I'm being honest.

1393
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,246
Would you wear it?

1394
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:10,410
I like it. I'm so glad
I went with red.

1395
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,420
It looks so good on him.

1396
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:14,388
It looks good,Jerry.

1397
01:10:14,457 --> 01:10:16,925
- Come on.
- What?

1398
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:18,722
Take it off and let's go.

1399
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:19,726
Oh, O.K., fine.

1400
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:22,127
You want me to take it off?

1401
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:23,256
Yeah.

1402
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:25,596
Can't he wear it
for a little while?

1403
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:27,602
Will you take it off,
please?

1404
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,467
I know he's in a meeting.

1405
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:33,441
This is an emergency,
and I've got to talk to him.

1406
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:37,377
You'll interrupt him or I'll come
busting into that meeting.

1407
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,506
No. Forget calling me back.
I'm on my way.

1408
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,711
Why didn't you
just listen to the tape?

1409
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,219
It wasn't that hard...

1410
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:48,280
a few minutes of your time
to listen to something...

1411
01:10:48,357 --> 01:10:50,791
that I worked
on my whole life.

1412
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,293
Let's go to my office...

1413
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:55,296
and we'll play
the tape right now.

1414
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:58,390
Do you know what would
happen if I went there?

1415
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,900
You know, I'm not stupid.

1416
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,402
Nobody's calling you stupid.

1417
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,802
You pulled this off.
That makes you smart.

1418
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:07,274
You know,Jerry,
I'm going to tell you something.

1419
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:09,277
Friendship is a two-way street.

1420
01:11:09,345 --> 01:11:12,610
Do you know that?

1421
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,116
And you couldn't
care less about me.

1422
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:16,617
Am I holding this
till next Shavuot?

1423
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:18,620
You going to make
some decisions?

1424
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:21,953
You going to knock off the talking
for two minutes?

1425
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:23,958
You put the sweater on him.

1426
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:25,584
Yeah. It took one minute.

1427
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,095
- You have a long night
ahead of you.
- I have something to say.

1428
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:29,597
You've got enough to say.

1429
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:31,098
- You're driving me nuts.
-Just a minute.

1430
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,601
Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute...

1431
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:36,729
and let me rest
with this gun?

1432
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:38,740
You're driving me crazy!

1433
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:41,242
You haven't shut up
since we've walked in.

1434
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,108
This is my house.
This is my domain.

1435
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,671
Jerry is my guest,
and you're my guest.

1436
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:48,182
And you're lucky to be here.

1437
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,683
You change in my house.

1438
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:53,188
You get to get your head together
for the show tonight.

1439
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:54,654
Give me a little break.

1440
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:57,158
-Shut up.
- Why don't you shut up?

1441
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,524
I listened to you
talk about that sweater.

1442
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:01,426
Worrying about the sleeves,
the color.

1443
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:02,930
Did I say anything?

1444
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,432
I made it forJerry...

1445
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,661
and it looks
fabulous on him.

1446
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:08,169
Whose idea was this anyway?

1447
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:11,673
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't even be here.

1448
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:15,199
Why didn't you just listen
to the tape when I asked?

1449
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,074
I'm sure you can understand.

1450
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:20,582
Doing the kind of show I'm doing,
it's mind-boggling.

1451
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,084
There's so much stuff
that comes down...

1452
01:12:23,152 --> 01:12:25,848
you can't keep
your head clear.

1453
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,355
And if that's the case,
I'm wrong.

1454
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:29,789
You're right.
I'm wrong.

1455
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,292
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

1456
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,294
I'm just a human being...

1457
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:36,798
with all of the foibles
and all of the traps...

1458
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,299
the show,
the pressure...

1459
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,800
the groupies,
the autograph hounds...

1460
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:41,302
the crew,
the incompetence...

1461
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,305
those behind-the-scenes
you think are your friends.

1462
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:46,807
You're not sure if you'll
be there tomorrow...

1463
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:48,309
because of their incompetence.

1464
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:50,311
There are wonderful pressures
that make every day...

1465
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:52,939
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

1466
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,573
It's terrific.

1467
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,517
O.K., if all of
that means nothing...

1468
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,020
if I'm wrong,
in spite of all that...

1469
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,488
then I apologize.

1470
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:02,649
I'm sorry.

1471
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:05,216
If you accept my apology...

1472
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:07,159
I think we should shake hands.

1473
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,662
We'll forget the whole thing.

1474
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:10,164
I won't press charges.

1475
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:12,166
You could be
in deep trouble...

1476
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:16,534
but I will not
press charges.

1477
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:18,732
That's easy for you to say.

1478
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:20,241
But I mean it.

1479
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:21,742
I'll go to the office...

1480
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:24,245
and tell them all it's a gag.

1481
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:25,746
They'll understand that.

1482
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:27,510
If I tell them, they'll buy it.

1483
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,448
Then we'll put the tape on.

1484
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:32,214
Sit down.
I said, ""sit down.''

1485
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:33,619
You heard what he said.

1486
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:36,783
With a gun on him,
he wants to be friends.

1487
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:39,293
What happens
when he walks out the door?

1488
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,556
What happens then,Jerry?

1489
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,860
You get to his office,
and they jump you.

1490
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:45,400
Is that what happens,Jerry?

1491
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:47,902
Not if I tell them not to.

1492
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,904
No one's going to jump you.

1493
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,532
If I tell them to,
they do it.

1494
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:54,542
No one's going to jump you.

1495
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:57,807
Now, that's the truth.
Take my word for it.

1496
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,815
If you think
I'm not telling you the truth...

1497
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:02,316
then don't respond.

1498
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:05,615
If I'm telling the truth,
let me out of here.

1499
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:07,656
He gives me his word.

1500
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:08,815
And what else?

1501
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:10,552
And what else,Jerry?

1502
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:16,394
There is nothing else,
just my word.

1503
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,831
Now, isn't my word
good enough?

1504
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:23,537
I'm sorry,Jerry.

1505
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:42,555
Suppose we tape him,
he doesn't talk...

1506
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,490
it gets to be 1 1 :30...

1507
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,994
do we put him on
no matter what?

1508
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:48,495
Go ahead and tape him.

1509
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:49,997
It won't hurt anything.

1510
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:51,293
You can always erase it.

1511
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,301
We may learn
something from it...

1512
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,098
and it'll also buy us time.

1513
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:56,604
But under no circumstances...

1514
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,970
will we put this man
on the air.

1515
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,508
This lunatic
is threatening Jerry.

1516
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:02,669
You're not putting him
on the air?

1517
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:04,474
Gentlemen,
let's not get excited.

1518
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:05,912
I don't think you understand.

1519
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:07,414
We'll tape at 7:00.

1520
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:09,417
We won't have
to make a decision...

1521
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:11,783
about putting him
on the air till 1 1 :30.

1522
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:14,288
This gives us
four hours to move in.

1523
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:15,789
Hopefully, by that time...

1524
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:18,326
we'll have your
Mr. Langford back safely.

1525
01:15:18,394 --> 01:15:19,884
Harry, that's it.
We're suing.

1526
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:21,862
We're going to sue everybody.

1527
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,489
Who is this man?

1528
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:25,056
Jerry's lawyer.
That's who he is.

1529
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,601
Who am I?

1530
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:28,864
I'm the one who's suing.
I'm the lawyer.

1531
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:29,870
Jay.

1532
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:31,406
Don'tJay me, please.

1533
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,907
Jay, who are you
going to sue?

1534
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,409
We're suing you personally.

1535
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:36,910
Who else are you're suing?

1536
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:38,139
The FBI.

1537
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:39,647
We have a serious situation.

1538
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:41,615
I want it dealt with rationally.

1539
01:15:41,684 --> 01:15:43,117
Unless we start talking politely...

1540
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,278
there's going to be
serious consequences.

1541
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,652
There's nothing polite
about kidnapping.

1542
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:50,658
It's one of the most
stupid offenses ever created.

1543
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:52,159
Where's the defense
of kidnapping?

1544
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:54,696
How can you say,
""I was crazy,''

1545
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:57,197
""I didn't know
what I was doing,''

1546
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,734
- "I did on the spur
of the moment'?
- Who cares? Who cares?

1547
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:01,667
Only an idiot kidnaps...

1548
01:16:01,737 --> 01:16:03,967
and decides to do
what you're doing.

1549
01:16:13,616 --> 01:16:15,880
Jerry, I'm going to go now.

1550
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:18,385
Pretty soon,
you'll be able to go...

1551
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:19,887
about 1 2:00 as I said.

1552
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:22,150
Have a good time.

1553
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:24,556
I know you will.

1554
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:25,855
Bye.

1555
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:32,200
First of all,
we don't know...

1556
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:34,236
whether we're dealing
with kidnappers or terrorists.

1557
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:35,463
Terrorists?
Terrorists?

1558
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:38,005
You might have this man
go on the air...

1559
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:39,472
deliver a coded message...

1560
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,475
and very possibly 50 people...

1561
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:43,875
around the country
would lose their lives.

1562
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:45,914
You're out of your mind.

1563
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:47,414
I'm not out of my mind.

1564
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:48,916
That guy will be taped.

1565
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,918
We'll listen to what he says.

1566
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,420
And unless something horrendous
is on that tape...

1567
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:55,719
we'll put that tape
on the air.

1568
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,225
Because all we're dealing
with is 1 0 minutes...

1569
01:16:58,294 --> 01:17:00,728
of talk show time
against a man's life.

1570
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:03,230
And I don't see that
as any argument.

1571
01:17:03,299 --> 01:17:06,291
Hello. How are you today?

1572
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:07,630
Well, I'm calling--

1573
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:11,298
Mr. King calling collect
long-distance for Mr. Thomas.

1574
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:14,570
Mr. Thomas,
there's a long-distance call.

1575
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:17,111
Let's go.
This is it.

1576
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,272
Remember.
Keep him talking.

1577
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,873
Uh, hi there.
Who is this?

1578
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:23,316
This is Mr. King.

1579
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:24,818
I'm calling for Mr. King.

1580
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,821
Well, you're right on time.

1581
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,322
Yes. Of course.

1582
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,823
We're always punctual.

1583
01:17:29,892 --> 01:17:31,189
We're fine. Thank you.

1584
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,194
I want to make it brief--

1585
01:17:33,262 --> 01:17:35,287
Could I break in and ask...

1586
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,127
could I speak toJerry?

1587
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,632
Jerry's not with us now.

1588
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:40,134
We're at a pay phone.

1589
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:42,534
So, don't try
and have the call traced...

1590
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:44,037
which I noticed you did.

1591
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:46,540
It's kind of important,
you know...

1592
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,668
so that we know that
he's in your care.

1593
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:52,179
We're bringing along
an article of clothing...

1594
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:53,544
that I know you'll recognize.

1595
01:17:53,615 --> 01:17:55,549
It will be satisfactory
to everyone.

1596
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:58,051
It's not as easy as you think...

1597
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,145
just to walk in the studio--

1598
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,656
No, Bert,
if I could call you--

1599
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:06,092
Well, if I could just say,
there is no problem.

1600
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:07,651
The material is clean material.

1601
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,664
Do you know
standards and practices?

1602
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,791
No. But that can be discussed.

1603
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,301
Now, all I can say is...

1604
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,803
don't have any press leaks.

1605
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:19,739
You must keep the audience
there until 1 1 :45 or 1 2:00...

1606
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:21,639
after it has been
aired nationally.

1607
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,736
Thank you.
We'll discuss the other things.

1608
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,246
Nice talking to you.

1609
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:27,407
One--

1610
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:31,652
Boy, he's shrewd.

1611
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,211
He just, uh,
wouldn't buy anything.

1612
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:34,440
I feel completely
impulsive tonight.

1613
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:36,643
Anything could happen.

1614
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,152
I have so much to tell you.

1615
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,155
I don't know
where to start.

1616
01:19:41,223 --> 01:19:43,657
I want to tell you
everything about myself...

1617
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:46,956
everything you don't know.

1618
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:49,725
Do you like these glasses?

1619
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:50,992
Crystal. Beautiful.

1620
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:53,000
I bought them just for you.

1621
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:54,501
There's something about them...

1622
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,003
the simplicity of them.

1623
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,504
If you don't like them...

1624
01:19:57,573 --> 01:20:00,542
if there's a doubt
in your mind...

1625
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,042
[Glass Shatters]

1626
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:08,382
You know,
sometimes during the day...

1627
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,883
I'll do the simplest things.

1628
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:13,388
I'll be taking a bath
and I say to myself...

1629
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:16,390
""I wonder ifJerry's
taking a bath right now?''

1630
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,891
And I just hope...

1631
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,894
that you're not drowning
or something.

1632
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,896
I get really worried about you...

1633
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:24,524
like something terrible
is going to happen.

1634
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,033
I have these daydreams...

1635
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:28,194
like I'm with you
at the golf course...

1636
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,703
driving your cart...

1637
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:32,968
just driving around.

1638
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,805
Need a putter,Jer,
you know?

1639
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,311
Need an iron?

1640
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,847
I don't even know
how to play golf.

1641
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,849
I played with my parents once...

1642
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:45,614
but, uh, but I love you.

1643
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:53,260
I never told my parents
that I love them.

1644
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:56,263
They never told me
that they loved me either...

1645
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:57,764
which was fine with me.

1646
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,358
But I love you.

1647
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:04,166
You want some wine?
No, O.K.

1648
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,106
I'm not in the mood to drink
either, though.

1649
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:10,111
I'm in the mood to
be alone with you.

1650
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:16,415
Why don't we just
clear off the table?

1651
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:18,043
I was thinking...

1652
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,553
why don't we go upstairs?

1653
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,555
But that's so predictable.

1654
01:21:21,623 --> 01:21:24,057
Let's just take
everything off the table...

1655
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:25,684
and do it right here.

1656
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,194
That would blow your mind.

1657
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,695
It would blow my mind.

1658
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,698
I've never done
anything like that.

1659
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:33,200
I never even had anybody
over for dinner.

1660
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,463
Let alone,
made love on the table.

1661
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:36,970
I want to do that.

1662
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:38,472
I just want to dance.

1663
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,008
I want to, like,
put on some Shirelles.

1664
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:44,011
I want to be black.

1665
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:47,242
Wouldn't that be insane?

1666
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,944
God,you know
who I wish was tonight?

1667
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,679
I wish I was Tina Turner...

1668
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:54,017
just dancing
through the room.

1669
01:21:54,089 --> 01:21:55,920
Ooh ooh

1670
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,361
Thank you. Thank you.

1671
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,830
Please have
your tickets ready.

1672
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,536
Good evening, Officer.

1673
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:11,038
My name is Clarence McCabe.

1674
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,539
Are these people with you?

1675
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,041
Yes. This is my wife.

1676
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:16,043
And these are her parents...

1677
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:18,136
the Saunders
from Cleveland, Ohio.

1678
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,976
I'll check your name, sir.

1679
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:22,107
I'm going to be on third.

1680
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:24,812
I'll check your name, sir.

1681
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:26,319
I'm sorry, sir.

1682
01:22:26,388 --> 01:22:28,117
I don't see your name, sir.

1683
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:30,158
You just went pass the N's.

1684
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:31,783
I'll go back again, sir.

1685
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,623
Here it is again, sir.

1686
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:35,128
Let me just check.

1687
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:37,495
No. This is impossible.

1688
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:39,966
Did Miss Long call you at all?

1689
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:41,525
No, sir, she didn't.

1690
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:44,265
She didn't tell you
about my book?

1691
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:45,829
Listen, I follow this list.

1692
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:48,398
She told me
to present myself at 5:45.

1693
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:49,944
It's now 5:50.

1694
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,707
I've only got 1 0 minutes.

1695
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,714
Only authorized personnel
allowed in here.

1696
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:55,215
That's the rules
and regulations.

1697
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:57,411
You never heard
of the book?

1698
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,922
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

1699
01:23:00,989 --> 01:23:01,978
Well, can I call Miss Long?

1700
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:03,991
You cannot call
Miss Long at all, sir.

1701
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,492
Can you call Miss Long?

1702
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,425
Your name isn't on the list.

1703
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:08,929
I cannot let you in.

1704
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:11,090
That's the rules of the place.

1705
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,758
I'm going to try to get her.

1706
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:14,028
Stop him.

1707
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:15,831
Miss Long.

1708
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:17,030
Hold on.

1709
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:18,538
Let go of me.

1710
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:21,303
Let go of me.

1711
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:43,996
What is this Clarence McCabe?

1712
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,499
That's who I am.

1713
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,000
Is that your real name?

1714
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,833
Well, technically,
it's my real name.

1715
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:52,135
No, it's a pseudonym,
an alias.

1716
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,141
Why did you use
the pseudonym?

1717
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:55,801
I'm an author.
That's my business.

1718
01:23:55,877 --> 01:23:57,310
Author of what?

1719
01:23:57,379 --> 01:24:00,507
I wrote a book called
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

1720
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,516
I spent two years in Russia...

1721
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,018
two years in China
researching that thing.

1722
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,054
Russia? China?

1723
01:24:06,121 --> 01:24:07,782
Does that make me
a Communist?

1724
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:19,193
Up in control, we have
one more light to pre-set.

1725
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,497
Hello. I'm the king.

1726
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,764
What?

1727
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,305
The king.

1728
01:24:24,373 --> 01:24:26,807
What can I do
for Your Highness?

1729
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,672

Well, Mr. Pumpkin,
are you going to tell us...

01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,781
whereJerry Langford
is or not?

1766
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:49,180
Are you from the show?

1767
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,718
I'm not from the show.

1768
01:26:50,785 --> 01:26:52,719
This is my assistant
Agent Giardello.

1769
01:26:52,787 --> 01:26:55,255
This is Captain Burke

I'd like to meet
someone from the show.

1771
01:26:57,559 --> 01:26:58,992
You don't see anyone...

1772
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,051
until I get to see Langford.

1773
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:03,563
I'd like to see
someone from the show.

1774
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:06,567
You won't see someone unless
you tell us where Langford is.

1775
01:27:06,635 --> 01:27:09,934
Well, then Jerry Langford is dead.

1776
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:11,404
Get Thomas.

Are you Mr. King?

1778
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:18,278
Yes. How do you do?

1779
01:27:18,346 --> 01:27:20,280
Did we talk
on the phone today?

1780
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:22,282
We spoke a few moments ago.

1781
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,375
Then Jerry spoke
to you earlier.

1782
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:27,387
Where did you get this?

1783
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:30,618
That's Jerry's as you can see.

1784
01:27:30,692 --> 01:27:33,752
- What's that?
- That's my blood, notJerry's.

1785
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:35,159
I'll buy this.

1786

01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:38,465
Now, this is
my introduction...

1788
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:41,764
I'd like Mr. Randall
to speak it word for word.

1789
01:27:41,836 --> 01:27:44,270
This is Randall's introduction
to your monologue?

1790
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:46,432
Could I have a copy
of your monologue?

1791
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:48,669
Well, actually,
I have it memorized.

1792
01:27:48,743 --> 01:27:50,074
So, I don't have--

1793
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:52,807
There are reasons
that I need a copy.

1794
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:57,250
We have to make sure
we don't say anything obscene.

1795
01:27:57,319 --> 01:27:58,752
No. It's all right. Really.

1796
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,583
Yeah. It's a wholesome monologue.

1797
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:03,715
- You guarantee that?
- I guarantee it.

1798
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:06,488

lasts till 1 1 :30.

01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,597
Nice meeting you.

1801
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:12,997
Sit down, Pupkin.

1802
01:28:13,068 --> 01:28:15,502
Mr. Pupkin,
I got to tell you this.

1803
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:16,901
From this point on...

1804
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:19,031
you have the right
to remain silent...

1805
01:28:19,107 --> 01:28:23,134
'cause anything you say
from here on out might be used...

1806
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:25,736
- against you later on
in a court of law.
- I'm aware of that.

1807
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:27,247
Say you understand.

1808
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,748
I understand that.

1809
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:32,548
Did you participate in
the abduction ofJerry Langford?

1810
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:34,521
Yes, I did.
I abducted him.

1811
01:28:34,589 --> 01:28:36,022
You abducted him?

1812
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:37,183
Yes.

1813
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:40,022
Do you know where
Mr. Langford is right now?

1814
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:42,029
Will you lead us
to Mr. Langford?

1815
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:43,564
No, I won't.

1816
01:28:43,632 --> 01:28:45,566
Well, at this time,
Mr. Pupkin...

1817
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,067
I want to advise you...

1818
01:28:47,135 --> 01:28:49,103
to consider yourself under arrest.

1819
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:51,798
Fine. I think
I should get made up.

1820
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:53,773
You need some makeup.

in your face.

out of my head.

01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,891
I think we'd better go.

1905
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:07,325
I don't like
to say it like this...

1906
01:33:07,395 --> 01:33:09,158
butJerry's going to be
unavailable.

1907
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:10,663
You'll understand when we go.

1908
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:12,165
I'll understand?
Why will I understand?

1909
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:13,723
Where are we going?

1910
01:33:14,969 --> 01:33:16,402
That's part of the bargain.

1911
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,405
I want to see it
somewhere else--

1912
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:19,906
Part of what bargain?

1913
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:21,407
Well, that's my understanding.

1914
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,411
I just want to see it
in this other place.

1915
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,414
Once I see it,
I'll give you Langford.

1916
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:28,915
You don't understand
my position.

1917
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:30,416
I have you right now.

1918
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:33,420
Having you,
I have a shot at Langford.

1919
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:34,921
But you don't haveJerry.

1920
01:33:34,989 --> 01:33:36,479
I understand that.

1921
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:39,526
I'm doing this as fast as I can.

1922
01:33:39,594 --> 01:33:40,686
Good, Masha.

1923
01:33:40,762 --> 01:33:41,854
Yeah?

1924
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:43,022
Good.

1925
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:44,530
You all right?

1926
01:33:44,599 --> 01:33:45,691
I'm fine.

1927
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:48,668
I know you are.

1928
01:33:48,736 --> 01:33:50,169
All right. Come on.

1929
01:33:55,877 --> 01:33:56,969
Let's go.

1930
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:58,478
Oh, one more thing.

1931

I can't walk in here with you.

1932
01:34:01,049 --> 01:34:02,482

1933
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,984
and let me walk in by myself.

1934
01:34:05,053 --> 01:34:08,420
I'll break your ankles
if you make a wrong move.

1935
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:09,922
O.K., I promise, O.K.?

1936
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:12,425

you don't know me, too.

1937
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:13,892

Rupert Pupkin.!

1970
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:10,810
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1971
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:12,311
Let me introduce myself.

1972
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,813
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1973
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:18,181
I was born
in Clifton, NewJersey...

1974
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,311
which was not at that time
a federal offense.

1975
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:21,480
[Laughter]

1976
01:36:21,556 --> 01:36:23,990
Is there anyone here
from Clifton?

1977
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:25,150
[No Response]

1978
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:28,161
Oh, good.
We can all relax$ now.

1979
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:30,163
I'd like to begin by saying...

1980
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:33,667
my parents were too poor
to afford me a childhood.

1981
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:35,167
But the fact is that...

1982
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:38,672
no one is allowed to be
too poor in Clifton.

1983
01:36:38,739 --> 01:36:41,173
Once you fall
below a certain level...

1984
01:36:41,242 --> 01:36:43,176
they ex$ile you to Passaic.

1985
01:36:43,244 --> 01:36:44,677
[Laughter And Applause]

1986
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:48,014
My parents did put...

1987
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,516
the first two down payments
on my childhood.

1988
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:53,520
Don't get me wrong,
but they did also...

1989
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:56,523
return me to the hospital
as defective.

1990
01:36:58,593 --> 01:37:00,026
But, like everyone else...

1991
01:37:00,094 --> 01:37:04,030
I grew up in large part
thanks to my mother.

1992
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:05,963
If she were only here today...

1993
01:37:06,033 --> 01:37:08,968
I'd say, "Hey, ma,
what are you doing here?

1994
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:11,470
You've been dead
for nine years.!'

1995
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:15,975
But seriously,
you should've seen my mother.

1996
01:37:16,043 --> 01:37:17,476
She was wonderful.

1997
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:21,481
Blonde, beautiful,
intelligent, alcoholic.

1998
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:24,484
We used to drink milk
together after school.

1999
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:27,146
Mine was homogenized.
Hers was loaded.

2000
01:37:28,556 --> 01:37:30,990
Once they picked her up
for speeding.

2001
01:37:31,058 --> 01:37:32,491
They clocked her doing 50.

2002
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,994
All right,
but in our garage?

2003
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:36,654
[Applause]

2004
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:41,500
And when they tested her...

2005
01:37:41,569 --> 01:37:44,504
they found out that
her alcohol had 2% blood.

2006
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:52,512
Ah, but we used tojoke together,
mom and me...

2007
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:55,515
until the tears
would stroll down her face..

2008
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:57,517
and she would throw up.!

2009
01:37:57,585 --> 01:37:59,519
Yeah, and who would
clean it up?

2010
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:03,023
Not dad. He was too busy
down at O'Grady's...

2011
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,024
throwing up on his own.

2012
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:06,116
Yeah.

2013
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:08,128
In fact, until I was 1 6...

2014
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:11,632
I thought throwing up
was a sign of maturity.

2015
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,132
While the other kids...

2016
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:16,136
were off in the woods
sneaking cigarettes...

2017
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:18,138
I was hiding
behind the house...

2018
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:20,640
with my fingers
down my throat.

2019
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:26,479
The only problem was
I never got anywhere...

2020
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:29,482
until one day
my father caught me.

2021
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,984
Just as he was giving me...

2022
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:34,988
a final kick in the stomach
for luck...

2023
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:38,492
I managed to heave
all over his new shoes.!

2024
01:38:38,559 --> 01:38:39,992
"That's it, 'I thought.

2025

"I've made it.
I'm finally a man.!'

[Audience Applauds Wildly]

2027
01:38:50,571 --> 01:38:53,506
But as it turned out,
I was wrong.

2028
01:38:53,574 --> 01:38:57,010
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

2029
01:38:57,078 --> 01:38:59,512
Yeah, he was usually too busy...

2030
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,516
out in the park playing ball
with my sister Rose.

2031
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:05,449
But today, I must say...

2032
01:39:05,519 --> 01:39:07,953
thanks to those many hours
of practice...

2033
01:39:08,022 --> 01:39:11,014
my sister Rose has grown
into a fine man.

2034
01:39:16,497 --> 01:39:19,125
Me, I wasn't especially
interested in athletics.

2035
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,134
The only ex$ercise I ever got...

2036
01:39:21,202 --> 01:39:23,136
was when the other kids
picked on me.

2037
01:39:23,204 --> 01:39:25,138
Yeah, they used to
beat me up once a week...

2038
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:26,298
usually Tuesday.

2039
01:39:26,374 --> 01:39:28,308
And after a while...

2040
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:30,810
the school worked it
into the curriculum.

2041
01:39:30,878 --> 01:39:34,974
And if you knocked me out,
you got ex$tra credit.

2042
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:38,984
There was this one kid,
poor kid...

2043
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:40,486
he was afraid of me.

2044
01:39:40,554 --> 01:39:41,987
I used to tell him...

2045
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:44,217
"Hit me, hit me.
What's the matter with you?

2046

Don't you want to graduate?'

2047
01:39:50,564 --> 01:39:52,998
Hey, I was the youngest kid...

2048
01:39:53,067 --> 01:39:55,001
in the history of the school...

2049
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:56,502
to graduate in traction.

2050
01:39:58,572 --> 01:40:01,006
But,you know,
my only real interest...

2051
01:40:01,075 --> 01:40:03,509
right from the beginning,
was show business.

2052
01:40:03,577 --> 01:40:07,513
Even as a young man,
I began at the very top--

2053
01:40:07,581 --> 01:40:09,014
collecting autographs.

2054
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:15,522

are probably wondering...

2055
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:18,023
whyJerry isn't with us tonight.

2056
01:40:18,092 --> 01:40:19,525
Well, I'll tell you.

2057
01:40:19,593 --> 01:40:21,527
The fact is he's tied up.

2058
01:40:21,595 --> 01:40:24,029
I'm the one who tied him.

2059
01:40:24,098 --> 01:40:27,033
Well, I know you think
I'm joking...

2060
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,535
but, believe me,
that's the only way...

2061
01:40:29,603 --> 01:40:32,037
I could break
into show business--

2062
01:40:32,106 --> 01:40:33,539
by hijacking Jerry Langford.

2063
01:40:33,607 --> 01:40:36,542

01:41:43,577 --> 01:41:45,010
Did you like it?

2080
01:41:45,079 --> 01:41:47,172
Thank you.

2081
01:41:47,248 --> 01:41:50,183
I'd like to buy
everyone here a drink.

2082
01:41:50,251 --> 01:41:52,742
I hope you all
enjoyed the show.

2083
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,811
Rita, you keep the change.

2084
01:41:54,889 --> 01:42:00,452
Just because I made it big,
I won't forget about you.

2085
01:42:00,528 --> 01:42:01,961
Come on. Come on!

2086
01:42:02,029 --> 01:42:03,462
[Man]
What's happening here?

2087
01:42:03,531 --> 01:42:04,964
[Rita]
Take care of yourself, Rupert.

2088
01:42:05,032 --> 01:42:08,399
That's the same guy who
was just now on television.

2089
01:42:08,469 --> 01:42:09,731
Just now. Same guy.

2090
01:42:10,905 --> 01:42:12,338
I'm just getting even.

2091
01:42:12,406 --> 01:42:13,839
No jokes. No jokes.

2092
01:42:13,908 --> 01:42:15,000
You murdered.

2093
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:17,009
You didn't like my show?

2094
01:42:17,077 --> 01:42:18,169
No. No.

2095
01:42:18,245 --> 01:42:19,678
Matter of fact...

2096
01:42:19,747 --> 01:42:22,682
I'm looking for the guy
that wrote the material.

2097
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:26,186
I'll pick him up
and take him along with you.

2098
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:29,188
I wrote the material.
I disagree with you.

2099
01:42:29,256 --> 01:42:31,690
I thought they were
very good jokes.

2100
01:42:31,759 --> 01:42:33,192
If you wrote that material...

2101
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:36,195
I got one piece
of advice for you.

2102
01:42:36,263 --> 01:42:39,198
Throw yourself on your knees
in front of the judge...

2103
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:40,699
and beg for mercy.

2104
01:42:40,768 --> 01:42:42,201
That's very funny,
but you'll see.

2105
01:42:42,269 --> 01:42:45,204
In what has to rank
as the most bizarre debut...

2106
01:42:45,272 --> 01:42:46,705
in recent times...

2107
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:49,208

2109
01:42:51,278 --> 01:42:53,712

Rupert Pupkin a household word.

2111
01:42:56,016 --> 01:42:57,449

On the anniversary of
his appearance on the show...

2119
01:43:15,069 --> 01:43:17,503
Rupert Pupkin told
a gathering of reporters...

2120
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:19,505

his friend and mentor.

2122
01:43:21,075 --> 01:43:24,010
He reported he had been
spending his time...

2123
01:43:24,078 --> 01:43:26,512

which have been purchased...

2124

and he looked forward

2140

Would you welcome home

Wonderful.!

2160
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:59,034
Rupert Pupkin,
ladies and gentlemen.!

2161
01:45:22,896 --> 01:45:26,491
How can you stand the silence

2162
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:30,765
That pervades when we all cry?

2163
01:45:30,838 --> 01:45:35,002
How can you watch the violence

2164
01:45:35,075 --> 01:45:38,670
That erupts before your eyes?

2165
01:45:38,746 --> 01:45:42,147
How can you tell us something

2166
01:45:42,216 --> 01:45:46,312
Just to keep us hanging on?

2167
01:45:46,387 --> 01:45:50,517
Something thatjust
don't mean nothing

2168
01:45:50,591 --> 01:45:52,752
When we see it,you are gone

2169
01:45:54,595 --> 01:45:58,531
Clinging to some other rainbow

2170
01:45:58,599 --> 01:46:01,591
Or standing waiting in the the cold

2171
01:46:02,803 --> 01:46:05,567
Telling us the same old story

2172
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:10,972
Knowing time is growing old

2173
01:46:11,045 --> 01:46:14,572
That was a wonderful remark

2174
01:46:18,485 --> 01:46:23,013
I had my eyes closed in the dark

2175
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:30,363
I sighed a million sighs

2176
01:46:30,431 --> 01:46:33,264
I told a million lies

2177
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:34,857
To myself

2178
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:38,561
To myself

2179
01:46:50,284 --> 01:46:53,981
How can we listen to you

2180
01:46:54,054 --> 01:46:57,387
When we know your talk is cheap?

2181
01:46:58,759 --> 01:47:02,354
How can we ever question

2182
01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:05,956
Why we give more and you keep?

2183
01:47:06,033 --> 01:47:10,470
How can your empty laughter

2184
01:47:10,537 --> 01:47:14,200
Fill the room like clouds ofjoy

2185
01:47:14,274 --> 01:47:18,074
When you're only playing with us

2186
01:47:18,145 --> 01:47:21,478
Like a child does with a toy?

2187
01:47:22,883 --> 01:47:25,249
How can we ever feel the freedom?

2188
01:47:26,553 --> 01:47:29,021
Or the flame lit by the spark?

2189
01:47:30,557 --> 01:47:34,084
How can we ever come out even

2190
01:47:34,161 --> 01:47:37,995
When reality is stark?

2191
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:42,297
That was a wonderful remark

2192
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:50,239
I had my eyes closed in the dark

2193
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,402
Yeah

2194
01:47:53,814 --> 01:47:57,511
I sighed a million sighs

2195
01:47:57,584 --> 01:48:00,519
I told a million lies

2196
01:48:00,587 --> 01:48:02,214
To myself

2197
01:48:04,091 --> 01:48:06,321
To myself

2198
01:48:08,529 --> 01:48:12,989
Believin'to myself

2199
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:15,964
Ooh

2200
01:48:16,036 --> 01:48:20,473
Believin'to myself

2201
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:23,476
To myself

2202
01:48:24,978 --> 01:48:28,106
To myself

2203
01:48:28,182 --> 01:48:30,673
To myself
