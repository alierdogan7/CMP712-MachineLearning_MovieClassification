1
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,477
HANNAH: Oh, my God,
he really knew so many people.

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,056
It's just crazy that you don't know the depth
of someone's power until their funeral.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,608
It's so sad.

4
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:20,605
Oh, my God. I think I see Zadie Smith.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,442
- That is definitely her.
- All right, calm down, kid. It's a funeral.

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,870
Who do you know here?

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,288
Uh...

8
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,916
(SOFTLY) That's David's assistant, Bob.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,796
Please help yourself.

10
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,972
ANNALIESE: I can't believe it.

11
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,762
It's just so nice of you all to come here.

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,093
It really means everything to me.

13
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,140
- Hi, Bob.
- on.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,648
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Hi, Hannah. Thank you.

15
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,317
ANNALIESE: Bob.

16
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,896
Bob. Sweet, sweet Bob.

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,981
What would I do without you?

18
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,904
Hi, I'm Adam.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,699
- Oh. Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

20
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,280
- Hi.
- This is Hannah.

21
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,411
- Hannah, hi.
- A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,912
I'm Annaliese.

23
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,495
You haven't met. This is David's wife.

24
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,379
Oh, you're... You're David's wife, yes.

25
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,711
- So, you two, um, lived together...
- Yes.

26
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,094
...romantically as well as maritally.

27
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,925
I'm sorry, I... (STUTTERING)
How did you know my husband?

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,762
- This one.
- Ah, yes, I was writing my memoir for him.

29
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,062
Okay.

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,269
Oh.

31
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,653
Oh, my gosh. Oh, I know exactly who you are.

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,399
David spoke about you all the time.

33
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,233
- He did?
- He did.

34
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,242
Oh, gosh, he loved you.
He really loved you so much.

35
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,121
You know, he always would tell me
about this amazing girl that I needed to meet

36
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,453
who had overcome such obstacles.

37
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,460
And now, finally, I am meeting you.

38
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,463
Thank you.
Well, my OCD is very much in check now...

39
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,419
But the Tourette's and the obesity...

40
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,679
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That was Paige.

41
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,974
- What?
- That wasn't Hannah. That was Paige.

42
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,346
- Not Hannah.
- Oh.

43
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,637
- Obesity?
- ANNALIESE: <i>Um...</i> No, no, no.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,814
- I don't have Tourette's.
- I'm so sorry.

45
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,062
- I don't know about obesity...
- If everyone could take their seats.

46
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,984
I've always thought
I was more chubby than obese.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,813
No, no, no, overcame. It's my... I'm so sorry.

48
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,148
- It's nice meeting you.
- No, please.

49
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,107
- It's very nice to... Bob, where are we headed?
- Thank you.

50
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:36,693
Where are we seated?
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

51
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,914
(WHISPERING) I thought you said he was gay.

52
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,586
Well, I don't know now.

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,791
He had gay apps on his iPhone
and he liked to show his ankles,

54
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,047
but what does that even mean
in this day and age?

55
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,595
Hello, everyone. I am Father Tudor Snowdon.

56
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,097
Today, we celebrate
the life of David Pressler-Goings.

57
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,105
Can we go now, please?

58
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,028
I'm not leaving until
I have locked eyes with Michiko Kakutani.

59
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,321
I told you that.

60
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,571
ADAM: I'm gonna wait outside.
HAN NAH: Okay.

61
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,904
Hi again.

62
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,113
(SIGHING) Oh.

63
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,449
Hi.

64
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,707
- Hannah.
- Right.

65
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,831
- Not Paige, Hannah.
- I know.

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,958
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,711
I was surprised
that David had such a beautiful...

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,714
Just stunningly...

69
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,712
You thought he was gay.

70
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,972
- Uh, no.
- Yes, you did.

71
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,175
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. It's okay, it's okay.

72
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,056
- I didn't. I thought he was straight.
- lt's okay.

73
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,433
I thought he was straight.
I thought he wanted to sleep with me.

74
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,140
- Really, I know you...
- I wouldn't have slept with him, but...

75
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,853
A lot of people think it.
A lot of people think he was gay.

76
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,562
Well, he acted gay.

77
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:53,196
- And, you know, he was sometimes.
- Okay.

78
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,284
I loved working with your husband.

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,159
- David was wonderful.
- Oh, I bet.

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,123
(CHUCKLES) I mean, I know.

81
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,290
Um...

82
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,416
I'm working on a book with David, too.
I was. Was.

83
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,917
I really hope you finish the book,

84
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,795
and I really,
really hope I get to read it someday.

85
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,421
Thank you. Yeah, I don't know.

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,754
I mean, now that
Millstreet has dropped all of Davids projects,

87
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,430
I just...

88
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,803
I'd have to find a new publisher, so,
you know, we'll see...

89
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,352
Wait, you said
Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?

90
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,725
Yeah. Oh, shit. Shit.

91
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,772
There's David's morn. She's so devastated.

92
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,021
- Have you seen Pepper? Did you meet her?
- No, I didn't, no.

93
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,818
- She's devastated and I should...
- You were saying that...

94
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,022
You were saying that
Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?

95
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,277
Right, that's right. For now, yeah.

96
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,074
So, my book is dead?

97
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,861
Um...

98
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,620
Do you happen to know another publisher
that I could maybe slip the manuscript to

99
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,546
if I do decide
that I really want to try to keep it alive?

100
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,638
Okay, um, if I do give you another name,
will you get the fuck out of here?

101
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,551
Yes.

102
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,184
Great. Great, I'll be back.

103
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,690
Honestly, I just...

104
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,560
I loved your husband.

105
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,562
JESSA: You know the person
who gave me this

106
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,569
told me that
it used to belong to Edna St. Vincent Millay.

107
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,569
But who can ever know if that's true?

108
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,537
Can you believe
that my friend told me that she died

109
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,081
so that she didn't have to hang outwith me?

110
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,625
Yeah, I know, I totally get that.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,872
Excuse me?

112
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,046
Okay, look,
I know that we, like, technically live together,

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,339
but this is still very much my private home,

114
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,089
and it just is slightly worrisome to me
that all you do all day long

115
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,053
- is sit around and watch the Forensic Files.
- (SIGHS)

116
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,471
And I have kept my mouth shut until now,

117
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,970
but I literally cannot
keep my mouth shut any longer

118
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,848
because I really need to study.

119
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,018
- Since when?
- Since forever!

120
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,771
Plus, my recent hijinks
have really taken a toll on my GPA.

121
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,691
But I thought this was your time to go wild

122
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,489
before you become
an international business lady.

123
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,693
Yeah, exactly,
so it's really important to my 15-year plan

124
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,322
that I get into a good business school

125
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,370
because I don't want to
become like all my friends and family,

126
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,698
yourself included, no offense.

127
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,658
What happens after the 15-year plan?

128
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,119
It would be, like, insane to think about that.

129
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,876
Oh, yes.

130
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,127
CAROLINE:...so difficult
to even nourish myself.

131
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,004
Yes, I could definitely come in tomorrow.

132
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,881
ADAM: ...conditioner later
and then it's deodorant.

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,803
CAROLINE: Why? Why?
Why are you inherently disinclined

134
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,131
to support me in any way?

135
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,806
ADAM: You're living in my house.
CAROLINE: Oh, God!

136
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,103
Thank you so much. I will see you then.
I really appreciate it.

137
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,604
ADAM: Why should I give you anything?

138
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,057
Oh, right, God forbid.
God forbid we assist one another, right?

139
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,642
- Simply because we share the same blood.
- HANNAH: Guys...

140
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,944
Forget about the fact
that I spent my formative years raising you

141
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,863
- because Verna had absolutely no interest.
- No, I never asked you for anything.

142
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,315
- No one ever asked you for anything.
- Oh, please.

143
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,820
You can't be bothered
to do anything for anybody.

144
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,902
ADAM: You need so much
from everyone all the time...

145
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,532
(SCREAMS)

146
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,957
Oh, my God. Seriously.

147
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,123
Seriously, it's already been
a very long day for me,

148
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,751
and what I need is a peaceful house
where people are centered.

149
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,922
See what you're doing, Caroline?

150
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,501
You're upsetting Hannah
when she just found out her book is dead.

151
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,594
I actually just found out
I have a very exciting meeting

152
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,888
with a publisher
who I think is pretty interested.

153
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,594
I was just trying to make myself a meal.

154
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,516
- Just feeding myself...
- With my last eggs.

155
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,267
Guys, I cannot take this anymore, okay?

156
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,099
- We have to work this out.
- ADAM: There is no working this out.

157
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,609
Okay, I've watched enough
<i>Dr. Phils</i> and <i>Interventions</i>

158
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,403
to know you can work anything out
if you talk about it.

159
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,605
CAROLINE: I would love to.

160
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,191
Thank you, Caroline. I appreciate that.

161
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,620
Adam? Will you join us at the listening table?

162
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,207
Please?
- (CHUCKLES)

163
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,210
Come on.

164
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,962
Thank you.

165
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,755
Okay, I think we should all start

166
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,087
by acknowledging
that we all really care about each other.

167
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,047
So, Caroline, tell me you love me.

168
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,974
Hannah, I love you.

169
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,677
I love you, too.
Adam, you tell me you love me.

170
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,770
Why are we telling you we love you?

171
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,271
(SIGHS) Okay, so then why don't you both
just tell each other that you love each other?

172
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,148
- Adam, I love you.
- This is dumb.

173
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,025
HANNAH: Okay,
emotions are running high right now,

174
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,449
and I think it's really important
that we avoid using inflammatory language.

175
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,825
Words like "dumb,"
words like "skank," "fatty."

176
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,664
Let's just acknowledge
that we're here for each other

177
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,241
and make this a safe space.

178
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,955
So, Adam, why don't you just begin

179
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,662
by telling Caroline
what some of your issues are with her

180
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,588
in a very calm, rational way?

181
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,176
I feel like she's an evil person

182
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,883
who pukes on everything, metaphorically.

183
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,179
Okay, maybe perhaps
you could elaborate on that...

184
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,105
- Jeez.
- ...and be a little bit more specific

185
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,023
with some of your issues with me.

186
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,353
Okay, specifically, you don't know
what you want to do with your life.

187
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,821
You have no drive, no real goals,
but somehow tons of opinions.

188
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,990
Interesting, interesting, interesting,
interesting, interesting.

189
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,696
Why is that interesting seven times?

190
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,959
I just have to say that sounds a lot like you.

191
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,126
Whose side are you on?

192
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,163
She's not on anyone's side. She's the Dr. Phil.

193
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,964
Well, it's easy to say when she's on your side.

194
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,549
- I'm not on anyone's side.
- (MOCKING)

195
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,171
I'm not on anyone's side.

196
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,719
(WHISPERING) I'm on your side.

197
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,515
If I had to pick a side, it would be your side.
This is something I'm doing for us.

198
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,304
Why are you whispering? She can hear you.

199
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,477
I can hear you. I'm sitting right here.

200
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,601
What is that?

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,900
This is a space cigarette,
invented by Stephen Dorff.

202
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,979
It's just water vapor and nicotine
and good things like that, you know?

203
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,695
I'm really on a mission to improve myself.

204
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,868
Okay, if you're serious
about improving yourself,

205
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,195
you need to do more than just,
like, smoke Dorff cigarettes.

206
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,747
You need to grocery shop
and condition your hair,

207
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,699
even though
I know it does so well with natural oils.

208
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,075
JESSA: I'm gonna get that job.

209
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,377
Are you sure
that's the kind of job you should be having?

210
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,706
Like, being near things that children are near?

211
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,134
Yeah, I want something
with a touch of innocence.

212
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,881
SHOSHANNA: You have a criminal record!

213
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,718
ADAM: No, I'm not like you.
I'm not a different person every other week.

214
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,636
- Oh, really?
- You're hearing each other.

215
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,471
- Let's keep doing that.
Really? What is it?

216
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,104
Okay, it was an actor last week.
What was it before that, a woodworker, huh?

217
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,685
And the last time I saw you, you were, what?

218
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,191
You were gonna go join
the special armed forces, G.I. Joe?

219
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,772
- Those are professions.
- That's crazy.

220
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,901
I remain the same,
whereas you move to Montana,

221
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,157
put on a phony accent,
and claim to be a midwife or some shit.

222
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,989
It was a doula.

223
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,450
You know what, guys?
Let's just take a breath, okay?

224
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,959
Adam, we have given you a chance to express
what some of your issues with Caroline are.

225
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,381
So, why don't we now
take a moment to hear Caroline?

226
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,796
You are doing really good.

227
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,219
Thank you.
I feel good about it, but it's too soon to say.

228
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,218
Okay, first I want to say, Adam,
that I love you very much.

229
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,969
- (SCOFFS)
- However, it really upsets me

230
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,646
that he thinks of me as this insane,
dependent nightmare,

231
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,476
because he knows how hard
I have been trying to get my stuff together.

232
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,903
Things fell apart because of bad luck
and you're the victim again,

233
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,527
- but next year will be your year...
- Yes, yes, I am cursed with bad luck.

234
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,278
- I am sorry that that upsets you so much.
- Over and over.

235
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,157
Just get a normal job and an apartment
like everybody else and stop bloodsucking.

236
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,489
- He's been angry like this always at me.
- lt's okay.

237
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,791
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

238
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:05,750
I think it is possibly because
he is internally battling a sexual desire for me.

239
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,293
Holy dogshit!

240
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,720
HANNAH: That's a weird one.
That's a weird one for me.

241
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,969
I'm sorry, guys. It doesn't take a psychiatrist

242
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,599
to correlate Adam's romantic interest in you
with a repressed fantasy toward me.

243
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,272
- I don't want to fuck my sister.
- No one is saying you do.

244
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,641
Caroline just did.

245
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,693
That is true, and, Caroline,
that goes in the category of things

246
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,987
we should never say out loud ever,
no matter what.

247
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,063
This is what she does.

248
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,615
She finds a way to
drive a wedge between people

249
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,283
so everybody ends up
just as unhappy as she is.

250
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,826
I know, I know.
I don't want a wedge between us.

251
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,370
- She's sick in the brain.
- You're sick!

252
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,539
You're sick in the brain! You're sick...

253
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,036
- (SCREAMING)
- HANNAH: Stop it, you guys!

254
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,951
Please stop!

255
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,080
- Please! Hey! Hey!
- Ha-ha.

256
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,416
- Hey, T.O.! You're nuts!
- (LAUGHS)

257
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,968
I do not understand why
you can't be a little bit better to each other.

258
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,973
Being an only child is extremely lonely.
All I wanted as a kid was a sibling.

259
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,147
Caroline, come on, you don't think
your brother wants to have sex with you.

260
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,316
No, not in a physical way, no.

261
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,690
See, it was all
a big misunderstanding, all right?

262
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,818
So, can't you just tell your sister
you love her?

263
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,405
Yeah, I do. Whatever.

264
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,113
<i>Feliz cumpleaños.</i> Great!

265
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,240
Okay, you just make me crazy.

266
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,327
I know I do.

267
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,833
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,332
Sorry I yelled at you.

269
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,416
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

270
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,424
Hold on one second, guys. I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna put this on silent...

271
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,882
Okay, I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Marn, I can't talk right now.

272
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,392
So, I went out this morning to get a muffin,

273
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,097
and I saw this teenager
giving away kittens from his backpack.

274
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,854
And so' I took the cutest one.
You have to come over and see it.

275
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,151
Uh, I'm sorry. I really... I can't.

276
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,195
You never can, Hannah. Why?

277
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,948
Well, I'm sorry.
We're having a very real moment over here.

278
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,195
Fine, don't come see
the cutest thing that's ever lived. Good-bye.

279
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,991
You're my best friend.

280
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,200
(MEWING)

281
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,601
- (HAWKING)
- (DOOR OPENS)

282
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
- Hannah.
- Hi.

283
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,265
I had Mo read a couple of chapters last night
and he loved them.

284
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,975
- Loved them.
- That's what I said.

285
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,358
So, I read a bit this morning
and I get you, Hannah Horvath.

286
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,905
- And I like you.
- MO: I knew she would.

287
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,990
Thank you so much.

288
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,988
You're like a Mindy Kaling meets...

289
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,570
- Joan Didion.
- No, Mo. (SIGHS)

290
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,782
- I love Mindy Kaling. She's terrific.
- Right, but she holds back.

291
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,413
She'll go there,
but she doesn't go all the way there,

292
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,744
you know what I mean?

293
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,997
I definitely do. She just never...
She never takes it there.

294
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,300
You take it there
and then you take it even further,

295
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,096
and I'm just like,
"Whoa! How the fuck did we get here?"

296
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,221
Mindy Kaling's not writing about choking
on long balls, so... (LAUGHS)

297
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,517
Well, neither am I.

298
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,765
You wish, Mo.

299
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
Anyway, the book
obviously needs some work.

300
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,728
It's not as tight as it can be,
but I really think we can get it there.

301
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,522
So, who is Hannah Horvath?

302
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,197
I am... I write my own books and I'm not a...

303
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,321
Right, no, but beyond these pages.
I want to know more. Who are we selling?

304
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,652
How would you describe yourself?

305
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,282
What's your brand?

306
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,285
- Good question, Mo.
- Thank you.

307
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,992
Okay, let's see. My brand.

308
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,543
Well, I'm from the Midwest,

309
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,713
so, I will always be
15 to 45 pounds overweight,

310
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,210
depending how far I live from the coast.

311
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,212
(BOTH LAUGHING)

312
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,385
The farther I am from the coast, the fatter I am.

313
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,136
So, I guess my brand is Tombstone pizza.

314
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,221
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

315
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,139
Uh...

316
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,850
Uh, let's see. I...

317
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,059
I feel like I'm a person who just, like,
can't keep my mouth shut.

318
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,610
There's things
that you only talk about with your friends.

319
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,528
Those things I'll talk about with anyone.

320
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,315
- I don't believe in secrets.
- Right, TMI all the time.

321
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,945
You're like Kathy Griffin on truth serum.

322
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,697
Well, I don't know.
Kathy Griffin's not exactly...

323
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,403
What the fuck is truth serum, Mo?

324
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,578
Well, I'm sold,
but here's the thing about our company.

325
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,829
We don't do e-books.

326
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,168
Well, maybe you should start.

327
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,082
Nope, so we'd
want to put it out as an actual book.

328
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,838
That you can hold, buy in a store,
that kind of thing.

329
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,339
I hope that's okay with you.

330
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,929
Are you kidding me?
I mean, that's the best thing I've ever heard.

331
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,682
I just said yes to an e-book
because it was better than, like, a "no book."

332

(SHRIEKING)

334
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,819
- That's exciting.
- Sorry.

335
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,028
You guys laugh too much. I don't even care.

336
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,701
I'm sorry. That's so good.

337
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,044
- Okay, Mo.
- l'm so... I'm sorry.

338

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

339
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,001
Hey, what's up?

340
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,967
Hey. What are you wearing?

341
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,094
- I'm heading to play ball.
- You play basketball?

342
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,677
Yeah, what do you think I do?

343
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,640
I don't know, read, eat soup,
write letters of complaint to local businesses?

344
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,900
- Won't you come in?
- Wow.

345
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,068
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Ray, this place is huge.

346
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,990
Yeah, well, it's not exactly Versailles,
but it works for me.

347
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,738
Yeah, it's not half as bad
as Hannah said it was.

348
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,366
No, it was.
Believe me, it was a real house of horrors.

349
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,662
Yeah.

350
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,241
I'm surprised you live in such a nice place.
No offense.

351
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,871
I could never live all the way out here, though.

352
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,829
Once you go to Manhattan,
it's hard to go back to Brooklyn.

353
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,880
Well' sounds like
you know what you're doing to me.

354
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,754
- Totally, thank you.
- Yeah.

355
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,048
(SIGHING) Oh.

356
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,845
- So...
- Yeah?

357
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,266
I'm on pins and needles here, Mam.
What did you want to talk about?

358
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,563
Yeah, so I guess I just wanted you to...

359
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,226
God, I don't really know how to say this.

360
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,238
I wanted you to tell me what's wrong with me.

361
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,908
- What's wrong with you?
- Yes.

362
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,485
It just feels like it's time for me

363
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,118
to take responsibility
for what has happened in my life,

364
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:15,247
and you are someone who likes to tell people
what's wrong with them anyway,

365
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,873
so, shoot.

366
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,217
- I'm smelling a trap here.
- No, it is not a trap.

367
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,419
Seriously, this is what I need.

368
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,973
From you, specifically, please.
So, just give it to me.

369
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,139
- Please.
- Okay.

370
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,811
- Okay.
- All right.

371
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,935
- You ready for this?
- Yes, I am a strong woman.

372
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,893
All right, let's see here. Hmm.

373
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,571
Well, for beginners,
you're extremely judgmental.

374
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,066
What?

375
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,243
Yeah, you came in here and immediately
insulted me and my neighborhood.

376
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,740
Those were funny jokes.

377
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,697
- Were they? Were they funny jokes, Mam?
- Well...

378
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,703
You come across like
you're better than everyone

379
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,706
and you want no pan of their lives,
and then when you're excluded from things,

380
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,755
you're outrageously offended
and hold onto this grudge.

381
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,878
Also you're unbearably uptight.

382
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay, who isn't uptight, really?
If we're being serious.

383
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,635
And you use people.

384
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,967
- No.
- You use people a lot.

385
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,596
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

386
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,974
So much so that even
when you try to connect and be sincere,

387
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,805
it comes across as phony.

388
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,266
I think that actually
more or less sums it up in a nutshell.

389
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,602
You're a huge, fat fucking phony.

390
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,447
Wow.

391
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,781
Okay, yeah, thanks.

392
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,659
I'm super glad I came here. That was great.

393
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,198
Yeah.

394
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,703
Fuck.

395
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,039
(GROANS)

396
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,295
But, that being said, I still like you.

397
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,751
Why?

398
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:51,465
Because behind it all, I think you mean well.

399
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,801
And I'm old enough to recognize
that all of this bullshit

400
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,479
comes from a very deep, dank, dark,
toxic well of insecurity,

401
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,477
probably created by your absent father.

402
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,775
And that allows you to be
a sympathetic character.

403
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,066
That's nice.

404
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,861
Look...

405
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,866
You are, ultimately, a good person, Marnie.

406
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,447
Okay? I believe that.

407
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,162
Thank you.

408
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,041
You're welcome. You want a hug?

409
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,670
Come on. Give me a hug.

410
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,512
Maybe I went a little too far. I'm sorry.

411
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,093
It's okay.

412
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,871
Take these off. Take these off.
Take them down.

413
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,294
Oh, fuck, how many pairs of underwear
do you wear?

Nothing to worry about. Are you...</i>

419
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:25,733
Okay, I just met with a publisher
and they want to give me a real book deal.

420
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:30,484
Not a stupid' pathetic, shitty e-book deal,
a real book deal.

Well, that is... That's great. love bug.

<i>Well, to be honest, you know,
I just got off the phone with Cousin Rudy,</i>

424
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,578
and he looked at that contract
like you wanted him to,

425
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,414
and it seems that your old publishers

426
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,171
own the rights to your book
since they paid you.

427
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,423
No, they were very, very clear about the fact

428
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,254
that they're definitely
not publishing the book.

429
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,510
<i>Well, Rudy called and spoke
with someone over at the Millstreet,</i>

430
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,592
and apparently they don't release the rights

431
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,849
on any of the books
they acquire for, like, three years.

432
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,149
Dad, that's insane.
You're not making any sense, okay?

433
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,567
You're, like' loopy
from your procedure or whatever.

434
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,276
- Small mole on my...
- Plus, Rudy is not even a real lawyer, okay?

435
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,278
He's like a Subway sandwiches
franchise lawyer.

436
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>Now, let's not go and insult Cousin Rudy.</i>

437
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,493
- He took the time to...
- Rudy represents sandwiches, not art, okay?

438
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,576
If a pepperoni sub
is ever suing a tuna salad sandwich,

439
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,581
let's call Cousin Rudy.

440
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,665
Well, I think you should call Cousin Rudy
and talk all this over with him.

441
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,250
And it sounds like, in three years,

442
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,960
you'll be able to do
whatever you want with that book.

443
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,597
Three years?
Three years might as well be a million years.

444
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,058
Well, we tried three years for you.

445
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,681
Well, you're insane and I have to go.

446
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,241
I should really get going.
I have this lunch thing.

447
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,822
Yeah, I should get going, too.

448
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:08,036
I run point... Point guard on the court,
so I don't want to keep the fellas waiting.

00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,291
Mmm-mmm. You can't do that.

450

- No.
- No.

451
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,341
Should I wait for you?

452
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,171
No, you go ahead. No. I'll wait here.
You go, so...

453
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,380
Hey, um,

454
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,676
thanks for talking to me.

455
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,387
That was really helpful when you talked to me.

456
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,815
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
I'm glad it was helpful.

457
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,476
Nice to know I could be of service.

00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,195
Okay, so...

00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,824
Yeah, so, be safe and stay warm.

460
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,874
You know, maybe for the time being,
it might be best to keep this on the DL,

461
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,374
the down low, you know?

462
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,797
Go fuck yourself. Like I'd advertise this.

463
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,011

You wrote all of those wonderful stories
and now you know you can do it.

You just have to write a whole new bunch
of wonderful stories, that's all.

Ugh!

480

And now, what am I gonna do?

481
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,102
Live another 25 years
just to create a body of work

482
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,608
that matches the one that they stole from me?

What if nothing happens in the next 25 years?

wondering if there's asbestos?

they came to shoot <i>Independence Day</i>
in my hometown,

490
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,879
and I got an audition
for the part of Alicia Casse.

491
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,591
By all accounts, I was fabulous.

492

00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,682
They gave it to somebody else,
but in that moment,

I was certain that my acting career
was finished, you know, forever.

00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,651
Caroline, that has absolutely nothing
to do with what we're talking about,

496
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,074
and your acting career is over.

497
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,490
Where's Adam?

498
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,367
You know,
he should be here for you right now.

499
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,493
Mmm-mmm.

500
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,333
No, he shouldn't.
He has his own things going on.

501
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,413
No, don't you see, Hannah?
This is his modus operandi.

502
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,418
When times are sunny, oh, there's Adam.

503
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,171
But when the great seesaw of life
throws your cunt in a sandbox,

504
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,094
he's a ghost, nowhere to be found.
This is what he does.

505
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,467
- Hey, Caroline?
- (SIGHS) Yeah, honey?

506
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,678
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.

507
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,306
Can you try shutting the fuck up?

508
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,941
Listen, I feel your pain. I really do.

509
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,065
But, honey,
I think you're projecting a little bit.

510
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,359
You feel my pain?
How do you feel anyone's pain?

511
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,908
All you do is talk and talk and talk and talk.

512
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,079
And every time I come home to my apartment,
you’re just here talking.

513
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,656
And at first it was kind of fun,

514
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,539
but now I'm getting pretty fucking sick
of listening to your mouth run. Just...

515
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,994
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

516
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,122
I'll go to my room, give you a little space.

517
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,424
It's not your room, it's my room.

518
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,213
The whole apanment's mine,

519
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:48,799
and for the low, low price of $2,100 a month,
it could be yours, but it isn't.

520
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,850
Well, what would you
like for me to do, Hannah?

521
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,977
Hmm, let me think about it.

522
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:58,308
I'd really like you
to get the fuck out of my apartment!

523
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,400
Fucking selfish little whore.

524
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,358
You and my brother deserve one other,
you know that, you selfish little pricks?

525
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,067
And you will never write a thing that matters

526
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,494
because you will never
understand the true struggles of humanity,

527
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,788
because you just slipped
right out of your mothers pussy

528
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,458
like a nice little golden egg,
you spoiled little fucking brat.

529
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:22,252
MAN ON TV: <i>I actually suffered
and still continue to suffer from acne.</i>

530
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,299
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

531
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,673
(PANTING) Hey.

532
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,518
Hey.

533
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,016
What's up?

534
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,151
Where's Caroline?

535
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,734
I kicked her out.

536
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,531
What? Why?

537
00:26:56,073 --> 00:27:00,795
'Cause she was ruining our lives and
I thought it would make you happy, finally.

538
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,213
Well, what happened?

539
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,915
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

540
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,375
- Hannah?
- I don't know.

541
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,304
What did you do?
I'm supposed to be taking care of her.

542
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,097
Well, you didn't like doing that, so...

543
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:17,394
Yeah, so? She's my sister.
Do you understand that? What the fuck?

544
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,233
