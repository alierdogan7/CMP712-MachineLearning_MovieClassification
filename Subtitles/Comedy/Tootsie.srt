00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,930
the next day,

167
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,140
or a week later, and they say:

168
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,017
"I saw your play.

169
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,853
What happened?"

170
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,066
I've got it under control. I'll feed
my cats and be back in an hour.

171
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,486
I can't make it. My roommate
wants to work on the third act.

172
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,531
You can't make it?
He wants to work.

173
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,075
Give me your phone number.
I already did.

174
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,452
I thought you changed it.
Since an hour ago?

175
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,290
Oh, you didn't. Good point.
Let me talk to him. I'll call you.

176
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,169
Didn't anybody hear me?
No, guess not.

177
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,463
I've been trapped in that
bathroom for half an hour.

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,340
What kind of a party
is this?

179
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,051
God, you guys are having
a good time, huh?

180
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,553
Sorry.

181
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,557
I'll remember that if I ever
do a scene where I'm trapped.

182
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,144
That's nice, Michael.
Thanks.

183
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,105
Who is that?

184
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,233
Mallory. She's married to John.
Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:00,200
I did a thing about suicides
of the American Indian.

186
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,537
And nobody cared.
Nobody showed.

187
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,250
And I think the American Indian
is as American

188
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,627
as John and Ethel Barrymore

189
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,130
and Donny and Marie Osmond.

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,341
I think it's really sad,

191
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,469
but I think that, nowadays,
when people dream

192
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,348
they don't even dream in their
own country anymore.

193
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,099
And that's sick.

194
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,935
MICHAEL: I had a good time. I
just didn't know half the people.

195
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,396
JEFF: It was late, and I wanted it
to be a surprise.

196
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,107
I invited 10 people.
They all invited 10 people.

197
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,902
You met 40 new people.
They all liked you.

198
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,154
I heard a lot of nice things
about you.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,781
Thanks, Jeff.
Good night.

200
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,449
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Sam.

201
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,910
One of the five people I knew.
Great party.

202
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,328
Thank you.

203
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,959
Excuse me, Miss Right?
Miss Right?

204
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,261
Good night, Michael.
It was a wonderful party.

205
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:06,016
My date left with someone else. I had fun.
Do you have any Seconal?

206
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,060
Come on, I'll take you home.

207
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,355
SANDY: I did have a good time.
I really did.

208
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,108
No, you didn't. Wait. I didn't
bring enough money for cab fare.

209
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,902
That's okay. It's cheaper to
get mugged. Let's walk.

210
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,446
The fares are really
insane now anyway.

211
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,825
Why didn't you have a good time?
I did have a good time.

212
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,910
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

213
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,620
What?

214
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,749
What?
Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

215
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,043
I just cry like this,
like a tic.

216
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,130
Tell me what's wrong,
or I'll kill you.

217
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,383
Nothing's wrong, Michael.
I'm really very up.

218
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,136
You're worried about your audition
tomorrow, aren't you? Why?

219
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,347
No. Because I'm not gonna get it.
Why not?

220
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,685
Because I'm completely wrong for it.
What kind of a part is it?

221
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,271
A woman!

222
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,190
You don't have a man,
so you wanna act like one.

223
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,026
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm proud of being a woman.

224
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,612
Wait a minute. This guy
treats you like dirt

225
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,781
because you're a woman
and he's a big doctor, right?

226
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,576
But don't take that.
Talk to him on his level.

227
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,954
Show me what you mean.
You're doing a Southern accent?

228
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,082
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm very proud of being a woman!

229
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,626
I can't do it as good as you.

230
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,297
Yes, you can! Just turn the tables on him.
Come on, now, will you?

231
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,008
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] You're wrong.
I'm very proud of being a woman.

232
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,259
Where am I off?

233
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,635
I don't know what you're playing.

234
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,346
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.

235
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,725
You told me to turn the tables.
I'm playing rage.

236
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,768
This is rage?

237
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,812
I have a problem with anger.

238
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,191
Yeah, you certainly do. But there's 100
other actresses reading for this part

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,776
who don't have a problem with anger,
who aren't afraid of working.

240
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,529
Who aren't afraid to stick everything
out on the line and do it!

241
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,907
Don't get mad at me!
Stop being a doormat!

242
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,659
I'm not a doormat!
Act right now! Do it!

243
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,205
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...
Go on.

244
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,750
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...
Do I have to hit you with a stick?

245
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,586
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] You're wrong.
I am very proud to be a woman.

246
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,004
And I'm proud of this hospital.

247
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,673
And before I see it destroyed
by your petty tyrannies,

248
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,300
Have the anger.
Don't show it to me.

249
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,886
I'll recommend you be
thrown out into the street.

250
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,888
Don't lose it.
Good day, Dr. Brewster.

251
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,183
Don't whine like you're second-rate.
I said, good day!

252
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,727
Not bad. Pretty good.

253
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,812
Did you feel
how much I hated you?

254
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,607
You really felt it?
That's why I'm going.

255
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,402
How can I get it back tomorrow? How
can a total stranger enrage me?

256
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,905
I'll pick you up at 10:00
and enrage you.

SANDY: I'm supposed
to look like this?

263
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,093
That is what you look like.
It's not funny.

264
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,636
Good. Don't lose that.

265
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,056
No sequins, Alfred. She's
attending her husband's funeral.

Fuck you.
Thank you.

Go.
God bless you.

including John Van Horn, who has
played Dr. Medford Brewster

279
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,133
since the first episode
aired 20 years ago.

00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,096
Now we'll head into Studio B, where
the episodes are actually taped.

WOMAN [ON SPEAKER]: Andrew Donovan,
report to Wardrobe, please.

282
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,811
I didn't get it.

283
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,105
What?
They wouldn't let me read.

284
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:44,526
They wouldn't let you read?
They said I wasn't right physically.

285
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,487
They want somebody tougher.
So I'm going home.

286
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,948
Okay, I'll walk you.
To San Diego?

287

I'm going home!

God! I'm 34 years old!
I paid $24 for these glasses.

290
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,792
All I do is buy things...
I want to be a waitress.

291
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,669
I wasn't gonna resort to this,
but you're gonna read.

292
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,755
I don't want to.
Shh. Shh.

Excuse me,
is Terry Bishop here?

294
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,302
No, he's no longer with the show. Mr. Bishop
is rehearsing The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.

295
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,511
He's what?

296
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,806
He's rehearsing The Iceman
Cometh for Broadway.

297
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,809
That was my part.
I was supposed to be up...

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,772
I gotta see somebody.
Don't do anything rash.

right now. I swear!

00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,233
Hang on. Will you wait outside?
I'm talking to the Coast.

305
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,527
This is a coast too.
New York is a coast too.

Oh, boy.

I cut myself off.

What is it, Michael?

311
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,249
Terry Bishop's doing Iceman. You
promised to send me up for that part.

312
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,002
You told me I'd get a reading for that.
Aren't you my agent?

313
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,797
Stuart Pressman wants a name.
Terry Bishop is a name?

314
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,093
Michael Dorsey is a name. When you want to
send a steak back, Michael Dorsey is a name.

315
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,430
Wait, wait, wait!
You always do this to me.

316
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,349
It was a rotten thing to say.
Let me start again.

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,686
Terry Bishop is on a soap opera. Millions
of people watch him every day. He's known.

318
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,815
That qualifies him to ruin Iceman?
I can act circles around him.

319
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,570
I played that part in Minneapolis.
If Stuart wants a name, it's his affair.

320
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,447
People are in this business
to make money.

321
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,284
I'm in it to make money too.
Really?

322
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,037
The Harlem Theatre for the Blind? Strindberg in the Park?
The People's Workshop at Syracuse?

323
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,957
Wait a minute. I did nine plays
in eight months up at Syracuse.

324
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,711
I got great reviews from the critics.
Not that that's why I did it.

325
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,547
God forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure.

326
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,716
You think I'm a failure?

327
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,469
I will not get sucked
into this conversation.

328
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,678
I will not.

329
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,849
I sent you my roommate's play to read.
It had a great part in it for me.

330
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,394
Where do you come off sending
me a play for you to star in?

331
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,814
I'm not your mother. I don't
find plays for you to star in.

332
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,025
I field offers.
That's what I do.

333
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,194
Field offers? Who told you that?
The agent fairy?

334
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,529
I could have been terrific
in that part.

335
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,239
Nobody's gonna do that play.
Why?

336
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,911
Because it's a downer about a couple
that move back to Love Canal.

337
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,247
But that actually happened.
Nobody wants to watch people

338
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,751
living next to chemical waste!
They can see that in New Jersey.

339
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,005
I don't want to argue about it. I'll
raise $8000 and produce his play.

340
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,299
Send me up for anything.
I don't care.

341
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,761
I'll do dog commercials.
I'll do radio voiceovers.

342
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,888
I can't put you up for any of that.
Why not?

343
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,849
Because no one will hire you.

344
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,519
I bust my ass
to get a part right!

345
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,188
And you bust
everybody else's ass too!

346
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,149
Four weeks to put on a play, who
wants to argue about whether Tolstoy

347
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,444
can walk when he's dying
or walk when he's talking...?

348
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,239
That was two years ago,
and that guy's an idiot!

349
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,325
They can't all be idiots.
You argue with everybody!

350
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,079
You've got one of the worst
reputations in this town.

351
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,748
Nobody will hire you.

352
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,752
Are you saying that nobody
in New York will work with me?

353
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,257
Nobody in Hollywood will either.
I can't even get you a commercial.

354
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,719
You played a tomato for 30 seconds, and they went
over schedule because you wouldn't sit down.

355
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,555
Yes, it wasn't logical.

356
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,600
You were a tomato! A tomato
doesn't have logic. It can't move!

357
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,854
So if he can't move,
how's he gonna sit down?

358
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,232
I was a stand-up tomato.
A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!

359
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,610
Nobody does vegetables like me!
I did vegetables off-Broadway!

360
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,821
I did the best tomato,
the best cucumber!

361
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,825
I did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass!

362
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,744
Michael, I'm trying to
stay calm here.

363
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,622
You are a wonderful actor.

364
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,710
Thank you.
But you're too much trouble.

365
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,628
Get some therapy.

366
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,049
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise
$8000 to do Jeff's play.

367
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,720
Michael, you're not
gonna raise 25 cents.

368
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,556
No one will hire you.

369
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,433
Oh, yeah?

370
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,060
[♪♪♪]

371
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,339
Dorothy Michaels?

372
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,341
[IN FEMININE VOICE] Yes?
George Fields is your agent?

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,343
Yes.
Okay, ladies.

374
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,929
Please bring your pages
and follow me.

375
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,852
I hate this line, "You have
every right to happiness."

376
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,688
This is Dorothy Michaels.
Our director, Ron Carlysle.

377
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,401
That's our producer, Rita Marshall. No résumé,
but George Fields is Dorothy's agent.

378
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,778
That's very impressive.

379
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm afraid you're not right for this role.
Thanks for coming by.

380
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,162
Page 205, you want
camera one or two?

381
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,707
RON: Camera two, and tell Art.
Why am I not right?

382
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,502
I'm trying to make
a certain statement,

383
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,838
and I'm looking for
a specific physical type.

384
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,344
Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.
I can play it any way you want.

385
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,638
I'm sure you're
a very good actress.

386
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,724
It's just that you're not
threatening enough.

387
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,059
DOROTHY:
Not threatening enough?

388
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,521
Take your hands off me or I'll knee your
balls through the roof of your mouth!

389
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,232
Is that enough of a threat?
It's a start.

390
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,486
DOROTHY: I think I know what you want.
You want a caricature of a woman.

391
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,031
To prove some idiotic point like
power makes a woman masculine,

392
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,908
or masculine women are ugly.

393
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,578
Well, shame on any woman
that lets you do that.

394
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,872
And that means you, dear,
Miss Marshall.

395
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,292
Shame on you,
you macho shithead.

396
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,420
Jesus!

397
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,842
What is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine?

398
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,846
Not that that was my point.

399
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,767
RITA: Miss Michaels,
just a minute.

400
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,771
Was that for real
or were you auditioning?

401
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,941
Which answer will get me
a reading, Miss Marshall?

402
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,944
Well, good for you. Come.

403
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,906
JO: Miss Michaels.
DOROTHY: Yes. Oh, thank you.

404
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,704
You really think she's worth
testing for this, huh?

405
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:57,417
She told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast.

406
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,836
She said that?
Mm-hm.

407
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,463
I like her...

408
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,089
accent.

409
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,432
Hi.
Hi.

410
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,604
I gotta get these pages back in order.
They'll never know the difference.

411
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,945
I'm a little nervous.

412
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,575
Just think of them as something
friendly, like a firing squad.

413
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,582
RON [ON SPEAKER]: Miss Michaels,
we're gonna do a camera test now.

414
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,125
Yes.
RON: Uh...

415
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,296
Let me have a right profile, camera 1.
Camera 3, give me a left profile.

416
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,757
What side?
Left side.

417
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,759
Which way for your left?

418
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,762
What?
Is that my left or your left?

419
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,765
Wait. What are you
talking about? My left.

420
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,391
Your left.

421
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,269
Miss Michaels,
nobody's talking to you.

422
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,438
I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted my profile.

423
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,483
Not so close on camera 3.
Camera 3, back off.

424
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,654
Make her look a little more attractive.
How far can you pull back?

425
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
How do you feel about Cleveland?
Knock it off.

426
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,825
That's good
right there, Herbie.

427

you showed us a while ago.

00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,625
Cue her, Jo.

431
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,003
"I know the kind of woman
you are, Emily.

432
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:28,842
You're getting older. You don't have
a man, so you want to act like one."

433
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:33,054
Shut your mouth right now. When you
talk to me, talk professionally.

434
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:37,058
You don't get personal.
That is inappropriate behaviour.

435

a woman, Dr. Brewster.

inhumanities, sir,

Good day, Dr. Brewster.

441
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,834
I said, good day, sir.

Thank you.
Hold it a minute.

443

Tough cookie.
I gave her that direction.

Something more, though.

about her bothers me. Does it bother you?

446

Congratulate me.

00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,988
Dorothy, it was wonderful
the way you held my face.

822
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,157
You controlled me completely.
I felt your power.

823
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,410
Well, thank you, John, but you
know, you had some great moments.

824

Really?
Yes.

RITA:
Hold it. Good news, children.

Our brilliant engineering staff has once
again erased an entire reel of the show.

Good night, Ben.

That's some day, huh?

835
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,831
What? Oh, you mean about
doing it over again.

836
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,667
Tell me, does
that happen often?

837
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:39,004
Every once in a while. You know, we
actually had to do it live once.

You should have
seen Van Horn's face.

Of course, you couldn't
see Van Horn's face

841
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,761
because he was so panicked we
had to shoot him from the back.

No, thanks. I better
be getting on home.

what you want to hear right now,

00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,113
if you could find it in
your heart to come over

849
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,698

with me tonight.

She hasn't seen you
in the white thing.

856
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:23,256
What, this? You cannot wear white
to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.

You couldn't wear pants?
No. Pants? I can't.

No, no.

I don't have the
right shoes for it,

I hate the way the horizontal
lines make me look too hippy,

across the bust.

"Hey, listen, I'm confused
about this too.

I could lay a big line on you,
we could do a lot of role-playing,

and the water turned off

977
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,584
and I got soap in my eyes.

978
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,586
I had to go to five
different stores to get

chocolate chocolate chip.

been a very special person.

I guess so. I don't
remember her very well.

pick out this wallpaper.

1319

I'd chosen one with great big
purple flowers on it.

1320
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:52,737

you choose it,

of your room for a long, long time."

purple flowers would look like

falling asleep

when I was getting dressed.

01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:21,558
So I said to her, "Which one
would you choose, Mom?"

1328
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:28,064
And she said, "The one with
the daisies and the little rosebuds,

1329
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:33,320
because daisies
are such homey flowers,

1330
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:38,867
and rosebuds are so cheerful
and always waiting to bloom."

My lips are sealed.

1643
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:45,726
You slut.

1644

[IN NORMAL VOICE] Look, don't
start in with me. Don't do that.

a laughing matter.

1646
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:53,901
That guy wanted me.

1647
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:57,404
You cannot believe
the night I have had tonight!

1648
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,907
I think I could imagine.
Oh, no, you can't.

1649
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,159
I saw the look in his eyes.
I was in big trouble.

1650
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:05,454
If you don't come in, I'm in the
Daily News the next morning.

1651
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,289
How did you ever
let him in here?

1652
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,376
What do you mean how did I let him in here?
He was singing.

1653
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,211
Is he that good a singer?
What do you...?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

1655

That's him!

1656
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,216
Tell him I'm in the bedroom
crying. Don't let him in!

1657

SANDY: Michael.
It's Sandy.

1658
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,720
Sandy? It's Sandy?

1659
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,223
I can't let her
see me like this.

1660
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:25,975
SANDY:
I hear you in there.

1661
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,937
Jeff, open the door.
It's me, Sandy. Open the door!

1662
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,730
Sandy, is that you?
SANDY: Yes! It's me!

1663
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:35,150
What time is it?
I fell asleep, I guess.

1664
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:38,070
I was having a nightmare
and you were in it.

1665
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,446
Mike's in the shower.

1666
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:42,449
I'm in the shower! I got soap in my eyes!
I'll be right out.

I'm not dressed. All my clothes
are in the other room.

1668
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,120
I was asleep. I was dreaming.

1669
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,290
Funny, you were in my dream. You had real big
teeth, but you were still a nice person.

Turn on the water!

and there's no water coming out!

Open this door.

The door was open.

You must think I'm really
stupid or something.

1680
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,736
No one would call
you stupid to your face.

Jeff, I've been out
there for 10 minutes.

a party in here or something.

Well, Michael's
in the shower. You know.

Hi, I was taking a shower.
He was in the shower.

Good shower?
Good shower.

01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,542
Why haven't you returned
my phone calls, Michael?

1687

go do some writing. Excuse me.

to give this to you. Here, it's for you.

I suppose this means

Nothing is. Is it?

You treat me like I'm a jerk.
What are you talking about?

Chocolate-covered cherries?

That's sweet.
Oh, and a card.

01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,497
Oh, yeah. No, no!
Don't, don't read it!

This isn't for me.
This is another girl's candy.

1706
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:26,720
I wouldn't give you
another girl's candy, I swear.

is sending you candy?

01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,604
Yes. He's a friend of mine.
He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.

1710
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:39,441
Why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire?

1711

01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,121
Just be honest with me.
Tell me the truth!

For once in your life,
tell me the truth!

1717
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:57,793
Because these stories
are very demeaning to me.

1718
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,587
No matter how bad the truth is,

1719
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:03,715
it doesn't tear you apart
inside like dishonesty.

1720
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,803
At least it leaves you with some
self-respect and some dignity.

01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,097
You're right.

1722
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,519
Okay. Okay.

pretend it was something else!

I never said, "I love you."

You asked me
to be straight with you.

Please, tell me, what can I do?
There's nothing you can do for me.

I just have to feel like this until
I don't feel like this anymore,

No, we are not friends.

I think I should tell you
to shove your play.

1746
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:17,706
But I won't, because
I never allow personal despair

What happened?
I'm sorry.

1758
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,365

She thinks I'm gay.

No, my friend Sandy.

Well, sleep with her.

to get me out of this show.

Dorothy have an accident?

1767
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,969
I mean, we can use our imaginations.
This isn't too tough.

1768
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,346
You want to kill somebody
and bring back the stiff,

1769
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:16,014
that's okay, but she'd
better look exactly like you.

Those people don't miss a trick.
These are nice, good people.

1771
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:24,439
Something is weird about you. Since when do you
care so much about what other people feel?

1772
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,983
I mean, if I didn't
love Julie before,

1773
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,860
you should have seen the look on her
face when she thought I was a lesbian.

1774
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,779
Lesbian? You just said "gay."

1775
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,574
Sandy thinks I'm gay.
Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.

1776
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,117
I thought Dorothy was
supposed to be straight.

01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,493
Dorothy is straight.

1778
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:39,871
Les, the sweetest, nicest man
in the world, asked me to marry him.

1779
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,999
A guy named Les
wants you to marry him?

1780
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,042
Yeah.
No, wants to marry Dorothy.

1781
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,503
Does he know she's a lesbian?
Dorothy's not a lesbian!

1782
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,880
I know that, but does he?
Know what?

1783
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,341
That... Well, I don't know.

1784
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:54,595
You know he gave me a ring?
He gave me a diamond ring.

1785
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,888
What did you say?
What do you mean? I said,

1786
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:58,599
"I gotta think it over."

1787
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:02,352

pissed in the sink. I'm in trouble, man!

You don't have to.

1970
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:07,178
She's right here.

1971
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:11,557
And she misses you.

1972
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:18,523
Look, you don't
know me from Adam.

1973
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:23,569
But I was a better man
with you as a woman

1974
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,489
than I ever was
with a woman as a man.

1975
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,366
You know what I mean?

1976
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:35,331
I just gotta learn to do it
without the dress.

1977
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,337
At this point in our relationship,

1978
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:44,507
there might be an advantage
to my wearing pants.

1979
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:52,515
The hard part's over, you know?

1980
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:55,643
We were already...

1981
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:57,937
good friends.

1982
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:10,825
Will you loan me
that little yellow outfit?

1983
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,034
[♪♪♪]

1984
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,036
Which one?

1985
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,914
The Halston.
The Halston?

1986
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,125
Oh, no!

1987
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:21,669
You'll ruin it.
Michael!

1988
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:24,338
You'll spill wine all over it.
I will not.

1989
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:29,051
I'll loan it to you, but you gotta
give it back. It's my favourite.

1990
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,970
What are you gonna use it for?

1991
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,349
