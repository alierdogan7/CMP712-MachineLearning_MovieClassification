517
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,108
Lab? No, I work at Safeway.

518
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,820
And you don't know anything
about the experiment?

519
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,447
What experiment?

520
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,533
Oh, God!

521
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,786
- The miniaturization experiment.
- No.

Lieutenant Tuck Pendleton.

00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,502
I've been miniaturized.

524
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,047
I was supposed to be injected
into the body of a laboratory rabbit,

525
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,551
and somehow I got inside you instead.

526
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,177
What do you mean, "somehow"? How?

527
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:41,641
All I know is I was inside a syringe
and now I'm inside you.

- Putter.

00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,576
- Putter. This yours?
- Uh, yes.

532
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,578
- I'm from Cook Travel Agency.
- Oh.

00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,413
- Wanna sign on number 12.
- Okay.

534
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,790
I think these are probably cruise
tickets, if I'm not mistaken.

535
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

536
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,419
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,212

538
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,548

- I don't have a roommate.

I heard you talking to someone.

He's not a messenger.

- Never mind. Let's get to the lab.

You mean to tell me
that he can actually talk to you?

574
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,646
Yes. And I can talk to him.

575
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,733
And also, he's able
to see everything that I see.

576
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,651
He's patched into the optic nerve
and the eardrum.

- Doc, this is a guy, not a bunny.
- But the computer doesn't know that.

and makes the proper adjustments.

- Yeah, I can see you.

- Well...
- I'll tell you what went wrong.

who don't know squat about security.

All right, look directly at them.

...explain to you exactly
what's going on.

606
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,192
PETE: Explain it to me then.

607
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,820
We're not the only ones
working towards miniaturization.

608
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,738
Don't you think I know that, Niles?

609
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,491
- Hey, I can hear them.
- TUCK: I know. Shut up and listen.

610
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,826
Sorry.

611
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,204
But we are the first to perfect
the tricky re-enlargement process...

612
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,624
by using two chips.
One of the chips is in the pod.

613
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,126
And the other has been stolen.

614
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,878
Now, what do we do to we save Pendleton?

615
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,463
- Recover the stolen chip.
- Don't you have duplicates?

616
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,132
No! They're prototypes!

617
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,009
That's thinking ahead, Niles.

618
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,635

of course.

- What happens at nine o' clock?

620
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:16,726
By nine o' clock,
his air supply runs out.

621
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,978
PETE: That is no problem.

622
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,647
All he's gotta do is take the pod
to the guy's lungs,

623
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,274
open the hatch and breathe in
all the air he needs.

624
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,984
NILES: He can't open the hatch!

625
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,944
The sudden change in the cabin pressure

626
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,988
would cause the pod
to explode like a balloon.

00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,032
That's right, Einstein.

628
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,910
- Then we don't have to do anything.
- What do you mean?

629
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,996
The stolen chip is useless
without the one inside the pod,

630
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,539
and we've got that one.

631
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,541
You build your duplicates.

632
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,003
It doesn't matter how long it takes.
Then we'll be back in business.

- And what about Pendleton?
- We can't save him. That's too bad.

01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:30,363
Jack! It's Wendy! My God, Jack!

1027
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,073
- Wendy!
- Look at you!

1028
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,534
- Well, look at you!
- I'm going in before we lose him.

1029
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,327
- All right.
- I'm with him!

1030
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,037
She's with me.

1031
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:48,798
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

1032
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,743
Hey, Cowboy!

1033
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,728
Oh!

1034
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,163
I can't believe it, Jack!

1035
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,166
This is so exciting! Oh!

1036
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,835
How long have you been leading
this double life?

1037
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,630
Oh, for a while now.

1038
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:18,846
Women... love me.

1039
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,723
But you know that.

1040
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:25,770
But for serious,
two things you want to know about me:

1041
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,106
One: I make love with my boots on.

1042
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,484
And two...

1043
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,736
(WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)

1044
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,616
I know I've been mean to you, Jack.

1045
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,285
I can... Oh!
...just be such a shit sometimes.

1046
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:44,080
Uh... It doesn't really matter.

1047
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,416
It's because on account of my life
sucking the way it does.

1048
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,002
I'm a complete mess, you know.

1049
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,714
- You know?
- Yeah.

1050
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:59,136
You're probably the only person at
the supermarket I haven't slept with.

1051
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,180
And it's like... you're the only person

1052
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,891
I'm even partially attracted to.

1053
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,769
Thank you.

1054
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,815
That lady is signaling you.

1055
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,822
Oh, I came with her,

1056
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,700
I should find out
what she wants, I think.

1057
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,207
I found out something.

1058
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,835
The Cowboy is meeting
with Scrimshaw early this morning.

1059
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,045
They are picking him up at the hotel.

1060
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,756
They are gonna give him the microchip.

1061
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,553
Cowboy.

1062
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,346
This is Jack.

1063
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,890
- Hey, Cowboy.
- Howdy, big Jack.

1064
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,394
Let's go buffalo gal.

1065
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,731
Let's split this... no right scene.

1066
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:54,400
He's taking me to the hotel. Follow us.

1067
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,823
- Wendy.
- Hi.

1068
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,826
- Uh, I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Call me later?

1069
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,328
Sure.

1070
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,421
- TUCK: Hurry up!
- I am hurrying up, okay?

1071
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:17,381
I don't want to see her alone
with that sleazy Cowboy

1072
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,343
- any more than you do.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

1073
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,095
I just don't, that's why.

1074
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:26,432
God, I can't believe how hostile
I feel toward you right now.

1075
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,185
Because I'm stimulating
your adrenal gland, pal.

1076
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,395
Yeah, well, maybe that's
the reason and maybe not.

1077
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:34,523
Look, you got something to say,
why don't you say it.

1078
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,442
She deserves better. That's all.

1079
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,778
- Better than what?
- Better than you.

1080
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:39,987
Oh! I knew it!

1081
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,490
You think she goes for you,
don't you, pal?

1082
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,284
You know what she sees in you, Jack?
She sees me.

1083
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,454
All right, Pendleton, that's it.
Where are you?

1084
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,665
Where are you, you little weasel?

1085
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,667
Save it for the Cowboy.

1086
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,384
Ah! Wrong door!

1087
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,638
That's an exit, Jack.
Come on, now, control it.

1088
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,765
Come on, you're
a dangerous individual, Jack.

1089
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,809
Come on, you can do it!

1090
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,812
Big Jack!

1091
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,189
Don't knock, just come!

1092
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,149
Duke the son of a bitch!

1093
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,611
Jack?

1094
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:24,865
- Where were you?
- Next door waiting for you.

1095
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,368
Beauty punch anyway, big Jack.

1096
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:32,289
That's it, now tie that sucker tight.
He's gonna squirm when he wakes up.

1097
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:36,335
There, now look at the Cowboy.

1098
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,672
Hold it! Hold it right there.

1099
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,468

Contour analysis, stage one.

1101
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,181
Move over, Picasso. Look at this.

1102
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,517
Grid-mapping ectodermal contours.

1103
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,060
Okay, go to the mirror.

1104
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,896
Mirror, oh... What are we gonna do?

1105
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,815
I'm going to attempt
an electronic stimulation

1106
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,151
- of your nerves and muscles.
- What's that mean?

1107
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,737
- I'm gonna alter your face.
- My face?

1108
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,447
Change my face? How do you do that?

1109
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,949
Uh... Eh... It's complicated.

1110
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:10,536
I don't even understand it myself.
But just... trust me.

1111
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,996
Will it hurt?

1112
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,123
Uh... yeah.

1113
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,791
Well, let's not do it then.

What are you doing in there?

Are you okay?

1117
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,261
We're getting there, Jack!

1118
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,765

Is that a five or a six?

1122
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,279
No, I'm right, it's a five.

- Jack!
- Jack?

- I'm Jack.
- No! You get away from me!

I'm Jack. Listen to my voice. It's me.

1129

Then who's in the bathroom?

1130
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,553
- He is.
- Who is?

1131
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,930
- Him.
- Who?

1132
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,598
The Cowboy.

1133

Sorry. I know it's hard to understand.

1134
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:17,520
It's hard for me to understand.
But you just have to believe me

1135

- and... and trust me.
- Jack?

I can explain it later,
but now is not the time...

- How did you get Jack's hair?
- I'm not too sure about that one.

- Oh, my God.

How?

I only write about.

- Almost six years.

- Idi Amin's barbecue.

we saw each other, have you?

we seem to have a rather...

attractive added starter
here this morning.

- Fine. I take what your got.

You do understand,

1199
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,165
the first chip only miniaturizes.

1200
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,877
Both are required for re-enlargement.

1201
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,547
Right. We whet their appetites

- Good point, Cowboy.
- Thank you.

- Thank you.

Now, I want you to reach out...

1208

and put it in your pocket.

1209
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:42,451
Gee, it's so tiny. Who would think?

1210

Jack, what are you doing?

1211
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,417
Take the chip.
Come on, don't freeze up on me.

1212
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,049
I wonder, miss,
if Cowboy's ever told you

1213
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:59,051
of his incredible tolerance for pain?

1214
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,344
- His what?
- His what?

1215
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,889
- His what?
- His ability to withstand pain.

1216
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,434
Why, his stoicism is legendary.

1219
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:15,067
- If that is who you are.
- Uh-oh.

1220

on that point?

- No!
