561

And the story it tells is very disturbing.

562
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,327
Every hundred million years or so,

563
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,562

564
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,091

565
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,130
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

Ugh! Yuck.

567
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,449
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

568
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,846
an asteroid hit.

569
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,162
Boom! Bye-bye.

570
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,449

won't save us this time.

Hey, that wasn't there before.

583
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,923
And look what it's doing to the sky.

584
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,321
No worries. Because I've got a plan.

585
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,051
Really? To stop an asteroid?

586
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,648
Look, the last two asteroids

587
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,722
have pummeled the earth in the same spot.

588
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,803
And it's about to happen again.

589
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,485
We've got to go there

590
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,324
and see what's attracting the asteroid.

591
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,330
Once we know why it's coming...

592
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,721
we can figure out how to send it
somewhere else.

593
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,405
That plan is so dumb,

594
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,767
I wish it had a face so I could smack it.

595
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,967
Let me get this straight.

596
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,606
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

597
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,967
you want us to run directly towards it?

598
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,090
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

599
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,447
it'll kill us no matter where we went.

600
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,250
Well, that's reassuring.

601

we get to the crash site...

the face of the Earth,

but some escaped.

607

the happiest day of your life!

768
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,011
let her stroll into the wilderness...

769
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,003

770

Come on, El, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

No. I'm not still mad.

773
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,725
Because that's not how I want to spend

774
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,370
what could be our final days together.

775
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,085

Well, I've been thinking about that, too.

780
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,131
What if...

781
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,641
Ooh. I know! We destroy
the relationship, right?

782
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,404
That way we never have to let her go...

783
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,325
and she'll just stay
our little girl forever!

Oh! That's better.

788

I like it. But how?

789
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,082
The way we always
get her to do what we want.

790
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,481
We make her think it's her idea.

Ooh. Pythagoras Buck.
He's got the right angle.

What if we use the magnets to attract
the asteroids somewhere else?

835
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,764
As in, not towards Earth.

836
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,961
Theoretically speaking, if we can
launch enough of these into space...

837
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,527
they will pull the asteroid off course.

838
