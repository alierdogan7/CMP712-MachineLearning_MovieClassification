Well, you look like
you could use one.

Hm!

Who couldn't?

221
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,120
I've had, uh...

222
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,640
Four, five, maybe. I don't know...

223
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,640
They're darn tasty.

224
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,080
Margaritas always
taste better in Mexico.

225
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
They certainly do.

226
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,320
Margaritas and cock.

- Don't worry.

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,120
- I'm not trying to make a pass at you.
- I'm not worried.

230
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,840
If you're that type of guy...

231
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,240
- I don't mean to be rude but...
- It's all right.

232
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm just messin' with ya.

233
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm sorry about
the cock comment.

234
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,480
Kind of a conversation stopper.

235
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,560
Kinda.

236
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,920
Yeah.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,560
So? What are you
doing in Mexico?

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160

Why the hell do you care
why I'm in Mexico?

244
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,920
- Why so interested, huh?
- No reason. Just...

245
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,520
...hotel bar conversation, I guess.

246
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
Are you with the farm?

247
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,200
- What's that?
- The agency?

248
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,400

- Are you following me?

I have no idea
what you're talk...

251
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,680
Did I fucking make you? Hm?

252
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,440
OK. I'm going to excuse myself.

253
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,480
- I have to go, thank you.
- No. No, please.

254
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,520
No, I'm really tired.

255
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,080
No, no, please.
I didn't mean to weird you out.

256
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,520
I just get paranoid sometimes.
I was wrong. Please.

257
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm drunk. I'm tired.

258
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,840
I've been fornicating
for the last two hours,

259
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,920
and, before that,
I was doing shit...

260
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,080
Horrible business shit...

261
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
Please... come on.

262
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,800
I was out of order.

263
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Let's finish our drink.
Oome on.

264
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,960
Here you go.

265
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,160
Here you are.
Here's your drink.

266
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,640
Danny?
Here you go.

267
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,160
I mean, you seem
like a nice guy.

268
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,560
You know, a normal guy.

269
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,440
Really, it's all right.

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,160
So...

272
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,040
...you in town on business?

273
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,040
Hm?

274
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,080
You have that way
about you, Danny.

275
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400

- Yeah?

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
Ah, very good.

280
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
Oh, I'm here on business.

281
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,440

a very good pitch session.

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,840

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,080
Well, that's fantastic.

288
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,560
That's great, Danny.

289
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,880
I needed a day like this.

290
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I hear ya.

291
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,840
I've had a tough couple years.

292
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,800
I was with this business
out of Denver for nine years.

293
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,360
And out of the blue they just...

294
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,720
- They laid me off.
- Oh...

295
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,520
Yeah. Just like that.

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,160
And it was, I don't know,
two and a half years ago.

297
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,560
- I've been struggling back ever since.
- And today you got back.

298
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Well, I hope.

299
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,480
Today you're a man again.

300
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah.

301
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,600
And to be a man,
after they fuck you

302
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,680
and destroy your self-respect...

303
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,040
Well, that is a great thing.

304
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,800

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,720

306
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,440
Are you married, Danny?

307
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,080
Oh, yeah, I am.
Fourteen years.

308
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,360
Oh... let me guess.
High school sweetheart.

309
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,120
It's true.

310
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
Unbelievable.

311
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,400
The fuckin' American dream, huh?

312
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah. What about you?

313
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,360
What do you do for a living?

315

You got kids, Danny?

316
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,120
Oh, no.
I crossed the line.

317
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,760
No, no, no. You did not.

318
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,640
- I did.
- You did not cross the line.

319
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,920
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

320
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,360
It's fine.

321
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,240
We lost our son three years ago.

322
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
It was a school bus accident.

323
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,840
Fourteen children lived that day...

324
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,440
...and one died.

325
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
That was Henry.

326
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,840
We, uh...

327
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,240
...had a bad run for a while.

328
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

329
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
What?

330
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,320
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

331
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,440
One's a midget, and the other's got
a dick 15 inches long.

332
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,560
W-what are you saying?

333
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm trying to change the subject.
The midget says to the bartender,

334
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,360
"They call my amigo
the human swizzle stick.

335
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,360
You know what they
call me?"

336
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
This is incredible.

337
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,880
What?

338
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,520
You're... very rude.

339
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,320
I'm trying to change the subject.

340
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,680
Thank you very much
for the drink.

341
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,720
Goodbye. Good night.
Thank you.

343
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,240

362
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,560
My cell phone.
I think I left it at the front desk.

363
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,360
- Watch my stuff for a sec?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

364
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,160
- [Julian] Staying a few days?
- What?

365
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,360
I couldn't help but overhear.

366
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
Yeah. So you're spying

367
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,080
on my personal conversations
now, huh? Great.

368
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,680
Something about the asshole buyers
not being completely convinced.

369
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
And now wanted to hear
other pitches?

370
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Pfff!

371
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,880
Sorry about that.

372
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,800
I-I knew things
were too good to be true anyway.

373
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,320
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
but I'm glad you're still in town.

374
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,600
It gives me the opportunity to tell you
how truly embarrassed I am

375
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,400
about last night.
See? See, the thing is...

376
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
I liked you.

377
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,680
I kind of enjoyed
talking to someone, you know,

378
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,480
just... talking.

379
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

380
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,640
And yet...

381
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I tell you about my dead son,

382
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,320
and you mock it.

383
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,920
I lost my wife.

384
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,160
I was 24 years old,
I was drunk,

385
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,520
I plowed our car
into an oak tree.

386
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,680
Jesus.

387
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,600
Since then, I've soiled
my way through life,

388
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,000
been a magnificently cold moron.

389
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,360
I run away from anything
that resembles an emotion.

390
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,720
Thus, you tell me
about your dead son,

391
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
I tell you a joke
about a 15-inch schlong.

392
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,040
So you can forgive me, huh?

393
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,520
[Phil] Got it!

394
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,640
Better I remember it now
than somewhere over Amarillo.

395
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,880
Right.

396
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
All right.
Speak to you mañana, right?

397
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,000
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know.

399
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,640
Danny?
Hey, Danny.

400
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Wait. Hey.

401
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,560
I've got an extra ticket to
the bullfights this afternoon.

402
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,160
Supposed to be a good one.

403
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,240
It would mean a great deal
to me if you would join me.

404
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,200
Oh, I'm so...
Thank you.

405
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you,

406
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,680
and I... I can't.

407
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
I can't. I have work.

408
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,640
On a Sunday afternoon?

409
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,840
Ever seen a bullfight?

410
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
No.

411
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,240
You haven't seen the real Mexico Oity
until you've seen a bullfight.

412
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Oome on.

413
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,760

Bean is not gonna believe this.

421
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,800
I can't wait to tell her.

422
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,880
[Laughs] Where did you
ever find a woman like that?

423
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
A woman you can share
everything with.

424
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,520
She's pretty special.

425
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,720
You must be too.

426
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,240
- I could learn from you.
- [Scoffs] Learn what?

427
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,600
You want my mortgage,
my blood pressure?

428
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,800
I've never had
my blood pressure taken,

429
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,880
and I wouldn't know
how to get a mortgage

430
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,880
for all the teenage twat
in Thailand.

431
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
You don't own a house?

432
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,360
No house.

433
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,080
No apartment, no address.

434
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,640
- You bullshittin' me?
- I shit you not. Montecristo?

435
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,920
Uh... yeah!

436
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,240
Thanks.

437
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,000
You don't have a permanent address?
Where do you live?

438
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,280
- I live wherever I'm working.
- So, what do you do, Julian?

439
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,000
What do you possibly do you don't have
a permanent home or an address?

440
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,800
I'd rather not say.

441
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Oh, my God,
did you see that?

442
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,960
Jeez, it's so bloody.

443
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
We're lucky.
That matador was very good.

444
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,280
It's much worse
when they're mediocre.

445
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,200
- Why?
- A great matador,

446
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,920
he can kill the bull with
one plunge of the blade.

447
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,760
A lesser one,
he's going to have to

448
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,480
plunge that blade
more than once.

449
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,960
That makes the crowd
very unhappy.

450
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,080
They don't like to see
the bull suffer.

451
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,160
No.

452
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,000
No, no. They clearly care
so very much about these animals.

453
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,640
They respect these beasts.

454
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,080
They want 'em to die with honor.

455
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,640
That's ridiculous.
There's no honor in being killed

456
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,080
by a man with a sword
whether it's one plunge or 20.

457
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,520
Ah, you're wrong.

458
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,880
You're very wrong.

459
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,480
There is honor.

460
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,760
How would you know?

461
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,520
I do.

462
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,480
You're a mysterious man, Julian.

463
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,760
Mm-hm.

[Bull roars]

466
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,240
- [Danny] You won't tell me what you do?
- It's... confidential.

467
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,480
Oonfidential?

468
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,640
What, do you work
for the government?

469
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,640
The government?
Pfff! Please.

470
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,120
You know what they pay?

471
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,200
Hmph! Forget it.
Watch the picadors.

472
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,880
- You a spy? Something like that?
- You read too many novels, Danny.

473
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,000
Huh? You a spy?

474
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
Huh?

475
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,840
So now you're not going
to tell me. It's OK.

476
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,680
It's OK.

477
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,040
All right.

478
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,040
Hm. All right.

479
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
If I tell you,
will you keep your cool?

480
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,520
- What do you mean?
- We're in public,

481
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,480
and I don't want you
to lose your shit.

482
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,800
Lose my shit?

483
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,480
My God, w-what
are you gonna tell me?

484
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,880
Sometimes...

485
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,040
Sometimes what?

486
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,520
Sometimes...

487
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,080
...people need to be eliminated.

488
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,840
Oh, come on!

What? You're...

491
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,880
- You're a hit man?
- Oh, please.

492
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Please. My handler...

493
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,080
...calls me a facilitator.

494
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
A facilitator of fatalities.

495
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
That's insane.

496
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,560
Think what you like.

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,280
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,

498
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,840
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.

499
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.

I sell aluminum siding
in Minneapolis.

501
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,800
- You actually kill people for a living?
- I do what I'm asked to do.

anonymous high-paying jobs.

I'm a great helper
in getting deals closed.

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,320
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

- I don't believe you.

Oome on! Oorporate gigs.

- Think what you will.
- Ridiculous.

- Yes!
- Oorporate gigs.

514
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,520
Yes! My God...

515
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.

516
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,480
Uh-huh.

517
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
All right, see that guy over there?

518

- Fat man and little girl?
- Yeah.

519
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
Say I wanted him dead.

520
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,760
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.

521
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,960
- Right here.
- Right now? Oouldn't happen.

522
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,960
I know, but say that it could.

523
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
- Money's no object.
- OK.

524
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,280
- You sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

525
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

526
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,080
I want you to facilitate it.

527
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,920
OK, Danny.

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,600
Now...

539
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,520
...ask me for a cigarette.

540
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,000
- What?
- Do it.

541
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Oan I have a cigarette, please?

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,360
Sure. But these things'll
kill ya, you know. [laughs]

543
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,720
Now, look around.

544
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
[Coughs]

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
They're scary.

546
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
- Yes and no.
- Why?

547
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,160
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women

548
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
coming and going
from the ladies' room.

549
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,440
That's good for us.

550
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,360
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.

551
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
They're only interested in us

552
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,720
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.

553
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,120
No one is watching
the men's room.

554
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
The gotta-pee theory.

555
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,840
You're catching on.

556
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,920
Now, escape routes.

557
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,440
- Escape routes?
- Don't wanna get caught, right?

558
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,880
Don't get caught, it sucks.

559
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,240
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

560
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,560
That's a traffic jam.

561
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,200
- Where else?
- You tell me.

562
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
OK, OK.

563
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,160
Uh, that door over there.

564
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,800
If it... if it weren't locked.

565
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,880
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together

566
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
I couldn't get a whiff
of her spring roll.

567
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,960
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.

568
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
Every lock can be broken.

569
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.

570
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,960
This looks like it's worth it.

571
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,880
[Julian] Uno cigarillos, por favor.

572
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,760
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

573
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
'Oause I wanna smoke.

574
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Gracias.

575
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,880
Oome over here.

576
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,560
Now do your shoelaces up.

577
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,760
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?

578
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,080
I think 2:00, Derrick.

579
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Let's go, Seymour.

580
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,280
[Cheering]

581
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
Holy shit!

582
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
[Chuckles]

583
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
[Crowd cheering]

584
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,880
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

585
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,640
You wanted to see
what I do, right?

586
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes.

587
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,520
Yes, I've been watching.

588
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,480
- But, you know...
- What? Show-and-tell is over.

589
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,720
The real deal is about to start.

590
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,680
- The real deal?
- Mm-hm.

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,520
Show-and-tell is for sissies.

592
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,280
But a sissy I'm not.

593
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,000
- Oome on!
- My God, fire!

594
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,360
- Oome on. It's a distraction.
- Are you crazy?

595
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,800
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.

596
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,920
Are you ready to finish
what we started?

597
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,640
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.

598
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,920
Baloney! Baloney!

599
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,280
The cops may have
gone towards the fire,

600
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,440
- but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
- Bodyguard?

601
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.

602
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,520
If they didn't, they'd ask you.

603
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
So I slit the guard's throat
in one move,

604
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,040
push him into the bathroom...

605
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,280
And now we're set up for the kill.

606
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,920
Where the hell
did you get the knife?

607
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,240
He's not peeing,
so it must be number dos.

608
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,600
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.

609
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,040
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Point made.

610
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
The point's made.
Let's get out of here...

611
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.

612
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,360
OK. Julian?

613
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm asking you to stop this!

614
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,120
No way, job's not done.

615
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,360
But this is not a job!

616
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,760
You said money was no object!

617
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,800
# Bingo was his name-o #

618
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
- This is want you wanted?
- No!

619
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
- You helped me.
- I didn't help you!

620
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,400
Oh, yes, you did!

621
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
- Oh, yes, you did!
- No! No, no.

622
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
Oh, God, no!

623
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,360
Oh! Disculpa me, por favor.

624
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,720
Lo siento.

625
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Fun, huh?

626
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,680
[Laughing]

627
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,640
Oome on. [laughing]

628
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,520
[Danny] Whoo-hoo!
That was incredible!

629
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,360
- You scared the hell out of me!
- You liked that. You did?

630
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,080
- I really bought it!
- What, that I'd stab a stranger?

631
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,720
[Laughing] I don't know.

632
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Just like that?
A complete stranger?

633
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,080
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.

634
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,960
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know.

635
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
- Psychopathic, not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

636
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,480
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?

637
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, yeah, but...

638
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,120
- Don't get the wrong impression.
- Huh?

639
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.

640
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,560
No, what you do is unsavory.

641
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,040
You know what they say.
You are what you do.

642
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
Gracias.

643
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,920
Gracias.

644
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Tell me...

645
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,440
...will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?

646
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,240
- What?
- Will Bean stay with you

647
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,480
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?

648
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
If she ever left me
I'd fall apart...

649
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,440
You're not answering my question.

650
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
To be quite honest...

651
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,400
...I don't know how much faith
the woman has left in her.

652
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,280
[Sighs] Hey.

653
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,840
Hey.

654
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,560
Oomforting me?

655
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,840
- Hey.
- Let's change the subject. Please.

656
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
- I agree.
- Something sunnier.

657
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,880
Sunnier.

658
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Absolutely.

659
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,640
There's something
I wanted to talk about.

660
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,440
- It's a favor, really.
- Sure.

661
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.

662
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,560
No, it's OK.

663
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,080
See, the thing is...

664
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,920
...I could use your help.

665
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Help in what?

666
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,120
I'm down here,

667
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,240
I finished my otherjob early,
so I let it be known.

668
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
You let it be known?

669
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,080
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.

670
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,280
- The powers that be?
- Yeah.

671
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,480
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.

672
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,840
An-anotherjob?

673
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Mm-hm.

674
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,720
Jesus Ohrist.

675
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,440
The thing is, I could
really use your help.

676
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
Oh! [laughs]

677
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,280
You're kidding right now.

678
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm as serious
as an erection problem.

679
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,080
- I mean, I...
- Gracias.

680
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,560
I can't help you, Julian.

681
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,960
You could.

682
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Well, I could, but I-I can't,

683
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm not gonna help
kill an innocent man.

684
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,040
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous.

685
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,280
- Just assisting.
- No!

686
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
- You'd just have to...
- No, no, no, no!

687
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

688
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,680
- Bup...
- You're being childish.

689
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka...

690
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,240
- Not listening.
- Ohildish.

691
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you...

692
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,200
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
- All right. All right.

693
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,600
I won't tell you.

694
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,640
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

695
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,040
- Great.
- I won't say that

696
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,000
all you have to do
is trip on the street.

697
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,120
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Just trip in half an hour

698
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
- so his bodyguards look the other way.
- No way.

699
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,480
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.

700
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,080
- No.
- A lot of money. Oash.

701
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,080
- It could be interesting and fun.
- I said no.

702
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,800
He's a prick, a real prick!

703
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,080
I don't give a darn
who he is or what he did

704
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,440
or anything like that.

705
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,880
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.

706
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,800
And if you bring it up again,
I'll... I'll leave.

707
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,040
[Julian clears throat]

708
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
- Fine.
- Fine.

709
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
- Ohange the subject.
- Good. You do it.

710
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,520
- Ohange it.
- You.

711
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,440
- Fine.
- OK.

712
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,280
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

713
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,960
Really. A cheerleader.

714
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,440
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

715
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,080
Seriously?

716
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,800
Mm-hm.

717
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,960
That's so funny.

718
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,960
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader...

719
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,320
Jesus Ohrist, Danny!
I'm fucking kidding!

720
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,360
I don't want to
talk about cheerleaders

721
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,880
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them!

722
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,160
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to!

723
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,480
There's nothing
to talk about!

724
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,800
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.

725
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, come...
Now, Julian...

726
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Oome on, what are you...
You're leaving?

727
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,080
I've got business to attend to.

728
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,080
- I really thought...
- Nothing.

729
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,560
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.

730
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,520
Bye, Danny.

731
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,840
Julian!

732
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,560
[Phil] So unfortunately,
I was right.

733
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,720
I finally got in touch with Alejandra

734
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,160
and she said her bosses are

735
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,480
leaning towards Cardenas
and his group,

736
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,920
and not us.

737
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
Now, things still might
break in our favor.

738
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,920
I mean, their first instinct
was to go with us,

739
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,960
but they're getting intense pressure

740
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
to sign with a Mexican company.

741
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm trying to get Antonio
so I can set up

742
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,240
one more meeting
with you guys tomorrow.

743
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,160
I'll call you
when I hear something.

744
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,920
So hang in there.
It's not over yet.

745
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,880
- [Hangs up]
- [Operator speaks Spanish]

746
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,760
- [Knocking]
- [Julian] Danny.

747
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,880
Danny, it's Julian.

748
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
Oome on, Danny,

749
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,520
I just want to say I'm sorry.

750
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,040
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

751
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,680
But... I'm sorry.

752
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,760
I'm a mess! I'm a fucker! Ha!

753
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,840
[Sighs] Look, I shouldn't
have asked you to help me.

754
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,880
I infringed...
I infringed on your kindness,

755
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
but please...

756
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
...let me tell you I'm sorry.

757
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,000
Let me apologize.

758
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Oan't you see
how guilty I feel?

759
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,920
Danny!

760
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,960
Danny!

Oh, yes.

00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,440
Hello, Julian.

777
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,280
Getting some culture?

778
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,000
Anytime I can.

779
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,560
You look tired.

780
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,480
I am.

781
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,480
- I need a break.
- What are you saying, Julian?

782
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,320
Moscow, Las Vegas,
Vienna, the Philippines.

783
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,600
Now Budapest. I'm exhausted.

784
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,240
Well, you know what it's like.

785
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,280
You take a break,
we go with a younger, cheaper kid.

786
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,840
- Oh.
- He does all right.

787
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,280
Maybe we don't want you back when
you're ready to get back in the game.

788
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,800
You'll always want me.

789
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,720
No, not always.

790
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,280
Not if we can save a few dollars.

791
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,480
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manila.

792
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,720
That was one time.

793
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,520
Made some people nervous.

794
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,800
It made me nervous.

795
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,560
Well, that's why
I need a break.

796
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,520
I don't want to have
that happen again.

797
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,200
- It can't.
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

798
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,080
But I'm feeling burnt-out,
I'm feeling...

799
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,400
...shaky.

00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,240
Oan you believe this shit?

801
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,560
I mean, can you believe
the words coming out of my mouth?

802
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,040
Did you ever think
you'd live to see the day?

803
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,200
I never thought you'd
live to see the day.

There's not a retirement home
for assassins, is there?

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,240

I don't know if they'll
let you back in.

809
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,880
And then what
are you gonna do?

810
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,120
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers

811
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280

812
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,360
- Sounds delightful to me.
- Julian, do this job.

813
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,240
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.

The problem is Julian Noble.

deliver the portfolio.

00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,200
Mr. Stick is upset.

831

Mr. Stick knows?

00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,720
Mr. Stick knows.

833
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,080
Well, he knows we can fix it.

834
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,120
I'm just the messenger.

835
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,280
But he knows we can fix it.

836
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,200
We always fix any problems.

837
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
You can't fix it with Noble.

838

839
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,680
All right. I'll replace him.

840
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,920
No.

841
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,280
Yes, you'll replace him,

842
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,720
but no.

843
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,080
Mr. Stick has asked
for other things.

844
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,040
No, it's ridiculous.

845
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,720
Julian has been
with us for 22 years.

It's such a long time, really,
when you think about it.

861

Seems like yesterday, right?

862
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,840
Henry was alive...

863
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,640
...here.

864
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,400
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.

865
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,440
And they called me Hippo Hips

866
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,600
and Plate of Beans, the works.

867
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,080
And even though I did basketball

868
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,320
and... and chorus and...

869
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,080
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong...

870
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,280
...I never was.

871
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,560
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.

872
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,920
And I...

873
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,800
I always thought
I would believe them.

874
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,960
Until I met you.

875
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,920
You arrived in 12th grade...

876
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,080
...and you told me
that I was pretty.

877
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,920
And for the first time,
I believed it.

878
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,800
You told me that I was sexy.

879
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,320
You were sexy back there
on the dryer.

880
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,240
And when Henry died...

881
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,120
[crying]... you told me
to stay strong...

882
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,080
...and that we would
get through it.

883
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,400
And we did.

884
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,920
We did.

885
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,200
It's because you
never gave up on me.

886
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,440
I never could.

887
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
I never will.

888
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,880
[Doorbell ringing]

889
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,600
Who could that be
at 11:30 at night?

890
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,800
[Doorbell continues ringing]

891
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,040
[Knocking on door]

892
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,440
Yeah?

893
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,520
[Julian] Danny Wright?

894
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,360
Yes. Who's there?

895
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,320
Danny, Danny!

896
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,880
Danny with the large white fanny!

897
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,600
- Julian!
- Would you mind opening up, Danny?

898
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,600
It's freezing out here!
My balls are like bonbons!

899
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,800
[Laughing]

900
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,640
I was praying
you'd remember me.

901
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,960
It's been a spell.

902
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,400
[Chuckles]

903
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,960
Please, please, come on...

904
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,880
- Oome on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

905
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,240
[Laughs]

906
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,160
Oooh!

907
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,760
Hey.

908
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,040
Oh, I decided to...

909
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,800
How did you find me?

910
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,920
I found a whore
with a heart of gold once.

911
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,760
I can find Danny Wright's card
in my address book.

912
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,120
[Giggles]

913
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,360
Oh.

914
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,600
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize. Sorry.

915
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,080
It's OK.

916
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,000
You must be Bean.

917
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,920
- My wife.
- Oh, this...

918
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,880
- Um...
- Oh, my...

919
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,200
My boots.

920
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,240
I've heard so much about you.

921
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,560
And me, you.

922
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh...

923
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,240
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.

924
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,000
[Chuckling] Danny...

925
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,680
I always said you were
the luckiest man I ever met.

926
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,440
Well...

927
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,360
What are you doing here, Julian?

928
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,440
I really don't know.

929
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,800
I don't know.

930
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,320
I hope it's all right, my being here.
I mean...

931
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,920
I guess it's the middle
of the night. [chuckling]

932
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,080
- Yes, it's...
- Well...

933
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,760
I could sure use some coffee.

934
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,760
Just a cup.

935
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,680
Yes. All right.

936
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,280
Of course.
I could get coffee.

937
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,040
That'd be great.

938
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,800
- Or some whiskey?
- Even better.

939
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,760
- Mm.
- Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.

940
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,280
And song and dance.

941
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,000
Well, whiskey, at least.

942
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,360
This is really odd.

943
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,320
Really, really odd.

944
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,200
I could ask him to leave.

945
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,200
We just asked him to stay.

946
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,240
We could change our minds.

947
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,960
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

948
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,920
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

949
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,160
But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.

950
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,960
You said he was a nice guy.

951
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,480
He is. For an assassin,
he's... very nice.

952
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,920
Fuck.

953
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,480
Fuckity-fuck!

954
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,760
What? I'm allowed to curse.

955
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,520
Especially now.
If not now, when?

956
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,240
True.

957
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,000
This is the fucking perfect time

958
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,720
to be fucking cursing.

959
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,360
There's a fucking killer

960
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,280
standing in our
fucking living room.

961
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,000
Do you think he
would show me his gun?

962
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,120
[Bean] A toast, maybe?

963
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,840
To a stranger,

964
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,200
arriving in
the middle of the night.

965
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,720
Well, you're not a stranger.

966
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,600
Well, I'm pretty strange.

967
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,480
Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.

968
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,960
Far from it.

969
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,080
The toast really
should be to you, Danny.

970
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,560
And to you, Bean.

971
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,440
For your hospitality
and your warmth.

972
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,920
- Oh.
- [Coughs]

973
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,840
Hmm! [chuckling]

974
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,240
I never thought
I'd see you again, Julian.

975
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,360
I never thought
I'd see you again, Danny.

976
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,600
But, well...

977
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,040
...things, uh...

978
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,880
Things change.
They just change.

979
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,720
[Julian] Is that...?

980
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,800
- You saved it.
- I did.

981
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,800
You saved it.
I can't believe it.

982
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,200
- [Bean] He still talks about that.
- No, it's...

983
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,200
It touches me
that you kept it.

984
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,560
How could I not?

985
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,080
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

986
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,720
So Danny told you what I did?

987
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,880
Professionally?

988
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,160
Did you bring your gun?

989
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,400
Yes... as a matter of fact.

990
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,320
May I see it?

991
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,880
Really?

992
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,080
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's notjust...

993
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,440
- Here you go.
- OK.

994
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,920
Is that a.38?

995
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,600
Yes, it is.

996
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,040
You know your guns, Bean.

997
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,360
Yes, well...

998
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,040
My God.

999
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,880
You are a magnificent woman.

1000
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,240
Hm.

1001
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,440
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.

1002
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,120
Bean, tell me,

1003
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,080
did Danny tell you everything

1004
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,280
about our time
in Mexico together?

1005
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,280
Yes, I'm sure. Why?

1006
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,840
Oh.

1007
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,200
My God, you look great, Danny.

1008
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,880
[Laughing] Really great.

1009
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,280
- You do too, Julian.
- Oh, no.

1010
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,000
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning

1011
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,000
after the Navy left town.

1012
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,160
But you...

1013
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,520
Life's been good to you,
am I right?

1014
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,040
Pretty good, yeah.

1015
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,440
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?

1016
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,120
I do.

1017
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,360
So you got thatjob
you were in Mexico for?

1018
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,640
We did.

1019
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,600
And your luck?
It's better, right?

1020
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,600
No more trees in the kitchen?

1021
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,160
You told him about that?

1022
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,440
And you love Bean
more than ever.

1023
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,880
Mm. That I do.

1024
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,680
Then what more could you want?

1025
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,920
Here's a toast.

1026
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,400
To a man with respect again,

1027
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,960
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves

1028
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,760
and to me.

1029
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,800
What is the toast to you for?

1030
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,080
Toast to a dead man, Bean.

1031
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,440
Toast to a dead man.

1032
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,960
[Julian] Then about two months ago
I had this job in Manila.

1033
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,440
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.

1034
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,880
I like the hot climate.

1035
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,440
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.

1036
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,560
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.

1037
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,960
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what "burnt-out" meant at the time.

1038
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,840
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.

1039
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,360
[Julian] I was having panic attacks.

1040
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,560
I was completely
losing control of myself.

1041
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,920
I tried to counter this
with booze, of course,

1042
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,800
but nothing was working.

1043
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,920
I drank and drank and...

1044
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,400
...nothing.

1045
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,920
I was still feeling edgy,

1046
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,840
still feeling like
my head was going to explode.

1047
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,400
So...

1048
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
...I moved on
to my other usual diversions.

1049
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,240
A wonderful little
whorehouse I knew

1050
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,440
right off of Mabini Street.

1051
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,120
But that wasn't workin'either.

1052
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
And a good fuck usually does.

1053
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,680
Excuse my French.

1054
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,360
- Go on.
- So I had this assignment.

1055
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,000
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,

1056
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,720
someone doesn't
want him around.

1057
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,040
You know,
my usual type gig.

1058
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,040
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy

1059
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,720
always came to this sweaty little
outdoor market every Thursday

1060
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,040
to buy fruit.

1061
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,080
The guy liked his fruit.

1062
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,000
[Monkeys chattering]

1063
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,160
It was a simple plan.

1064
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,080
As he walks through the crowds
I bump into him

1065
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,280
and stab him.

1066
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,360
The thing was,
I was still a mess.

1067
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,520
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him,

1068
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,440
but I saw a little boy insteadl

1069
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,560
And it wasn't just any boy.

1070
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,040
It was me.

1071
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,080
Me, as a child!

1072
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,960
It was freaky shit, right?

1073
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,560
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.

1074
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,440
Still readied the knife,
still prepared for thejob.

1075
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,920
But...

1076
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,720
...I couldn't do it.

1077
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,160
I just couldn't do it.

1078
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,240
Then what happened?

1079
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,840
I woke up in a pile
of donkey shit.

1080
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,760
I fainted.

1081
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,400
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.

1082
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,760
[Donkeys braying]

1083
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,160
And since then,

1084
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,560
it's been extremely
hot and cold.

1085
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,760
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.

1086
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,680
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.

1087
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,600
Froze.

1088
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,240
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.

1089
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,920
[Sighs] Oouldn't finish the job.

1090
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,680
And that was that.

1091
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,240
And now it's just a matter of time.

1092
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,720
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?

1093
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,280
Like Mary Beth
in Human Resources?

1094
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,680
Oome on, this is...
this is insane.

1095
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,840
They're gonna kill you
for botching a job?

1096
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,040
Mm-hm.

1097
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,720
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,

1098
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,240
you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.

1099
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,080
You know,
I was a little burned out,

1100
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,640
and I'm a little messed up."

1101
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,960
I mean, can't you do that?
But...

1102
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,800
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.

1103
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,680
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.

1104
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,640
But certainly,
they have to see that.

1105
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,880
No, they don't.
They don't.

1106
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,400
I mean, I...

1107
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,800
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life

1108
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,520
and tipped me off to the plans.

1109
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,520
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

1110
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,560
And how did you end up here?

1111
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,240
In Denver?

1112
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,520
Hm.

1113
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,920
That's funny.

1114
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,840
Some people run home
in a time of crisis.

1115
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,520
My problem,

1116
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,120
the problem I shared
with Danny in Mexico,

1117
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,480
is that I don't have a home.

1118
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,000
I mean...

1119
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,360
...that's why I'm here.

1120
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,440
You're the only friend I have.

1121
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,920
Oh, well, that's...
that's ridiculous.

1122
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,120
I... You have... you have friends.

1123
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,720
I don't.

1124
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,080
I really don't.

1125
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,280
You all right?

1126
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,200
[Laughing] It's fucking crazy, right?

1127
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,400
You're my only friend,
and I barely know you.

1128

[Chuckles]

1129
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,120
This home...

1130
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,240
...your home...

1131
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,000
[sighs]

1132
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,400
...it's the only home I know.

1133
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,240
[Julian] God, she's really
fantastic, Danny.

1134
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,480
She's lovely.

1135
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
[Danny] She's everything to me.

1136
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,200
You said that to me in Mexico.

1137
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,880
And I nodded and listened...

1138
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,560
...but now I see.

1139
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,080
I see.

1140
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,280
You were right.

1141
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,360
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?

1142
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,360
I told her about
our time together, yes.

1143
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,440
And where does that story end?

1144
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,400
She knows the last I heard of you

1145
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,120
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night

1146
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,120
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

1147
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,320
That's what you said?

1148
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,000
That I knocked and knocked.

1149
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,120
And you never answered?

1150
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,280
Yes.

1151
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,920
[Bean] Gentlemen.

1152
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,800
- I'm a bit drunk.
- [Julian chuckles]

1153
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,080
That's a nice place to be.

1154
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,960
Julian, you will stay
the night, of course?

1155
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, thank you, Bean.

1156
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,240
I promise I'll be
out of here tomorrow.

1157
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,160
Oh, let's not talk about that now.

1158
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,720
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest

1159
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,640
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.

1160
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,720
It's good, right?

1161
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,160
- Oh, it's very good.
- Hey...

1162
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,080
Oan I turn on your stereo?

1163
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,920
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,

1164
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,960
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?

1165
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,560
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?

1166
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,000
Is that OK?

1167
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,520
Oertainly. I guess.

I hope you approve, but...

1171
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,440
...I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.

too much to drink.

another time.

I'm gonna have.

- What about your wife?
- Hm?

1202
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,880
- My wife?
- Danny told me that you were married

1203
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,800
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.

1204
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,960
Um...

1205
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,000
Oh, my God!

1206
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,680
I can't believe this!

1207
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,520
I was never married.

1208
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,920
- I can't believe this!
- No car accident?

1209
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,320
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son

1210
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,680
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.

1211
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,960
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.

No, no, no, no, no!

1213
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,400
You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!

1214
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,800
The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,

1215
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,000
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.

1216
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,680
Because... well, now we're friends.

1217
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,920
Oh.

We are friends, aren't we?

1219
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,200
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?

1220
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,280
Yeah, are you even
a hit man, Julian?

1221
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,600
Yeah, a facility fatalitator,
whatever the fuck you call yourself.

1222
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,920
Yes, I am.

1223
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,280
And to answer your question,
Danny, I lie when I need to,

1224
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,000
tell the truth when I can.

1225

just roll over us
like the summer breeze.

01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,000
Next we shall be
wife swapping. Ha!

1237
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,440
You don't have a wife.

1238
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,600
Remember?

1239
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,320
[Both laugh]

1240
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,920
[Laughs]

1241
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,240
That's a good point.

1242
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,320
[Breathing]

1243
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,920
[Door opens]

1244
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,280
[Whispers] Danny.

1245
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,640
Danny.

1246
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,600
- Danny.
- No. I don't like chicken.

1247
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,480
Oome on.
I've gotta talk to you.

1248
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,800
What is it, Julian?
What do you want?

1249
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,760
We can't talk about it here.

1250
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,480
- What?
- Oome on.

1251
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,040
[Danny] OK, Julian,
we're in your rent-a-car.

1252
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,760
- What is it?
- The thing is, Danny...

1253
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,680
...the thing I didn't tell you,

1254
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,120
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,

1255
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,560
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.

1256
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,560
- Well, that's good.
- I know, I know.

1257
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,800
No, that's really good.
What is it?

1258
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,480
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does

1259
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,160
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.

1260
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,280
Is that how you stay in contact?
Oat-sitter ads?

1261
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,040
Yeah.

1262
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,840
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.

1263
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,040
- I'm so tired, Julian.
- Well, anyway,

1264
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,960
he contacted me four days ago

1265
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,400
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups

1266
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,360
and got me a reprieve.

1267
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,440
Well, like I said, that's...
that's... great news.

1268
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,640
The thing is...

1269
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,000
...he's asked me
to do one more job.

1270
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,080
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.

1271
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,320
Right.

1272
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,680
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.

1273
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,800
All right.

1274
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,200
What's the problem?

1275
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,720
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.

1276
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,080
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

1277
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,520
Because the job...

1278
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,520
...involves you.

1279
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,560
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.

1280
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,800
What do you think I'm saying?

1281
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,680
You know what
I think you're saying.

1282
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,440
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.

1283
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,000
Does somebody want me dead?

1284
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,160
- No.
- What's that?

1285
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,760
No one wants you dead, Danny.

1286
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,240
- Jesus!
- [Whimpering] You scared me!

1287
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,320
No. No...

1288
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,520
You were doing that...

1289
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,240
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.

1290
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,600
- What?
- I need your help.

1291
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,480
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.

1292
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,280
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.

1293
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,520
I'm a complete mess.

1294
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I don't know
if I can do this job by myself.

1295
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,920
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.

1296
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
- I don't know colleagues.
- You must!

1297
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,040
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you.

1298
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,320
I know you're not
the ideal candidate...

1299
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,800
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.

1300
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,480
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?

1301
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,240
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!

1302
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,640
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?

1303
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,120
Oan be.

1304
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,560
- Oh... I'm going to sleep.
- Danny, come on.

1305
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,760
You don't even need
a second person.

1306
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,800
Haven't you done these things yourself?

1307
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,800
Some jobs are better
with two men.

1308
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,160
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,

1309
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,560
and... and unprepared.

1310
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,040
And unqualified and uninterested!

1311
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,440
Now I'm gonna go to bed.

1312
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,720
I'm in a very dangerous position here.

1313
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

1314
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,640
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.

1315
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,560
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.

1316
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,400
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.

1317
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,360
Huh? I can't do that.

1318
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,840
Yeah.

1319
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,880
Danny! Danny, please!

1320
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,400
I need your help!

1321
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,520
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.

1322
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,080
Which would you rather? Hm?

1323
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,080
Look,

1324
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,720
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

1325
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,160
Free and clear, Danny!

1326
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,000
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island

1327
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,280
with beautiful Greeks.

1328
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,800
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

1329
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,120
- I can't.
- Oh, damn it, Danny!

1330
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,160
You're my only friend!

1331
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,880
- Oh, Julian.
- It's true!

1332
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,160
And...

1333
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,400
- Oh...
- And what?

1334
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,840
And...

1335
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,080
[sighs]

1336
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,560
You owe me.

1337
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,800
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?

1338
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,200
Today. The horse races.

1339
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,520
- Today?
- Yeah, Arizona.

1340
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,000
No, that couldn't happen.

1341
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,480
Sorry, no choice.

1342
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,720
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

1343
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,000
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.

1344
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,720
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?

1345
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,440
Well, I-I don't know.

1346
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,360
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.

1347
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,560
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.

1348
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,120
How will you do that, Julian?

1349
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,560
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.

1350
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,480
Plenty of time
to catch the 2:30 back.

1351
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,200
- We do?
- Mm-hm.

1352
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,360
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.

1353
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,840
Now, chop-chop.

1354
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,800
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.

1355
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,640
We've gotta get
this road on the show. Eh?
