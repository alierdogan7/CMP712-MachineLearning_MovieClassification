1
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,060
d But it's probably just your
owner or the nice guy d

2
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,562
d That comes to read the gas. d

3
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,451
Good job, guys.
I'm seeing improvement.

4
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,906
Hi. I was wondering
where Miss Hope

5
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:48,742
Rope-a-Dope was.

6
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,126
Sorry she's late.

7
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,695
Jimmy was moving according
to coffee-pot time,

8
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,881
which is usually ten minutes
fast, but it crapped out

9
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,299
in the middle of the night,

10
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,969
so we're all kinda on
microwave time today.

11
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,547
Gotcha.

12
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,884
Hey, what happened
to your dead tooth?

13
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,435
Oh, I got rid of it.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,604
I thought it made me unique,
but then I saw

15
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,740
this hilarious episode of <i>It's</i>
<i>Always Sunny in Philadelphia,</i>

16
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:14,025
and there was this girl
with a dead tooth.

17
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,443
Crazy, right?

18
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:16,811
And everyone was
always making

19
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,763
fun of her,
so before anyone made fun of me,

20
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:19,948
I figured I'd get it fixed.

21
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,950
Mmm.

22
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,235
The other kids not here yet?

23
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:26,404
Oh, no, Hope's
the only kid left.

24
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:28,540
Jessie and Phoebe moved on
to real school,

25
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,658
and Jenny's mother's trying the
whole stay-at-home-mom thing

26
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:32,327
now that they got her
medications sorted out.

27
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,345
What about the old people
you were watching?

28
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:36,664
Dead. Waiting on a new batch
to come in.

29
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:39,584
Hope's not afraid to get in
there and mix it up, though.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,094
I'm telling you, Jimmy,

31
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,812
it's a great day care
and everything,

32
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:52,897
but she can't grow up
only around dogs.

33
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,799
How embarrassed are
you gonna be at

34
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,968
Sunday school when she starts
humping the minister's leg?

35
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,369
I appreciate your concern,

36
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,438
and I do wish Hope had some
other kids there,

37
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,273
but for now I'm sure she's fine.

38
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,796
Did your baby just bark?

39
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,532
No, maybe she burped.

40
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,054
Hiccup?

41
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,012
Okay, she barked.

42
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,132
What does this button do?

43
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:36,609
www.addic7ed.com
.:: Sync by Rezinha ::.

44
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,600
Is that another brochure
about joining the Air Force?

45
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,269
No, it's a brochure
for a private preschool

46
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:50,371
one of my client's kids
goes to-- Marcy.

47
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,806
Good kid, smart.

48
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,559
She reads the tabloids
to me while I'm cleaning.

49
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:55,660
We can't afford this place.

50
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,195
Go to the page
with the black kid.

51
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,883
Uh, yeah, it looks like they
have a great computer center.

52
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,368
No, not the picture

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,087
of the black kid
with glasses.

54
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,207
The one where he's high-fiving
the Mexican girl.

55
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,210
Ah, they have
scholarships, cool.

56
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:13,761
But these are for poor people.

57
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,146
What do you think we are?

58
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,314
I don't know.

59
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:20,268
Like, lower-lower-lower
middle class?

60
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,904
I'm gonna take these
to the bottle return place.

61
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:25,406
Huh, it's like a tunnel.

62
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:33,131
He does all that for $1.90,
and you think we're not poor?

63
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,871
Check out all those fancy
guys who went here.

64
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:42,290
Those are the presidents
of the United States.

65
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:44,909
I remember that guy.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,628
So handsome.

67
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,363
Check it out.
There's one named Grover.

68
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,132
Grover.

69
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,750
All right, everybody,

70
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:56,471
these applications are due
in two weeks.

71
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,723
Unfortunately, we only have
enough grant money

72
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:00,258
to cover one poor student.

73
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:02,026
We are totally winning this.

74
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:04,362
There's no way these people
are poorer than us.

75
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,648
Okay, does anybody have
any questions?

76
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,801
I do. I was wondering,
I had seen on

77
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,403
the neighborhood watch Web site
that there was a sex offender

78
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,305
living not far from the school.

79
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,157
What's a neighborhood watch
Web site?

80
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:20,878
It's a Web site that tells you
where the people who've been

81
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,297
convicted of sexual-related
crimes live.

82
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:26,284
There's a blue dot over
their house.

83
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,970
Oh, we use the computer
at the library,

84
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,139
since we can't
afford our own.

85
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,091
No, we forced that person out.

86
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:36,460
Now the closest blue dot is way,
way, way over on

87
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,980
the other side of town
by the dangerous mall

88
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,431
in Lacey Park.

89
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:42,016
We live in Lacey Park.

90
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:43,651
By the dangerous mall.

91
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:46,771
We're so poor, we live
by the dangerous mall.

92
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,808
I'll kill him.

93
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,443
I'll strangle him
with his own perverted

94
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:54,412
sexual-offending hands!

95
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,913
How do you know
it's a him?

96
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,132
I bet it's that woman who lives
up the street

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,984
whose bushes look like wieners.

98
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,953
No one sees that
but you, Mom.

99
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,488
There it is, the blue dot.

100
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,794
They live really close to us.

101
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:11,529
On our block.

102
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,049
In our house!

103
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:21,022
Huh.

104
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:23,784
It's obviously a mistake.

105
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:25,919
It says here "lewd acts
with a 15-year-old."

106
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,556
It didn't happen!
It's lying!

107
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,926
Wait a minute.
This is ringing a bell.

108
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:35,596
Burt, you remember
Donna Passani's Sweet 16?

109
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,765
We were all doing it in cars

110
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,533
in the Knights of
Columbus parking lot,

111
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:42,203
and we got caught by a cop?

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,437
You got arrested!

113
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,538
Oh, yeah!

114
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:47,783
I was only 15, he was 17.

115
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,668
That's where
that blue dot's from.

116
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,803
So you sexually offended Mom?

117
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,973
It wasn't Burt's fault.
I developed early.

118
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,844
You're still that smoking hot,
nasty, sex-crazed ... to me.

119
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:04,516
You know, the school does
a background check, and we're

120
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,185
not gonna get in
if we have a dot on this house.

121
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:10,755
He's right.
We need to do something.

122
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,642
I want my granddaughter
to go to that school

123
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:16,111
and have a chance to do
great things.

124
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:19,264
Whoever heard of a rich
and successful dog?

125
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:21,032
I can think of eight
right off the bat.

126
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,702
Plus, Hope is gonna want
to have friends over one day,

127
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:26,288
and no one will come
because there's a stigmatism

128
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,439
attached to our house.

129
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,274
What am I supposed to do?

130
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,159
Make a time machine,
work the kinks out,

131
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,461
go back in time,
then remember

132
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:33,945
not to smush parts
with your mom?

133
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,280
Is that what you want?

134
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,832
'Cause then you
wouldn't even be born!

135
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,283
Just like <i>Back to the Future!</i>

136
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,285
Am I the only one that watches
movies in this house?

137
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,971
Burt, this is serious business.

138
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,056
We'll need to hire a lawyer.

139
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,608
Then we'll have
to get dressed up

140
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,477
and go to an office park.
Come on, man!

141
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,595
I don't want to open this can
of worms now!

142
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:51,813
You have to!

143
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,631
We gotta make that dot
disappear!

144
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:59,905
There, it's gone.

145
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,673
When you have
legal trouble,

146
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,775
you don't just
need a lawyer,

147
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,744
you need a friend.

148
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:08,964
So call me, Wally Phipps.

149
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,750
I may charge
for legal services,

150
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,319
but the hugs
are free.

151
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,861
So I need you to sponge this
from my record.

152
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,546
Can you do that?

153
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:29,134
Well, I can get you a court date
in a week, but, uh...

154
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:31,036
Oh, Gilligan!

155
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:32,671
This is a problem.

156
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:34,706
Your registration
is in arrears.

157
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,158
Oh, hey, I don't know

158
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:39,227
what that cop wrote, but
we were doing it normal style.

159
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,146
Yeah, that is not my bag.

160
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:44,849
No, I meant you have to go
door-to-door

161
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,519
in your neighborhood
and identify yourself

162
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,655
as a sexual offender living
in the neighborhood.

163
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:52,524
Otherwise, you'll get in
even more trouble.

164
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:22,871
Hi. Are you looking for someone
to care for your lawn?

165
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,739
'Cause I'm not one of those
mow-and-blow guys.

166
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,660
I will weed, prune, plant.
I'm dependable, trustworthy.

167
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:31,947
Uh, here's my card.

168
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,731
Also, I'm a sex offender.

169
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,586
Good news,
I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.

170
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,338
Bad news, I'm a sex offender.

171
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,090
Hello, I'm your neighbor
Burt Chance.

172
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:44,759
I just wanted to let you know
there's a sexual predator

173
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,411
living in your neighborhood.

174
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:47,846
It's me.

175
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:51,082
About eight years ago,
I borrowed your staple gun.

176
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:54,269
Also, I'm a sexual predator.

177
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,272
Hey, I'm shaving ham here, man!

178
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,124
You're not being funny.

179
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,126
I'm not trying to be funny.

180
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,112
I, uh, finished proofing
Hope's preschool application.

181
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,798
You're a pretty big fan
of exclamation points, huh?

182
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,250
Yeah, I thought

183
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,585
it made it more exciting.

184
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:28,286
Is this more exciting?!

185
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:31,289
Or does it just seem
like I'm weird?!

186
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:34,893
Yeah, okay, well, that's why
I wrote it in pencil, see?

187
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,761
We're gonna need to jazz this
form up a bit.

188
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,813
You got to sell
yourself, like, um,

189
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:40,148
say you served in Iraq.

190
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:42,400
No, Afghanistan.
It's a better war.

191
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:43,985
Would you stop it?!

192
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,905
Stuff like this is why Barney
doesn't let you use the slicer.

193
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,857
I don't want to use the slicer.

194
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,275
Listen, seriously,
you're gonna have

195
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,944
to spice this up
a little.

196
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:54,562
I'm not gonna lie.

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,816
I don't want Hope's future
based on dishonesty.

198
00:09:57,883 --> 00:09:59,868
Well, suit yourself,
Mr. Honesty.

199
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,202
But whatever you do...

200
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:04,623
take it easy on the exclams!

201
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,341
It's my birthday.

202
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,855
Maw Maw, release!

203
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,223
Why couldn't we leave
her home?

204
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,008
Because I broke a glass
in the kitchen,

205
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,311
and I wasn't in the mood
to clean it up.

206
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:28,563
Burt and I need to get
to the judge's chambers.

207
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,482
But after, I'd love
to tell you

208
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:31,983
how you could use
your broken glass

209
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,852
to make a lovely mosaic
for your patio.

210
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:36,404
Come on.

211
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,691
Oh, gotta hang back.

212
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,660
You can't be near
those kids, Burt.

213
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,711
You're a sex offender.

214
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:48,333
No, uh, I'm not a perv
or anything.

215
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,719
I just made love
with my teenage wife.

216
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:54,139
It's cool! I gave him
the green light!

217
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:09,053
They've been talking to
the judge a long time.

218
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,488
Oh, man.

219
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:11,806
I hope Dad didn't
get frustrated

220
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,575
and do his crank-up-his-
middle-finger thing.

221
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,910
Yeah, he's definitely in
a finger-cranking mood today.

222
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:18,363
I got one this morning
when I got the last Eggo.

223
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,750
Good news.

224
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,201
They overturned
my dot.

225
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:26,571
Take that, justice system.

226
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,515
Some old lady
took her shirt off.

227
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,084
Best field trip ever!

228
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:55,406
talk to the judge
and explain that your Maw Maw

229
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,442
is a teeny bit bonkadoo,

230
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,610
he'll get rid of the
dot as soon as she

231
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:02,030
does 12 hours
of community service.

232
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,296
12 hours?

233
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,415
She's only awake for
three hours at a time.

234
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,017
Well, some of those kids
were pretty shook up.

235
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,820
Yeah. First time you see 'em,
it can be pretty rough.

236
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:21,090
I still can't eat dried fruit
without heaving a little first.

237
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,392
Well, let's see
what has a need right now.

238
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,428
Bip, bip, bip, bip...
here we go.

239
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,283
Picking up trash on Highway 80.

240
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,617
She's going to have
to do that tomorrow,

241
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,936
because the application's
due the day after.

242
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,539
She can't even get her own
toilet paper in the toilet.

243
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:39,709
How is she going to get strange
trash in a strange trash can?

244
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,127
Well, she has to.

245
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,695
A while back,

246
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,382
I slipped on a wig and did
my wife's community service

247
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,668
when she got arrested
for spousal abuse.

248
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,686
Point is,

249
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:54,507
that any woman can sign in
and do the job.

250
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,780
I hate all of you.

251
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,933
Thank you for having me
on the show, Johnny.

252
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,844
Hey, thanks for
doing this.

253
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:17,163
I packed you a lunch
of all orange things

254
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,532
so you wouldn't have to worry
about staining your jumpsuit.

255
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,534
It's mostly cheese puffs
and jelly beans.

256
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,390
Dad, what are you doing?

257
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,175
Shh. He's sleep-eating.

258
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,043
He does it every night.

259
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,632
You know, I'm starting to think
we should have left Hope

260
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,884
in that dog pound
day care.

261
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,721
She could still
be successful.

262
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,506
Just strap her to a
blind person and call it a day.

263
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:50,596
How is he not, like, 500 pounds?

264
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,514
He sleep-exercises.

265
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:57,036
Okay.

266
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,571
Let's do this.

267
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,326
You sure you don't want
to brush your hair?

268
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,911
Oh, right.

269
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,247
'Cause if I'm going to be
picking up beer bottles

270
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,750
and old rubbers,
I really want to look my best.

271
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,174
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee, pee, pee.

272
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,226
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee. Whoo!

273
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,932
He won't give me the key
unless I buy something.

274
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,234
Give me some money.

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,025
They don't have anything
for 26 cents.

276
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,660
Don't you have any more money?

277
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,128
No, that's it.

278
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,529
Try the "take a penny,
leave a penny" jar.

279
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,590
Hey, Jimmy.

280
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:54,043
Hey. Hey, Dancing Dan.

281
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,598
Nobody left a penny.

282
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,517
Sign of the times.

283
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,770
Hey, what are you going
to do with that?

284
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,530
Hey.

285
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,615
What in the Lord?

286
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,406
I can't believe
you're arresting me.

287
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:24,957
Watch your head.

288
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,293
The real crime is what
those people are charging

289
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:29,045
for a pack of gum in there.

290
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,113
Mom, what's going on?

291
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,115
We just caught your mother
relieving herself

292
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,550
behind the gas station.

293
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,752
She's being arrested
for indecent exposure.

294
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,426
What am I supposed to do?
I need to find someone

295
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,727
to pick up litter
in like five minutes.

296
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,762
I got bigger problems, Jimmy.

297
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,315
My mug shot's going
to look terrible.

298
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,809
Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to pay you

299
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,078
to pretend to be my
great-grandmother

300
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,446
on the side of the road.

301
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,780
It'll be dirty, but...

302
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:11,587
That hooker was wearing a wire.

303
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:14,540
I heard the whole thing
on the walkie-talkie.

304
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,208
It's like watching
your kid drown

305
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,128
and not being able
to tell him to shut up.

306
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,910
I know I've said lying's bad,
but, I mean,

307
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:31,828
half the games we play are lies.

308
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:34,081
Like peekaboo?

309
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:35,966
I'm not really gone.
Still here.

310
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,820
What I'm saying is,
I think I have to use

311
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,305
our neighbor's address
on this form,

312
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,708
although I wish
I didn't have to.

313
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,793
You know, I wouldn't have
to do all this

314
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:49,496
if you weren't doing dog stuff
like barking or...

315
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,017
Chewing bones?

316
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,502
Who gave Hope a steak bone?

317
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,972
She fetched my slippers.

318
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:00,724
I keep my promises.

319
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:04,511
Oh, man.

320
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:09,983
I got to get you away
from these dogs.

321
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,902
Think I have to lie about more
than just our address.

322
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,321
Excuse me.

323
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,406
Everybody?

324
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,692
I would like to thank
you all for applying.

325
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:22,796
All of you had
such compelling stories.

326
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:24,531
The O'Donnells.

327
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:26,533
Both of you working three jobs

328
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:29,252
while living
in another family's basement,

329
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:32,556
somehow using a hot plate
to heat your bathwater.

330
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,873
Oh, and Mr. Melman.

331
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,642
Mr. Melman volunteers

332
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,878
every single day
in a downtown soup kitchen.

333
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,233
The Sanchezes had to float
to this country

334
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,518
on an inner tube
with nothing but a stick

335
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,219
to fight off the shark attacks.

336
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:50,557
Oh, and the Hassecks,
who are functionally mute.

337
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,862
But one story stood out.

338
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,064
Would you come up here,
Jim Chance?

339
00:17:58,115 --> 00:18:01,034
Come on.
Don't be shy.

340
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:06,739
James Chance,

341
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,360
single father who gave up
a promising career in art

342
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:12,745
to fight for his country
in Afghanistan,

343
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,931
only to injure
his drawing hand

344
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:16,766
while carrying several
orphans to safety.

345
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,969
Then, when he
came back,

346
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:21,438
he was carjacked by a
man desperate for money

347
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,724
to pay for a
kidney transplant.

348
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,727
And who do you suppose
gave him the kidney?

349
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,513
ALL:
James Chance.

350
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,532
The scholarship goes
to Hope Chance.

351
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,401
Congratulations.

352
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:36,369
Yeah, I-I'm sorry
to have to do this,

353
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:38,271
but the unchosen will
have to leave now.

354
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:39,823
Thank you.

355
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,608
Just... mm-hmm.

356
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,328
Thank you.

357
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,663
Wait.

358
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:50,250
I lied on my application.

359
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,719
What?
I lied on my application.

360
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,638
I didn't even want to lie,

361
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:57,007
but it all started when...
when I had to fake my address

362
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,558
because we have blue dots.

363
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,126
We're... we're
sexual offenders.

364
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,761
Excuse me?

365
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,763
But it's all
a misunderstanding, right?

366
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,181
My parents hooked up
as teenagers,

367
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:07,634
my great-grandmother runs around
without her bra on,

368
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,853
and I tried to get a favor
from a hooker.

369
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,155
Okay, but it wasn't
a sexual favor.

370
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:16,309
I really wanted to get my
daughter into this school.

371
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,194
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:22,449
Uh... I'm really sorry.

373
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,786
That was very brave,
Mr. Chance.

374
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:29,589
Coming clean like that,
that took courage.

375
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:31,491
Really?

376
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,926
Cool.

377
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,010
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

378
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,795
I can be brave, too.

379
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,830
I don't really volunteer
at the soup kitchen.

380
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:39,849
I have OCD--
one, two, three, four, five--

381
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,968
and... and I think
that homeless people are filthy.

382
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,353
One, two, three, four, five.

383
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,605
Uh, we didn't really come here
on an inner tube.

384
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:47,641
Sure, our name is Sanchez,

385
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,343
but we're about as Latino
as the Three Amigos.

386
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,861
Uh, we can speak.

387
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,947
In fact, my wife here
will hardly ever shut up.

388
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,398
And she hits me.

389
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,516
Hey.

390
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,867
I also lied
about my kid's mother.

391
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,185
She was a serial killer.

392
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,487
I didn't even get into that.

393
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:02,372
Yeah, my penis is tiny.

394
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:03,573
Okay, uh-uh.

395
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,909
<i>Honesty may be the best policy,</i>

396
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,361
<i>but in this case,</i>
<i>it got us all disqualified.</i>

397
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,862
<i>It also gave me a chance</i>

398
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,698
<i>to tell everyone</i>
<i>about Shelley's day care,</i>

399
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,033
<i>and honestly,</i>
<i>I couldn't be happier.</i>

400
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:16,720
Wow, Jimmy.

401
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:21,091
Thanks for telling so many
people about my school.

402
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:22,726
This place is great.

403
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,978
It just needed
more kids.

404
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,646
Okay, everybody,

405
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:28,982
I think we're ready to
sing the welcome song.
