"He adored New York City.
He idolized it all out of proportion."

4
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,358
Uh, no. Make that "He romanticized it
all out of proportion."

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,939
"To him,
no matter what the season was..."

6
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,322
...this was still a town
that existed in black and white...

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,734
"...and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin."

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,403
Uh... no. Let me start this over.

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,664
"Chapter one."

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,702
"He was too romantic about Manhattan,
as he was about everything else."

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,462
"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic."

12
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,840
"To him, New York
meant beautiful women...

13
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,799
...and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles."

14
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,215
Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste.

15
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,679
Let me... try and make it more profound.

16
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,597
"Chapter one. He adored New York City."

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,063
"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,355
"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out...

19
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,365
...was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."

20
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,825
No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean,
face ft, I wanna self some books here.

21
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,786
"Chapter one. He adored New York City...

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,328
...although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

23
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:04,842
"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitized by drugs, loud music...

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,799
...television, crime, garbage..."

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,134
Too angry. I don't wanna be angry.

26

"Chapter one."

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,762
"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved."

28
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,227
"Behind his black-rimmed glasses
was the coiled sexual power

29
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,641
of a jungle cat."

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,354
I love this.

(♫ jazz music)

34
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:27,106
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation...

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,771
...so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

36
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,238
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
They've had this argument
for 20 years.

38
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,663
Listen to this example.

39
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,748
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning...

40
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,912
...would we have the nerve...

41
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,878
Would one of us have the nerve to dive
into the icy water and save them?

42
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,839
It's a key question.

43
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,845
I, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

44
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,765
Oh... God.

45
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,476
Which of us? (chuckles)

46
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,222
- You want a little more?
- No.

47
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,188
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

48
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,149
You don't smoke.

49
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,908
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but...

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,447
...I look so incredibly handsome with
a cigarette that I can't not hold one.

51
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,033
- You like the way I look?
- Mm-hm.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,577
Provocative.

53
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,714
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

54
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,218
- Jesus, she's gorgeous.
- Mm.

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,180
But she's 17.

56
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,599
I'm 42 and she's 17.

57
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,725
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

58
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,225
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

59
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,361
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

60
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,740
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

61
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,448
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

62
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,365
- Who, Tina?
- Mm-mm. My second ex-wife...

63
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,247
...is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

64
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,630
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

65
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,385
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies...

66
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,012
...and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

67
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,016
Mm, mm, not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

68
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,680
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret. (sighs)

69
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,725
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

70
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,361
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

71
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,738
You should never let yourself drink.

72
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,525

'cause I've got an exam tomorrow.

73

She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

What is it? What's the matter with you?

76
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:55,007
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

77
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,167
I have something I wanna say.

78
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,213
I, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

79
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,472
Um, I, uh...

80
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,678
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party...

81
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,938
...and I met a woman there.

82
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,937
And...

83
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,444
And I've got
kind of involved with her.

84
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,695
You're kidding?

85
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,529
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

86
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,193
And now it's, you know,

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,113
it's getting out of hand
and I don't know what to do about it.

88
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,373
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

89
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,535
Well, who is she? What are the details?

90
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,874
- Well, she's a journalist.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,630
She's very...

92
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,212
- ls she married, too?
- No, no.

93
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,628
- She's very beautiful.
- Mm-mm.

94
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,765
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

95
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,346
Great. It sounds wonderful.

96
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,855
Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.

97
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,108
What are you telling me?
That your marriage is...

98
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,896
I mean, how serious is it?

99
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,531
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

100
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,533
But you haven't
said anything to Emily?

101
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,239
No! God, no.

102
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,872
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know...

103
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,126
...I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

104
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,628
We do! I mean, I love her.

105
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,165
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,084
But in all the years
that we've been married...

107
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,472
...I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

108
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,804
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea.

109
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,561
I hate myself
when I'm doing this sort of thing.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,769
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

111
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,356
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

113
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,287
Well, I don't think 17 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

114
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,790
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

He has done a lot worse.

116
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,545
I just think he's wasting his life.

117
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,833
He writes that crap for television.

any more about having kids?

00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,845
Listen, I've gotta get this book
finished. it's never gonna get done.

121

I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

123
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,854
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

- (Sighs) Connecticut.
- Yeah.

125
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,826
I can't go to Connecticut.
It's not practical.

It's just the wrong time.

What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

129

He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

132
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,519
Are you writing a book
on our marriage?

133
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,777
Leave me alone.

134
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,033
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

135
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,035
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

136
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,448
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

137
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,289
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

138
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,828
Do you spy on me?

139
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,624
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter...

140
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,511
...of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

141
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,549
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

142
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,217
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

143
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,730
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

144
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,890
He doesn't wear dresses.

145
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,731
You'll find out the details
when it's your turn to see him.

146
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,521
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

147
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,986
It's an honest account of our break-up.

148
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,323
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

149
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,704
Look at you. You're so threatened.

150
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:59,835
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

151
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,371

154
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,768
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

155
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,022
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

156
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,311
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

157

No? What does that mean?

158
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,740
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

160

This is... This is a terrific thing -
move over - you know.

And we're having a great time,
but you're a kid

162
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,870

00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,000
...and, you know,
I want you to enjoy me.

165
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,216
My wry sense of humor (chuckles)
and astonishing sexual technique...

166
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,383
...but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,722
Don't you have any feelings for me?

168
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,435
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you...

169
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,227
...but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

170
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,566
It's... charming, you know.

171
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,653
(Clears throat) Erotic.
No question about that.

172
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,909
As long as the cops don't burst in,

173
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,287
I think we're gonna break
a couple of records.

174
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,790
But you can't, uh, you can't...
it's not a good thing.

175
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,250
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

176
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,041
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

177
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,426
I don't want you to get in the habit...

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,178
...because first you stay one night,
then two nights,

179
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,590
and then you're living here.

180
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,430
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

181
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,096
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

182
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:48,110
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,898
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

184
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,943
No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?

185
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,864
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

186
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,830
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

187
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,632
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

188
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,420
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

189
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,215
I was taking pictures in our drama
class. It's fun, really neat.

190
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,180
You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry.

191
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,719
Are you kidding me?

192
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,435
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- Sh! You sound like the mouse.

193
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,395
Well, thanks.

194
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,732
- I know, I'm a whiner.
- (giggles)

195
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,024
- What are you doing here?
- (Yale) Hi.

196
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,114
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

197
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,703
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

198
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,085
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

199
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,167
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

200
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,332
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

201
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,048
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

202
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,258
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

203
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,673
You, too.

204
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,432
- Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,595
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

206
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,355
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

207
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,935
Really?

208
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,692
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

209
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,695
Great. Absolutely great. Did you?

210
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,982
No, I really felt
it was very derivative.

211
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,526
To me it looked like it was
straight out of Diane Arbus,

212
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,660
but it had none of the wit.

213
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,494
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

214
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,408
You liked the Plexiglas?

215
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,953
You didn't like the Plexiglas either?

216
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,669
Ah, that's interesting.
Nah, no... uh-uh.

217
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,335
It was a lot better than that...
that steel cube. Did you see it?

218
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,552
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

219
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,716
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

220
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,932
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

221
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,723
It was perfectly integrated
and it had a...

222
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,812
a marvelous kind of negative capability.

223
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,068
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

224
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,950
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

225
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,486
You wanna see that?

226
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,156
He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights.

227
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,246
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

228
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,505
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

229
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,007
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

230
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,171
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

231
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,676
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

232
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,139
Right!

233
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,522
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as...

234
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,810
...Gustav Mahler...
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

235
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,446
- ...Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

236
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,359
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

237
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,246
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich Boll.

238
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,032
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

239
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,623
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

240
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,585
- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch?
- She said "Van Goch"?!

241
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,000
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

242
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,296
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,260
He's a big Bergman fan.

244
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,222
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

245
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,183
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

246
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,349
It's bleak, my god.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

247
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,521
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

248
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,691
OK, OK, OK. I mean,
I loved it when I was at Radcliffe,

249
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,985
but, all right, you outgrow it.

250
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,496
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

251
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,123
No. Don't you guys see?

252
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,912
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups...

253
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,752
...by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,916
Here we are.

255
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,301
Uh, listen,
it was very nice meeting you.

256
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,304
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation...

257
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,387
...but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

258
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,553
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

259
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,145
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in god so, uh... OK?

260
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,901
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

261
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,107
Well, that...

262
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,317
"I'm from Philadelphia.
I believe in god."

263
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,404
- (nervous laugh)
- Does this make any sense to you?

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,823
What a creep. Could you believe her?

265
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,330
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

266
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,036
Nervous? She was overbearing.

267
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,419
She was, you know, terrible!
She was all cerebral.

268
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,625
Where the hell
does a little Radcliffe tootsie

269
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,836
come off rating Scott
Fitzgerald...

270
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,343
...Gustav Mahler and Heinrich Böll?
- Why are you getting so mad?

271
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,097
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

272
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,056
"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch. Like an Arab she spoke.

273
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:37,019
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

274
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,186
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

275
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:46,358
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife and
he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

276
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,198
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

277
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,911
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

278
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,327
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese...

279
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,918
...and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism“.

280
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,708
I get the feeling
that Yale really likes her.

281
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,844
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

282
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:11,053
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

283
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:16,062
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

284
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,475
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

285
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,566
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

286
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,279
You're 17. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

287
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,990
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

288
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,827
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

289
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,414
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

290
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,624
Get the groceries, will you?

291
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,462
Good morning
and welcome to Human Beings Wow!

292
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,505
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith...

293
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,672
...close friends of the Caner family.

294
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,934
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt. (laughs)

295
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,811
Except that Mrs. Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

296
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,520
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

297
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,146
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

298
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,314
I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...

299
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,156
No, wrong.
That's very chancy material.

300
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,697
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

301
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,084
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

302
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,960
You don't find this insightful?

303
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,338
Worse than not insightful.
It's not funny.

304
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,250
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

305
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,795
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

306
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,963
This is an audience raised on TV.

307
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,304
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

308
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:41,143
They watch their sets and the gamma rays
eat the white cells of their brains out.

309
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,151
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a Lude.

310
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,190
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

311
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,281
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

312
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,198
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

313
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,162
Ike, you're being silly.

314
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,701
(laughter)

315
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,370
We've talked to them about that.

316
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,960
- Don't break her neck.
- I won't. That's fine.

317
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,251
What did I do?
I made a terrible mistake.

318
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,419
It's the first smart thing you've done.

319
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,713
I've screwed myself up completely.

320
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,635
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

321
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,020
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

322
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,681
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

323
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,727
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

324
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,817
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

325
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,075
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

326
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,739
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

327
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,454
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

328
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:47,543
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and child
support. You know, I gotta cut down.

329
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,707
I'll have to give up my apartment.

330
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,253
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner...

331
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,421
...or take the Southampton house.

332
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,965
(sighs)

333
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,180
Oh! Plus I'll probably have
to give my parents less money.

334
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,219
It'll kill my father.

335
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,515
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

336
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,605
He'll be in the back,
away from god, far from the action.

337
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,770
Have you said anything to Tracy?

338
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,860
I gotta get out of that situation.

339
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,027
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

340
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,072
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

341
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,450
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

342
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,247
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

343
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,462
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

344
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,882
Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.

345
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,467
(woman) This is a wonderful turnout.

346
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,307
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

347
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,895
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment...

348
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,402
...is that so many of you
who would never do it before

349
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,278

350
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,439

351
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,699
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

352
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,990
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

353
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,664
Hi. What are you doing here?

354
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,549
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

355
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,960
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

356
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,595
Listen, I'd like you
to meet Isaac Davis.

357
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,722
Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

358
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,226
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

359
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,387
Well, of course I'm here.

360
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:31,355
What a funny coincidence. Uh,
excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

361
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,441
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

362
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,064
I heard you, uh, quit your job.

363
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:41,327
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

364
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,490
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

365
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,079
We should go there,
get some guys together.

366
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,416
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

367
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,334
There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times.

368
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,843
Well, a satirical piece
in the Times is one thing,

369
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,676
but bricks get right to the point.

370
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,762
Aw, but biting satire
is better that physical force.

371
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,643
No, physical force is better with Nazis.

372
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,351
It's hard to satirize
a guy with shiny boots.

373
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,017
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

374
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,027
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

375
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,611
I'm from Philadelphia. We never
talk about such things in public.

376
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,902
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

377
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,413
I'm just about to direct a film...
uh, of my own script.

378
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,451
The premise is this guy
screws so great...

379
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,836
- Screws so great?
- Screws so great...

380
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,292
...that when he brings
a woman to orgasm, she's

381
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,378
so fulfilled that she dies.

382
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,635
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

383
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,218
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

384
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,510
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

385
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,431
It's, uh, Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

386
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,108
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

387
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,612
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

388
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,152
My worst one was right on the money.

389
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,543
(Ike) Good night.
It was nice to meet you.

390
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,702
(Dennis) Same here.

391
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,621
(Mary) Bye-bye.

392
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,291
Oh, gee!

393
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,632
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

394
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,550
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

395
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,513
- She's a brilliant woman.
- Mm-hm.

396
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:32,601
She's a genius. I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

397
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,607
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

398
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,189
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

399
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,026
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

400
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,190
You don't have
to tell me if you don't...

401
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,110
Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

402
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:50,281
I was tired of submerging my identity
to a brilliant, dominating man.

403
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,539
He's a genius.

404
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,623
He was a genius,
Helen's a genius, Dennis is a genius.

405
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,833
You know a lot of geniuses.

406
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,045
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

407
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,209
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

408
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:07,098
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

409
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,849
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

410
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,477
God, that must have been demoralizing.

411
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,683
I took it well under the circumstances.

412
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,893
Phew-wee.

413
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,183
I tried to run 'em both over
with a car.

414
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,192
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

415
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,026
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

416
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,489
Hey, the little girl is tine. Jesus,
she's... What's with the little girl?

417
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,827
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
16 years old, no possible threat at all.

418
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,711
She's 17. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

419
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,170
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

420
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,006
I like the way you express yourself,
too. Pithy, yet degenerate.

421
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,514
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

422
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,766
I never thought I was very pretty.

423
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:55,896
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

424
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,730
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

425
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,897
When you climb into the sack, if you're
a bit giving, they're so grateful.

426
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,861
Yeah, I know I am.

427
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,025
- D'you have kids?
- Me, yeah.

428
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,320
He's being raised by two women.

429
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,238
I think it works.

430
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,248
They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

431
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,830
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

432
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,668
Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.

433
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,085
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in a rush?

434
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,629
Oh, no, sure.
What kind of dog you got?

435
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,389
(laughs) The worst.

436
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,892
It's a dachshund. You know,
it's a penis substitute for me.

437
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,681
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

- Yeah. I call him Donny!

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,278

Oh, that's perfect.

00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,086
I've got an appointment
with Yale for lunch later on.

481
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,637
(Ike groans)

482
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,906
Mm, hi. (coughs)

483
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,159
No, no. No, I'm awake.

484
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,618
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7:15.

485
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,458
Oh, yeah.

486
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,120
Really?

487
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,839
You did? At the museum?

488
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,673
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

489
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,593
Uh, so you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

490
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,928
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

491
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,018
Yeah, I don't think
you'll have any trouble.

492
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,650
(softly) I knew you'd...
see she's a terrific woman,

493
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,527
if you spent some time with her.

494
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,316
You still feel the same way about her?

495
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,404
'Cause you hadn't
mentioned it in a while.

496
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,036
So you... Yeah. Mm-hm.

497
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,993
Yeah, mm-hm, right. I know.

498
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,457
She's great, I know. Great.

499
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,872
So, uh... No, I gotta go
apartment hunting today.

500
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,882
I have to get something cheaper.

501
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,840
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

502
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,764
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Mm, yeah.

503
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,928
Said he had a great time with you.

504
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,895
Really? That's good 'cause I always
think he's uncomfortable around me.

505
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,060
Oh, come on.

506
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,694
I missed you so much.

507
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,153
Yale, this is ridiculous.
You're married.

508
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,569
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

509
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,737
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

510
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:09,582
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

511
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,371
Besides, I'm not looking
for any big involvement here.

512
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,289
It's just... I don't...

513
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,427
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about
you when you're not around.

514
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,844
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

515
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,681
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

516
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,845
You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.

517
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,434
Oh, Yale, please stop it.

518
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,646
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

519
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,688
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

520
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:41,905
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

521
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:46,698
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

522
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,959
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

523
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:55,043
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

524
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,798
And I don't wanna go to your house

525
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,257
'cause I can't stand the dog
and the phone ringing.

526
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,640
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

527
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,554
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

528
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,813
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

529
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,859
Oh, hi, Isaac.

530
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,987
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

531
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,148
(ex-wife) He'll be right down.

532
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,158
- How you been, Ike?
- Good. How you been?

533
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,319
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

534
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,286
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

535
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,374
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

536
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,211
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

537
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,547
Where does he get that?
'Cause you don't draw and I don't draw.

538
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,087
I draw.

539
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,678
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

540
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,469
I'm hoping you'll take Willie
on the 16th

541
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,683
'cause Connie and I
want to go to Barbados.

542
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,770
Are you still gonna
write that stupid book?

543
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,775
I mean, are you serious about that?

544
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,982
I'm very serious about it.
It's an honest book.

545
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,193
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

546
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,199
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

547
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,658
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

548
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,790
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

549
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,746
- You can't understand?
- No.

550
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,707
You knew my history!

551
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:20,340
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

552
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,922
D'you think we can be
ever just friends?

553
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,757
You're putting in all the details?

554
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,719
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

555
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,304
Wha... I tried
to run her over with a car?

556
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,971
What are you talking about? It was late.
You know I don't drive well.

557
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,139
It was raining. It was dark.

558
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,479
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

559
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,065
I was spying on you guys
'cause I knew what was happening.

560
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,151
You were falling in love.

561
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,907
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

562
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,696
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

563
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,865
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

564
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,707
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

565
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,630
(♫ "Love ls Sweeping The Country")

566
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,954
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

567
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,371
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

568
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,756
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

569
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,760
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

570
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,173
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

571
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,344
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

572
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,016
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

573
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,728
We could do well.

574
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,020
I think we could have picked up
these two, if you were quicker.

575
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm serious.

576
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,279
I think the brunette liked you.

577
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,112
(barking)

578
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,532
(mutters) I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

579
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,880
Mm...

580
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,924
Hello, Yale? Um, I'm sorry for calling.

581
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,556
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

582
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,887
Well, I just thought
that it's Sunday out...

583
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:43,310
...and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or... Mm.

584
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,523
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

585
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,312
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.

586
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,074
Well, OK, it was just a shot.
Yeah. Yeah.

587
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,577
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

588
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,082
(phone rings)

589
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,327
Hello?

590
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,671
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

591
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,293
No, not at all.
I was just sitting around

592
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,303
looking through the magazine section.

593
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:18,097
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

594
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,728
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

595
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,891
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

596
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,151
You wanna go for a walk?

597
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,695
I don't know, I've gotta get out.

598
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,323
I'm going stir-crazy
and Yale's with Emily's parents.

599
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,826
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

600
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,827
(clap of thunder)

601
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:40,240
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

602
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,035
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

603
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,420
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

604
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,458
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favorite sound either.

605
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,797
D'you know every year
one or two people get killed

606
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,304
during a storm in Central Park?

607
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,090
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

608
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,408
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

609
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,661
You look ridiculous! You know that?

610
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,414
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

611
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,203
I've never seen anybody react
so strongly to a little bit of water.

612
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,996
It wasn't the water.
It was the electricity.

613
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,588
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

614
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,879
What do you think? You think
I look terrible? How do I look?

615
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,674
- I can't see.
- (laughs) You should see your face!

616
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,390
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

617
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,098
- (Mary) I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

618
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,143
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

619
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,277
And I had tickets
to this Vivaldi concert.

620
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,438
He had to cancel on me, of course.

621
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,576
- (Ike) That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

622
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,034
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

623
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,996
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

624
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,877
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

625
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,257
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

626
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,591
That I was bad in bed, not bright
enough, or physically unattractive.

627
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:20,633
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

628
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,928
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

629
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,017
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

630
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,274
Women found him devastating.

631
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,485
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

632
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,113
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

633
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,320
How many of the satellites
of Saturn can you name?

634
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:43,455
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course. Uh...

635
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,743
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

636
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,537
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

637
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,425
They mean nothing 'cause nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

638
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,803
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening...

639
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,511
...if you'll forgive
the disgusting imagery.

640
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,177
I don't agree at all. Where would
we be without rational thought?

641
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,597
You... you...
you rely too much on your brain.

642
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,562
The brain is the most overrated organ.

643
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,319
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

644
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,732
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

645
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,903
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

646
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,071
You're tine. Are you kidding?

647
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:29,163
You do have a tendency to get a little
hostile, but I find that attractive.

648
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,829
(Ike whispers) Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm glad you do.

649
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,500
(Mary) So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

650
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:41,342
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

651
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,596
(Mary sighs)

652
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,884
I think you're...
I think you're terrific.

653
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:51,022
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

654
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,899
I think you're wonderful, really.

655
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,363
(Mary sighs) What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

656
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,400
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

657
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,870
(mumbles) I gotta
see somebody this evening.

658
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,656
I don't know if it's a great idea.

659
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,371
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

660
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,878
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

661
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,131
Uh... (sighs)

662
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,252
I'm not gonna have any free time

663
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,262
'cause... I don't think
it's such a great idea.

664
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:29,053
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

665
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,186
OK. OK.

666
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,607
(Yale) Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time. (laughs)

667
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,194
- (Emily) Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

668
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,235
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

669
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,324
Written another one,
if you can believe it.

670
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,161
- (Emily) Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

671
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:55,045
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

672
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,833
- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.

673
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:03,424
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

674
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,680
Oh, come on.

675
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:12,395
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

676
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,351
Yeah.

677
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,103
It's not too crowded.

678
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,815
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

679
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,026
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight

680
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,408
'cause...
I really did wanna see you a lot.

681
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,161
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

682
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,414
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

683
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,668
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

684
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,829
So I have a chance to go to London...

685
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,715
...study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

686
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,671
Really? When did this happen?

687
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,303
The other day.
Got a letter in the mail.

688
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,681
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

689
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,684
But I don't wanna go without you.

690
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,096
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

691
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,937
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

692
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:02,070
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

693
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,821
You'll have a great time.

694
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,529
It's a great town
and you're a wonderful actress

695
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,319
and it's a terrific place to study.

696
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,080
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

697
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,960
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

698
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,088
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

699
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,044
I'm kidding.

700
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,380
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

701
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,422
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17.

702
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,764
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

703
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,553
You're 17 now.
When you're 36, I'll be...

704
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,307
- Um...
- 63.

705
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,693
63, right. Thank you.

706
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,776
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

707
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,191
Of course, I will too probably, but...

708
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,451
...you know, I'm a late starter.

709
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,612
- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.

710
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,749
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

711
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,626
- Mm-hm.
- Forgot the coconut.

712
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,912
So what do you wanna do tonight?

713
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,084
We'll go to the movies,
I'll take you dancing...

714
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,547
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

715
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,712
OK, I know what we can do.

716
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,722
Well, get the filthy look
off your face.

717
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,225
Shut up. It's not filthy.

720

(Ike) This is so corny. I can't believe
this. Is this what you wanted to do?

721
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,123
(Tracy) I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

722
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,955
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

723
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,917
Well, I've never done it.
I think it's great.

724
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,380
(Ike) On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

725
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,638
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

726
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,154
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

727
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,817
I am. You're...
You're God's answer to Job.

728
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,703
You would have ended
all argument between them.

729
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,035
He'd have said
"I do a lot of terrible things

730
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,076
but I can also make one of these."

731
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,961
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

732
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,677
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do
this any more. It's really bullshit!

733
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,188
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend...

734
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,441
...and I sit around like
I've nothing to do, so I called Isaac.

735
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,817
We went for a walk.

736
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,355
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

737
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,526
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

738
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,821
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

739
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,284
I know.

740
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,541
- What if I took some action?
- No!

741
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,543

- Oh. I'm not a home wrecker.

742
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,127
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,302
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

- Uh, what?
- (dog whining)

746
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,852
Well, um, why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

747
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,312
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Right, I'll talk
to you later. OK, bye-bye.

00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,728

- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

749
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:34,400
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going no place. Excuse me.

750
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,488
Look, I know it's terrible.

751
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,450
I'm at Sneedon's Landing
with Emily and her parents...

752
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,162
...and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

Um, no, uh... Well, I think
that'd be impossible. Uh...

759
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:09,605
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

760
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,395

Please, just don't. This is really a bad
time... Waffles! ...A bad time for me.

763
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,448
I gotta think things through here.

764
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,916

Listen. Where's it coming from?

769

It's like somebody's
playing the trumpet.

770

00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,245
And I got brown water here.

798
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,416
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

799
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,085
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

800
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,927
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

801
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,969
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

802
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,479
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

803
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,891
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

804
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,563
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

805
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,778
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

806
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,615
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

807
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,200
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

808
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,084
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

809
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:17,748
Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.

810
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,757
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

811
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,419
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

812
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:27,136
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

813
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,472
I'm not angry.
It's just I knew it was gonna end,

814
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,012
but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

815
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,682
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

816
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,691
And I don't wanna break up my marriage

817
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,273
and then find out
we're no good together.

818
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,734
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

819
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,025
OK, you made your point very clear.

820
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,035
I'm just glad one of us
had the nerve to end it.

821
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,531
- Will you be all right?
- (crying) Yeah...

822
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,076
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

823
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,667
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

824
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,548
I got everything going for me.
The point...

825
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:06,759
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

826
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,552
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

827
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,688
I could go to bed with the entire
faculty of MIT, if I wanted to.

828
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,063
It's just...

829
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,443
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

830
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:26,024
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

831
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,534
I got these tickets
to see Rampal tonight.

832
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,865
Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

833
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,622
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

834
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,786
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

835
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,046
Fuck off, Yale!

836
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,505
Um, I know you're gonna think
the water's a little brown,

837
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,340
but you can drink it.

838
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,504
Don't get thrown by this.

839
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,641
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

840
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:52,891
It's just...

841
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,021
- God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it.

842
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,977
I didn't know who to call.

843
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,018
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

844
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,734
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

845
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,898
When did they find that out?

846
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:12,070
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

847
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,580
Well, I guess
I deserve everything I get.

848
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,785
Come on.

849
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,669
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

850
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,829
Yeah, you pick a married guy...

851
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,626
...and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

852
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,793
What worst feelings?

853
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,966
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

854
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,682
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyze me.
I pay a doctor for that.

855
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:41,099
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

856
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:46,897
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

857
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,906
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

858
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,738
He's done a great job on you.

859
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,369
Your self-esteem is like
a notch below Kafka's.

860
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,576
- (rumbling)
- What is that noise?

861
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,662
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it?

862
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,202
There's a guy upstairs.
I don't know what the hell it is.

863
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,373
It's like he's up there strangling a
parrot or something. I can't stand it.

864
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,541
How can you stand it? It's terrible.

865
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,710
I know.
I used to have a great apartment.

866
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:14,257
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

867
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,517
- No, come on.
- (sniffles)

868
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,939
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticize him?

869
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,021
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

870
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,404
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

871
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,736
Yale has his problems as we all do.

872
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,243
I'm starting to sound
like Rabbi Blitzstein.

873
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,497
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

874
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,956
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

875
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,540
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

876
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,296
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:50,881
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

878
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,137
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

879
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,559
(TV) But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money...

880
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:03,518
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

881
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:08,653
That is hilarious. Mm, there's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

882
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,315
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

883
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,861
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

884
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,624
But look at his wife. Looks like her
face has been lifted about 8,000 times.

885
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,877
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

886
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,458
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

887
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,467
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

888
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,253
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

889
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,639
Yeah. They're great.

890
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,720
Mm... Mm...

891
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:44,230
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

892
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,767
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

893
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,106
Mm.

894
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,363
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

895
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,991
(Yale) om on, God.

896
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,038
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

897
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,573
Yeah?

898
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,539
You know, I just had
to cut this thing off finally.

899
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,829
I'm not the type for affairs.

900
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,089
D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?

901
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,750
No. We cut it off.
It's easier that way.

902
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,591
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

903
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,802
Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.

904
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,592
Right up your alley.
You oughta call her.

905
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,137
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

906
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,806
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

907
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,974
She told me she did.

908
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,611
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she Ends you attractive.

909
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,649
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

910
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,193
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

911
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,987
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

912
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,078
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

913
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,619
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

914
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,915
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

915
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,052
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

916
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,213
I think you guys
would be good together.

917
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,347
I could be a good influence on her.

918
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,601
I think that under
my personal vibrations,

919
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,808
I could put her life
in a kind of good order.

920
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,227
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

921
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,566
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

922
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,450
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

923
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,283
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

924
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,994
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

925
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,659
- ...Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

926
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,295
(♫ "I've Got A Crush On You")

927
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,059
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

928
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,818
Or Grand Illusion. That's...

929
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,151
I see that every time it's on
television, if I'm aware of it.

930
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,407
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

931
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,783
Oh, Jesus, what is this?

932
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,617
You got a corned beef sandwich here
from 1951, I think.

933
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,623
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

934
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,252
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

935
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,505
Ugh, it's really terrible.

936
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,040
- Hey.
- What?

937
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,879
Come here.

938
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,804
What're you doing?

939
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:29,937
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

940
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,190
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

941
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,350
it's something I wanted
to do for ages.

942
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,689
Yeah, I know.

943
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:41,107
Do you? I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

944
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,867
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

945
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,028
- I did.
- I thought so.

946
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,117
But you were going out with Yale then

947
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,659
and I would never
in a million years interfere...

948
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,827
Did you want me to kiss you?

949
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:58,044
Mm, I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

950
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:01,460
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain...

951
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,427
...and I had a mad impulse to throw you
down on the lunar surface...

952
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,638
...and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

953
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,599
I can't go from relationship
to relationship. It's senseless.

954
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,560
I can't do it.

955
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,022
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Ls that the problem?

956
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,186
I've got too many problems.

957
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,983
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

958
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:27,619
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- (giggles) What are you saying?

959
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,281
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

960
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,541
I'm... I'm kidding.

961
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,955
(♫ "Do-Do-Do")

962
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,497
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

963
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,961
Shh.

964
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,297
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

965
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,883
What about your relationships
with women?

966
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,095
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

967
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,511
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

968
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:56,182
She got into drugs
and she, uh, moved to San Francisco.

969
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,350
Went into est, became a Moonie.

970
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,861
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

971
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,612
D'you like that?

972
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,617
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

973
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,574
- A marvelous negative capability.
- OK.

974
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,660
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

975
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,383
(Mary) I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

976
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,546
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

977
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:31,058
(Ike) Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

978
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,844
- (Mary laughs)
- It's 14 bucks!

979
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,060
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

980
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:41,648
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

981
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,812
Hey, you know,
it was the only time in my life

982
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,902
I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

983
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,941
- Give me a kiss.
- (Mary) OK.

984
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,999
- (Ike sighs)
- What are you thinking?

985
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,415
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me...

986
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,130
...because I've never
had a relationship...

987
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,967
...that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

988
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,257
I think you're still drunk!

989
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:12,970
(kissing)

990
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,219
It's great. It's... it's...

991
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:58,387
I don't play the harmonica, but it's an
incredible... harmonica is what it is.

992
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:03,810
Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying to open up that side of you.

993
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,946
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection...

994
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,107
...on the wrong person.

995
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,367
It's not wrong for me.

996
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,996
(sighs)

997
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,705
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

998
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
Why not?

999
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,666
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

1000
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,426
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

1001
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,928
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

1002
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,590
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

1003
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,477
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

1004
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,854
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

1005
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,640
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

1006
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,651
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

1007
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,858
You... But you're 17 years old.

1008
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,695
By the time you're 21,
you'll have a dozen relationships...

1009
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,577
...believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

1010
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,113
Well, don't you love me?

1011
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,785
The truth is that I love somebody else.

1012
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,258
You do?

1013
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,882
Hey, come on... We... we...

1014
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,719
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

1015
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,597
You met someone?

1016
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,308
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

1017
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,397
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

1018
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,561
Have you been seeing someone?

1019
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,197
No. Yes. Someone older.

1020
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,528
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

1021
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,571
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

1022
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,332
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

1023
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,586
It's not right.
You shouldn't get hung...

1024
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,918
I mean, you should open up your life.

1025
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,082
You know, you've got to.

1026
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,627
You state it like it's to my advantage,

1027
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,795
when it's you that wants
to get out of it.

1028
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,182
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

1029
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,469
I'm 42. My hair's falling out.

1030
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,763

some hearing in my right ear.

1031

Is that what you want?

1032
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:09,893
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

1033
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,611
Why should I feel guilty about this?

1034
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,403
I've always encouraged you
to go out with guys more your own age.

out of my left leg. Apart from that...

- Yeah, you were dynamite...

two seconds you were faking.

So crazy.

Because I'd like
everything to work out.

- Mm-mm.

Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

1059
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,539
I don't blame you.

1060
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,423
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

- Yeah?

Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

We should go out sometime.

need a car? A sudden urge.

He just wants it.

Why not bring Mary around?

- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

1115
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,685
Bye. Bye.

1116
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:03,273
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

1117
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,651
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

1118
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,905
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
'cause that's not what I expected.

1119
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,941
- What did you expect?
- I don't know.

1120
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,530
You had always led me to...

1121
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:19,163
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

1122
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,574
So? So?

1123
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,710
Then this little homunculus,
you know...

1124
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,792
He's quite devastating.

1125
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,547
Really?

1126
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,256
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

1127
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,216
I don't know what you're...

1128
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,177
(typewriter)

1129
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,513
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- (Mary) Yeah, it's a cinch.

1130
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,678
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

1131
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,269
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelization.

1132
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:49,186
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelization for?

1133
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,946
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

1134
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:56,702
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

1135
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:00,534
The novelizations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

1136
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,042
- (phone rings)
- You should be doing other stuff.

1137
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,166
- Like what?
- Fiction.

1138
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,296
I've seen your fiction.
It's terrific.

1139
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,832
Hello?

1140
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,092
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

1141
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,629
I was hoping you'd pick up.

1142
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,889
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

1143
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,300
Well, why? What is it?

1144
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,846
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

1145
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,356
No, I don't think
that would be possible.

1146
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,609
I don't think that would be
possible at all.

1147
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,317
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1148
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,451
(Mutters under breath)

1149
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,828
- Who was that?
- What?

1150
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,989
Who was that on the phone just now?

1151
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:47,127
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

1152
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,797
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

1153
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:57,216
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

1154
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,855
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters...

1155
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,608
...and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

1156
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,520
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

1157
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,485
But Yale's family,
so of course he's encouraging.

1158
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,866
But Viking will shell out the money.

1159
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,494
Maybe it'll inspire Yale
to finish his book.

1160
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,155
He's been talking about it long enough.

1161
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:28,998
Mary read the stuff and she was laughing
out loud. I respect her judgment.

1162
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,583
Although she's doing
a think piece on...

1163
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:32,872
(Yale) Hello?

1164
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,464
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

1165
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,846
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

1166
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:43,133
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

1167
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,301
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

1168
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,972
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of Ike's book?

1169
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,140
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

1170
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,685
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

1171
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,603
- OK.
- In our new car.

1172
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,860
(♫ "Oh, Lady Be Good")

1173
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,750
(Yale) Jesus, listen to this.

1174
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,879
(laughing) "Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female..."

1175
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,041
...made me realize
what an empty experience...

1176
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,507
"...what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1177
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,639
Please. That is so nauseating. I... Oh!

1178
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,846
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1179
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,011
- She put that in?
- (Yale laughs)

1180
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,602
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1181
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,438
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1182
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:19,571
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1183
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,073
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1184
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,701
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1185
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,956
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1186
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,458
Everybody... All my friends and...

1187
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:36,838
(Emily) Listen. "He was given to fits
of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia..."

1188
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,840
...male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy...

1189
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,172
"...and nihilistic moods of despair."

1190
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,384
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1191
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:49,176
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1192
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:52,562
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death...

1193
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:57,396
...which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1194
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:01,153
- I came here to strangle you.
- (Jill) Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1195
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,531
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1196
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,487
It's an honest account.

1197
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,244
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1198
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:12,407
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1199
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,371
Like what? What?

1200
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,627
You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind.

1201
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,710
- (Connie laughs)
- What are you laughing about?

1202
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,593
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1203
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:26,550
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1204
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,966
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1205
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,306
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1206
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,723
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1207
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,392
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1208
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,311
Don't forget
that Willie's at ballet class.

1209
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,526
Look, I better warn you.

1210
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,239
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1211
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,539
- Anybody home?
- (Mary) Uh-huh.

1212
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:58,625
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story to
tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1213
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,379
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1214
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,042
Just let me get one glass of brown water
'cause I'm dying of thirst.

1215
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:08,384
- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today...

1216
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:12,551
...because I'm real annoyed over that
junk she printed in the book. And...

1217
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:16,597
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1218
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,982
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1219
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,899
Wh... What's the matter?

1220
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:29,567
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1221
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,492
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1222
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,050
What?

1223
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,466
You... Are you kidd...?

1224
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:54,183
- You are?
- Yes.

1225
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,978
Well, when did this happen? What...

1226
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,349
Well, you are or you think you are?

1227
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,984
I started seeing him again.

1228
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,237
When? Since when?

1229
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:11,989
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1230
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,656
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1231
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,419
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1232
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,877
I think I've always
been in love with him.

1233
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,133
How does he feel about this?

1234
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,168
Well...

1235
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:33,764
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1236
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,518
I'm stunned.
I mean, I'm in a state of, uh...

1237
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,896
Somebody should throw a blanket
over me. You know, I'm...

1238
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:44,935
Well, you see, he called me several
times in a very depressed state...

1239
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,320
...and he still loves me.

1240
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:52,075
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1241
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,656
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1242
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,821
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1243
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,284
Well, then I wish you would.

1244
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,451
I wish you'd get angry
so that we could have it out.

1245
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,040
I don't get angry.
I tend to internalize.

1246
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:08,549
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumor instead.

1247
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,961
Well, I told you that
I was trouble from the beginning,

1248
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,721
from when we started dating.

1249
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,132
So what does your analyst say?

1250
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,518
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1251
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:23,181
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1252
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,645
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

1253
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:26,934
Why?

1254
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:30,105
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1255
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:33,650
I know that sounds egotistical,
but, uh, you know...

1256
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:37,411
This guy's been married 12 years.
What do you think will happen?

1257
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,494
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1258
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:44,627
And if he does commit to you, when you
start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1259
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,629
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1260
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,416
I can't plan that far in advance.

1261
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,803
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1262
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,555
What kind of foresight is that?

1263
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,719
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1264
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,013
You always think
that you're gonna be the one

1265
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,898
that makes 'em act different, but...

1266
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,650
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1267
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,028
Mm-mm. Oh, well, I'm...

1268
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,906
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1269
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,158
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1270
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,156
What are you doing here?

1271
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,534
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1272
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,036
I was, but...
I'm trying to teach a class.

1273
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,947
So where can we go and talk?

1274
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,992
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1275
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,332
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily...

1276
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:12,169
...and run away with
the... the winner of the...

1277
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,959
...Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1278
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,923
Look, I love her.

1279
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:21,011
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1280
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,017
- Why? What was the point?
- 'Cause I thought you liked her!

1281
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,851
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1282
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:33,019
“I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1283
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:37,486
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1284
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,867
So you liked her?
Now you don't like her?

1285
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,450
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1286
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,456
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1287
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,459
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1288
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:53,213
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1289
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:57,377
You could've said, but you... All you
had to do was call me and talk to me.

1290
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,218
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1291
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,975
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1292
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,353
We had a few innocent meetings.

1293
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:12,438
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1294
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,693
We met twice for coffee.

1295
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,854
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1296
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,398
Did you meet for Sanka?

1297
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,283
That's not too romantic.
A little on the geriatric side.

1298
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,035
I'm not a saint, OK?

1299
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,821
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1300
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:30,494
You're... You rationalize everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1301
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,753
You talk about you wanna write a book,

1302
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,130
but in the end
you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1303
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:39,635
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1304
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:44,094
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1305
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,054
You are so self-righteous.

1306
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:50,346
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1307
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,686
I gotta model myself after someone.

1308
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,149
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1309
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:00,736
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1310
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,526
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1311
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:08,289
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1312
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,916
And now look.
This is what happens to us.

1313
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:14,750
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1314
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,381
I'll be hanging
in a classroom one day...

1315
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:22,295
...and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1316
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,838
Ike!

1317
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,177
Isaac, where are you going?

1318
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,320
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1319
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,324
But then, nothing's perfect.

1320
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:30,204
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1321
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,411
It's funny 'cause I'm just
a non-compromiser.

1322
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,418
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1323
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:40,081
I think it's always
a mistake to look the other way

1324
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,249
'cause you pay for it in the end.

1325
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,590
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1326
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,754
I'm living in the past.

1327
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,015
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1328
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:54,975
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1329
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:58,186
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1330
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,396
I think, and I know this sounds strange,

1331
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,062
but I think
I really missed a good bet...

1332
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,230
...when I let Tracy go.

1333
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,616
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1334
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,744
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week...

1335
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,624
...and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years...

1336
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,660
...when I actually
am honest with myself,

1337
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,749
I think I had the most relaxed times...

1338
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,415
...and, you know,
the nicest times with her.

1339
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,879
She was a terrific kid,
but young, right?

1340
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,044
So that's that.

1341
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,213
Why don't you call her?

1342
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,258
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1343
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,803
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1344
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:39,849
And (sighs) she was so sweet, you know.

1345
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,940
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago...

1346
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,696
...that I should
watch Grand Illusion on television

1347
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,950
and I never returned her call.

1348
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,157
'Cause I, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1349
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,618
She really cared about me and I...

1350
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,202
You know I was
a little pissed off at you.

1351
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,745
Me?

1352
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:05,758
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

1353
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:14,138
(Ike) An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan...

1354
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,927
...who are constantly creating...

1355
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,600
...these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves...

1356
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,767
...'cause it keeps them from dealing

1357
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,939
with more unsolvable,
terrifying problems...

1358
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,233
...about, uh, the universe.

1359
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:35,037
Um, let's, uh...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

1360
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:39,041
Well, all right, why is life worth
living? That's a very good question.

1361
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,076
Um...

1362
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:46,082
Well, there are certain things,
I guess, that make it worthwhile.

1363
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,046
Uh, like what?

1364
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:54,432
OK, um, for me, uh...

1365
01:24:55,299 --> 01:25:00,931
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

1366
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:04,767
Um, and Willie Mays.

1367
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:10,565
And, um... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

1368
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:17,079
And, um, Louis Armstrong's
recording of Potato Head Blues.

1369
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,950
Um, Swedish movies, naturally.

1370
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,995
Sentimental Education by Flaubert.

1371
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:27,290
Uh, Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

1372
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:32,086
Um, those incredible apples

1373
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,220
and pears by Cézanne.

1374
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,974
Uh, the crabs at Sam Wo's.

1375
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:43,431
Um, Tracy's face. (chuckles)

1376
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,652
(sighs)

1377
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,028
(♫ "He Loves And She Loves")

1378
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,389
(engaged tone)

1379
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,153
(♫ "Strike up The Band")

1380
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,148
(♫ "But Not For Me")

1381
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,075
(catches breath) Hi.

1382
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:29,114
Hi.

1383
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,666
I... (clears throat)

1384
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,873
What are you doing here?

1385
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,754
Well, I ran. (catches breath)

1386
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,755
I tried to call you on the phone,
but, uh, it was busy...

1387
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,262
...so I knew that
was two hours' worth of...

1388
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,924
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

1389
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,554
Where you going?

1390
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,598
London.

1391
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:57,267
You're going to London now?

1392
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:01,905
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

1393
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,157
...you'd be going to London?

1394
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,374
Well, let me get
right to the point then.

1395
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,330
I don't think you oughta go.

1396
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,338
I think I made a big mistake.
And I would prefer it if you didn't go.

1397
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,498
Oh, Isaac.

1398
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:25,045
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it, uh...

1399
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:28,090
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

1400
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,724
No.

1401
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,802
So... well...

1402
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,940
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

1403
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,736
Jesus, you... pop up...

1404
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:44,740
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

1405
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,945
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

1406
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:52,785
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

1407
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:56,703
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say? (mumbles)

1408
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,205
I don't think you oughta go to London.

1409
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,715
(sighs)

1410
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,047
Well, I have to go.

1411
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:08,009
I mean, all the plans
have been made, arrangements.

1412
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:12,597
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

1413
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,432
(sighs)

1414
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,596
Well...

1415
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:19,687
Do you still love me or what?

1416
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,236
Do you love me?

1417
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,151
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

1418
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,942
That's what this is all about, you know.

1419
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,862
- Guess what? I turned 18 the other day.
- Did you?

1420
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,201
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

1421
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:37,368
You're not such a kid. 18 years old.

1422
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,879
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

1423
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,794
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

1424
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,008
It was not on purpose, you know.

1425
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,515
I mean, I, uh...
You know, it was... I mean...

1426
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:56,265
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

1427
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,931
Well, I'll be back in six months.

1428
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,600
Six months! Are you kidding?

1429
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,565
Six months you're gonna go for?

1430
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:11,111
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

1431
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,278
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

1432
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:16,073
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

1433
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:19,493
You're gonna be in the thea...

1434
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,912
...working in the theater
with actors and directors.

1435
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:25,878
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

1436
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:31,593
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

1437
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:35,430
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

1438
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,641
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

1439
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:42,023
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

1440
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:45,436
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

1441
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:50,733
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

1442
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:55,279
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

1443
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,785
I've gotta make a plane.

1444
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:04,875
Come on, you don't... Come on.

1445
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,461
You don't... You don't have to go.

1446
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,803
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

1447
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,887
Six months isn't so long.

1448
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:21,138
Not everybody gets corrupted.

1449
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:26,727
You have to have
a little faith in people.
