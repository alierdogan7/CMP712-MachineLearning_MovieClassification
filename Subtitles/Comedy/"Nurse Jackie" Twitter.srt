1
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:03,940
Are you okay?
- I'm executive of my mother's estate,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,045
and as such,
it would mean the world

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,115
if I could set up a college
fund for the girls,

4
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:13,883
if for no other reason than taxes.

5
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,853
Ladies, this is Sam.
He's our new R.N.

6
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:20,123
You know I dismissed him because
he was wacked out on benzos.

7
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,758
He successfully completed
a rehabilitation program.

8
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:25,328
I have a stack of glowing
recommendations on my desk.

9
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,230
Can we get something
straight right now?

10
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,899
- You and I are not buddies.
- If you say so.

11
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,734
- You missed one.
- It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,171
The sun's going to explode and eat
up all the other planets anyways.

13
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,941
Wow, that's nice.
- The ring I could never afford to give her.

14
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,376
Still can't.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,944
How am I supposed to know?

16
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,480
He wears a big fucking bracelet
that says "I am diabetic."

17
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,717
I need to lodge a formal
complaint against a nurse.

18
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:49,118
Super.

19
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:52,288
- What do we got?
- Jackie, really, go.

20
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:12,667

21
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:13,502
<i>( phone buzzes )</i>

22
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,052
( hisses )

23
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,658
Goodness, that took a long time.

24
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,693
I was using an iron
that was not plugged in.

25
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:13,863
Fiona says Grace has
been getting up at night

26
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,931
and unplugging appliances.

27
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,667
Is that true?

28
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,702
Faulty wiring 
causes more house fires

29
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,437
than cigarettes and arson combined.

30
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:23,272
Where'd you hear that?

31
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,979
This is the best smoke detector 
they make.

32
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:32,715
It's also 
a carbon monoxide detector.

33
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:38,654
I've been saving my allowance 
to buy it.

34
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,123
( sighs ) Sweetie, thank you,

35
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,394
but your allowance is for fun
things like toys and stickers.

36
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:47,263
Here, sit down, sweetie.
Eat your breakfast.

37
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:51,233
Hey, Gracie, let Mom and Dad worry
about smoke detectors, okay?

38
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:52,968
Put your money away.

39
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:55,471
I just don't want the
house to burn down.

40
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:22,298
Wow.

41
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,668
You know the #1 ingredient
in hotdogs is cancer?

42
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,377
I partied like a
20-year-old last night.

43
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:37,680
Managed to score
some grade-A ecstasy.

44
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:41,817
Dvornoff in Psych told me
it would only last six hours

45
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,986
and it's been nine!

46
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,989
Still going strong.

47
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,592
You know...

48
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:53,496
I think my mother's death
ripped something open in me.

49
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,235
You have wonderful daughters, Jacks. 
Cherish them.

50
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,637
I will. Oh my goodness.

51
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,173
Do they know I'm their godmom yet?

52
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,542
Well, as it turns out,

53
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,010
I have not had that conversation--

54
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,846
Just call them. Call them.

55
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:13,149
And then let's all go 
to the St. Regis for lunch,

56
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,850
just us girls.

57
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,986
- Huh?
- The girls are in school.

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,989
Oh, we'll yank 'em out.
Love is more important than reading!

59
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,425
( garbled ) Maybe
I'll just catch a taxi

60
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,693
- and then go-- no one will notice--
- Right now? No.

61
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,796
You're staying right here.
Do not go anywhere.

62
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,497
- Stay right here.
- Taxi!

63
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,633
<i>(Jackie:) Stay here.</i>

64
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,680
( muffled ) Hey, guys.

65
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,788
Was that a walk of shame?

66
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,323
I don't want to know.

67
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,959
Do we think Zoey got
her pipes cleaned?

68
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,828
Dyahhh.

69
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,429
That's like seeing Santa naked--

70
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,364
It's not right.

71
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,567
( babbles incoherently )

72
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,535
- That's paper.
- Oh.

73
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,707
Hi. You the parents?

74
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,242
What can I do for you?

75
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,877
It's our son Harry.

76
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,879
He has a history of
breathing problems.

77
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:19,548
Our pediatrician said it
could be cystic fibrosis.

78
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,017
We scheduled a sweat
test to be sure,

79
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:24,019
but it isn't for another month.

80
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:26,922
He woke up choking. Could you help him? 
- Sure.

81
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:30,593
Harry, my name is Jackie.
Can I listen to your chest?

82
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:31,994
Okay.

83
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,599
Okay. Well, it's restricted,

84
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,901
But he's definitely
getting some air.

85
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:41,337
Harry, do you like coloring books?

86
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,339
Okay. Why don't I get
you some coloring books

87
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:46,342
and I'll have a doctor come and take a look? 
- I don't like doctors.

88
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:48,177
<i>- Yeah, me neither.
- ( mother chuckles )</i>

89
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,845
Lennox Hill has newer equipment,

90
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,648
but we can certainly bule him up
and give him a sweat test here

91
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,783
- if you like.
- That--

92
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:56,452
that-- that would be great.

93
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,354
Okay. You just sit tight.
I'll take care of that.

94
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:00,222
Dr. Cooper will be right in.

95
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:04,026
( humming, singing softly )

96
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,967
- Oh! 
- ( shrieks ) Oh my God!

97
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,135
Dr. O'Hara, I'm so sorry!

98
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,505
<i>Zoey, ma petite fleur!</i>

99
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,241
- Zoey, get back to work.
- But she's--

100
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:21,343
( giggles ) here.  Come here.
You, come with me.

101
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:28,050
Dear Dr. O'Hara,

102
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,985
I would like to take
this opportunity

103
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,720
to thank you for the lovely scarf.

104
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,356
Ooh. Stationery

105
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:35,891
and stamps.

106
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:38,027
Mmn, stamps!

107
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,129
There are little hearts there.

108
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,764
Hey, Jackie, Dr. O'Hara.

109
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,699
Hello.

110
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,901
- Can I help?
- Actually--

111
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,336
No, we are good.

112
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,174
Your accent-- London with
a touch of Sussex, right?

113
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,643
Indeed. 
- I spent my junior year in England.

114
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:57,012
- I'm kind of an anglophile.
- How convenient.

115
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,380
I'm an anglo.

116
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,816
- So what's going on?
- Nothing.

117
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,418
We're good. You can leave, please.

118
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:05,254
Went clubbing. Tad dehydrated.

119
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,790
Feel like humping the world.

120
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:10,759
- Did you do a little X?
- ( exhales slowly )

121
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:14,730
Chasing your GnTs with a
little Thai stick. Impressive.

122
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:17,733
Does she have a little problem? 
- No, her mother just died.

123
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,735
She went out clubbing last night--

124
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,971
You know what?
Get the hell out of here.

125
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,106
Go!

126
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:27,543
( softly ) Bye.

127
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,280
Jacks.

128
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,749
Bored. Need magazines.

129
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,886
Thor, give me your magazines.

130
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:39,822
What magazines?

131
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,924
Give them to me, including "In Touch".

132
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,100
How can you read this crap?

133
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:53,202
Please don't amplify my shame.

134
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,710
I know you like "In Touch".

135
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,746
Whoo!

136
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:09,084
Oh, look. Goldie and Kate--

137
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,286
mother and daughter

138
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,989
together just...

139
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:16,091
loving each other.

140
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,060
I should've called
my mother more often.

141
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,062
Did you know that when
I was at university

142
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:22,498
we used to speak to
each other every day?

143
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,299
No, I didn't.

144
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,969
I'd forgotten how affectionate
she was on the phone.

145
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,971
Speaking of, I can't figure out

146
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,739
how to delete her from my contacts.

147
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,642
Clearly, you need to give
yourself some time to grieve.

148
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:36,712
In the meantime: CT scan, CT scan,

149
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,681
this one needs a full workup,

150
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:41,016
this one needs a shitload
of Haldol and a psych eval.

151
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,218
Sign off on these.
Then you can read your crap.

152
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,933
Hey. Need a hand?

153
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,369
Oh hey, man. How you doing?

154
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,804
- Great. How are you?
- Good.

155
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,639
Oh no, I think I can
handle this one.

156
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,708
Thanks.

157
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:07,076
Strong man.

158
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,744
There you go.

159
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,379
So how's everything?
How's the family?

160
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,047
How's your wife? Jackie, right?

161
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,415
Yeah. Good memory.

162
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,484
Yeah, she's good, man. 
We're good.

163
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:16,852
Things are great--
better than ever.

164
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,488
That's nice.

165
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:21,857
Hey, did she like
that ring you got her?

166
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:23,826
Did I show you that?

167
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,894
You do pay attention.
Yeah, man, she loved it.

168
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,530
- She loved it.
- That's great.

169
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:31,700
So how about you, huh? 
Haven't seen you for a while.

170
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,669
Yeah.

171
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:36,338
I, uh-- I tried to kill myself.

172
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:39,575
I OD'd on some drugs trying
to get a girl's attention.

173
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:42,411
You believe that? Didn't work.

174
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:44,379
Man.

175
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:46,348
Yeah.

176
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:49,118
I'm just fucking with you.
I didn't try to kill myself.

177
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:51,820
Jesus.

178
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,123
You are a sick fuck.

179
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:57,359
I know, I know.
I got a sick sense of humor.

180
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,495
( chuckles ) How about a beer?

181
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,662
Yeah. You got a bud?

182
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,798
Yeah.

183
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:09,805
To love. To women.

184
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,573
To Jackie. Cheers.

185
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,709
Cheers.

186
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:15,811
How you feeling, little buddy?

187
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:17,446
Hot.

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,814
I guess that was a silly question.

189
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:21,850
Anyway, it seems strange, I know,

190
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,952
but it is the standard test
to confirm or eliminate

191
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,988
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis--

192
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,524
we force Harry to sweat
and then we measure

193
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:30,225
the amount of chloride
in his perspiration.

194
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,728
We know. 
Jackie explained everything to us.

195
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,798
Good.

196
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,666
How much longer does he
have to wear all this?

197
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,169
Uh, not much longer.
Then I'll do everything I can

198
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,004
to get you the test
results quickly.

199
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,973
And I'll do everything I
can to make sure he does.

200
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,344
- But I'm on it, so...
- And I'm on him.

201
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,581
- I got it.
- I'll just check

202
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:54,983
and double check.

203
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:59,288
A little bit O.C.D., but not a
bad thing if you're a nurse.

204
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,691
Your son's in good hands.

205
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,095
- What are you doing?
- Tweeting.

206
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,031
People follow my life online.

207
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:10,732
I'm sharing my thoughts
with the world.

208
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,601
Are you blogging about
that little boy?

209
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:14,369
It's not a blog; it's Twitter.

210
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:16,171
You can't do that. 
It's private.

211
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:18,874
Everyone remains
anonymous except for me.

212
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,779
If I said "cys fib," would you
know that's "cystic fibrosis"?

213
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,648
If I said "eff you,"
would you know that's "eat shit"?

214
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:29,885
( slaps button )

215
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,655
Bee-yotch.

216
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:39,928
- That's a nice scarf.
- Well, thanks.

217
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,097
It's from hermÃ¨s,

218
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,166
Which I think is a
pretty good store.

219
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,401
Dr. O'Hara gave it to me.

220
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,203
- Oh, cool.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:51,607
Does Dr. O'Hara have a problem?

222
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,208
I mean, with drugs.

223
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,743
No.

224
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,580
- Does Jackie?
- No.

225
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,582
- You sure?
- Positive.

226
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,352
And since you're asking,
I don't do drugs either.

227
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:06,088
Although, when I go to great adventure,
I do take Dramamine

228
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,023
'cause once on rolling
thunder I yacked

229
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,958
and it was a huge bummer.

230
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:13,128
<i>( man shouting ) I see your sins,</i>

231
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:15,330
<i>For I am God!</i>

232
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,798
That's God.

233
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,568
It's 12:53 pm.

234
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,436
Vermin!

235
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:23,472
Huh. 
- I used to be totally scared of him,

236
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:24,840
but now, not so much.

237
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:28,243
<i>- ( ranting continues )
- Oh, and he's crazy.</i>

238
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,913
Hey, you! Yeah, you,

239
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:34,049
Sir with the misshapen head,

240
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,118
<i>how do you wake up in
the morning?!</i>

241
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,786
I love this guy.

242
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,857
And you! Hey you, pizza-face!

243
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:45,694
You shall never marry!

244
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,863
<i>You won't even be engaged!</i>

245
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:49,865
<i>I am God!</i>

246
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,201
Bow bow bow to me,
you sinners and slu--

247
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:54,403
( groans )

248
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:57,639
Uh-oh! God's down!

249
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:01,143
<i>A lake of fire will
swallow you up!</i>

250
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:03,178
Pimps and whores!

251
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:06,315
- On my count-- one, two, three.
- Get the fuck off me!

252
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,917
I'll smite every one of
you fuckin' assholes!

253
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:11,053
Psychosis. Can I have some
vitamin H over here, please?

254
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:14,156
- Haldol-- shaken not stirred.
- Getting the IV.

255
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:24,232
This is God, age unknown.

256
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,068
He's probably about 50.
He lives across the street.

257
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:27,936
<i>Schizophrenic, currently off meds.</i>

258
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,938
I know this guy. 
- Got hit in the head with a bottle.

259
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,741
He told me I was super handsome, 
like Clark Gable.

260
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,509
I retract!

261
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,145
Let's stitch him up.

262
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:47,189
You are an angel.

263
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:53,528
Will you stop fucking
twittering and focus, please?

264
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,234
"Bitchy nurse being bitchy again."

265
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:02,237
<i>Don't do that. 
Don't you dare twitter about me.</i>

266
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,846
Thanks for telling me I'm an angel.

267
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,217
When I was younger,
I actually thought I was an angel

268
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,219
because I had a round face.

269
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:20,155
And I thought about
becoming a nun--

270
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,593
( whispers ) "Sound of Music"--

271
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,762
But I really like boys,

272
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,463
So I didn't.

273
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:30,332
Not all boys. There's one boy.

274
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:34,002
More man. Man-boy.

275
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:35,871
He's totally...

276
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,407
Picka picka picka picka.

277
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,675
It feels really inappropriate

278
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,446
<i>Talking about this with you,
God, Sir.</i>

279
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,315
You know, when I hit my head,
I seen something.

280
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,052
Like what? Like a bottle
whizzing towards you?

281
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,653
I seen this tunnel

282
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:55,257
with this incredibly bright
light at the end of it,

283
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,792
but it didn't hurt to look at.

284
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:59,327
And at the end of the tunnel,

285
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:01,897
I met the most loving presence.

286
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:04,733
And I just knew it was God.

287
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,635
I saw God.

288
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,170
But I thought you were God.

289
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,972
I mean, I thought you
thought you were God.

290
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,308
- I am God.
- So you saw yourself?

291
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,511
- No.
- So you saw God

292
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:19,047
and it wasn't you.

293
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:20,615
Yeah.

294
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,585
So... ( clicks tongue )

295
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,854
I guess that means

296
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:28,990
That you're not God.

297
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,493
Oh my God.

298
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,665
Oh my-- I'm not God!

299
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,234
- I'm not God!
- Wait.  Calm down.

300
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:40,669
I'm not God!

301
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,672
- ( yells )
- ( shrieks )

302
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:46,174
I'm not God!

303
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,043
( yelling )

304
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,179
- Zoey, handle it.
- ( groans )

305
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:54,382
<i>I'm not God! ( yells )</i>

306
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,391
Hey, Jackie, I found these.

307
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:05,494
Okay.

308
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,729
Where? 
- Right over here on the floor.

309
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,798
- Good catch.
- I'll take 'em.

310
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:12,734
- Are they yours?
- Are they mine?  No.

311
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,703
What is hospital policy

312
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,505
Regarding lost or found drugs?

313
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,406
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

314
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,809
- Oh, why so desperate?
- Excuse me?

315
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:23,712
Well, you just seem really
anxious for me to hand them over.

316
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,448
Do you want to get your ass kicked?

317
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,750
Give them to me. Now.

318
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:33,488
Come with me.

319
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,859
Any unidentifiable drugs or
substances go into the slot.

320
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:40,028
That is hospital procedure. Got it?

321
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,545
Pain in my ass.

322
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,141
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

323
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,443
Listen, Luis is a firefighter, right? 
- Yeah.

324
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:31,046
- Is he there?
- Yeah, he's here.

325
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,715
Can you do me a favor?
Can you ask him to go over to the house

326
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,785
and explain to Grace that the
house will not just burn down?

327
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,520
<i>Maybe that'll ease her
mind a little bit?</i>

328
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:40,655
- That's a great idea.
- All right.  Love you.

329
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,824
Love you too. Bye.

330
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:48,563
- The wife?
- Yeah.

331
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:53,902
I fuckin' love beer nuts.

332
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,543
<i>- ( knocks on door )
- Come in.</i>

333
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:06,014
Hi. A few things.

334
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:11,019
First of all, Coop will
not stop twittering.

335
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:13,622
It is interfering with work
and it's pissing me off.

336
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,257
That's interesting.

337
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,493
Dr. Cooper lodged a formal
complaint against you.

338
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,695
Against me? Really?  For what?

339
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,365
Insubordination and
general bitchiness.

340
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,500
Insubord-- fuckin' A.

341
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:28,236
Twitter tweetering
fuckin' dickhead.

342
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:30,939
- Anything else?
- Yes.  This Sam guy,

343
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:33,174
like every newly-sober person,

344
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,810
he's convinced that everyone
around him is an addict.

345
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,979
It's like the born-again
guy we had last year.

346
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,814
I'm just sayin'.

347
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,084
Also, one of my nurses needs
a pediatric psych referral.

348
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,755
- Which one?
- She'd rather not say.

349
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,858
Be helpful if I knew
how old the child was

350
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,126
before making a referral.

351
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,661
Yes, well, she's a
very private person

352
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,363
and she would rather not have
everyone know her personal life.

353
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:57,365
I would say the kid's between,

354
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,134
I don't know, 7 and 12.

355
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,835
<i>Gender? 
- Look, she wants a list of shrinks</i>

356
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,772
that take our insurance and
she wants it anonymously.

357
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:06,207
You know what? Forget about it.

358
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,909
Jackie.

359
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:14,149
Here is the best child
psychiatrist I know

360
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,418
and she takes our health plan.

361
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,921
Thank you.

362
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:22,023
She was tremendously
helpful with my boy.

363
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,760
Thanks.

364
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:32,934
Hi, I have the family
of a little boy

365
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,936
waiting for the results
of a CF sweat test.

366
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,438
I would really love
to send them home.

367
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,473
I can only give the results to
the doctor who ordered the tests.

368
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,742
I know. Dr. Cooper
really wants the results,

369
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:42,477
but he's in with a
trauma right now.

370
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,946
And if the test is positive,
I need to set up an IV--

371
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,615
Look, I'd really like to help
you out here, but I can't.

372
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:51,553
( sighs ) Okay.

373
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,822
Everything's really
preliminary at this point,

374
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:56,324
So it's just better not to give out. 
Sorry.

375
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,229
- How old?
- Oh.  Three months.

376
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:03,565
<i>- Smiling yet?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

377
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,168
It's really awful
when they get sick.

378
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,874
- What's the name?
- Miller; first name Harry.

379
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:19,047
Well, the whole run's not complete,
but the prelims look good.

380
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,849
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,221
Okay, so I went to the lab

382
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,956
and talked to the tech.

383
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,558
You have to keep in mind that the
doctor has not seen the results yet,

384
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,294
But so far they are
looking very good.

385
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,598
- Thank God.
- Why don't you all go home

386
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:38,466
- and get some rest?
- Thank you so much.

387
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,403
You've been--
you've been so wonderful.

388
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,038
Really? We can take him home?

389
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:47,675
- I would.
- Just... Thank you.

390
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,044
See ya, Harry.

391
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,514
- ( whispers ) Say bye.
- Bye.

392
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm telling you, man, it's great.

393
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:01,055
You can see the
lights of Citi Field.

394
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,191
It's way brighter
than Shea used to be.

395
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:06,594
You been yet, to Citi?

396
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,030
- Mmn, not yet.
- You want to go sometime?

397
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,132
My brother gets me tickets.

398
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,134
Well, I would love that.

399
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:14,502
Cool.

400
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,339
- Islanders too.
- No shit.

401
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:22,410
Would I shit you?

402
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,612
( chuckles )

403
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:32,053
<i>( plastic crinkling faintly )</i>

404
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:38,226
<i>- Thor?
- ( crinkling stops )</i>

405
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,940
( meekly ) It's not what you think.

406
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,575
Donuts.  Really?

407
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:56,444
You already lost one eye,
am I right?

408
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,380
- How'd you know?
- Today in trauma

409
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,349
with God,

410
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:02,784
I had my hand next to your face

411
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:04,786
<i>for about 20 minutes
before you saw it.</i>

412
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,690
Also, I just kind of
used my spidey sense.

413
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,429
You are the only one who knows.

414
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:17,499
I haven't even told
my new boyfriend yet.

415
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,434
Thanks for covering.

416
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:23,738
It's a shell.

417
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,139
It's porcelain.

418
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:28,109
They paint it to
match my other eye.

419
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:30,378
It's great. You would never know.

420
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:33,648
- You wanna see?
- Sure.

421
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:44,659
Ooh, look at you.

422
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,675
( sighs )

423
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,312
What do you think of
the new guy-- Sam?

424
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:06,281
Oh.

425
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:09,717
Uh, well, I think he's really smart

426
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:11,920
and incredibly cute.

427
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:15,690
And I think he's probably
an excellent nurse.

428
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,861
- I don't like him.
- Yeah, he's dead to me.

429
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,469
Go on, yell at someone.

430
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:30,138
I don't want to.

431
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:32,440
Oh, come on.

432
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,475
You're so good at it.

433
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:37,612
Ooh.

434
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:39,514
Look at the bald dude.

435
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:42,850
Say, "Hey, baldy, you're all bald.

436
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,719
Grow some hair, you idiot."

437
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,988
What's the point?

438
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,690
I'm not God.

439
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:50,858
Oh, sure you are.

440
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:56,898
I'm not. 
I've seen God and he wasn't me.

441
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:59,734
- That doesn't mean anything.
- It means everything.

442
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,736
It means I'm not God.

443
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,972
It means my life is a sham.

444
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,308
Well, Jesus wasn't God.

445
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:11,212
So? 
- But he's still, like, really important

446
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:14,682
in the religious
hierarchal stratification.

447
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:17,785
So maybe you're like Jesus.

448
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:21,155
Uh-huh?

449
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,992
Hey, Jesus was the son of God.

450
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,995
So maybe you're like
the nephew of God

451
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,631
or the brother-in-law of God.

452
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:35,069
I like where this is going.

453
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:39,073
Hey you, strumpet with
the thinning hair!

454
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:42,577
I can see your soul!

455
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:45,246
You whore!

456
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,785
Lather, rinse, repeat!

457
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,188
That's how they'll get you!

458
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:57,659
Where's the sweat-test kid?

459
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,627
I sent them home.

460
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,163
Why don't you run to Akalitus
and lodge a formal complaint?

461
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:04,499
What do you mean
you sent them home?

462
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,535
What don't you understand?
They were sitting here for over six hours

463
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,170
while you were dicking
around somewhere.

464
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:11,072
So I went to the lab,
I got the results,

465
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,074
Which were negative in
case you're interested,

466
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:15,877
- and I sent them home.
- Negative.

467
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,081
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

468
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:23,251
Excuse me? 
- Those test results were preliminary.

469
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:26,187
I was waiting for the final results which,
by the way, were positive.

470
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:27,955
Kid's got cystic fibrosis.

471
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,590
Oh fucking God, no.

472
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,726
Yeah. Harry and his family
are home celebrating

473
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,394
and now it's my job
to pick up the phone

474
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:35,363
and tell 'em that their kid's
not gonna live to see 30.

475
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,367
What's the matter?
No snappy comeback?

476
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,570
( sighs )

477
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:44,272
Let me call them?

478
00:26:44,306 --> 00:26:46,574
Have a nice goddamn night.

479
