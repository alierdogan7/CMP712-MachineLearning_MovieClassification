- OK, Hammy.
- Huh?

173
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,766
- What is it?
- What is what?

174
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,834
What is it you want to tell me?

175
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,368
Hmm? Oh. Oh!

176
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,971
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

177
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,173
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Oh, yeah!

178
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,676
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

179
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,346
It's really scary.
Follow me.

180
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,917
OK. Meeting called on account
of weird scary thing.

181
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,186
Let's go.

182
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,756
Hmm. Foragers...

183
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,426
Hammy, what weird thing?

184
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:39,397
Oh. That weird thing.

185
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,108
[gulps]

186
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,976
[gasps]

187
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,860
It never ends!

188
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,130
Whoa!

189
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,232
Hey!

190
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,235
It never ends that way too!

191
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,770
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

192
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,271
[Lou] Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.

193
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:25,443
- I've never seen
anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

194
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,014
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

195
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,416
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

196
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:36,221
Shh! It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?

197
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,224
I... Well, it's a...
It's... Verne?

198
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,494
Well, it's, uh...
it's obviously...

199
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,461
some kind of bush?

200
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,531
I'd be less afraid of it
if I knew what it was called.

201
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,466
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

202
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,035
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

203
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,504
I'm a lot less scared of Steve.

204
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,806
Oh, great and powerful Steve!

205
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,543
- What do you want?
- I don't think
it can speak.

206
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,545
[woman] I heard that,
young man!

207
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,247
- [all scream]
- [gasps]

208
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,215
- [woman] You get over here!
- OK.

209
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,183
Hammy, get back here.

210
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,553
- Steve is angry!
- It came from
the other side of Steve.

211
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,856
I mean the bush.
I mean... Jeez!

212
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,557
[sighing]

213
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,060
There's only one way
we're gonna find out
what this thing is,

214
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:20,799
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

215
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,234
[gulp] Aah!

216
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,538
- [all scream]
- Ay yai yai.

217
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,274
Uh... Aah!

218
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,975
Steve ate Verne!

219
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,845
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

220
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:39,450
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten,
I just tripped.

221
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,556
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

222
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,928
[shuddering]

223
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,968
[woman] Kids, come on,
hurry up! You'll be late!

224
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,470
[car engine starting]

225
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,208
[woman] Gary,
come on, breakfast!

226
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,845
[dog barking in distance]

227
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,218
What is this place?

228
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,029
Oh, hey there, little...

229
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,631
- [sizzling]
- Ohh!

230
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,234
fella. Ugh!

231
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,037
Oh! [gasps]

232
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,307
Hi.

233
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,542
Aah!

234
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,246
- Oh!
- [rolling]

235
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,181
[gasps]

236
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,651
[panting]

237
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

238
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,223
Ow.

239
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,633
Whoa! Ohh!

240
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,908
- <i>[ringing]</i>
<i>- Operator.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

241
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,679
No, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

242
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,588
[bicycle bell rings]

243
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,058
- [quavering]
- [yelling]

244
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,094
Aaah!

245
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,629
- [grunting]
- Verne's back.

246
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,231
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

247
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,632
- You OK?
- Help him up.

248
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,468
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

249
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,538
They must have come while we
were hibernating. It was awful.

250
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,574
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

251
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,344
whacking me with
these sticks like it was
some sort of sick game.

252
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:51,282
You should have died!
You should have
laid down and died.

253
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,618
- Dad.
- That's not
the worst part.

254
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,254
Half the forest is gone.

255
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,122
The oak trees
and the berry bushes,

256
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,159
they're just...
they're just gone.

257
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,029
- Jeepers.
- What'll we do for food?

258
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,565
How are we gonna live?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,068
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

260
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,138
We will be fine
as long as no one
goes over Steve again.

261
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,243
It's called a hedge,
and it is not to be feared,
my amphibious friend.

262
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,114
It is the gateway
to the good life.

263
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,983
Uh, I'm a reptile, actually.

264
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,452
But, you know,
it's a common mistake.

265
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,419
And, uh, you are?

266
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,990
Oh. Where are my manners.
I'm RJ.

267
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,359
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help
overhearing,

268
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:39,364
and I can shed a little light
on what this whole hedge
situation is about.

269
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,199
You see, what was
once mere wilderness

270
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:46,037
is now 54 acres
of man-made, manicured,
air-conditioned paradise.

271
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,207
Except for that
little-bitty speck.
You are here.

272
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,444
- [gasping]
- No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

273
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,613
You gather up food,
store it for the winter?

274
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,016
- Uh-huh. We fill the log!
- Hammy.

275
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,752
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

276
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,288
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

277
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,456
Let me ask ya,
how long's it take?

278
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,293
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and
seventy-four days.

279
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,464
- Ohh! Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

280
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,399
Not if we work together.

281
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,268
You've got
the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,

282
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,404
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

283
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,441
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

284
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,210
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

285
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,112
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

286
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't know,
the guy's making
a lot of sense to me.

287
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,584
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with
wazoo food there.

288
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,621
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.

289
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,258
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on.
The what is what?

290
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,561
When something doesn't
feel right, my tail tingles.
Let me tell you,

291
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,530
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

292
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:50,768
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something
you need to be afraid of.

293
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,806
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

294
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:55,740
This is not a birthmark.

295
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,676
That's because you went
over there without a guide.

296
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,578
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

297
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,816
Not interested in
the most delicious food
you've ever tasted?

298
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,517
- No!
- Come on.

299
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,620
Not interested!

300
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,456
OK. I get it.

301
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:18,196
I understand.
This is something that
you're just not open to.

302
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,732
- Wow!
- [gasps]

303
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,537
- Whoa!
- [moaning]

304
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,207
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

305
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,374
What is that?

306
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,777
That, my friend,
is a magical combination
of corn flour,

307
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,149
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

308
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:42,253
a.k.a., the chip.
Nacho cheese flavor.

309
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,823
- Over here!
Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

310
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,592
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

311
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,395
It's all good.
And we're going
over there. Tonight!

312
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,731
Yeah!

313
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,534
[RJ] Welcome to suburbia.

314
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,836
- Wow!
- Look at that!

315
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,405
[gasping]

316
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,175
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!

317
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,511
[Lou] Oh, my!
Hon, look at this.

318
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,714
- Jeepers.
- How's that tail, Verne?

319
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,517
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,

320
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,518
I'm holding you responsible.

321
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,656
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility
for that.

322
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,891
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

323
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,459
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

324
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,896
I took a few clippings
out of my quills to do
a little comparison.

325
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:28,366
Look at this,
the grass seems to be
greener over here.

326
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,536
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

327
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,271
Yeah, 'cause
the raccoon says...

328
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,772
OK, enough about him.
I get it.

329
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,843
So he can do a couple of tricks.
I mean, it's not like
he can walk on water.

330
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:43,481
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

331
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,517
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

332
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,920
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

333
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,190
because they are slowly
losing their ability
to walk.

334
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:56,327
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans
fit in there?

335
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,663
Usually? One.

336
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:02,333
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

337
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,702
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.

338
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,736
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

339
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,207
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

340
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,876
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

341
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,912
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

342
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,249
roll over and give your
privates a good licking.
They love it.

343
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,386
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed
to be two inches,

344
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,257
and according
to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

345
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,594
Could we just get
the food and go? Really,
do they have it or not?

346
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:34,865
Didn't you see it?
It was in the box. They've
always got food with them.

347
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,869
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.

348
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,938
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

349
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,674
[RJ] The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."

350
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,611
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

351
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,980
That is a device
to summon food.

352
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,716
That is one of the many
voices of food.

353
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,652
That is the portal
for the passing
of the food.

354
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,556
That is one of the many
food transportation
vehicles.

355
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,891
Humans bring the food,
take the food,

356
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,627
ship the food,
they drive the food,

357
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:07,331
they wear the food!
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

358
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,301
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

359
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,036
- [children cheering]
- Aah!

360
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,338
What do you know? Food!

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,742
That is the altar
where they worship food.

362
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,877
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

363
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,481
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

364
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,584
Food! Food! Food! Food!

365
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,418
Food!

366
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,588
So you think they have enough?

367
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,624
Well, they don't.
For humans,
enough is never enough!

368
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:38,829
- [gasping]
- And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?

369
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:43,801
They put it in gleaming,
silver cans,

370
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,736
just for us.

371
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,073
Sweet jeepers.

372
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,942
- Dig in!
- [cheering]

373
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,680
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

374
00:21:55,682 --> 00:22:00,551
- Wow.
- Share there,
everyone, share.

375
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:05,856
That's a diaper.
And that does come out
of a wazoo.

376
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,660
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

377
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,329
And these things
are just the scraps!

378
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,699
Wait'll you see
what comes in the boxes,
packages and cans!

379
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,101
I'm telling you,
stick with me,
and in one week

380
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,804
we will gather
enough food to...

381
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,006
- To feed a bear.
- What?

382
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,677
- Just a figure of speech.
- <i>[beeping]</i>

383
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,781
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

384
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,651
What is it, baby?
[screaming]

385
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,588
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...

386
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,824
No! Nix that! Run!

387
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,992
- Run!
- Get outta here!

388
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,028
Run!

389
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,796
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

390
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,033
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

391
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,068
Filthy vermin!

392
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,741
Verne's right,
that was horrible.

393
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,942
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

394
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:02,446
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what
I was talking about!

395
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,382
These humans
don't want us around.

396
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,752
So we scared her,
and she overreacted.
No biggie.

397
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,720
No biggie? Oh, that is
what we call a biggie.

398
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:14,458
Come on, think about
the food. It was worth it
for that food, huh?

399
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,494
That stuff is to die for!

400
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,396
[groaning]

401
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,597
Let me rephrase that.

402
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,799
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.

403
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:26,670
Look, maybe our little
forest life looks primitive
to a guy with a bag.

404
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,938
- What?
- But I think I speak

405
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,608
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

406
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,745
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

407
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,580
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

408
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:40,117
You haven't even
tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

409
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,420
That is the way
to store some fat.

410
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,821
You'll be sweatin'
through the winter!

411
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:48,793
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right,
you guys sleep on it!

412
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:53,664
Good idea. I'm gonna
check back with you.

413
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,600
Shoot!

414
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,969
Almost had 'em.

415
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,043
- [Verne]
Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

416
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,678
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

417
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,713
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

418
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,915
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

419
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,817
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

420
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,984
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

421
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,986
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

422
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,122
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

423
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,858
When we wake up,
only 273 days left
till winter.

424
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,563
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

425
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,699
Spuddies...

426
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:33,838
Cooler... Wagon...
Redder wagon.

427
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,873
Time's up, RJ.

428
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,809
But I have
six more days! No!

429
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,579
No! Aaah!

430
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,713
[gasping]

431
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,616
OK. Four paws, fur.

432
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,085
Still alive, still alive.

433
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,589
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em
to his house?

434
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,591
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

435
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,259
Jimmy was pushing me
on the bus.

436
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,928
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

437
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,798
Next time he shoves you,
beat him up.

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,967
Yes!

439
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,603
[grunting]

440
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:09,540
OK, kids, dive in.
There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

441
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,043
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

442
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,212
[Penny] No, you don't.

443
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,283
[buzzing]

444
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,022
[groaning]

445
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,765
[crunching]
OK. This is great.

446
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,668
[crunching]

447
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,940
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.

448
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,309
But that... [swallows]

449
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,545
That was very satisfying.

450
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:51,615
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

451
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,182
Mmm!

452
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:56,720
- Lots.
- I gotta admit,
that does look tasty.

453
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,222
[spits]
What are you doing here?

454
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:03,127
I'm here to help you
with your...
foraging thing.

455
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,028
Look, Verne,

456
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,931
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.

457
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:10,801
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

458
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,603
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

459
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,605
You know,
that got me right here.

460
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,740
You see, Verne, I used
to have all of that.

461
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:21,245
My own place,
surrounded by loved ones,

462
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,279
universal remote.

463
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,182
But then all that
went away with...

464
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,217
the weed hacker incident.

465
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:31,055
- [shudders] Oh, God.
- Oh, come here.

466
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,724
Yeah, that feels good,
doesn't it?

467
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,893
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

468
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,662
We could always use
the extra hand there,
you know.

469
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:43,233
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

470
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,234
OK.

471
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:49,006
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

472
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,709
This is me...

473
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,676
going.

474
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,111
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

475
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,312
[RJ] Really nice
getting to know you.

476
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,749
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

477
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,185
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

478
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:04,288
- Hey, uh, RJ?
- [sobbing]

479
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,789
You can... you can stay.

480
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,392
- [laughing]
Come here, ya big lug!
- No.

481
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,794
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

482
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,896
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.

483
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:17,101
- Do you mind if
I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

484
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,871
Great. Hey,
can I work with Hammy?

485
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,673
Wanna help me find my nuts?

486
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,708
Very tempting, Hammy,
very tempting.

487
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,678
But first,
I want to show you this.

488
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,047
- [sniffing]
- You like this cookie?

489
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,981
Ohh ho ho ho!

490
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,051
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

491
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,985
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

492
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,920
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

493
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:42,092
that they are
hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

494
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,095
- The Doyles'
is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

495
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,431
There they are.
America's most coveted
cookies.

496
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,968
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners
and Smackeroons.

497
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,805
- And guess what?
They're all yours!
- Hoo hoo! Aah!

498
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,142
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.

499
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,744
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

500
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,112
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

501
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:06,850
if we successfully marry
your manic energy
to my brilliant plan!

502
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,153
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...

503
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,688
The I's have it!
Let's ride.

504
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,390
[girl] Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

505
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,925
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

506
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:19,029
- her face explodes
or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

507
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,298
- Wait, wait.
How many boxes of...?
- Hey!

508
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,101
You stay away
from those cookies.
They're mine!

509
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,736
- [tapping] Ahem!
- Aah!

510
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,772
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

511
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,774
Oh, we have so much work to do.

512
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,310
Come on,
step into my office.
Now, listen up.

513
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:37,715
What we're going for here
is a vicious, man-eating,
rabid squirrel.

514
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,284
- Can you handle that?
- Um, excuse me?

515
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,185
Yes... Hammy.

516
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:46,724
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute
and cuddly, so...

517
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,059
Rabid, not rabbit.

518
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:49,927
Oh... What?

519
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,931
- OK. So first we're
gonna muss the hair.
- Ow, ow, ow!

520
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,300
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

521
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,902
[spits] We're gonna
mat the fur a little bit.

522
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,172
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

523
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,006
Liking that a lot.

524
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,209
Show me that wild look
in your eye. Come on!

525
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:12,116
- Oh! I can burp my ABCs!
[burping] A, B, C.
- Hammy!

526
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:15,953
I really need you
to focus right now, OK?

527
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,254
- OK.
- Thank you.

528
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,455
Let's see. There we...

529
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,289
Hang on a minute.

530
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,127
Not that, not that.
No, no. Aha!

531
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,829
- Nice!
- Ooh!

532
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,032
Hammy?

533
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,539
[chuckling] Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

534
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,342
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!

535
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:43,180
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

536
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:48,118
[babbling] I'm rabid!
I'm foaming at the mouth.

537
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,923
I'm foaming,
very scary rabid squirrel.

538
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:53,557
[both] Rabies!

539
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,959
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

540
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,896
I know.
You're right behind me...

541
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,963
Got it! Stand back!

542
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,433
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

543
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,569
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!

544
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,070
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?

545
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,072
Everything's
under control. Go back.

546
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,174
You call that under control?

547
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,176
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

548
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,912
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

549
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,948
What are you doing?
Watch out!

550
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:27,491
- Hold still!
I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

551
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,526
- Yuck!
- Gross!

552
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,362
- Eww! Nasty!
- Eww, eww! Oh, my God,
this is so gross!

553
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:37,568
Verne! That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

554
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,939
Or, should I say, au naturel.

555
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,241
Huh?

556
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,210
Oh.

557
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,911
Hammy, you were awesome,
my man!

558
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:52,182
You had me scared.
I was about to come out and
beat you with a book myself.

559
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,619
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are.
You are Hammy!

560
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:59,623
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what?
Chicks dig scars.

561
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,924
- There!
- Over there!

562
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,928
That's where
the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

563
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,297
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

564
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,433
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

565
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:14,071
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV
and calm down.

566
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:14,605
Thanks, Mom.

567
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:18,442
Sorry, Janis, did I hear
them say "rabid squirrel"?

568
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,377
Oh, I think they might
just be overreacting.

569
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,514
What if they're not?
What if we have a potential
pandemic on our hands?

570
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,184
Vermin running loose,
spreading disease

571
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,387
and lowering
our property values?

572
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,091
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

573
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,459
Fine. Worry about
your casserole,

574
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:41,632
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!

575
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,335
[RJ] That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

576
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,538
Got a box right over here
for ya, Penny.

577
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,940
That is good. Eat up!

578
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,075
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.

579
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,178
Feel buzzing in the back
of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

580
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,450
It's what keeps humans going,
why they don't hibernate.
Add a little of this,

581
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:05,155
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

582
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,056
I like it! I like it!

583
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:12,095
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing
you need is caffeine.

584
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,197
That's right.
Come on, dig in.

is just the beginning.

Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

666
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,968
- I certainly hope
he's not in any pain.
- [chuckles]

667
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,670
- What the...?
- Aah! Kill it! Kill it!

668
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:24,241
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!

669
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,509
Oh, man!

670
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,413
All right, what am I
up against here? [sniffing]

671
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,883
Possum, porcupine,
skunk, squirrel,

672
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,254
raccoon...
[sniffing] amphibian.

673
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,824
- Reptile.
- No.

674
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,693
Reptile.

675
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,665
That's what I call
a super-duper
performance there.

676
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,467
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.

677
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:53,303
They were riveted.
You were awesome!

678
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,771
All right!

679
00:37:54,773 --> 00:38:00,477
Dad. I just gotta say,
that was, uh...
that was pretty good.

680
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,946
Props for the Ozman!

681
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,881
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!

682
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:08,718
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:

683
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,953
RJ.

684
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,521
[all] RJ!

685
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,656
Brilliant!

686
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:16,593
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

687
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:17,827
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

688
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,431
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows
what he's doing.

689
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:25,001
[Lou] You're my hero there,
fella.

690
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,072
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!

691
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,642
Yeah, we wanna show you
something. Come on, hurry!

692
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,046
Check it out.

693
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,884
[Stella] Your new home!

694
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,557
And look, we got
a place for you right here!

695
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,558
That's for me?

696
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,762
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

697
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,865
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.

698
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,736
- Here, I'm not
supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

699
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,771
- [slurping]
- [clears throat]

700
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,007
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here

701
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,876
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.

702
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,645
Really? Wow.

703
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,481
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

704
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:16,052
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!

705
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,955
Can you take the remote
before my dad does?

706
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:22,992
Wow. A universal remote?

707
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:27,731
This is nice, guys.
Really nice.

708
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,667
<i>[man] We now return to</i>
<i>A Scoundrel Among Us.</i>

709
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,669

00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:49,819

<i>"I am a dirtbag."</i>

715
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,790
Dirtbag. I don't think
that guy's a real doctor.

716
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,993
What do you think there,
RJ? RJ?

717
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,662
[rapid breathing]

718
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,765
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, RJ.

719
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:06,803
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in
way too deep.

720
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,004
Just get the food.

721
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,607
Feed the bear.
Get the food.

722
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:11,574
Feed the bear. Whaah!

723
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,744
Where's the food?
Where's the food?!

724
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,814
[wheels squeaking]

725
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,820
[groans]

726
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:24,921
Verne.
What are you doing?

727
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,990
Getting things back
to the way they were.

728
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,925
- No, don't.
How about I just leave?
- Good.

729
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:33,430
You leave,
and I return this stuff
to the rightful owners.

730
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,464
What?! Why?

731
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,499
Because we've angered
the humans.

732
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,035
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.

733
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:44,007
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

734
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:48,511
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!

735
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,579
No, we don't!

736
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:53,183
- You can't take it!
- Yes, I can!

737
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,185
- Let go!
- You let go!

738
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,721
- I have to have it.
- No!

739
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,157
Stop!

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,633
[gasps]

741
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:15,071
Verne. Move slow,
keep your voice low
and follow me.

742
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,106
- What?
- Shh!

743
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,642
- No.
- Shh!

744
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,746
No. I'm not falling
for any more of your
smooth talk!

745
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:29,118
I don't know what
you're up to, but my
entire shell is tingling.

746
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,587
Know what? I'm listening
to it this time,

747
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,857
- and I'm putting
my foot down.
- No, no.

[chew toy squeaking]

749
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:40,230
- Play?
- Huh? Oh! Huh?

750
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:43,266
Play! Play! Play! Play!

751
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:46,669
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

752
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,139
Aaah! Oof!

[growling]

755
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,985
Let's play!

756
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,722
Play!

757
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,624
Jeez... Aah!

758
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,192
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!

759
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:13,763
- Down, boy. Sit.
Roll over!
- Play!

760
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,900
- Play dead!
- Play!

761
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:21,004
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

762
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,005
- Play.
- Huh?

763
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:22,972
Play, play, play, play.

764
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:26,543
Play, play, play, play.

00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,848
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

766
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,984
[RJ] You're dropping
all the food, man!

767
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:38,254
- Here, catch.
- Play!

768
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,224
Are you hungry?
Look, food.

769
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,961
- Oh, my back!
- Whoa!

770
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,664
Look, people!
Play with them!

771
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,932
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?

772
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:52,669
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

773
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:56,940
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's...

774
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,845
Verne, unhook the chain.

775
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,183
Play!

776
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,187
No.

777
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:12,922
Yes.

778
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,891
Bad.

779
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,194
- Oh, boy.
- Wow!

780
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,272
Verne, I told you
to unhook the chain.

781
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:49,025
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

782
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,161
Aah!

783
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,737
[both gasping, blowing]

784
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,142
You're the devil.

No! No!

788
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,261
Verne, you all right there?

789
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,064
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

790
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,799
- What happened?
- What happened?

791
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:33,770
It's gone.
The food! Gone!

792
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:34,771
- What?
- Gone?

793
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:38,207
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

794
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:41,177
- Verne?
- I returned it

795
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,446
- to its rightful owner.
- What?

796
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,848
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

797
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,152
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

798
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,821
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

799
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,457
Yeah, Verne,
what were you thinking?
The log was full!

800
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,427
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you
saying there?

801
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:02,999
That the food we gather
our way isn't as good as
the food we gather your way?

802
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,134
Your way?
You mean his way.

803
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,470
Can't you see RJ
is just using you?

804
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:11,207
[gasps] Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

805
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,043
You have got
to trust me on this.
Don't you understand

806
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,912
there's something
wrong with him?

807
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,715
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

808
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,951
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

809
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:25,888
I'm starting to think
that tingle is just you
being jealous.

810
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,057
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

811
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,794
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.

812
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:34,931
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

813
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:36,032
See what you've done here?

814
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,800
If they listened
to half the stuff
you're telling them,

815
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:41,904
they'll be dead within a week.
You are only interested
in taking advantage

816
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:47,977
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

817
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,515
I'm not stupid.

818
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,386
OK, I didn't mean...
Uh...

819
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,356
I meant ignorant.

820
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,926
To the ways over...
over there.

821
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,897
Come on, you guys.
You know I didn't
mean it like that.

822
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,532
Don't... don't do this.

823

00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,467
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.

1002
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,502
Shoo. Go on,
get away from here.

1003
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,672
My owner does not give
scraps to common strays.

1004
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,574
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.

1005
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:22,544
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice
collar you got on.

1006
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,113
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Come no closer!

1007
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:29,418
I must not be
so near a creature
of the outdoor woods.

1008
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,586
[sneezes]

1009
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:33,589
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?

1010
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,758
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.

1011
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,129
OK, that's it. I am sick
and tired of everybody
taking one look at me

1012
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:42,631
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.

1013
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,567
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't get all primped

1014
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,836
and preened to have some
over-fed, pompous puffball

1015
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,141
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

1016
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,176
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

1017
00:56:54,178 --> 00:57:00,048
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

1018
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,053
It is bold. I like it.

1019
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,825
Well, believe me,
there's more
where that came from...

1020
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:13,562
- ...puffball.
- All right, team,
let's boogie.

1021
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,098
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

1022
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,102
- What...?
What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

1023
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:24,573
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.

1024
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,809
Luminous? Dang.

1025
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:29,445
You know, I think
this is the part
where I blacked out.

1026
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,048
Did the little shoes
and cars actually
get into the house?

1027
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,483
<i>[beeping]</i>

1028
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,685
- So you got a name?
- Yes.

1029
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:40,022
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.

1030
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:43,225
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

1031
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:49,097
Ooh, that's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?

1032
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:54,036
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

1033
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:58,474
Animals are in the house.

1034
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,049
[all] Wow!

1035
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:11,086
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

1036
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:15,824
- Yes! OK,
stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!

1037
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,025
- We got it.
- Here we go.

1038
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,661
No grip, no grip, no grip.

1039
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:24,600
- Hammy!
Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.

1040
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:27,169
That hurt.

1041
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,208
<i>- </i> Uh-oh.
<i>- [loud rising note]</i>

1042
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,878
- Just a minute,
I'll be right there.
- What was that?

1043
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,616
It... That's just
the sound of my heart.
Can't you hear it?

1044
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:43,652
[imitating rising note]

1045
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,121
Aaah!

1046
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,825
This way, this way!

1047
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:57,900
OK, OK, we're good.
Go back to work.

1048
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,168
There ya go.

1049
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,304
Here, catch!

1050
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,978
Oh, boy. [gasps]

1051
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,914
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

1052
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:15,717
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.

1053
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,688
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

1054
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:20,222
Fascinating.

1055
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:24,259
inside, I have
a multi-leveled climby-thing
with shag carpet.

1056
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,228
- Come, I show you.
- No, no!

1057
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,829
I haven't told you
about my life.

1058
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,765
Good, good.
Going great, going great.

1059
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:32,935
- <i>[beeping]</i>
<i>- [water bubbling]</i>

1060
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:33,702
What is that?

1061
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,672
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

1062
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:41,076
- [both screaming]
- Where'd she go?

1063
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,612
Get down and stay down.

1064
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,818
[yawning]

1065
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,220
Move. Move.

1066
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:13,809
Come on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

1067
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,844
- No! Not without
those Spuddies.
- What?

1068
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:19,982
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye
on that human.

1069
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,951
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

1070
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,620
The tingle, the tingle.

1071
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:27,222
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

1072
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,291
Hang on, Vincent,
this'll only take a second

1073
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,826
- Vincent?
- Where?

1074
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:33,128
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

1075
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,964
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I... er...

1076
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:41,069
Just bear with me is what
I meant to say. [chuckling]

1077
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,405
There's no bear.

1078
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:50,712
Lights fading.
Limbs growing co...

1079
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,148
Heather.

1080
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,184
[shudders, retches]

1081
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,258
Oh, Heather!

1082
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:08,163
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

1083
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,834
I thought you were dead.

1084
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,070
I learned from the best, Dad.

1085
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,239
That's my girl.

1086
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,107
[grunts] Come to Papa.

1087
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,743
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

1088
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:23,045
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

1089
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,714
Let's get out of here
because we have
what we need.

1090
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,783
- No, we don't.
- What are you
talking about?

1091
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,718
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

1092
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,954
I've got this long
to hand over that wagon
of food to a homicidal bear.

1093
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:37,893
If these Spuddies aren't
on the menu, then I will be.
Now let go of my tail.

1094
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:42,798
- What?
- Let go!

1095
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,102
Hey, whoa!

1096
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,004
- Huh?
- [gasps]

1097
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,338
Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

1098
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,878
Stella, Stella,
where are you going?
Stella!

1099
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,382
- Aaah!
- Stella!

1100
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:06,421
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK,
because I'm a...

1101
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:07,356
Skunk!

1102
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:11,426
Yeah, that. Sorry
you have to see this.

1103
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,495
Fire in the hole!

1104
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:21,236
- [coughing] Oh, my...
- This smell
doesn't bother you?

1105
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,873
No. This face
was bred for beauty.

1106
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,775
I cannot smell a thing.

1107
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:30,112
You can't smell?

1108
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,855
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1109
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:42,257
- Run!
- This way!

1110
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,029
[muffled] Let's party.

1111
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,298
- Bunnies!
- Aah! [grunts]

1112
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,501
Flee, my love.

1113
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,337
Run, that way. Outside!

1114
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:59,274
- Move, kids! Come on!
- [all grunt]

1115
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:06,081
Buenos días, reptile.

1116
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,320
You've just been verminated.

1117
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,822
[laughing]

1118
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,190
[sniffing]
Whoa! You stink.

1119
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,493
That's because you let them
into my... house!

1120
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,862
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy,
stop your honkin'.

1121
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:25,333
These little guys
will be disposed of
quickly and humanely.

1122
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:30,472
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

1123
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,444
It was a pleasure
doing business
with you, ma'am.

1124
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,253
[wheels squeaking]

1125
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:57,365
- What's he gonna do
to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

1126
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,901
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.

1127
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:05,106
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be OK.

1128
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,345
You were right about him,
Verne.

1129
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,582
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.

1130
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,384
No.

1131
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:21,323
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

1132
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:25,060
I should've known better.

1133
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,202
- [Vincent] Wow!
- Vincent?

1134
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,038
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

1135
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,210
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...

1136
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:47,949
that, right there,
is a thing of beauty.

1137
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,554
That is the most vicious,
deceitful,

1138
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:57,459
self-serving thing
I've ever seen.
[chuckling]

1139
01:04:57,461 --> 01:04:58,960
Classic RJ.

1140
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:04,332
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

1141
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:11,640
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up
just like me.

1142
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:15,310
Having everything
you ever wanted.

1143
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:18,046
But I already had that.

1144
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:21,283
What, them?
Who are you kidding?

1145
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:25,687
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

1146
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,222
Always will be.

1147
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:30,125
It's how guys like
you and me survive.

1148
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:33,194
So a few saps
got hurt in the process.

1149
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:39,367
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

1150
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:43,705
Actually, I do.

1151
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,110
And right now,
they really need me.

1152
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:54,382
- So I really need this!
- [Vincent] RJ!

1153
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,288
- [gasps]
- [tires screeching]

1154
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,991
What the...?

1155
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:12,000
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

1156
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,272
You sorry sack of rat dung.

1157
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:21,009
Whoa, Stella,
this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

1158
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:24,045
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

1159
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:26,414
- [muffled] Bear!
- What's that?

1160
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,482
- Bear!
- Hair?

1161
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,516
- Bear!
- Dare?

1162
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,753
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

1163
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,727

[RJ] That, my friends,
is the object of all human
attention and devotion.

1346
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,299
- And they call it a TV.
- [Bucky] Wicked cool!

1347
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:57,171
[RJ] Humans feel an inner
need to connect with
the world around them.

1348
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,305
[Lou]
That is super-duper.

1349
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,141
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

1350
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:02,777
Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.

1351
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,211
[Stella]
Wow. Interesting.

1352
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:07,782
[Penny] Come on, kids.
Family time there,
in front of the TV.

1353
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:08,816
Got your snack food?

1354
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:10,317
[Hammy] Buy a vowel.
Buy a vowel!

1355
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:11,452
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1356
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:14,388
- [Ozzie]
I can't find the remote.
- [Lou] Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1357
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,425
- Has anybody seen the remote?
- [Heather] Dad, chill.

1358
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:18,759
[Stella]
I could do a little TV.

1359
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,829
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted

1360
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:22,897
or if Saxon is really an alien.

1361
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:24,398
[Hammy] Like Khan
in Star Trek II!

1362
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,268
The Genesis Project
was in the hands
of the Enterprise,

1363
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,837
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1364
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:31,105
[Verne] Well,
that was specific.

1365
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:32,807
[Hammy] I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.

1366
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:35,843
- [Heather] Gummi Worm, anybody?
- [RJ] Let me have one.

1367
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,178
[Stella] Bucky,
pass this to Lou.

1368
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,213
- [Lou] Taste this.
- [Spike] Don't you take that.

1369
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,383
- This is the perfect food.
- [RJ] Fat-free cookies?

1370
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:43,484
Might as well be eating dirt.

1371
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,787
[Hammy] I've had dirt.
I don't like dirt.
It tastes like dirt.

1372
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:49,824
