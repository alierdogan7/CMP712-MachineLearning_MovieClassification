00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,256
I'm sorry. Is everything okay?
I did not ...

178
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:54,390
Not bad, but it is pain.

179
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,181
I'm not myself today.

180
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,256
My career was ruined by
an idiot in a homemade rocket Sat

181
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,891
Hold on. What about your feet?

182
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,465
"Spray on shoes. They will not come off.

183
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:13,338
Cool. This may loose shoelace
epidemic problems.

184
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,398
Where are they made.
An elastic material.

185
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,096
Yeah, exactly.

186
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:24,695
I mean, they are shiny.
I am Sam.

187
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:30,503
Is that a monkey thought translator?

188
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:35,018
Unbelievable. Will you make this?

189
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,262
You've hit me with that rocket.
- You have kicked me in my face.

190
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,206
I told you that I am sorry.

191
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,625
You only get one chance, and
if you do not save ...

192
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:56,698
you again have to do cleaning.

193
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,007
That can only mean ...

194
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:18,252
This really works.

195
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,074
Your machine?
Was that rocket of yours?

196
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:27,835
Do you love it?

197
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,851
Delicious! It's great!

198
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:34,994
This is the biggest weather phenomenon
in history.

199
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:38,106
You do not weather?

200
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,755
Our trainee humiliated again
is apparently back.

201
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,930
Thanks, Patrick.
That you will not believe ...

202
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,990
but I am heart
a hamburger rain.

203
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:12,561
Perhaps you have seen a meteor shower,
but such meteors've never seen.

204
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:17,263
The city does not eat more sardines,
This is absolutely wonderful.

205
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:28,973
This will be great.

206
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,895
This is actually food <i> again
invented by Flint Lockwood. </ i>

207
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,388
Flint Lockwood?

208
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:40,651
You are arrested for destroying
Land of Sardine.

209
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,440
Those burgers were great.

210
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,691
The director called, and he said,
"everyone thought that great food again.

211
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,085
"Food Show". This increases
Country or Sardine.

212
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,915
Can you please again
eat make it rain?

213
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,393
I really do not know if I ...
- Do you back?

214
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,011
You take me a fool?

215
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,645
Please?

216
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,755
Yes!
- No.

217
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:04,686
Give me a chance.
- We both know that it was accidental.

218
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,715
I know.
- Cheese Burgers from the sky ...

219
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:10,545
that is not natural.
- My invention can save the entire city.

220
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:13,387
You are so proud of me, Dad.

221
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:17,279
And ...
A career.

222
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:22,761
Can you look into my eyes and tell me
you have this under control?

223
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,940
And not that it ends in a disaster?

224
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:27,040
Yes.

225
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:43,473
I have it under control,
it does not end in a disaster.

226
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,218
Well.
- Thanks, Dad.

227
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,391
Of course.
- Good. So Sam ...

228
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,470
Here the magic happens.

229
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:07,091
<i> Home, Flint. </ i>

230
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:11,556
You take really much time alone.

231
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:18,601
How it works.
Water goes in the top ...

232
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:20,871
and food is coming from the bottom.

233
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,310
So if you are in the stratosphere,
change the molecules ...

234
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:28,602
the cumulonimbus layer.
- This is a clever observation.

235
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:33,159
I mean, the clouds contain
probably water.

236
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,525
I think you therefore
appeared there.

237
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:40,114
Why did I do that.
- Exactly.

238
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,817
The machine uses the principle
of hydro kinetic mutation.

239
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,760
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation ...

240
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:55,814
that mutates the genetic recipe
in any food you want.

241
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,016
Pizza is?
- Yes!

242
00:22:58,114 --> 00:22:59,172
Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

243
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,978
Peas? Cake? Apples? Apple Sauce?
- Yes.

244
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,345
A sandwich with bacon, lettuce and tomato?
- I am pretty sure every kind of food.

245
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,417
Kipvleugels?
- Think about what you want to say ...

246
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,470
if the food is, it can.
- Bullshit.

247
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,379
Nonsense is no food.
- Gelatin then!

248
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:15,492
Do you enjoy gelatin?
- Delicious.

249
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,987
I agree, wonderful.
And then peanut butter?

250
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:20,379
No, I am very allergic to peanuts.

251
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,334
Me too.
- What is it?

252
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:23,764
Peanut allergy.
- No, the machine.

253
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:27,253
Of course. It is called the Flint Lockwood
diatonic super mutant ...

254
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,173
etensvermenigvuldiger dynamic ".

255
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:33,389
Or for short 'the FLDSMDFR.

256
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:34,984
FLDSMDFR.

257
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:42,132
FLDSMDFR.

258
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:45,925
Manny, make sure you record it.
He is now making the food.

259
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,443
Now?

260
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,470
I can not.

261
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:54,721
I did this hilarious internet
video show.

262
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,428
Impressions, build, connect.

263
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:10,028
Paints, run.

264
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:13,989
Staring, motivate.
Place.

265
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,159
I can not believe I
all three hours sitting watching.

266
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,468
I know.

267
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,089
It works.

268
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,470
What do you want for breakfast?

269
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:33,656
Gummi Bears.
- No, we know how you are with Gummi Bears.

270
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:36,164
Eggs then?

271
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:37,628
Toast?
- Orange juice.

272
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:39,901
Bacon!

273
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,897
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

274
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,657
To the computer!

275
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,837
Input code <i> eat.
Menu: (Bacon), crisp. </ I>

276
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:51,338
<i> eggs. </ i>
- Are you sure this is safe?

277
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:57,536
Do not worry. I have a meter that hazard
let us know when dinner is overgemuteerd.

278
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,791
What happens if it mutates to eat?

279
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:03,379
That will never happen.

280
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,863
Now it will explode.

281
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,035
Keep your distance.

282
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:24,495
Those cheeseburgers were only the beginning, because
a breakfast area go to Swallow Falls.

283
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:28,182
My prediction: "fried eggs".

284
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:49,253
Flint my boy, can you do?

285
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:52,271
We do so, you let it
snacks but still raining ...

286
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,896
weather girl doing free advertising ...

287
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,804
I have a loan with high interest
concluded ...

288
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:01,034
this miserable town
"a tourist voedseltopia" change.

289
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:04,146
You should only eat to rain,
three meals per day ...

290
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,065
every day in the foreseeable future.
And in thirty days.

291
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,960
We reopen the island on
a fantastic way ...

292
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,480
as a destination that you must have seen.

293
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:17,686
Then everybody, everywhere,
adore your invention.

294
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:22,056
Do you?
- I know.

295
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:29,892
Poultry in motion.

296
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,867
Mr. Lockwood, there are waffles?

297
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,899
A waffle. - Jelly Beans.
- Avocado.

298
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:45,494
Coming.

299
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,888
Leftovers? No problem,
with the latest invention of Flint Lockwood ...

300
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:54,620
from the zichter. Thereby bringing it
the uneaten food out of sight.

301
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,058
And you thought it out.

302
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,026
Flintlock Woods napkins

303
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,228
Great!

304
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:23,018
A pizza in a turkey is stopped
All frozen and dipped in chocolate.

305
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,315
I am the mayor.

306
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,289
You look different. Another hairstyle?
- Yes, that's right.

307
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,382
Thank you remember.

308
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,550
Dad, I'm going back to the laboratory.

309
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:53,378
I can show you how I make dinner.

310
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,569
No thanks. This techno eat ...

311
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,098
is too complicated for an old fisherman.

312
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,487
I got it.

313
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,666
I can still use your help here.

314
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,838
I now work with the mayor.

315
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:12,801
The reopening of the city
is about one weeks.

316
00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:15,673
Exactly. I got it.

317
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:26,576
Flint Lockwood?
- Yes.

318
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:30,135
Tomorrow is my birthday son Cal.

319
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:33,746
Can you not
something special to rain?

320
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:37,858
I'm quite full of requests.
And you were always mean to me.

321
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:41,205
For just once.
For my special angel.

322
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,483
A special day.
- I do not know.

323
00:28:44,484 --> 00:28:47,578
I want the machine
too much work, so ...

324
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:51,041
I knew I would make little chance.

325
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:54,038
I just wanted to show Cal
how his father loves him.

326
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,614
I thought you would understand.

327
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:03,872
You always know how their father's love and
appreciation to their sons want to show.

328
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:10,115
Earl, wait.

329
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,116
I have an idea.

330
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:46,730
Congratulations son.
- Dad?

331
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,437
This is your day.
Go have fun.

332
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:53,938
I love you. You are crazy.
- I love you, boy.

333
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:56,532
Ice!

334
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:04,005
Frozen strawberries river.

335
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:19,797
Come on, Dad.
- I do not know, Cal. It does not ...

336
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:31,193
I love you boy.
- I know, Dad.

337
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:33,679
You say that every day.

338
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,557
Flint, this is crazy.

339
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:42,773
For ice design, which looks like,
I do not know how you did.

340
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,901
Perhaps with hot caramel?

341
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,642
Flint, meaning in a snowball fight?

342
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,410
What is the problem?

343
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:56,730
I've never thrown snowballs.
- Really?

344
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,597
I know the rules.
Is there a way now, or ...

345
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:04,370
to death.
- No.

346
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,164
You never ...
Even Steve throws chocolate snowballs.

347
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,368
So?

348
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,866
No, throw harder.

349
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,957
Snowball!

350
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:27,922
Snowball!

351
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:31,177
Well, I can not say
on your enthusiasm.

352
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,730
Snowball!

353
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,059
Snowball!

354
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,729
Snowball and snowball!

355
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:42,906
What is going on.
- Snowball!

356
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:46,359
Snowball.

357
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,088
<i> I scream, you cry,
We all scream for ...</ i>

358
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:51,946
<i> Flint's latest delicacy. </ i>

359
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,019
<i> We freeze and have fun
if the mayor declares that ...</ i>

360
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,717
<i> it is a holiday ice cream. </ i>

361
00:31:57,343 --> 00:32:00,018
<i> He wants to invite everyone in the world,
a cruise-liner to take ...</ i>

362
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:04,634
<i> Saturday to qualify for the grand opening
Chewandswallow of ...</ i>

363
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:07,878
<i> a town that really
in fashion. </ i>

364
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,603
<i> A town that is truly full of ice. </ i>

365
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:23,500
<i> This is the news today on WNN.
I am Sam Sparks. </ I>

366
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,682
Flint, this is the best present ever.

367
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:36,272
I got it. Investigations,
role.

368
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:37,326
Rotate.

369
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:39,597
Wait.

370
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:42,956
Sam Sparks.
- End.

371
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:47,666
Regret. Think about it.
See what I do?

372
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:49,659
Flint?
- Hey Sam, how are you? That's nice.

373
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,317
I was wondering if you with me ...

374
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:54,111
morning with something I wanted to do?

375
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,535
Well.
- Great, bye, meet me in the woods.

376
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,252
Got it.
I have to go Steve!

377
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:03,147
Keep the lab to watch for me!

378
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:13,935
Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

379
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:18,398
I thought it was fun
to piece together a run.

380
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,729
Like friends do.

381
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:24,735
Look, what's that?

382
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:36,022
Jelly is my favorite.

383
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:37,938
You never made a request, so ...

384
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:40,560
I have one for you.

385
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,236
Join us.

386
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,004
How did you ...

387
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,482
I made some jelly
middle of the night ...

388
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:07,261
and when I awoke
I brought it here and ...

389
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,978
and pressed it into a giant mold
I had made.

390
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,354
Nothing special.

391
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,019
Everything is made of jelly.

392
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:19,691
These piano. These hanging lamps.
That Ghetto Blaster, which jelly.

393
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,759
The aquarium.
The Minus D'Milo-with-no-face statue.

394
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:25,076
And David the conqueror as you see.

395
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,784
Come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?

396
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,525
Nowhere on!

397
00:34:48,092 --> 00:34:50,234
Cannon Ball!

398
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,041
Jelly-stroke.

399
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:58,333
I know I should not do.

400
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,153
So, so jelly.
- Yeah, right.

401
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:14,172
It is fixed, it is liquid.
It is transparent and you can eat!

402
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:17,408
I mean, it's good.

403
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:20,240
Why are you doing?
- What?

404
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:24,340
Most clever thing to say and then
see from there?

405
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:28,118
Can you keep a secret?
- No.

406
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:32,234
But this time.

407
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:38,252
It is a long time ago but
I was also ...

408
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:43,190
a nerd.
- It?

409
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,706
When I was a little girl ...

410
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:48,486
I wore a ponytail, glasses ...

411
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,706
and I was completely obsessed
the science of weather.

412
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:59,953
Other girls wanted a Barbie,
I wanted a weather radar Doccler Turbo 2000.

413
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:04,132
Robert Child Rick taught me a weird song,
which was not even clever.

414
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:08,882
Eyed, squinting,
you have a need glasses to see!

415
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,860
Go ahead.

416
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:17,471
So I got a new look,
gave science doing it ...

417
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:20,223
and there was never laughed at me.

418
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:24,396
And I still need those glasses, but
I never wear it.

419
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:27,006
I bet you look good
with glasses.

420
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,056
And up it.

421
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,216
What?
- Nothing.

422
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,929
Wait!

423
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,939
It is a jelly-clamp.

424
00:36:44,055 --> 00:36:46,469
And now, the unveiling.

425
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:54,775
I mean, you looked good before,
but now ...

426
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,087
you are beautiful.
- No, I mean ...

427
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,402
so I can not come in public.

428
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:06,762
Why not?
I mean, this is you really! Right?

429
00:37:08,457 --> 00:37:11,195
Smart. Respect Abel.

430
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:15,332
Who would not want that look.
- You know ...

431
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,746
I've never
as you met Flint Lockwood.

432
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:22,377
Me neither.
How about you?

433
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,928
Flint, you phone.

434
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,804
Is your phone?
- That's odd?

435
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:48,280
Someone must have turned my number.
- Flint!

436
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,497
It is the mayor.
Do you mind if I answer him?

437
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:53,194
No, go ahead.
- I'm so sorry, I must ..

438
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:56,731
It is really important.
I step outside.

439
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,206
Dad, you've come.
I must tell you so much.

440
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,140
Do I look good?
- You look great! Come on.

441
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:20,662
I would stand in the list.
- Hi, Brian.

442
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,190
What?
You let the guy inside?

443
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:27,107
That guy is a Nerd!

444
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:32,839
Thank you.

445
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:37,062
At Flint and his delicious steak!

446
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,145
Thanks though.
- Very nice case.

447
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,875
Flint Lockwood!

448
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,225
No roof?
- Yes.

449
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:57,129
Just love on your plate. I even let
your favorite foods rain. Meat.

450
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:09,021
You know that tomorrow is the big opening
of the town?

451
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:14,056
The mayor has asked me
at the ribbon cutting.

452
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:18,703
He says that my invention has the city
saved. Are not you proud of me?

453
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:32,694
Flint, seems you do not steak
a little too big?

454
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,481
Yes, it is a great steak and not
each steak was exactly the same.

455
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:40,186
Did you not hear what I just said?

456
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,134
I'm not this good
for humans.

457
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:52,361
You may need this thing off.
- It makes everybody happy.

458
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:55,378
Everyone except you.

459
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:58,292
If you accept now that I'm like?

460
00:39:58,293 --> 00:40:01,082
Instead of trying to me
a tackle shop to get boring?

461
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,733
You obviously know what you're doing.

462
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,019
Then I will not stand in the way.

463
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,362
You can do him no favors.

464
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:46,814
He is everything I do spoil.

465
00:40:56,326 --> 00:40:59,376
These are great hot dogs.

466
00:41:11,442 --> 00:41:14,378
This is not so bad?
Or it may, Steve?

467
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,889
Yellow.
- You're right, Steve.

468
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,303
The danger meter is in yellow.

469
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,503
I do not know what to do.
- I do.

470
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:27,887
This delicious hot dogs as explained!
- Oh no!

471
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,656
How did you get in?
- Tomorrow is the big day Flint.

472
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,413
The fate of the city
is in your food again.

473
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,263
I think to post up.

474
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:42,141
Just sign here.
I do not know you in the lurch.

475
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:48,418
Mr. Mayor, I think
You should see something. - What?

476
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:53,123
This is the molecular structure of
the hotdog who last week cases.

477
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:57,475
And this is the structure
of a hotdog, today cases.

478
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,319
The machine uses radiation to micro
the particles of food to mutate.

479
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,245
The more we ask to make
more clouds he used ...

480
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:08,515
the more radiation there is,
the more the molecules-to mutate.

481
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:12,604
And therefore the food growing.

482
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:16,494
This I have heard,
science, higher.

483
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:22,483
And bigger is better. Everyone is crazy
the size of these portions.

484
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:25,234
I certainly would.

485
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:31,129
My dad thinks I should put him out.
- Geniuses like us ...

486
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:34,617
fathers are never understood, Flint.
- As things now ...

487
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:36,620
Who has the approval
need of a family ...

488
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:39,499
if your approval
millions of people have?

489
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:42,423
And not to forget, that cute girl
one of Sam Sparks.

490
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:47,458
And me.
I've always seen my own son.

491
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:53,496
I will be so proud of you tomorrow.
And you cut ribbon ...

492
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:59,259
and saves the city and proves to everyone
what a great inventor you are.

493
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:02,835
So here is the opportunity.

494
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:06,485
You can let go by
and have anything you want ...

495
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,535
and the great man,
I know where you are ...

496
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:18,947
if you put it out, ruined everything,
and nobody will ever allowed.

497
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:22,052
The choice is yours.

498
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,664
Choice.

499
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:35,381
Imports <i> etens Code </ i>

Al Dente Spaghetti <i> Menu </ i>

501
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:45,777
I mean, bigger is better.

502
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,785
Right?
- Oh yes!

503
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,576
Who is hungry?

504
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,942
Welcome tourists,
in Chewandswallow.

505
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:53,174
This is a great mayor.

506
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:56,256
Fun in our Nacho Cheese Hotspring.

507
00:44:57,547 --> 00:45:02,971
Allow the children to eat junk food all
they want our children unsupervised area.

508
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,612
Jelly Beans, teeth.

509
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:07,223
And when the fun is over ...

510
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:10,856
look at the sunset
in 'mountain leftovers.

511
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,531
Protected by our
suspected indestructible barrier.

512
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:18,835
Today we have people here,
around the world.

513
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:24,508
Flint, you should consider this.

514
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:26,965
Are not you on TV?
You would have to send out.

515
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,509
There is a problem. I think
the food increases.

516
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,619
No, it's great. Big portions.
Everyone loves it.

517
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,519
Flint, I'm not sure
we do well.

518
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,729
If we have more on our plates
than we can chew?

519
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:40,808
For the first time in my life is
everyone like what I did.

520
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:44,456
Why can not you just be happy for me?

521
00:45:44,457 --> 00:45:47,224
Go say something about the weather or something.

522
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:54,618
And now the hero of the city, and my
metaphorical son, Flint Lockwood!

523
00:46:04,664 --> 00:46:08,198
Flint, we wish you the ceremony
with the scissors does.

524
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,201
Flint? No!

525
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,874
Please.
- You can not tackle!

526
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:17,153
Baby I'm Brent.

527
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:31,060
The truth is, Flint,
everyone loves you.

528
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:12,560
Danger!

529
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,301
Salt and pepper wind?

530
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,957
Oregano?

531
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:39,420
Sam, wait. I just sold.

532
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:47,463
I can sell?

533
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,028
Sorry.

534
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:13,375
Sorry.
- No problem.

535
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:27,203
Look there.
- Not now, Steve.

536
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:37,125
Sauce.

537
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:47,507
This is Sam Sparks, live
Chewandswallow from ...

538
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:52,014
Sam, we find a good storm is fun,
but you look like a nerd out.

539
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,695
Several children are stranded
in a tornado.

540
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:59,522
My stomach hurts.

541
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:06,106
What is that, one schrunchie? I took
not seen since 1959.

542
00:49:06,107 --> 00:49:08,812
We have an emergency.

543
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:13,453
We come right back to that storm, as
Sam is looking more attractive.

544
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:25,964
Steve, we have the Kill Code Upload ...
What are you doing here?

545
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,364
I am the last ten minutes
to ordering food.

546
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,887
Why? Is there something wrong?
- I try to stop the machine.

547
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,802
I've put everyone in danger.

548
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:35,433
So much can it not be.

549
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,802
No!
- I'm off.

550
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:41,530
I can command
Kill the stop code.

551
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,273
Send the Kill Code.
- I'm back.

552
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:49,266
I have the button ...

553
00:49:52,043 --> 00:49:56,566
Flint, it's nice to beat.

554
00:49:56,567 --> 00:50:00,038
Not so fast!

555
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,469
That was the only way the machine
to work.

556
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,931
What exactly did you order?

557
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:29,877
"A Vegas Style
all you can eat buffet ".

558
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,994
Jelly Beans ...

559
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,340
Is everyone all right?
- Yes.

560
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:02,724
Somebody help me!

561
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:05,379
It is my son.

562
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,449
We have a doctor.
Is there a doctor?

563
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,977
Someone?
- I am a doctor.

564
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:15,060
Are you?
- That was me. In Guatemala.

565
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,534
I came here for a better life.

566
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:19,673
Quite a big decision.

567
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,601
How is he?

568
00:51:26,762 --> 00:51:28,953
He is in a food coma.

569
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:33,891
Too much junk food. I need celery.
- Please.

570
00:51:37,868 --> 00:51:42,440
Papa?
- Cal, I love you son.

571
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:48,869
It seems that everything has come.

572
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:53,564
Not yet. That tornado is nothing
compared to what is on.

573
00:51:53,565 --> 00:51:56,402
Manny, connect us.

574
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:05,274
Do you report, Nancy.

575
00:52:06,517 --> 00:52:10,586
Patrick, there is a huge
food storm.

576
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:12,936
It will spread around the globe.

577
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:16,348
I have calculated speed of the storm.

578
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:18,634
First it will arrive in New York.

579
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:23,323
Dan Paris. And it goes on to China.

580
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:28,635
And about four hours, the entire Northern
Hemisphere have a big blockage.

581
00:53:04,252 --> 00:53:07,445
Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing?

582
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:11,955
I've tried to help everybody
but instead ...

583
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:14,346
I ruined everything.

584
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:16,905
I'm just a piece of waste.

585
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:20,378
So, I myself discarded.

586
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:24,372
Along with all these stupid inventions.

587
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:28,877
This is shit ...

588
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,986
and it is junk.

589
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:36,648
Listen son, if your boat ...

590
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:39,131
if not now ...

591
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:42,049
you know.
- I understand.

592
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,806
Mama had no right.

593
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:47,792
I'm not an inventor.

594
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,779
I had to take time
you said that.

595
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:00,393
Well ...

596
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:04,513
when it rains, do one coat.

597
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:09,134
Papa, I do not understand vismetaforen.

598
00:54:27,328 --> 00:54:30,970
Come on, Steve, we have
a team together.

599
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,899
Download Kill Code.

600
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,826
Redesign, fertilize ...

601
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,886
cutting, burning ...

602
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:49,478
wrought iron ...

603
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,962
Help me!
- Fifteen.

604
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,571
Yes!

605
00:54:57,704 --> 00:55:02,110
My car!
Now we will.

606
00:55:13,422 --> 00:55:16,108
I have dreamed of.

607
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:28,078
Hotdogs!

608
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,685
Everyone!

609
00:55:46,235 --> 00:55:49,242
I would say that I am sorry.

610
00:55:49,744 --> 00:55:52,150
Especially to you, Sam.

611
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:54,455
I have a plan.

612
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:57,593
This memory stick includes a Kill Code.

613
00:55:57,693 --> 00:56:01,313
Food that I will storm fly
the machine stop in the ...

614
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:03,046
and for ever cease.

615
00:56:03,146 --> 00:56:06,905
As you evacuate the island ...
- It's all his fault.

616
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,746
Get him!

617
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:12,437
Shake the car back and forth!

618
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:22,423
The mess we are in it,
is all our fault.

619
00:56:24,535 --> 00:56:26,613
Take my own son.

620
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:29,776
I'm just so mad at Flint
like you.

621
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:33,818
I will save him even at his face
if he comes out of the car.

622
00:56:34,206 --> 00:56:38,205
I know that the food has Flint Lockwood
made, but that was to order.

623
00:56:38,206 --> 00:56:41,569
And now we all
pay the price.

624
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,396
Thank you, Earl.

625
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:56,037
Sorry.
- It's okay.

626
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,869
Let us build a boat.

627
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,654
I go along with you.

628
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,962
You need someone who you
will navigate through this storm.

629
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,315
I can not just leave it.
- Sam, I am so sorry.

630
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:15,245
Do you kidding?
- I just thought ...

631
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:16,667
No!
- Good.

632
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:20,047
You need a co pilot.
- Are you a pilot?

633
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:22,670
Yes, and I am a physicist.

634
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:24,865
Really?
- No, that was a joke.

635
00:57:24,866 --> 00:57:26,700
I am also an actor.

636
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:30,921
Let's do it.
- I go along.

637
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:34,392
Brent, it is good.
- No.

638
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:39,813
It is not good. I've had since I
a baby on my fame tarred.

639
00:57:39,814 --> 00:57:42,291
But it is all just an illusion.

640
00:57:42,637 --> 00:57:46,905
Maybe I was upstairs from
who I really am.

641
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:49,774
We are already full, so ...

642
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,941
Yes, Flint.

643
00:58:07,224 --> 00:58:09,733
Good luck, kid.

644
00:58:19,722 --> 00:58:23,877
He is too far!
- Manny, press the wiper.

645
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:30,992
Flint, there accumulates a lot of gas
around on the machine.

646
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:37,522
It seems almost as if ...
- Inside a huge meatball.

647
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:46,793
Water is a top, and
a hurricane food comes out from under.

648
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:49,260
Why I wear a diaper.

649
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,054
Has anyone ordered pizza?

650
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:12,603
We are haunted by a pizza?
- Sends it eat?

651
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:14,853
That is impossible.
- The massive molecular structure ...

652
00:59:14,854 --> 00:59:16,414
mutating into super food.

653
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:19,580
Genetically designed to
the FLDSMDFR protection.

654
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:21,293
Pizza.

655
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:30,823
That was a close call. Can you imagine
Kill Code if we had lost?

656
00:59:38,136 --> 00:59:42,449
Dad, are you okay? Great.
I need your help, the world is at stake.

657
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,964
What do you need?

658
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:49,926
Go to my lab, the computer
and mail a file to my mobile.

659
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:58,052
Well.

660
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,371
Yeah, okay.

661
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:18,801
That does not look bad.

662
01:00:25,513 --> 01:00:28,558
This is the plan. Sam and I
go here in the meteorite ...

663
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:30,701
what to us now FLDSMDFR
should lead.

664
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,021
Manny, you and Steve continue to ship.
Pipe not around.

665
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:35,802
Once my father told me the Kill Code
emailed ...

666
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:39,437
destroy the machine and we meet
we meet at the western point of ...

667
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,945
How long before the world is destroyed?
- Approximately 20 minutes.

668
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:46,012
Just that.
- What about me? What should I do?

669
01:00:46,564 --> 01:00:50,846
You may be president of the backseat.

670
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:55,841
Car upside down, and go!

671
01:00:57,124 --> 01:01:02,568
Ladies first?
No? Well.

672
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:05,921
Wait for me!

673
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,853
Stay on course, then we
there right off.

674
01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:23,586
Where is Steve?

675
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:37,254
We are at a different place or landed.

676
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:40,756
But if we go that way, should
FLDSMDFR here that the air shaft are.

677
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,026
Brent, come away from that cake.
- What?

678
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:07,783
<i> Home, Flint. </ i>

679
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:18,298
That is hot.

680
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:26,308
<i> Flint, you get a call. </ i>

681
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:32,816
Dad on the screen
a file, Kill Code.

682
01:02:33,096 --> 01:02:35,807
Move it to the e-mail window.

683
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,723
Type my name and click
send.

684
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:44,226
Window?
- See that thing, a little piece of paper?

685
01:02:44,587 --> 01:02:46,363
Use it to drag the file.
- Drag?

686
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,205
Drag.
- Drag?

687
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:54,728
He does not drag!
- About the Office.

688
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:59,355
That worked for a yard.
- Of course not, you know what?

689
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:04,528
Hurry.

690
01:03:04,623 --> 01:03:08,602
Watch the sails.
We have almost no time.

691
01:03:13,634 --> 01:03:19,954
Hurry. What are you doing?
Keep it full, come on!

692
01:03:26,758 --> 01:03:29,404
Wait, I have an important announcement.

693
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,711
So long, suckers!

694
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:37,959
Bon voyage and bon appetit.

695
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:07,462
Food is released.

696
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,344
Your way I never lose again.

697
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,097
Good hold.

698
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:52,897
Anyone heading south!
We need the storm ahead.

699
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:57,825
And now?
- Click send.

700
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,477
Flint, the FLDSMDFR is there.
- Papa, hurry!

701
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:04,380
Sending ...
Wait.

702
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,537
Papa?
Can you hear me?

703
01:05:22,157 --> 01:05:23,961
Go!

704
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,569
They are actually pretty cute.
And this is ...

705
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,522
They have eaten Brent.

706
01:05:40,347 --> 01:05:44,552
Dad, we are now surrounded by
men consuming chicken.

707
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:49,642
So if this is goodbye, thank you
I told the truth.

708
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:52,551
I am a bit late
found out I think.

709
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:18,196
Give back my phone!

710
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,489
Baby Brent?
- Baby I'm not Brent.

711
01:06:40,806 --> 01:06:47,487
I kippenman. And I do finally
a contribution to the community.

712
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:59,197
Go on, crazy child.
And save the world!

713
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:03,622
Brent Chicken You've done it, really.
- Go!

714
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:08,536
Right in this hole.

715
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:11,719
That's peanuts.

716
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:16,061
If even one of us touches the
we get an anaphylactic shock.

717
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:19,884
Actually I'm not allergic
for peanuts.

718
01:07:20,392 --> 01:07:22,214
I told you so just me
nice could find.

719
01:07:22,815 --> 01:07:26,147
So you really thought you
more attractive with allergies?

720
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:43,354
This is a great bagel!

721
01:07:46,176 --> 01:07:48,261
Would I allowed some extra mustard?

722
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,141
You are about to pulverized
to be a huge corn cob.

723
01:08:17,942 --> 01:08:20,354
It seems that the food storm
follows an unusual pattern ...

724
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:25,386
she hit the main points first, and
now spreads over the rest of the world.

725
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:30,361
What the ...
- Come on, guys.

726
01:08:31,127 --> 01:08:34,205
After my phone in the FLDSMDFR
I stopped and got destroyed ...

727
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:38,142
I pull the rope twice, and
then you pull me up again, right?

728
01:08:38,143 --> 01:08:39,643
Sounds good.

729
01:08:55,828 --> 01:09:00,452
You have your cut, or not?
- It's only a scratch.

730
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:05,170
Flint, Sam needs you to bring airplane
for an injection against allergies.

731
01:09:05,423 --> 01:09:07,875
Hold on.
- Let go.

732
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:09,358
Let go, Sam.

733
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:13,390
I will not let you go!
Then you sit down there.

734
01:09:14,349 --> 01:09:16,417
It is not ideal really.

735
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:18,928
Come with us, then
we start over again.

736
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:22,693
Then we live under the ground,
and we use bacon as clothes.

737
01:09:22,694 --> 01:09:27,092
Sam, it's not really a good plan.
- We will at least not lose.

738
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:30,705
Listen, I like you very much.

739
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:34,466
As friends?

740
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:39,359
No, if I like you ....

741
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:46,193
I miss you too.
But then you.

742
01:09:52,331 --> 01:09:54,734
Flint, no!

743
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:59,199
Hold on, Sam. Doctor Manny
has medicine for you.

744
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:28,375
We are way, hurry!
- Hold on, Sam.

745
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:30,829
I'm almost there.

746
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:33,910
What is that?

747
01:10:46,224 --> 01:10:47,594
Gummi Bears.

748
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:52,695
From below!

749
01:11:04,888 --> 01:11:06,849
Where are you?

750
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,659
She has touched a peanut,
or something.

751
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,805
Friend, the kitchen is closed.

752
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,628
Daddy, no!

753
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:27,468
When it rains ...

754
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:29,801
pull a coat.

755
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,467
Spray on Shoes.

756
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:55,375
Where is Flint?

757
01:13:58,974 --> 01:14:03,128
No!
- I know.

758
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:52,374
Where is Flint?

759
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:56,629
Sorry ...

760
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:16,523
Your son was a wonderful man.

761
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:01,973
Flint ...
- Papa.

762
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:10,695
If you ever broken your line ...

763
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:14,071
if it is not right ...

764
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,754
Come on!

765
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:23,433
I am proud of you, Flint.

766
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:26,959
I am amazed that
an ordinary person like me ...

767
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,056
the father may be, of someone so
particularly as you are.

768
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:36,507
You're talented, original
and your laboratory is breathtaking.

769
01:16:36,874 --> 01:16:40,586
Your mother always knew
you would be special ...

770
01:16:40,587 --> 01:16:44,771
and if she still lived
both of us she would say "I told you".

771
01:16:46,587 --> 01:16:53,386
If I afdoe this thing, and if I
vismetafoor a say ...

772
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:55,695
know that a fish metaphor
means ...

773
01:16:55,791 --> 01:17:00,039
I love my son.
- Love you, Dad.

774
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:13,318
So, where were we?

775
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,115
You just wanted me to kiss.
- Will you kiss me again?

776
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:18,691
Why do not you get it back?

777
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:22,782
I would not be rejected again.
- Just kiss me!

778
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:55,978
This was not really the intention.
