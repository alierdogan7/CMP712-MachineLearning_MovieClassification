00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,156
Breathe, breathe!

165
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,514
(Howls) Why?!

166
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,998
- Why? (Sobs)
- Why?

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,877
- You're under arrest.
- What?

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,390
- You dumb son of a bitch!
- No!

169
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,318
I'm a... I'm a peaceful man.

170
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,557
- I'm a schoolteacher!
- Shut up! You're a cop killer!

171
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,558
Cop killer? I love horses!

172
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,795
- I love horses.
- I love horses.

173
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,037
- I love Buttered Stuff.
- Buttercup! Say it!

174
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,277
- Butter nuts.
- Cup, cup, cup!

175
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,515
(Sirens wailing)

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,118
Why must you rage? Stop the hate, child.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,837
Bail is set at one million dollars
for the crime of killing an officer of the law.

178
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,556
And may God have mercy on your soul,
young man. This court is adjourned.

179
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,398
<i>(PA) Back to your cells. Lockdown.</i>

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,076
(Another inmate) Good night, fish.

181
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,113
(All) Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish...

182
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,196
My weed's wearing off.

183
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,959
Fish! Fish! Fish!

184
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,109
(Snoring)

185
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,675
- <i>Guess who!</i>
- Yo, Thurgood.

186
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,790
Oh, ho-ho!

187
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,796
- Hey, nigger, what time is it?
- 8.30.

188
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,592
Kenny didn't come home last night.

189
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,835
- We are worried, man.
- Worried, yo.

190
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,552
Where the hell is he?

191
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,790
Did he just move?

192
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,270
"Kenny called. He's in jail.
He didn't leave a number.

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,118
"Sincerely, The Guy on the Couch."

194
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,278
Come on, guys.
We gotta get Kenny out of jail, man.

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,549
Hey, Kenny, how they treating you?

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,673
Let's just say I'm not gettin'
the respect a cop killer deserves.

197
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,438
All right, time's up. Break off.

198
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,710
I was up all night...

199
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,876
getting harassed!

200
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,435
- Hi, there, fish.
- See what I mean?

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,996
I think they're mistaking my kindness
for weakness. I'm scared!

202
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,593
Hey, Kenny,
we're gonna get you out of there, man.

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,236
All we gotta do is raise ten per cent
of one million, which, by our calculations...

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,874
Is fucking impossible, man!

205
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,831
Hey!

206
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,189
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,438
All my life, I did everything right.
I never screwed up.

208
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,678
I fed the horse.
I didn't know it was a diabetic.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,438
I'm scared!

210
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,631
Kenny, stop crying.
Stop crying, Kenny! Look at me.

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,276
Don't let 'em see you cry in there.

212
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,311
- Show me your mean face.
- No.

213
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,430
Yes, show me your mean face!

214
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,158
(Sniggers)

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,716
That's good.
I mean, work on it a little bit, but it's good.

216
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,518
- Kenny, how long can you make it in there?
- I don't know.

217
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,790
Maybe five...

218
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,829
6.30.

219
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,279
Man, it's gotta be a little longer than that.

220
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,634
But... but we'll get you out, right, guys?

221
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,070
- Yeah, you're out. You're outta here.
- Free as a bird.

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,351
<i>Number nine, time's up.</i>

223
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,755
- <i>Time's up, number nine.</i>
- That's me.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,956
I love you guys.

225
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,477
Have fun, Ken.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,633
- He looked all right, man.
- They're gonna kill him in there, yo.

227
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,439
Hey, lady.

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,232
Miss, is this your purse?

229
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,510
- Yes.
- I'm sexy.

230
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,716
I'm a scholar. People like me.

231
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,237
Give it to me. Bye.

232
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,317
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

233
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,715
Well, can I leave with ya?

234
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,354
Follow me.

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,037
- And your name is?
- Mary Jane.

236
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,672
Really?

237
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,188
Yes. So what's up with this?

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,550
- Is that your work uniform?
- Nah, this is my costume.

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,910
Tomorrow I'll be a cowboy,
the day after that I'll be an Indian.

240
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,353
Every day of the week, I dress up like a
different Village Person. It's a thing I'm into.

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,550
No, I'm a custodian.

242
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,591
So, what are you here for?

243
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,598
- Possession of narcotics.
- Wow.

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,837
- My father's a drug dealer.
- That must've been the shit.

245
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,919
- It ruined his life.
- That must've been shitty.

246
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,554
I don't do drugs. Drugs make me sick.

247
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,797
They're bad for your body.
Up with hope, down with dope!

248
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,479
Thurgood, come on, man. We gotta go.

249
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,478
Get on the train.
Toke up before we go to work.

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,188
- Yo, let's go.
- What are you doing, man?

251
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,789
Bouncy. Body. Is that Prell?
Do you use Prell?

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,877
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!

253
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,718
Hey, guys, meet Mary Jane.

254
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,035
That's what he's sayin'.
We wanna burn one.

255
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,911
No, no.

256
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,951
This is Mary Jane.

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,992
Meet her. Say hello to her.
Shake her hand, even.

258
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,873
- Oh, dear, my fault. What's up?
- Hi.

259
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,753
- All right.
- Hey.

260
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,793
Do you guys need a ride? I have a car.
You don't have to take the subway.

261
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,194
- You smoke?
- No, my grandmother died of lung cancer.

262
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,119
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- All the more reason to toke up, man.

263
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,436
Ease the pain.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

264
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,190
You know, I think what they're really trying
to say is that we'd love a ride home.

265
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,276
Great.

266
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,436
- What's wrong?
- She look good!

267
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,951
- Mary Jane! What is that about, man?
- I hate y'all.

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,592
Shotgun!

269
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,074
- Thanks for this ride. We appreciate it.
- Sure.

270
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,073
Guys, shut up about the weed.
I don't want this girl to know I smoke.

271
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,795
- Yeah, it's bad enough you're a janitor, yo.
- Custodian, dick!

272
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,551
(Bleeping)

273
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,948
# <i>It's the riddle of Rio</i>

275
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,753

<i>good looks and skills</i>

276
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,553

277

278

<i>so I can justify the reason</i>

279

280
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,912
- Is this good for you?
- Could you drop me in the lobby? Perfect.

281
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,909
<i>She wanted me to say something. I had to</i>
<i>make my move while the guys were asleep.</i>

282
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,112
I'm real bad at this, but you think
sometime we could get together,

283
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,879
maybe go out for some ice cream
or something?

284
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,512
Aggghhh-eee!

285
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,394
- Motherfucker said, "Ice cream"!
- Ice cream!

286
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,635
- Damn.
- OK.

287
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,912
- All the boys in the car need to get out.
- Such a dork, man.

288
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,030
Thanks a lot, fellas.

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,150
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thurgood!

290
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,555
- I knew it.
- You forgot your hat.

291
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,230
I knew it.

292
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,831
You know, I mighta came on too strong
with the whole ice cream thing.

293
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,077
- Let me give you my number. Is that cool?
- OK.

294
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,399
Don't call too late cos you know
I be strippin' in the evenings! Joking!

295
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,311
- Here you go. You can call me any time.
- Maybe.

296
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,673
"Maybe" is acceptable. It's that "no" thing
that gets me. Maybe I'll hear from you.

297
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,711
- Bye.
- Be thinking about you.

298
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,151
<i>Dr Koplesky,</i>
<i>please report to Clinical Studies.</i>

299
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,350
- <i>Dr Koplesky...</i>
- Janitor?

300
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,630
- <i>...clinical studies.</i>
- Uh, Janitor?

301
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,272
Ahhh!

302
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,915
- Sorry about that. What is it, scientist?
- Could you...

303
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,428
I know this isn't your responsibility,

304
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,995
but would you run this down
to the supply department for me?

305
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,349
- Second floor.
- Just run this down?

306
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,554
Yes. But make sure you bring the order
right back to me. I need it ASAP.

307
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,311
Gotcha. I know this isn't your responsibility,
but mop this shit up. I'll be right back.

308
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,069
(Sniffs) It smell like... It smell like...

309
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,238
No... (Sniffs) No... (Laughs)

310
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,271
I smell weed, man.

311
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,311
Hey, here you go.

312
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,396
(Sniffing)

313
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,512
- This all you need?
- I guess. I don't know.

314
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,635
- Just a sec.
- OK.

315
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,159
Damn.

316
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,316
Either someone's having a party
or somebody gotta do their shirt laundry.

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,233
Here you go. One pound of marijuana
and you can sign for it right here.

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,479
(Choking)

319
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,354
I sign for this and it's mine? And I take it?

320
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,757
Oh, yeah!

321
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,314
Thank you. Thank you very much.

322
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,995
Some good shit.

323
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

324
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,391
Look, here's...

325
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,989
Here's a... little something for your troubles.

326
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,789
- Thank you, thank you.
- Shhh.

327
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,549
- Let's not tell anyone about it, OK?
- Sure.

328
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,313
Why didn't you tell me you were into this?
We coulda been hanging out.

329
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,717
No, no, the Food and Drug Administration
are having us do a study

330
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,630
to determine what, if any,
are the medicinal purposes of marijuana.

331
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,830
Mmm. Wow.

332
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,519
If you ever need a guinea pig, let me know.

333
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,074
My grandpa
was in the Tuskegee experiments.

334
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,634
Oh, really?

335
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,319
Anyway, thank you, janitor. Enjoy.

336
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,238
Thank you, scientist. Got any papers?

338
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,591
Hey, fellas, what's going on?

339
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,357
- Nothing, man.
- Bummin', thinking about Kenny.

340
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,391
Yeah.

341
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,398
I got some weed at work today
if y'all wanna try it out.

342
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,908
Nah, we don't feel like smokin' right now.

343
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,951
Me neither.

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,356
- Me neither.
- <i>(TV) It belongs to the nicotine family</i>

345
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,595

<i>Well, here's a chap</i>
<i>contemplating a purchase...</i>

347
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,151
- So y'all want to smoke?
- I'll get Billy Bong Thornton.

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,638
No, Scarface. No Billy Bong Thornton
without Kenny. That would not be right.

349
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,956
Use Wesley Pipes. Yeah!

350
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,791
They got a bunch of this stuff at work.
One of them scientists gave it to me.

351
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,951
Ain't tried the shit out yet,
but it smells like the bomb.

352
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,436
- All right!
- Yeah, man, yeah.

353
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,472
- I'll do the honours.
- Please do.

354
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,709
Yo, this shit must be good, B. My man ain't
coughed like that since back in the day.

355
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,431
You sure I should do this, man?

356
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,158
Oh, yeah. That shit made my head hot.

357
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,031
Oh, man.

358
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,513
Pass it this way. Don't break the cipher.

359
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,553
Hold it. I gotta give the Guy some of this.
The Guy gotta taste this.

360
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,674
Hey, Guy. Hey, man.

361
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,479
Sorry to wake you, but you gotta try this.

362
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,991
(Cursory cough)

363
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,836
I'm taking it slow, man.

364
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,231
Hey, who's on munchies tonight?

365
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,158
We should make that lazy bitch,
the Guy, go.

366
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,113
For real. I don't know about y'all,
but I can't even move.

367
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,752
For real, B, right?

368
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,955
It's like I feel stuck here, yo.

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,797
Like I'm glued to the floor.

370
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,352
(# Tchaikovsky: Dance
of the Sugar Plum Fairy)

371
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,111
You guys feel like you're floating?

372
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

373
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,632
- Wanna go outside?
- Yeah.

374

375
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,916
Look at that!

376
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,669
Hey, you guys,
let's go check in on Kenny, huh?

377
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,872
(Kenny) You're not a fish, you're a man.

378
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,550
You're not a fish, you're a man.

379

(Sobs)

380
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,838
Where did that come from?

381
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,069
We really gotta get this guy outta jail.

382
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,390
You walk around on both legs,
homo erectus!

383
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,916
Did I say "homo"? I didn't mean that!

384
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,757
Thurgood! Thurgood!

385
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,512
I got it! I know how we could get Kenny out!

386
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,156
- How?
- Weed, man. We'll sell weed.

387
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,194
Man, you can't up and decide to sell weed.
You gotta know people to plug you into that.

388
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,071
- I do!
- Who?

389
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,157
- You, yo.
- Me?

390
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,716
You think I can just walk in and take this
shit? I gotta get a form from a scientist.

391
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,356
Well, how hard can it be, man?
There's gotta be forms laying around.

392
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,472
I mean, they are scientists.

393
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,239
What the fuck are you talkin' about, man?

394
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,035
Look, I'm not stealing weed.
We are not selling weed.

395
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,676
- We are reasonably bright young men.
- Bully, man.

396
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,271
There has got to be a legitimate way
to come up with this money.

397
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,039
We just gotta think, that's all that is.

398
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,272
Wait, wait, I think I got an idea.

399
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,039
Why don't we sell that shit
we smoked the other night, yo?

400
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,072
- You suggested that already.
- For real, B?

401
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,033
- (Number unavailable tone)
- <i>Marijuana affects the memory.</i>

402
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,275
It won't take us hardly any time, B.

403
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,238
- Too risky, man.
- Stop being such a wuss, yo!

404
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,999
- What other choice do we have, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,597
OK, fine, we'll do it.

406
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,792
- Yeah.
- We'll do it till Kenny's out and we're done.

407
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,196
We're not drug dealers, we're fundraisers.

408
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,150
- Of course, B.
- Bully, man.

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,191
OK.

410
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,835
Scarface, lay it on me, brother.

411
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,868
Check it out, yo. It's like this...

412
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,115
<i>Scarface's plan wasn't that bad.</i>

413
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,311
- Good night, Mike.
- See you tomorrow.

414
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,351
Good night...

415
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,348
<i>All I had to do was get forms from</i>
<i>that scientist that kept calling me janitor,</i>

416
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,439
- <i>forge one and put the order in like before.</i>
- Thank you.

417
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,838
<i>Then we scraped together our money and</i>
<i>bought bikes to help us move the product</i>

418
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,271
<i>and then stapled samples of our weed</i>
<i>on the back of our business cards.</i>

419
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,996
<i>We called the company Mr Nice Guy</i>
<i>in honour of our friend Kenny.</i>

420
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,999
Hey, you guys believe in angels or...

421
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,998
Man, give me your fruit cocktail.

422
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,996
Well, I can't.

423
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,875
If I did that, then I'd have to give it to you
every day and I won't get all my vitamins.

424
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,390
- Do you know who you're dealing with?
- Chill, Nasty Nate.

425
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,197
He's my bitch. Anybody gonna stab him, it's
gonna be me. You got a problem with that?

426
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,388
Watch your back, fish. Squirrel Master
won't be there for you all the time.

427
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,513
Cos next time I come for you,
I'm gonna want some cocktail, fruit!

428
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,157
Take it.

429
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,988
I'm somebody's bitch.

430
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,191
You gotta do something. This guy,
Nasty Nate, is after my cocktail fruit.

431
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,314
Everyone here likes fresh fish, then the
Squirrel Master told me I'm his bitch and...

432
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,069
- Help!
- Ken, listen, man. We got a plan.

433
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,830
- What is it?
- It's not honest. You might not like it.

434
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,509
- We gonna sell weed, yo.
- Yeah, great, weed, good, go.

435
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,949
- All right, man.
- Go!

436
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,548
No more window love. Go and sell it.

I gave you a ride home from prison?

I get so many rides home from prison.

I didn't think you were gonna call me.

I wasn't, but then I decided
I don't care what my friends think.

See, that was a joke. Get it? A little joke.

So, you wanna get together?

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,153
How about right now?
Meet me at the place you dropped us off at.

- You guys are greedy.

Marijuana is terrible. It's a gateway drug.
Everybody knows it leads to other stuff.

They probably roughed the Guy up, then
started going to war with the apartment.

You want to hear what I think, man?

835
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,108
First of all, to understand
what happened to Killer,

836
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,119
you gotta understand
who Killer the dog was.

837
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,755

<i>to a three-legged bitch of a mother.</i>

838
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,439
<i>He was always ashamed of this, man.</i>

839
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,156
And right after that,
he's adopted by this man, Tito Liebowitz.

840
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,955
<i>He's a small-time gunrunner</i>
<i>and Rottweiler fight promoter.</i>

They see Killer's good. He is damn good.

842
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,548
But then he had the fight of his life.

843
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,876
They pit him against his brother, Nibbles.

844
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,392
Killer said, "No, that's my brother. I can't
fight Nibbles!" He made 'em fight anyway.

845
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,069
<i>And then Killer, he killed Nibbles.</i>

846
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,793
<i>And Killer said, "That's it."</i>

847
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:22,233
<i>He called off all his fights and he started</i>
<i>doing crack and he freaked out.</i>

848
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,748
And then, in a rage...

849
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,711
he collapsed

some cocaine?
