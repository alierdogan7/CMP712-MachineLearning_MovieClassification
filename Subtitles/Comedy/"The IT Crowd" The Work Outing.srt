2
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:39,398
I've just won four hundred
and fifty grand playing poker!

3
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,018
Well done!

4
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,680
I saw that one coming, Mickey73!

5
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:47,014
That's my rent sorted this month!
And I can buy that new...

6
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,004
Oh, no, I've lost it all again...

7
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,007
Philip! Hello, hi.

8
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,306
This is Philip, from sixth.

9
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,150
This is Moss, this is... Roy.

10
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,020
- Hi.
- Hiya.

11
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,514
So, what brings you to my lair?

12
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:08,602
Not that I'm some sort of animal!

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,645
Or... maybe I am...

14
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,570
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

15
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,643
I was just...

16
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,906
wondering if you had...

17
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,208
the latest <i>Heat</i>?

18
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:24,655
Yes, yes. There it is.

19
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,188
Thanks.

20
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,637
Sorry about this.
I don't suppose, maybe...

21
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:33,431
you'd like to come to theatre
tomorrow night, maybe, or...

22
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:35,244
I'd be delighted!

23
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,982
- He means me, Moss.
- He was looking at me.

24
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,279
No, he wasn't.

25
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,576
I think he was!

26
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,555
You're not even in his eye line!

27
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,048
Philip, who were you talking to?
Me or Jen?

28
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,640
- Do you like the theatre?
- Never been!

29
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,834
But I've always liked the idea
of the theatre.

30
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:58,489
The smell of the grease,

31
00:01:58,631 --> 00:01:59,891
the roar of the paint!

32
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:03,495
I've often thought
if I hadn't ended up in computers,

33
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:05,119
I would've gone into the theatre.

34
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,157
But you've never been to see a play?

35
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:08,649
- No.
- Why not?

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,590
Never had the interest.

37
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:13,802
Are there any famous people in it?

38
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,167
It's a pass for me then, thank you.

39
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,925
- You haven't been invited anyways.
- Wait...

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,302
Laura Nightly's in it.

41
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:23,720
Laura Nightly from The Build?

42
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:25,835
She's gorgeous!

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,429
You know what?
I will come, Philip. Thank you!

44
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,570
There's no invitation!
Show me the invitation...

45
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,853
I guess you guys could come too
if you wanted.

46
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,184
I know people in the show,
tickets won't be a problem.

47
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:37,605
Great! That's settled then.

48
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,784
Great! I will give you a call

49
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,739
and then give you the details.
How's that?

50
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,575
That is perfect in itself, Philip!

51
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,339
Thanks for coming down, man!

52
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:46,772
Catch you later!

53
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,404
That could have been a date, there...

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,460
Now, it's...

55
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,534
a work outing!

56
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,736
Sorry! I forgot the <i>Heat</i>!

57
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,648
It's... it's...

58
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,722
What?

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,269
He actually did want
to borrow the copy of <i>Heat.</i>

60
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,080
- So?
- Well, it's just... you know...

61
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,524
- No, I don't. What?
- I'm just surprised.

62
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:25,326
Why?

63
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,069
It's just I don't know
many heterosexual men who read <i>Heat.</i>

64
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,729
What? He's gay

65
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,161
just because he reads <i>Heat</i> magazine?

66
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,208
Well, he's either gay
or a woman in her early twenties.

67
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:45,364
Why else would he ask me out on a date?

68
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,232
Are you sure he meant it
as a date "date"?

69
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:51,229
Are you sure you're not going along
as his gal pal?

70
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,750
If you're talking about
who I think you're talking about,

71
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,752
then the answer is yes, he is gay.

72
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,383
How do you know?

73
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,729
Everyone knows. And once more,

74
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,707
he's been gay, since Wham.

75
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:09,882
We were talking about Philip!

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,785
He borrowed <i>Heat.</i>

77
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,302
He borrowed <i>Heat</i>?

78
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,210
And he knows people in the theatre.

79
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:21,834
That's not a euphemism. He actually
does know people in the theatre.

80
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,605
Anyway, it's a date. I'm sure it is.

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,423
Why else would he ask me out?

82
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,168
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but...

83
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:31,109
could he have thought you were a man?

84
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:37,143
- Let's get a taxi.
- It's a ten minute walk.

85
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,733
No. I don't like walking.

86
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,533
Why do you just not come,
then you wouldn't have to walk anywhere?

87
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,182
I won't spoil your romantic evening
with the gay man.

88
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,488
He's not a gay man!

89
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:46,930
He reads <i>Heat</i>!

90
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,524
Hey, where are you lot off to?

91
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,315
Look! Richmond's still alive!

92
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:55,047
We're going to the theatre.
Do you wanna come?

93
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,676
No, thanks. And you shouldn't go either.

94
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:58,629
Why not?

95
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:01,044
A new wind is blowing!

96
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:06,797
Last night, I was stood from my slumber
by a crow calling three times.

97
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,759
Well, you know what a crow sounds like.

98
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,445
Passing to my window,

99
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,157
I trod on a piece of Lego.

100
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,010
Oh, it went right in the heel!

101
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,916
Turning on my television set,

102
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,716
I noticed the reception wasn't great.

103
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,534
Not terrible, just not great.

104
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,692
Hear me well!

105
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,122
No good can come of your trip
to the theatre tonight!

106
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,604
No good at all!

107
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,919
And if you ask me...

108
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,774
That's just bloody rude!

109
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,585
Where is my <i>Heat</i>?

110
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:52,616
A gay musical,

111
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,292
called "Gay".

112
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,028
That's quite gay...

113
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,303
Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay?

114
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,453
This must be like the gayest musical
ever made!

115
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:07,126
It's got some pretty good reviews!

116
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,399
"The story of a young man
trying to find his sexuality

117
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,378
"in the uncaring Thatcher years.

118
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,414
"Warning. Includes scenes
of graphic homo eroticism."

119
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,509
It's set in the 80's!

120
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,461
Graphic homo eroticism?

121
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:31,121
Are they gonna get them out?

122
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,029
You're not comfortable
with your sexuality?

123
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,668
I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

124
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,511
I don't wanna be slapped in the face
with their sexuality.

125
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,543
Look! There is Philip!

126
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,829
Look! He's leching at that lady!

127
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,187
Thank God for that!

128
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,446
He's just an ordinary ignored man!

129
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,027
Hey! You're already here!

130
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,185
What are we doing, Roy? This isn't us.

131
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,550
It takes place in the past!

132
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:56,821
Forget the play.

133
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,558
Philip knows the cast!

134
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,697
It's all about the backstage party
afterwards.

135
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,020
Those things are great.

136
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,936
You go to them telling
they were brilliant

137
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,463
and it's free wine all night.

138
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,404
Besides, I really wanna meet
Laura Nightly.

139
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,690
Hey there, guys!

140
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,043
It's great, isn't it?

141
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:15,389
Great. We should really pick up
our tickets.

142
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,724
I know someone who gets the tickle!

143
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,583
Sorry, I love doing that to him!

144
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:30,813
This is Jerome.
He does publicity for the show.

145
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,137
He got us our tickets.

146
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,284
Great, thanks.

147
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,331
This is Jen, and Moss and Roy.

148
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:37,607
How is it going?

149
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,125
My God, you're Irish!

150
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:40,430
I love Irish people!

151
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,909
They're just mad, aren't they?
They're just mad!

152
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,089
We're all insane, yeah.

153
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:46,959
You'll love this!

154
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,618
It's great crack!

155
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm mad for crack!

156
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:55,748
Quick everyone!
The show's about to start!

157
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,899
I hope Laura Nightly isn't gonna be
dressed up like toyer or something.

158
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,802
- Who is she in <i>The Build</i> again?
- She plays that heroin addict

159
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,598
- who gets stabbed in the face?
- She is lovely.

160
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:15,939
Isn't she lovely?

161
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:17,951
Oh God, here we go.

162
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,681
It might be right.

163
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,792
How bad can it be?

164
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,111
Welcome...

165
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,659
to the United...

166
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:36,913
Queendom!

167
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,190
Brilliant!

168
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,472
United Queendom!

169
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:45,713
He can't say that, can he?

170
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,395
Check that asses!

171
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:10,019
<i>I'm a friend of Dorothy!</i>

172
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:11,714
<i>I'm a friend of Dorothy!</i>

173
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:14,422
<i>She is my friend!</i>

174
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,557
This is insanely brilliant!

175
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,553
<i>Hold my hand.</i>

176
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:27,786
<i>No,</i>

177
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,950
<i>that's not my hand!</i>

178
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,437
<i>I love willies!</i>

179
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,863
Okay, I'm completely satisfied!

180
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:43,928
Don't leave! It's rude!

181
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:46,575
It's too gay for me. I thought
I could handle it, but I can't.

182
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,118
There'll be the interval soon.

183
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,603
I'm captivated, Roy.

184
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,407
Calm down.
At least, it can't get any worse.

185
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:56,520
All right, get them houselights up

186
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,203
and let's have a look at you!

187
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,604
Are you wearing that shirt for a bet?

188
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,827
Audience participation! Go, go!

189
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,711
What have we...

190
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,847
- here!
- Hello!

191
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,612
Tell me! Who wears the trousers
in this relationship?

192
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,488
What? Oh, no.

193
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,173
We're not homosexuals.

194
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,823
We're just very good friends.

195
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,287
So, you never had a look?

196
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,084
- At what?
- His bob!

197
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,840
I've seen it,

198
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,883
when he thrusts it in front of my desk,

199
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,698
or, should he bend over
to pick something up.

200
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,631
I'd love to work in that office...

201
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,303
There's nothing sexual going on.

202
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:40,374
I do like Roy, but I'm not "curious".

203
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,104
What were you engaging him for?

204
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,935
He was asking me questions,
I couldn't just ignore him.

205
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,277
It's a bit rude, Roy.

206
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,980
So what do you think of it?

207
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,674
I think it's fabulous.

208
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,950
Every value I've ever held
is being questioned,

209
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,415
and I'm loving it.

210
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,123
You don't like it, do you?

211
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,711
The songs are good.

212
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,599
No, they're not!

213
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,205
Hum one of the songs.

214
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:08,236
Willies, willies! I like willies!

215
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,578
It's "I love willies".

216
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:12,093
- I love willies!
- Sir, could you keep it down?

217
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,840
- I'm not going back in there!
- Oh yes, you are!

218
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,411
No. I'll wait out here for you,

219
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:21,426
but there's no way
I'm going anywhere near that thing.

220
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:24,585
You can't leave me alone in there.
I don't know what the hell is going on!

221
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,677
He's laughing like an idiot
at every single gay reference!

222
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,944
- Why didn't he come off for a drink?
- He doesn't wanna miss anything!

223
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,332
I need to wee wee.

224
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,088
Yeah, me too.

225
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,078
- What's wrong?
- They've got a toilet guy.

226
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,478
I hate toilet guys!

227
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,005
Let's just get over with.

228
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,672
Thank you.

229
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:26,260
Cheers, dude.

230
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,120
- Did you go?
- No. Did you?

231
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,695
No! How could I?

232
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,707
Block stood looking at us!

233
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,265
What was that?
It's not my fault he works in a toilet!

234
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,083
- How much did you give him?
- A pound.

235
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,783
I just paid a pound
not to go to the toilet.

236
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:43,854
He's a terrible toilet guy!

237
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,523
He should work where people
don't want to go to the toilet.

238
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,812
I'll use the disabled.

239
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,935
- You can't use the disabled!
- What? Why not?

240
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,034
You're not disabled!
You'll get in trouble!

241
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:55,175
It's not like a parking space, Moss.

242
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,751
I think. I think it's okay, isn't it?

243
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,816
It's okay.
I'm always using the disabled.

244
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,534
It's illegal!

245
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:04,316
I don't think so.

246
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,427
You all right in there?

247
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,470
Do you need help?

248
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,670
I'm disabled!

249
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,406
He sounds disoriented.

250
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:45,800
Move back

251
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,353
- from the door!
- What? No!

252
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,023
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic!

253
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,742
What... What's happening?

254
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,595
Someone's had an accident.

255
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,286
Well, you'd better keep going then.

256
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:12,911
My God, what happened?

257
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,870
I fell off the toilet.

258
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,008
Well, come on. Let's get you upright.

259
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:20,824
Thank you.

260
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,174
So, what happened?

261
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,474
- I'm disabled.
- How?

262
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:30,758
How what?

263
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,611
How are you disabled?

264
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,329
Leg disabled.

265
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,567
Wait, where's your...
Do you have a wheelchair?

266
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,133
Where?

267
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:45,397
Stolen!

268
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,344
But how did they get in?

269
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,221
I don't know!

270
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,515
All right. It's gonna be okay.

271
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,521
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

272
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:57,833
Come on. Give me a hand.
There you go.

273
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,925
There you go, there you go, mate.

274
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:01,817
All right, you're all right.

275
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,493
- Easy, mate.
- Hold him tight that way.

276
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,545
Easy.

277
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,821
All right. Bring him carefully!

278
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,978
Excuse me! This is a staff toilet!

279
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,248
I'm staff!

280
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:39,656
I really am feeling much better.

281
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:41,998
You can all go, now.

282
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,177
We're not going anywhere
until we've got you sorted out.

283
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,396
Here's Paul with the wheelchair.

284
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,254
All right. What?

285
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:56,019
I keep one in the office
for emergencies. Let's get you up!

286
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:58,791
Nice and carefully now.
That's it, there we go.

287
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,068
There we are, there.

288
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:05,962
Oh, the police!

289
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,798
Is everything all right?

290
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:09,074
I'm disabled!

291
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:14,438
- So, someone stole you...
- My wheelchair.

292
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,832
I'm disabled.

293
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,190
Some lazy bastard just waltzed in there.

294
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,444
Can you describe him?

295
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:24,201
- It was all over so quick!
- Just tell me just what you can.

296
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,078
Caucasian male...

297
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:30,239
Bearded.

298
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,354
Red hair...

299
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,523
Glasses.

300
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,051
Possibly disguised, I...

301
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:39,600
All right, thank you.

302
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,694
Do you need any help getting home?

303
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,173
No, I'm fine, I'm with people.

304
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,037
Here they are, now!

305
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,326
Hey, fellas!

306
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,223
- No, I'll take it from here.
- Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

307
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:54,397
Okay...

308
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,482
Are you slacking off in there?

309
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:02,940
Go and get changed!

310
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:08,482
Excuse me, sir. Can I have a word?

311
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,154
Amazing! Super powerful!

312
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,481
Thanks.

313
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,947
That...

314
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,895
The grit of it!

315
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:18,327
Five stars!

316
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:20,892
So what did you think?

317
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,850
- Of the musical?
- Did you not just love it?

318
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:25,068
Well, no,

319
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,005
- sorry.
- Why not?

320
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,382
I don't know, just...

321
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:30,670
Maybe, you have to be...

322
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,331
gay.

323
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,404
I loved it!

324
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:37,687
I guess it's more of a gay thing.

325
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,868
You know, you have to be gay.

326
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:42,941
A gay man.

327
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,131
A homosexual.

328
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:48,344
But all I know is I loved
every last second of it.

329
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:49,689
And I'm not...

330
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:51,849
usually a fan of musicals.

331
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,696
Do you want to meet the cast?

332
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,037
Come on!

333
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,794
The thing is I have to meet
Moss and Roy.

334
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:23,534
Listen, I told the cast
about what happened,

335
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,075
and they told me to get you all
to come back and meet them!

336
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,575
Come on everybody! Off the van!

337
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:40,067
Hey, James!

338
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:41,906
Wow, Edgar!

339
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:42,946
Hi!

340
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,114
Brilliant!

341
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:47,814
Jeremy!

342
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,178
How do you know all these... young...

343
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,888
good looking men?

344
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,617
You know, just from my route.

345
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,222
Hey, Jerome!

346
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,542
Come here, you!

347
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,067
Great show.

348
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,903
Hello, darling!

349
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,630
Listen, I can't talk at the moment.

350
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:05,045
The disabled are coming for a chat.
Here they are now.

351
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,192
He's had quite an evening.

352
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:25,745
Someone stole his wheelchair.

353
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:28,783
Really?

354
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:32,221
Did you see who it was?

355
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:34,633
Red bearded man.

356
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,888
How long have you been disabled?

357
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,947
- Ten years.
- Ten years!

358
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:46,099
And how did it happen,
if that's not a rude question?

359
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:50,649
Acid.

360
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,335
What are the chances
of that happening?

361
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,636
A hundred to one.

362
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,535
- You're like you could do with a drink.
- Whisky.

363
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,356
Please. Double.

364
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:05,377
- Excuse me?
- Yes, miss?

365
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,641
Can I have a double whisky, please?

366
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:19,947
Double whisky.

367
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,508
And a glass of white wine.

368
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,813
A glass of white wine.

369
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:25,833
You're very welcome, madam.

370
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,299
- Hello, Laura Nightly.
- How are you?

371
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,187
I'm disabled!

372
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:46,297
It must be so difficult
being gay and disabled.

373
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,954
Very difficult.

374
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,027
Come here, my little soldier.

375
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,787
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

376
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,072
- You're from telly!
- I am.

377
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:07,524
And you know, a little birdy told me
that you couldn't make the show tonight.

378
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:09,910
So, I've got you two tickets
for tomorrow.

379
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,040
Brilliant!

380
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,445
- You're doing so well!
- Yeah.

381
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,306
- High five!
- High five!

382
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,760
A couple of photos?

383
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,627
Is he from a newspaper?

384
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,296
- Yes, he's from <i>The Standard</i>.
- Oh, God!

385
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:31,591
What... What's...

386
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,573
I get it!

387
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:36,259
Very funny, you Irish!

388
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,573
I'm a bit tired!
Can I have a wheelchair too?

389
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:41,712
Hilarious!

390
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:44,427
Me legs don't work!

391
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,597
Help, pal! I need a wheelchair!

392
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,824
Come on, get out! Come on!

393
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:51,199
Stop buzzing around, all right, Gary?

394
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,878
Well, I guess this is good night.

395
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,179
For God sake, are you gay?
Are you a gay man?

396
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:20,759
- Are you?
- No!

397
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,354
So brilliant, dude! That's...

398
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,542
'Cause that's all I wanted to know.
I don't mind,

399
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,730
one way or another, you know.
it's just I like...

400
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,548
being clear. I don't want any...

401
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,296
ambiguity.

402
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:32,434
What on earth made you think I was gay?

403
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:35,636
Well, you know... I didn't just...

404
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:37,288
pull it out of the air.

405
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,809
You know, you just brought me
to a gay musical called "Gay",

406
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,106
You've been laughing like mad
at every...

407
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,253
at every gay reference. Your friends,

408
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,704
more of whom are gay,

409
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,875
say hello by tickling you!

410
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,502
In what century are you living in?
Do you think

411
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:56,325
that a man has to be gay
to like a gay musical?

412
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:59,153
Can a straight man
not have homosexual friends?

413
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,276
And since when was tickling gay?

414
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:04,200
I missed that meaning, Jen!

415
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,899
- Come here.
- I'm sorry, I guess

416
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,043
you astray me when you borrowed
that copy of <i>Heat</i>.

417
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:11,840
Oh God, it's true,

418
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:13,433
it's true, I'm gay!

419
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,445
I'm a gay man!
I tried to run from it tonight

420
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:18,666
but I can't, I can't!

421
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:21,595
Jen, what am I gonna do?

422
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,708
I thought
I could make it work between us,

423
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:28,322
because you looked a bit like a man!

424
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:39,431
Taxi!

425
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:01,914
Hello, there.

426
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,211
I didn't see you on the way out.

427
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,939
All right, lads!
Let's get a sing song coming!

428
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,051
It's a long way back to Manchester!

429
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,318
- 'Night, Steve.
- 'Night, Moss.

430
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,970
- 'Night Melly, you be good!
- Mind if I can't help it.

431
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:33,937
Ah, the theatre....
