I didn't hear you as I am distracted
by this mouth-watering chicken breast.

487
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,665
If you got a gambling problem,
if you're a degenerate...

488
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,505
...I wouldn't come down here
because gambling is a cancer.

489
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,504
Cut! Please just follow
the script, Razor.

490
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,786
It's not that.

491
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,501
The pictures make this look glamorous
but it could be a problem for people...

492
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,469
...and I'm saying
it should be known.

493
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,464
What is this, improv night at Chuckles?
Come on, say the words.

494
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,146
Well, maybe I just happened
to hit a sore spot, huh?

495
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,144
Didn't you lose 200 grand
betting the Buffalo Bills?

496
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,481
Who loses the Super
Bowl four times in a row?

497
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,647
I don't know. You.

498
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,710
- I thought they'd win once.
- Maybe you got a talent for losing.

499
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,340
- I got a talent for busting your...
DANTE: Hey, hey!

500
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,946
KID: You're getting personal.
RAZOR: I'm standing here.

501
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,023
<i>RAZOR: I'm gonna put that
shit right up your ass!</i>

502
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,467
Heh. No such thing as bad publicity.

503
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,271
<i>NEWSMAN [ON TV]: Those two ex-fighters
are making news again...</i>

504
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,701
<i>...and are trending on Twitter.
We'll have that...</i>

505
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,261
- What a lot of crap.
- What's the matter?

506
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,505
You gotta fight in 12 weeks, you're doing
stupid publicity stunts. Who's training you?

507
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,862
Well, here's a hint:
Somebody I can trust.

508
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,188
Well, that's easy,
because you don't trust nobody.

509
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,229
- I trust you.
- Ha, ha.

510
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,028
Forget it. I'm a dinosaur.

511
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,106
Come on, we did pretty good
for 13 years together.

512
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,060
In case you haven't noticed, I can hardly
take care of myself. I'm like an infant baby.

513
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,745
Except I got three white pubic hairs.

514
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,222
Heh. You can do this.

515
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,589
I haven't got time.
I gotta find myself a place to stay.

516
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,027
You can stay with me
until I find you a new place.

517
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,990
No. Don't spend any more money
on me. I'm almost done.

518
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,904
It's like polishing a turd.

519
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,426
Do you remember the first time
I came to the gym?

520
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,904
Do you remember what you
said to me? I do.

521
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,744
I said, "it looks like the garbage man
forgot to take out the trash."

522
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,982
Heh. Yeah. Something
cheerful like that.

523
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,745
Then you said:

524
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,426
"if I take you on, kid,
you're stuck with me."

525
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,945
You said that.

526
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,546
Don't quit on me, Light.
I won't quit on you.

527
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,950
Oh, here we go.

528
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,625
Call it.

529
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,261
It's a quarter.

530
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,344
Come on. Light, I need your help.

531
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,787
It'd be fun. One last time.

532
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,626
You know why I said what
I did about the garbage?

533
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,781
No.

534
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,305
I didn't want your head to get swelled
up. You were so goddamn good.

535
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,705
Thanks, buddy.

536
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,544
- Raze?
- Hmm?

537
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,464
Give me my quarter back.

538
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,791
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

539
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,630
How can you be so cheap?

540
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,260
I haven't got any money.
Give me my damn quarter.

541
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,626
Okay. Fine.

542
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,825
Nice car.

543
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,303
Oh, wow! This is exciting. Look who's
here to meet me. Kid McDonnen.

544
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,145
You know him from the Internet.
"Two old guys fighting."

545
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,827
He used to be Light Heavyweight Champ.
Wow, you put on a couple pounds?

546
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,784
- You're gonna get me in shape.
- Oh, really?

547
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,061
He's gonna get me in shape.

548
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,148
- Give us a couple minutes.
KID: They can come.

549
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,984
Watch a real reality show.

550
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,461
- Watch us negotiate.
- Okay. Okay! Ha, ha.

551
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,106
Hey! Ho-ho! All right.

552
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,906
- Let's get real, Kid.
- Okay, let's get real.

553
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,789
Me training you,
it ain't happening.

554
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,831
Well, this might be a problem, because
I already made the announcement.

555
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,028
You, my friend,
are embarrassing yourself.

556
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,547
A great performer knows when
it's time to get off the stage.

557
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,785
- What? Foreman fought when he was old.
- He was 15 years younger than you.

558
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,385
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

559
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,067
I'll go down there and fight
any one of those fighters, the best one.

560
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,669
And then if you see that I don't
have what you want, I'll walk away.

561
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,346
It's over.

562
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,911
Where's your dignity?

563
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,269
You're in my office, begging me
for a comeback you don't deserve?

564
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,900
- Well, take your best shot now.
- Whoa, Kid.

565
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,346
What are you flexing for?

566
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,741
Don't try it. I'm warning you.
I'll lay you out.

567
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,868
- Don't worry, I won't.
- All right.

568
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,590
Oh. Come on, Kid.

569
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,550
- What?
- I saw your fist clench 10 seconds ago.

570
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,351
I saw your eyes dart at my gut
five seconds ago.

571
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,940
You're an old man. You're washed up.

572
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,904
- Ooh!
- Did you see that five seconds ago?

573
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,506
Huh? Huh? What?
My eyes darted there first.

574
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,950
I can't believe you. After what I
did for your father, your family...

575
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,222
...how you ever could say no to me.

576
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,587
You wouldn't have all
this if it wasn't for me.

577
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,391
You wouldn't have this gym
if it weren't for me.

578
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,544
I don't understand.

579
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,180
You mention my father. That's a low blow.
I respect what you did for my family.

580
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,741
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay, I'll let you train here.

581
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,462
Good.

582
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,134
I'll even get some of
my guys to help you out.

583
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,706
But you and I both know
I won't be doing jack.

584
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,464
Okay. Thanks.

585
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,748
- Long as we're clear.
- Yeah, all right.

586
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,631
See? You got me moving
faster already.

587
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,424
Hey. You again?

588
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,266
- Think I can talk to you for a second?
- Why do you keep following me around?

589
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,663
My name's BJ. I'm your son, Kid.

590
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,389
We should get some coffee.

591
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,391
Yeah, I'd like that.

592
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,546
Excuse me, can I just
ask you something real quick?

593
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,987
- You're in training, right?
- Uh-huh.

594
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,507
What are you training for?
A pie-eating contest? Heh.

595
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,503
That's all carbs.

596
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,549
That's good. Maple syrup.
It's healthy.

597
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,511
Some Scotch?

598
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,347
- So when did your mother tell you about me?
- Just last week.

599
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,027
Gotta tell you, if you weren't all over
the news, I don't think she would've.

600
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,185
So how is she?

601
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,028
Well, she's, uh...

602
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,343
She's emotional, you know?

603
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,870
My dad. Her husband, the guy who raised
me, he passed away recently so...

604
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,706
- Ah. Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

605
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,544
- Was he good to you?
- Oh, yeah.

606
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,190
Yeah, he was the best.

607
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,065
So.

608
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,825
What'd she say about me?

609
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,341
That you were pretty much the worst.

610
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,070
- Really?
- Yeah.

611
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,781
Anything specific?

612
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,426
More specifically.
All right. All right.

613
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,390
She, um... She said
you turned into an asshole.

614
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,030
Heh, that's what she said.

615
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,346
She said you became a womanizer
and a drunk. Loudmouth, you know?

616
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,911
- Is that all?
- That's it.

617
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,542
- That's bullshit.
- Ha, ha.

618
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,067
Well, I was all those things
way before I met your mother.

619
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,384
Yeah, she wasn't too happy about
me coming to see you today so...

620
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,984
Yeah. Well...

621
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,506
Well, why did you?

622
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,784
Guess I was curious.

623
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,390
You were never curious about me?

624
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,540
Your mother asked me to not make any
contact with you so I respected that.

625
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,350
You respected that, but...

626
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,423
You did know you had a son, right?

627
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,027
I wasn't ready to be a dad and your
mother got pregnant accidentally.

628
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,789
You had me and I was a mistake
you didn't want to deal with, right?

629
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,103
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay, I get it.

630
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,945
- Don't take it like that.
- I'm not taking it any way.

631
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,583
You're not a mistake. You're here.
The situation was a mistake. I don't know.

632
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,868
It's okay. You don't owe me nothing.
Take that.

633
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,864
- Put that towards your double bypass.
- What's all this about?

634
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,466
When I came here today,
I was pissed off at my mom...

635
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,420
...because she kept you a secret from
me, but I think I get why she did it.

636
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,821
Good luck.

637
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,947
RAZOR: Home, sweet home.

638
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,944
LIGHTNING: It's exactly the
same as it was 20 years ago.

639
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,381
What's that?

640
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,504
It's my hobby. I got a creative side.
Didn't know that, did you?

641
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,707
No.

642
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,669
So where's the TV?
You don't got a TV?

643
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,504
I don't do TV.

644
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,788
- You don't do TV.
- Mm-mm.

645
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,430
You got an iPad?

646
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,991
No, I got a regular couch.

647
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,510
It's not a couch, dummy.

648
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,986
I know what an iPad is.

vinegar off my feet. It's strong!

1952
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,425
Why is it that strong?

1953
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,026
It might be bad. I think
the vinegar might be bad.

1954
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,108
Listen. If you thought Grudgement Day
was big, then this is gonna be huge.

They're talking Wembley Stadium for
the rematch. Ninety thousand people.

I can get you seven figures,
maybe eight.

1957

Bottom line is I can get you
guys paid. What do you say?

DANTE: That's what I'm talking about.

- What about you, Evander?
- No.

1960
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,027
Come on, Evander! So the man went
a little batshit and bit your ear off.

1961
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,064
- It's not like he liked the way you tasted.
- Taste like ass.

1962
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,109
Did you hear? You didn't taste good.

1963
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,262
Mike, do me a favor?
Tell him you're sorry.

1964
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,661
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, like you mean it.

1965
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,711
- Sorry.
- I felt that.

1966
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,664
- Come on, Evander. What do you say?
- No.
