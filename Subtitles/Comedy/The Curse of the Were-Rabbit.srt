559
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:59,398
Daddy created him for good,

560
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:02,163
but he's turned out evil.

561
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,745
[Growls]

562
01:20:23,524 --> 01:20:24,786
[Growls]

563
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,622
Ah!

564
01:20:34,902 --> 01:20:36,392
Huh?

565
01:20:37,972 --> 01:20:39,234
Ah!

566
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,833
It's a sheep-mincing thing!

567
01:20:41,876 --> 01:20:44,140
Now, that's clever.

568
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:45,167
[Loud whistle]

569
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:46,202
Huh?

570
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,121
[Engine speeds up]

571
01:21:09,837 --> 01:21:12,169
Do something, Wallace!

572
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,205
[Baa]

573
01:21:23,517 --> 01:21:24,643
Duck!

574
01:21:24,685 --> 01:21:25,947
Where?

575
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,317
Whoa!

576
01:21:35,963 --> 01:21:37,453
[Baa]

577
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:40,434
By heck!

578
01:21:40,468 --> 01:21:43,164
I thought we were
all for the can then.

579
01:21:50,544 --> 01:21:52,011
[Ring]

580
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:58,975
I couldn't pass by
without saying thank you.

581
01:22:00,788 --> 01:22:04,019
He's just like
he used to be.

582
01:22:04,058 --> 01:22:06,458
WALLACE:
Oh, don't mention it.

583
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,054
Thanks, pooch.

584
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:13,294
Give me a shout
if he goes wrong again.

585
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:15,825
You're very kind.

586
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,201
Oh, won't you come in?

587
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:19,433
We were just about
to have some cheese.

588
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:21,964
Oh, no, not cheese.

589
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:24,637
Sorry, it brings
me out in a rash.

590
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:26,442
Can't stand the stuff.

591
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:28,749
[Gulp!]

592
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:31,183
Not even Wensleydale?

593
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:34,944
Got to be on our way.

594
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,953
Come on, Preston.

595
01:22:45,466 --> 01:22:46,933
Good-bye...

596
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:47,934
[Door closes]

597
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,458
chuck.

598
01:22:53,808 --> 01:22:56,834
What's wrong with Wensleydale?

599
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:05,350
Talking of which...

600
01:23:05,386 --> 01:23:07,616
All the more for us,

601
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:10,556
and not a sheep to worry us.

602
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:15,291
Get off me cheese!

603
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:17,388
Get off! Get o...

604
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:19,626
Gromit? Gromit!

605
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,861
Go for him!

606
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:23,893
Gromit! Oh!

607
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:27,470
Get off with you! Oh!

608
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:28,975
[Gulp!]

609
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:30,476
[Baa]

610
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:31,500
WALLACE: Shoo off!
