You see, the problem with
this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

113
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,172
is that I am among many
who don't enjoy reading it.

114
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,549
We have an ailing circulation,

115
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,259

look around this building

116
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,886
to understand why.

117
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,723
Lack of commitment and
too much self-indulgence.

Mmm. Mmm.

119
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
So what I'm looking for

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,563
is some enthusiasm,
some energy,

121
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,565
some fresh blood.

122
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
And the question
that I'm asking myself

123
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,364
is how much alcohol
is usual in yours.

124
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,032
My fresh blood?

125
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,408
How much do you drink?

126
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,286
I suppose at
the upper end of "social."

127
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,205

to do that.

anxious, Mr. Kemp.

another heavy drinker.

very well qualify as.

with Betty Grable

So here, everything you
need is right there.

189
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,336
It's called
"Madam La Zonga Predicts."

He's rarely out in daylight.

Looks like he enjoys a drink.

a bank since the day it opened.

713
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,833
And like most every other
newspaper on Earth,

714
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,334
it's financed
by its advertising.

715
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,628
And without advertising, not
only is there no La Zonga,

716
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,588
there's no paper
to put it in, so, thus,

717
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,966
there are one or two things
that we don't write about.

718
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,759
In other words, nothing at all.

719
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,845
In one other word, discretion.

720
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,680
You're not
a foreign correspondent

721
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,017
in some far-flung foreign
land, this is America.

722
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,393
This is Puerto Rico.

723
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
This is America.

724
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,189
You think some plumber
from Normal, Illinois,

725
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,234
saves up for 25 years to
come here on a cruise ship

726
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,862
to read about bad times
in the sugar plantation?

727
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,864
They don't give a fuck!

728
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,532
The average guy
don't rock the boat,

729
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,325
'cause he wants
to climb aboard it.

730
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,078
And our readership
is vividly average.

731
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,122
(CHUCKLES)

732
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,541
They don't care
who the losers are.

733
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,419
(CHUCKLES) They want
to know who won.

734
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,712
Who won the bowls,

735
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,882
who won the races, who won the
pot at the slot machines.

736
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,261
Look at me, Kemp.

737
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,014
You're not sleeping,
you're wide awake.

738
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,600
And this is the American Dream.

739
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,021
So many hotels,
you can't see the sea.

740
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,273
You can see the sea by
checking into the hotels.

741
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,566
Pay to see the sea?

742
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,443
What's the matter with that?

743
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,320
You're paying to be
in the dream.

744
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,573
There's a thin veneer, Kemp,

745
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,492
between the dream
and the reality.

746
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,287
You wake them up and the people might
start asking for their money back.

747
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,253
You're the boss.

748
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
Not quite.

749
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,844
The editorial policy of this
newspaper is owned by the dream.

750
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,396
Oh, God.

751
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,529
Oh, Christ.

752
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,954
Oh, God, look at that.

753
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,166
Oh, God!

754
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,960
Hal?
Oh.

755
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,837
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.

756
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,006
I was looking at his boat.

757
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,674
She's a sweet little beauty.

758
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,092
You been aboard?

759
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,343
No.

760
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,845
Great little island hopper.

761
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,763
We've all been down on her.

762
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,807
It's a wonderful experience.

763
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,481
You two are early.

764
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,608
Oh, you got lucky.

765
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,817
SANDERSON: Yeah.

766
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,110
Did you meet?

767
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,820
Oh, yeah, we got first names.

768
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,908
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S.
Marines, great friend of mine.

769
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,535
This is Mr. Paul Kemp,
New York Times.

770
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,870
Oh, you're the writer.

771
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,330
Paul's a novelist.
Uh-huh.

772
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,082
(MR. ZIMBURGER CHUCKLES)

773
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,500
New York Times?

774
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,502
He don't know one
from the other.

775
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,546
Just go with it.
This guy's key.

776
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,964
Key to what?

777
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,842
Key to the discussion
we're about to have.

778
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,181
Look at those mothers.

779
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,184
Come with me, Kemp.

780
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,021
This is a private beach.

781
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,314
We are not on it.

782
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,149
No, but we are!

783
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,151
And what we do is private!

784
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,238
Now get the fuck gone!

785
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,034
Get the fuck out of here!

786
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,577
I see your face again,

787
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,079
you're gonna have
a 12-gauge shotgun

788
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,622
telling you what to do.

789
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,800
Talking about Satan...

790
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,387
if there ever was a kingdom of
Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

791
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,516
The only way to come to terms
with Communism is to destroy it.

792
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,437
Hit it before it hits us in a
devastating democratic strike.

793
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,106
No more for the major.

794
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,693
They're looking for a man
to push that button,

795
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,444
I am that man.

796
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,530
MRS. ZIMBURGER:
Yes, you are, honey.

797
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,783
You look ravishing, Chenault.

798
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,118
Thank you.

799
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,244
You need rescuing?

800
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,745
Oh, don't take him away.

801
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,455
He's very entertaining.

802
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,498
(CHUCKLES)

803
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,961
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't
know, we kind of veered off, didn't we?

804
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,422
Paul presents us with a
somewhat liberal point of view.

805
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,173
MR. ZIMBURGER: There is no
such thing as a liberal.

806
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:58,927
A liberal is a Commie with a college
education thinking Negro thoughts.

807
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,138
Well, here's a fact for you.

808
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:05,726
76.4% of all Negroes
are controlled from Moscow.

809
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,729
That's why Castro gets
such an easy ride.

810
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,690
In my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,

811
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,150
let its people live in peace.
Art.

812
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,485
Hey.
Come on, let's eat.

813
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,945
Come on.

814
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,076
Who's the guy in the shades?

815
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,995
Segurra's Daddy.

816
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,496
It's who you're waiting for.

817
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,664
Oh.

818
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,250
Thank you for my roses.

819
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,378
I didn't think you noticed.

820
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,088
Of course I noticed.

821
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,844
SANDERSON: Paul, would
you mind joining us?

822
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,890
Oh.

823
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,185
How do you do, sir?

824
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,478
Mr. Kemp.
Nice to see you.

825
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,645
Mr. Kemp.

826
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,483
Okay.

827
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,859
Let me just start by saying

828
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,402
this is a purely
informal meeting.

829
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,822
And, incidentally, you don't
worry about Letterman, okay?

830
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,074
Letterman?

831
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,451
What the hell's Letterman got
to do with The New York Times?

832
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,536
Mr. Kemp subs for
a variety of newspapers.

833
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,038
Occasionally, he writes
for the news.

834
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,248
What he does in his spare
time is his affair.

835
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,666
That's how I like it.

836
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,293
We'd like you to do
some writing for us.

837
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,544
So I gather.

838
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
About what?

839
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,256
SANDERSON: In a sentence,
we want to set something up,

840
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,425
and have the public
as our friends.

841
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,844
And there are a variety
of ways we can do that.

842
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:26,890
Let me tell you how this kind

843
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,266
of thing works, Paul.

844
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,185
Suppose, by way of example,

845
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,562
you wanted to put up taxes
by five percent.

846
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,231
The smart way of doing it

847
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,983
is to float the idea
of a ten percent hike.

848
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,694
Let them all shout about it,
get themselves in a fuss,

849
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,029
then you offer concessions.

850
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,073
"How about seven percent?"
"No way," they'll say.

851
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,578
"All right, let's stay friends
and make a compromise at five."

852
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,663
Bingo.

853
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,081
They think they won something,

854
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,333
you get the five percent you
wanted in the first place.

855
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,252
Same thing applies
to real estate.

856
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,421
You want to build five houses,

857
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,006
you put in a planning
application for 50.

858
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
How many do you want to build?

859
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,176
None.

860
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,970
We want to build one hotel.

861
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,805
Well, looking
around this place,

862
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,682
I don't think
anyone would notice.

863
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,308
It isn't in this place.

864
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,601
It's an island.

865
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,313
Sensitive for a variety of reasons
we don't want to get into now.

866
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,233
Nobody wants a paradise
choked with hotels, but

867
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,528
everybody will be pleased
to compromise at one.

868
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,613
This is going to require
some clever writing

869
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,532
in various
carefully placed articles.

870
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,326
Isn't that
kind of thing illegal?

871
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,870
MR. ZIMBURGER:
If I may say, Mr. Kemp,

872
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,622
that's an
inappropriate comment.

873
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,833
Where's the island?

874
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,959
Can't tell you.

875
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,127
Not yet.

876
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,796
Discretion is paramount,
Mr. Kemp.

877
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,257
If you want to join us, you'll
have to sign some papers.

878
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,135
We're having a meeting
tomorrow in Hal's office.

879
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,386
If you want to be
part of what will be

880
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,389
a very exciting project,
come along.

881
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,225
There's a man outside in a
funny little car for Paul.

882
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,310
Oh, yeah.

883
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,728
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

884
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,313
I have to run.

885
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,653
Can't stay?

886
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,239
I hear the mermaids
come out in the moonlight.

887
