Why can't you[br]accept the fact[br]that I'm not a genius?

Itjust kills you that[br]I'm not an honor student.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
[Sneezes][br]Loser!

163
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
[Sneezes][br]Loser!

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Wait, wait, wait. [br]Was that, uh...

165
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,500
Was that the loser sneeze[br]I just heard right there?

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,300
Guys, come on. [br]I mean, what is that, [br]from like the 1900s?

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,200
Nobody does that anymore. [br]I don't think anybody does.

168
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,200
When I lived in Kentucky... [br]Did they still do[br]the loser sneeze in Kentucky?

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,900
No. They had, uh, [br]guns and homemade bombs.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What about L.A.? [br]There wasattitude in L.A., [br]but no losersneeze.

171
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I'm pretty sure[br]the loser sneeze[br]is officially dead.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,100
Sorry.

173
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
- [Sneezes][br]Loser! [br]- [Laughing]

174
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Nice.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,100
I don't think[br]they got the memo[br]about the loser sneeze.

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,100
Uh, no, apparently not.

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
Cliff.

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,900
- Torrance. [br]- Advanced Chem.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,900
Yikes. [br]Um, 'fraid so. [br]Are you intimidated?

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,200
Y-Yeah, a little.

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,900
- Really? [br]- No, not really.

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,200
So, is that your band[br]or something?

183
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,700
The Clash? No, uh...

184
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,600
It's a British punk band, [br]circa 1977 to 1983-ish.

185
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,700
- Original lineup, anyway. [br]- How vintage.

186
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,400
[Class BellRinging]

187
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Um, so I'll[br]seeyou aroundthen?

188
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,700
Looks like it.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

190
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie...

191
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,200
and Jan, Jan, [br]the cheerleading man. [br]Hey, fags.

192
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,200
Just because we won[br]more trophies[br]than you guys,

193
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,400
that's no reason[br]to go get all malignant.

194
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,900
Malignant this, tool. [br][Laughing]

195
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,500
All right. [br]Right on!

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
One ofthese days, man. [br]Let it go.

197
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,400
They never even won[br]a single game.

198
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Gotta be kind[br]of rough on 'em. [br]Besides, they're dicks.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,100
Les, tell me you have[br]Advanced Chem[br]fi rst period.

200
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,500
Advanced Chem, fi rst period. [br]lfyou have a lab partner[br]already, I'm screwed.

201
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Torrance, it's only[br]the second day ofschool,

202
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
and your academic[br]insecurity bit[br]is completely tired.

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,700
You know, everyone's[br]saying your ambition[br]broke Carver's leg.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
When, really, it was[br]the ankle she slammed[br]into the ground.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,400
Kasey did a massive[br]E-mail last night. [br]Misspelled "leg."

206
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
Shut up! [br]Two G's.

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,600
Apparently, Carver[br]gets home schooling[br]for the next three months.

208
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm cursed. [br]Replacing her is[br]gonna be a nightmare.

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, that's why you're[br]the captain, Captain.

210
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:50,900
Bring on the tyros, [br]the neophytes[br]and the dilettanti.

211
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,800
Bring on the tyros, [br]the neophytes[br]and the dilettanti.

212
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,000
S.A.T. 's are over, Darcy. [br]And you're still jealous[br]of my score.

213
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Are we sure Carver's[br]not malingering?

214
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Carver will strictly be[br]cheering in Special Olympics[br]until March.

215
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,800
Nationals are February 10th.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Regionals are in, like, [br]four weeks. I talked to her. [br]She's cool with this.

217
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,100
Don't tell me Carver can[br]cut school just because she[br]broke her leg in three places.

218
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Hello! [br]Get a wheelchair! [br]That lucky bitch.

219
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Tell me we're not actually[br]continuing this masquerade[br]and having tryouts.

220
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
Let's cut the crap[br]and pick somebody now.

221
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Whitney's little sisterJamie[br]is really teeny.

222
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
She'll be easy to toss, [br]and she doesn't give lip.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,900
Just tongue. [br]Kiss my ass, Jan.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
I'd love to. [br]lfshe's the best, [br]Jamie's got it.

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,900
But we have to see[br]everyone.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,700
Ready, okay.

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,500
Wait. Hold on. [br]Let me try that again. [br]That was terrible.

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Ready, okay! [br]Go, team...

229
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Ready, okay! Sorry.

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Ready, okay! Shit.

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,100
Be aggressive. [br]Be, be aggressive.

232
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,600
How many cheers[br]do we have to memorize? [br]Do we get paid for this?

233
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
Anddo lhave to[br]provide my own uniform?

234
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,300
[Techno]

235
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,700
I see you guys are[br]wearing red. Um, that[br]does not work for me.

236
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,200
Ready, okay! R-C-H! [br][Sobbing]

Uh, bankrupt. [br]We've already[br]so decided onJamie.

291
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,200
Courtney, this is not[br]a democracy. [br]It's a "cheerocracy. "

292
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm sorry, [br]but I'm overruling you.

293
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,600
You are being a "cheertator,"[br]Torrance, and a pain in my ass!

294
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
We already voted.

295
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,700
Besides, Missy[br]looks like an uber dyke.

296
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,700
[Giggling]

297
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,700
Courtney, I'm the captain.

298
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm pulling rank, [br]and you can fall in line or not.

299
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,500
lfwe're gonna be the best, [br]we have to have the best.

300
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Missy's the poo. [br]So take a big whiff.

You. [br]And you.

303
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,300
I mean, hi. I'm... [br]A cheerleader.

304
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,500
Uh, yeah. [br]Head cheerleader, [br]to be exact.

305
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Wow.

306
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,500
So does Missy live here? [br]Uh, actually, she moved[br]back to L.A., yeah.

307
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,100
Something about[br]evil cheerleaders or... [br]Look, I'm serious.

308
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,100
We have to get her. [br]Is her drug dependency[br]gonna be a problem?

309
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Cliff, shut up. [br]What doyou want?

310
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,800
I want you on the squad.

311
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,300
You're the best. [br]They know it.

312
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Theyjust reject[br]the unfamiliar.

313
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,300
Thanks, but no, thanks. [br]I mean, I plead[br]temporary insanity.

314
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,300
See, I'm a hard-core gymnast.

315
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,500
No wayjumping up and down, [br]screaming, "Go, team, go!"[br]is gonna satisfy me.

316
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,500
Look, we're gymnasts too, [br]except no beam, [br]no bars, no vault.

317
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Sorry. Not interested.

318
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,800
What are you doing? [br]Nothin'.

319
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,900
I just thought that[br]it was interesting hearing[br]Torrance's point ofview.

But here's the thing. [br]It's gonna cost us[br]$2,000.

What, do I have[br]the letters A-T-M[br]tattooed on my forehead?

652
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
We were thinking more[br]like D-A-D-D-Y.

Maybe I can get 500.

654

He'd look a little ridiculous[br]in that bikini, wouldn't he?

Yeah. Um...

What can I say? [br]I drive hard.

683
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,300
- Shouldn't take long to wash. [br]- Don't even worry about it. [br]I got all afternoon.

Thanks for coming. [br]We're... [br]Don't speak.

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,900
You. You have weak ankles.

One ofyour calves[br]is bigger than the other.

696
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,400
Too much makeup.

697
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,100
Not enough makeup. [br]What's with the skin?

00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,800
Say it with me: "Sunlight"!

00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,300
And you, I take you[br]to be the captain,

706
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
which means[br]you'll probably need[br]more work than anyone.

Look, you don't... [br]But... [br]Shh!

Listen and learn.

710
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm a choreographer.

711
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,300
That's what I do.

712
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,300
You... are cheerleaders.

713
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,900
Cheerleaders are dancers[br]who have gone retarded.

714
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,800
Whatyou do is a tiny, [br]pathetic subset ofdancing.

715
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,300
I will attempt to transform[br]your robotic routines into poetry...

Got it? Now cut that in half.

720
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,000
This is called a diet. [br]Everyone start one today.

721
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,800
Darcy, honey, [br]you should stop eating.

722
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,600
You see, when you[br]skip a meal, your body[br]feeds off its fat stores.

723
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,800
And ifyou skip enough, [br]maybe your body[br]will eat your ass.

724
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,900
Why does everyone[br]have togo on a diet?

725
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
Because in cheerleading, [br]we throw people in the air,

726
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
and fat people don't go as high.

The Spirit Stick curse. [br]Will you[br]lay off with that?

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
There's no curse, [br]and you're not[br]going to Hades.

Idon't know[br]ifyou can imagine... [br]Hey.

848
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,600
the incredible sense ofdeja vu[br]lexperiencedasl was watching[br]that last routine.

849
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,000
It tends to make me[br]suspicious... [br]I wouldn'tjust now.

What? [br]Official cheer business.

Well, here's another.

857
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,200
Thanks.

858
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,900
Obviously your Toros[br]aren't the only squad with[br]this particular routine.

859
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,600
Does the name[br]Sparky Polastri[br]mean anything to you?

860
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,500
Sparky Polastri? [br]Mm-hmm.

861
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,200
Apparently he's been peddling[br]this same routine up and down[br]the California coast.

862
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,200
Six squads total.

863
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,600
We're holding[br]an emergency session[br]ofthe discretionary panel.

864
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,800
About what? [br]We've never had a situation[br]like this before.

865
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,700
We really should[br]disqualify you and... [br]No, don't punish the squad.

866
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,900
It was my choice[br]to hire Sparky, not theirs.

867
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,100
Don't penalize everyone[br]for my bad judgment.

868
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,500
But since there's[br]no precedent for this,

869
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,500
there's nothing[br]in the rule books[br]that forbids it.

870
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
It's simply frowned upon,

871
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,100
and I suppose[br]we can't disqualify you[br]on those grounds alone.

872
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,700
As defending champions, [br]you are guaranteed[br]a bid to Florida,

873
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,600
but know that we'll[br]be watching you.

874
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,000
And don't expect[br]to show up at fi nals[br]with that routine.

875
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,700
[Announcer][br]Taking the floornow...

It's not totally herfault. [br]lhookedup...

878
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,600
This season should have[br]been gravy, okay?

879
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,200
I handpicked the squad, [br]I delivered[br]an idiot-proof routine.

880
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,900
- Platter, nationals, hello! [br]- Don't you mean[br]a stolen routine?

881
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,700
Oh. Don't be[br]so naive, Torrance.

882
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,400
Look, the truth is[br]I was a real leader, okay?

883
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
I did what I had to do[br]to win at nationals,

884
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,600
and ever since I handed[br]the reins over to you, you've run[br]my squad into the ground!

885
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,100
If I made any mistake[br]as a squad leader, [br]it wasn't borrowing cheers.

886
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,600
It was announcing you[br]as my successor.

887
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,800
Uh-uh. Not cool.

888
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait, [br]wait, wait, wait, wait.

889
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,500
Let me go. I just[br]wanna get out of here. [br]Hey, Big Red's a bitch.

890
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
We all know that. [br]Even she knows that.

891
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't know[br]what to do here, Aaron.

892
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,000
Look. I know I haven't[br]always been there foryou[br]since I went to college.

893
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,900
It's been[br]a rough transition, [br]for both of us.

894
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,600
But I still care about you[br]as much as I ever did. [br]You know that, right?

895
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,300
You do? [br]Ofcourse.

896
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,200
Which is why I hate[br]to see you like this, [br]all stressed out.

897
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,100
It's not good foryou.

898
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,100
You're a great cheerleader, [br]Tor, and you're cute as hell.

899
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,700
It'sjust that maybe... [br][Sighs]

900
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Maybe...

901
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,800
you'rejust not[br]captain material,

902
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,100
and there's nothing[br]wrong with that.

903
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,600
Maybe you should consider[br]letting Courtney and Whitney[br]take over the squad.

904
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,100
They'rejust like Big Red. [br]You want me[br]to give up captain?

905
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
Hey, let them deal[br]with the politics.

906
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,900
You just do[br]what you do best, Tor. [br]You cheer.

907
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Cheer, Tor. Okay?

908
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,700
I just wanna see you happy.

909
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,700

Look, Cliff, [br]I can explain.

916
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,200
No. It's cool.

[Sighs][br]Aaron called us[br]last night.

945
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,300
He told us[br]you're turning[br]the squad over to us.

946
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,900
Just because you bit[br]the big one as captain,

947
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,300
does not mean[br]we're gonna be[br]super hard on you.

948
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,300
Oh. [br]We'll treat you[br]as ifyou...

949
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,200
didn't screw us[br]into the ground.

01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,400
Gee, thanks. [br]Everyone.

951
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,100
Torrance is not[br]to be harmed.

952
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,400
We've already decided[br]on a course ofaction.

953
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,400
We're gonna forego[br]nationals this year.

954
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,000
- [Sighs][br]- [Whitney] Everyone's[br]already agreedto it.

955
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,600
Uh, except me. [br]And me!

956
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,900
- Both ofyou can be replaced. [br]- [Torrance][br]lcan't believeyouguys.

957
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,600
The onlyperson who can[br]officially resign thepost[br]ofcaptain is the captain,

958
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,700
and I'm not[br]going anywhere.

959
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
Then we'll have[br]to overthrow you. [br]Which we will!

960
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,600
Enough!

961
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,800
Our whole cheering career, [br]we've stakedourreputation[br]on being the best,

962
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,700
the most inventive.

963
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Now we fi nally have a chance[br]to truly be original, [br]and you're all running scared.

964
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,300
[Courtney][br]She's crazy. [br]lam not crazy,

965
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,200
and I'm not resigning[br]as captain either.

966
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,800
- You're gonna have[br]to kill me fi rst. [br]- That can be arranged.

967
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,800
Shut it, Whitney! [br]Let her talk!

968
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,300
Look, lknowl've screwedup[br]royally as captain,

969
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,700
but lbelieve in this squad, [br]andlknow we can[br]bounce backfrom this.

970
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,900
I'm not saying[br]it's gonna be easy. [br]It's gonna be hard work.

971
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,500
We need a new routine, [br]something amazing and fresh,

972
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,500
and we've got less than[br]three weeks till nationals,

973
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,500
but ifwe can do it, [br]ifwe can pull this off,

974
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,300
then we can really[br]call ourselves original.

975
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,200
Now who's with me?

976
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,900
All right! [br]Yeah. [br]Yeah!

977
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,800
Yeah!

978
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,500
How 'bout it, girls? [br]It's gonna be hard[br]without you two.

979
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,100
[Sighs][br]Fine.

980
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,500
Sure. [br]Whatever.

981
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay. Let's do this.

982
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,600
[Torrance][br]We're gonna devote[br]every waking hourtopractice...

983
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,200

985
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,000
We've gotta do[br]whateverit takes to be[br]in perfectphysicalshape.

986
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,900
Yeah. You can go[br]a little harder.

987
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,300
Yeah, that feelsgood. [br]Maybe we should[br]join the squad.

988
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,700
Push. [br]Oh, yeah. [br]Fag!

989
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,900
[Torrance] Andsince[br]the football team sucks[br]no matterhowhard we cheer,

990
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,900
we'll use nightgames[br]topractice too.

991
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,500
But that's not all.

992
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,700
We're gonna study[br]othertypes ofmovement, [br]from swing dance...

993
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,300
to interpretive dance, [br]... you grow and you[br]grow and you bloom!

994
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,200

995

We'lldrawinspiration[br]from martialarts, [br]Hah!

01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,200
Tor! Wha... Wow! [br]What are you doing here?

1001
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,100
Just wanted to[br]come by and see you. [br]Is this a bad time?

1002
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah. [br]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,300
I'm super busy. [br]I'm workin'[br]on this project...

1004
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,300
Yeah, you sound super busy.

1005
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,900
I guess that's it. [br]You were too busy[br]to believe in me.

1006
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,800
Oh. No, no, but wait.

1007
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,500
You weren't too busy[br]to sell me out to Courtney[br]and Whitney, were you?

1008
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,300
Gee, now I'm confused.

1009
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,500
Well, I hope you're not[br]too busy to hear this.

1010
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,300
Kiss my ass, Aaron! [br]It's over!

1011
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,200
- [Scoffs][br]- [Gasps]

1012
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,300
You're a great[br]cheerleader, Aaron.

1013
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,800
It'sjust that...

1014
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,700
maybe you're not exactly[br]boyfriend material.

1015
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,100
Bye-bye.

1016
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,300
You're a cheerleader? [br][Disgusted Sigh]

1017
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,900
U.C.A. just posted the nationals[br]list on the Internet. [br]East Compton isn't on it.

1018
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,900
They couldn 't raise[br]the money in time.

1019
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,100
- They're not going. [br]- What do you mean, [br]"They're not going"?

1020
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,500
Torrance, [br]that'sgoodnews.

1021
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,500
They cannot not go. [br]That's not good news.

1022
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,800
What are you talking about? [br]They don't go, we win. [br]Once again we're the best.

1023
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,500
I defi ne best as competing[br]against the best there is[br]out there and beating them.

1024
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,700
- They have to go. [br]- [Sighs]

1025
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,400
It's so unfair. The fi rst[br]inner-city squad to get a bid, [br]and they can't afford to go?

1026
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,700
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning[br]off into another dimension. [br]Justin!

1027
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,000
The company gets hit up[br]for money all the time, honey. [br]I just can't.

1028
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,600
It's not that much money, [br]Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

1029
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
Tell them the deal. [br]Maybe they'll wanna help.

1030
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah? Okay, [br]I'll make the call,

1031
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,900
but they'll probably[br]say no.

1032
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,100
Don't let them. [br]Think of how much[br]it'll mean to East Compton.

1033
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,000
They deserve to go.

1034
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,800
Do the right thing, Dad!

1035
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,600
Did that[br]just happen? [br]Yeah.

1036
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,300
"Where we come from, [br]'cheer' is not a word[br]we hear very often."

1037
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,100
"They should call us[br]'inspiration leaders'[br]instead."

1038
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Oh, that's deep. [br]I like that.

1039
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,200
I don't know why[br]we writin' to some[br]talk-show host.

1040
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,400
It's like we beggin'[br]for charity. [br]It's not charity.

1041
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,300
Pauletta Patton's[br]from our neighborhood.

1042
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,300
- She'll understand[br]why we need the money. [br]- Tell her we need to buy donuts.

1043
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,600
- Her big butt[br]will understand that. [br]- Ha-ha!

1044
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,900
- Stop being[br]counterproductive, all right? [br]- Lava, please...

1045
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,100
stop teaching her[br]these big words[br]before she choke on one.

1046
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,400
No, better I choke you, Lafred.

1047
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,100
- Look, Jenelope... [br]- You guys, stop! Please.

1048
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,300
Damn! [br][Sighs]

1049
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,100
Well, tell her about[br]the late-night practices[br]we been having.

1050
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,900
There you go. [br]That's the kind ofstuff[br]she wants to hear about.

1051
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,900
Now we're talkin'.

1052
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,700
[DoorBangs Open]

1053
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,700
You guys have to go[br]to nationals.

1054
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,300
- Did you come up here[br]just to tell me that? [br]- Here.

1055
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,700
I got my dad's company[br]to sponsoryou guys. [br]What is this, hush money?

1056
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,000
No. [br]Oh, right. [br]It'sguilt money.

1057
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,200
You pay our way in[br]and you sleep better[br]at night...

1058
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,100
knowing how your whole world[br]is based on one[br]big, old fat lie.

1059
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,600
Well, you know what?

1060
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,700
- [Scoffs][br]- We don't need you.

1061
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,700
Why do you have to be so mean? [br]I'm just trying to do[br]the right thing here.

1062
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,300
I'm trying to be strong[br]for my squad, okay? [br]That's what a captain does.

1063
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,200
Well, I'm a captain too, [br]you know, and I'm trying[br]to make it right.

1064
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,800
You wanna[br]make it right?

1065
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,300
Then when you go to nationals, [br]bring it.

1066
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,300
Don't slack off because[br]you feel sorry for us.

1067
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,600
That way, when we beat you, [br]we'll know it's because[br]we're better.

1068
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,000
I'll bring it.

1069
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,500
- Don't worry. [br]- I never do.

1070
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,800
Yeah, your parents[br]just have to sign it.

1071
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,100
I didn't do[br]anything!

1072
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,100
Bye. [br]Bye, Tor.

1073
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,600
I listened to your tape. [br]I loved it.

1074
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,600
Great. [br]Can I talk to you?

1075
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,200
I was upset that night. [br]Aaron gave me a ride home.

1076
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,100
It wasjust[br]a good-night kiss. [br]It meant nothing.

1077
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,800
Oh. I'm sorry.

1078
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,400
And I wanted you[br]to know that... [br]I broke up with him.

1079
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,500
Congratulations.

1080
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,600
He didn't[br]believe in me.

1081
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,500
You did! [br]Whatever.

1082
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,700

Hanging out with the airheads[br]has really sharpened[br]your verbal skills, huh?

1088
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,300
- Screw you. [br]- Said the cheerleader.

1089
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,500
That's right, [br]I am a cheerleader, [br]and you're a dumb ass.

1090
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
Torrance likes you.

1091
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,700
Okay? She likes you.

1092
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,500
She has an odd way[br]ofshowing it. [br]Don't be stupid.

1093
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,900
She broke up with[br]her boyfriend foryou. [br]Yeah.

1094
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,800
Look. Do us all a favor[br]and get overyourself[br]and tell her how you feel.

1095
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,800
I thought I had.

1096
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,300
Well, try again.
