- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

854
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:35,904
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

855
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:38,607
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:40,618
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

Max, where are you?

01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:16,875
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

870

No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

Oh, Max.
