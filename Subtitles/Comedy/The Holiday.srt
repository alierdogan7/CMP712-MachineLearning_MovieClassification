00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:12,238
IRIS: l have found almost everything
ever written about love to be true.

2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,033
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,619
Oh, what an extraordinary thought!

4
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,206
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that,

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,543
but I'm more than willing
to believe Shakespeare had.

6
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,005
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,843
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer power
to alter and define our lives.

8
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,847
lt was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

9
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,477
Now that is something I know to be true.

10
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,578
For some, quite inexplicably, love fades.

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,930
For others, love is simply lost.

12
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,856
But then, of course, love can also be found,

13
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,693
even ifjust for the night.

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,034
And then there's another kind of love,

15
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,577
the cruellest kind,

16
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,247
the one that almost kills its victims.

17
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,500
lt's called unrequited love.

18
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,128
Of that, l am an expert.

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,259
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other,

20
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,094
but what about the rest of us?

21
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,720
What about our stories,

22
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,640
those of us who fall in love alone?

23
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,601
We are the victims of the one-sided affair.

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,728
We are the cursed of the loved ones.

25
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,105
We are the unloved ones,

26
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,648
the walking wounded,

27
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,110
the handicapped without the advantage
of a great parking space.

28
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,071
Yes, you are looking at one such individual

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,910
and l have willingly loved that man
for over three miserable years,

30
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,746
the absolute worst years of my life.

31
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,040
The worst Christmases, the worst birthdays,

32
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,878
New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

33
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,798
These years that l've been in love
have been the darkest days of my life,

34
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,759
all because l've been cursed
by being in love with a man

35
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,512
who does not and will not love me back.

36
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,890
Oh, God, just the sight of  him.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,393
Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
All the usual symptoms.

39
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh, Jasper. Don't tell me you're still...

40
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,694
No, no, no, no, that's over. Very over.

41
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,696
What's the story with you two, anyway?

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,489
You were shagging him, weren't you?

43
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,867
More importantly,
l was in love with him, truth be known.

44
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,368
Yes, yes, l remember.

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,204
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

46
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,373
Which is when l stopped shagging him.

47
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,959
l don't think we should be talking
about this at the office party.

48
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,378
But l always see you two together.

49
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,757
He cheated on you, but you stayed friends?

50
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,344
l was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,762
Oh, no.

52
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,932
-Does it look like l'm crying right now?
-No, no, no. No, no, no.

53
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

54
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,521
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

55
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,608
Yes. Three, almost four times

56
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,277
and when l've reminded him of that,
he said that it must have been

57
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:43,032
as an answer to a question,
which, by the way, it absolutely was not.

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,203
You know, lris, when you catch your guy
with another woman,

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,705
you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

60
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,958
You're supposed to never talk
to the prick again.

61
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,544
You're supposed to throw things at him,
scream, call him names,

62
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,881
-not do his blooming laundry.
-l don't do his laundry.

63
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,384
Did someone tell you l do his laundry?

64
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,806
No, no, all we do now is we e-mail.

65
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,891
Not when he's with her, of course.

66
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,144
Also, when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone,

67
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,563
sometimes for hours,

68
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,149
and then there's the occasional long lunch.

69
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,069
You know, l never realized
how pathetic you are.

70
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:24,991

don't they?

72

He knows whenever he wants
to come crawling back into your life...

73
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,249
Actually, he has made
some small comments like that recently.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,668

and said it, but he's...

l'm just, l've been on the...

513
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:54,159
-She's in Los Angeles.
-That's not possible.

514
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,372
-lris never goes anywhere.
-Well, we have that in common.

515
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:02,501
No, she listed this cottage
on a home exchange website and l found it.

516
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,546
We switched houses for two weeks
for the holiday.

517
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:09,091
She's in L.A. at my house and l'm here.

518
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,219
-People actually do that?
-Apparently.

519
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,388
Yeah. l mean, it seems.

520
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,181
Here l am in my pajamas.

521
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,726
She did ring me last night.
l didn't get a chance to get back to her.

522
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,687
l feel awful now.

523
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,775
Would you mind if l sat?
l feel like l might bump into you.

524
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,944
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

525
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,822
Oh, God.

(GRAHAM SlGHS)

527
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,744
-You okay?
-Yeah. l'm good.

528
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,915
Look, l'm sorry about the intrusion.

529
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,088
Although l may not appear it, l am, in fact,
lris' semi-respectable big brother.

530
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,924
But on the rare, or lately not so rare,

531
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,054
occasion that l frequent the local pub
and get inordinately pissed,

532
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,641
my little sister puts me up
so l don't get behind the wheel.

533
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:04,730
Pathetic explanation, but, unfortunately,
it's become a bit of a routine.

534
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,859
So how's it going so far?

535
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,361
l mean, up until l showed up
and ruined your night.

536
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:15,199
(STAMMERlNG) Well, it's not going so great.

537
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,201
Yeah, l'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

538
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:23,582
-Oh. When did you get here?
-About six hours ago.

539
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,667
We've made a great impression on you,
haven't we?

540
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:30,756
No, it's not that. lt's just that,
you know, l'm not quite myself right now.

541
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,633
l came here on a stupid whim.

542
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,135
Honestly, l've never thought
about anything less.

543
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,678
lt's very unlike me.

544
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,682
Would you like something to drink?
Glass of water?

545
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,435
Tea? Wine, maybe?

546
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,355
l think there's a bottle of brandy.

547
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,275
-You fancy a glass?
-Sure.

548
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,610
Good.

549
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,324
So, l'm sorry, l've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

550
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,700
Amanda.

551
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,329
So, Amanda, you're not married, are you?

552
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,873
Why? Do l look not married?

553
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,211
No, it was just a bacKwards way
of asking if you were married.

554
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,046
No, not at all.

555
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:17,886
Don't know what that means.
l mean, no, l'm not married.

556
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,015
Me, either.

557
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,642
Here you go.

558
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,395
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

559
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,364
So is it horrible if l stay?

560
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,032
l'll be gone before you even wake up.

561
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,202
l promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

562
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,666
-No, that's fine. Sure.
-Thank you.

563
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,543
Let me just get you a blanket.

ln the cupboard on top of the Scrabble.

565
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:59,136
So why is it you aren't quite yourself
at the moment?

566
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,765
Well, l just broke up with someone.

567
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,934
-Yesterday.
-Ah.

568
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,730
And l guess what l was feeling was that
l didn't want to be alone over the holidays,

569
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,567
and l thought that if l was somewhere else
that l wouldn't realize that l was alone.

570
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,611
But then l got here,
and l've never felt more alone in my life.

571
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,238
Big surprise.

572
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,742
-Bet you're glad you knocked on this door.
-l am, actually.

573
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,414
Yeah, well...

574
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:33,295
-Sorry and good night.
-Sweet dreams.

575
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,553
Do you think you could...

576
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:47,100
Would you mind trying that again?

577
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,073
Bad?

578
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,118
Weird.

579
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,665
-Kissing a total stranger.
-Really?

580
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,834
l do it all the time.

581
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,089
Let me try this.

582
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,477
Maybe if l closed my eyes.

(AMANDA MOANlNG)

584
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,748
You know,
given that l'm in a bit of a personal crisis

585
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,460
and l find myself in a total stranger's home

586
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:58,839
in a town that l can't actually
remember the name of

587
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:03,677
and considering that you showed up
and you're, like, insanely good-looking

588
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,305
and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway,

589
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,811
l'm thinking we should have sex.

590
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,522
lf you want.

591
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:22,362
-ls that a trick question?
-l'm actually serious.

592
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:27,159
And not that this matters, but l've never said
anything like that in my entire life before.

593
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,869
lt's just that this whole knowing

594
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,414
that l'll never see you again thing
is kind of exciting.

595
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,541
l mean, this is what
a vacation's supposed to be, right?

596
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,002
You're supposed to vacate your life,
do the unexpected,

597
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:41,089
and you are definitely unexpected.

598
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,092
This all sounded really wonderful
till l became the cabana boy.

599
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,678
You're funny, which is like a bonus.

600

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

601
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,390
-Never meet me when l'm sober.
-Deal.

-This being?
-Sex.

605
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,615
Okay, now that cannot be true.

606
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:10,327
Nevertheless, the guy that l lived with
mentioned it once or twice

607
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:14,331
and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:29,262
l mean, how bad could l be?
l mean, sex is pretty basic, right?

-Strangely, not at all.

-l think it's overrated.

in my opinion,

628
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,616

l gotta get going in a few minutes myself.

l know you're leaving and absolutely
not interested in getting involved,

641

but just so you know, things in my life
are a little bit complicated,

642
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,499
and even if you were staying,

643
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,250
l can promise you,
you wouldn't for one minute...

we hardly know each other.

but l just want to assure you,

-you're better off. l'm... You see...
-Okay.

No need to go on. Right.

be hearing from me

and you clearly don't,

l have the classic male problem
of no follow-through.

to call after a date,

my parents sat me down,

861
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,812

862
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:53,402

a suitcase out of the corner of my eye,

toughen up and, well, l got through it

Because you're hoping you're wrong,

that tells you she's no good, you ignore it,
