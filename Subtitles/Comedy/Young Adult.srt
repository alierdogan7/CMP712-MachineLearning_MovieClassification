It's a very popular teen series.

It's everywhere. It's huge.

[Clears throat] Excuse me?

184
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,543
You totally were.

185
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,585
You're the hate crime guy.

186
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,130
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?

187

Now I know who you are.

188
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,351
Matt, the hate crime guy.

189
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,558
Yes, Mavis. When I was a...

190
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,690
When we were seniors,

191
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,193
a bunch of jocks who thought
I was gay jumped me in the woods...

192
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,399
That's right.

193
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,905
...And hit me on the legs
and dick with a crowbar.

194
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,700
With a crowbar. I totally remember that.

195
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,235
It was national news.

196
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,451
I mean, until people found out
that I wasn't really gay.

197
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,366
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.

198
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,878
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.

00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,623
Didn't you get to miss
a bunch of school?

200

Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.

Yes.

- Buddy Slade. All right.

220

I'm pretty sure he's married
with a kid on the way.

221

No, kid's here. She already had it.

I mean, I've got baggage too.

Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.

225

But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.

226
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,132
They just tend to happen in slow motion.

227
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,849

all of this to yourself.

230
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,443

Actually, I haven't
been drinking recently.

273
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,781
Because during Beth's pregnancy,
and now that she's nursing our girl,

I thought I'd show some solidarity.

Right.

Yeah. Pizza or sub sandwiches.

Awesome.

God, Buddy. Nobody calls it
the Mini Apple any more.

00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,232

- I didn't know.

I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.

You know, bookkeeping,
dealing with vendors.

294

Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?

295
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,102
Just catching up with a friend.

Oh, catching up with a friend.

There's Buddy Slade,

You're not wasting any time, are you?

00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,027
Look, it was really great hanging out
with you last night.

00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,116
- It was great.
- OK.

00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,655
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.

303
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,915
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.

304
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,075
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.

305
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,119
What a wonderful,
permanent commitment to make.

306
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,129
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

307
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,507
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?

308
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,794
- [laughs]
- Sometimes I feel like a zombie.

309
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,587
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?

310
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,256
. Yeah.
- [Mavis] on.

311
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,516
It's so nice running into him.

312
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,676
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.

313
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,095
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.

314
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,231
- You wanna join us for a round?
- [all laugh]

315
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,108
I would love to. I would.

316
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,612
Sadly, I have work to do,
and it takes me twice as long

317
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,615
as an able-bodied person to complete
even the simplest task.

318
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,991
- So...
- Bummer.

319
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,077
[Scoffs] I don't wanna step on
your Mercury High reunion. So...

320
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,241
Go, go, Injuns.

321
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:08,255
Actually, uh, they changed the name
to "Indians" back in '99, remember?

322
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,962
The local Fond du Lac tribe...

323
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,422
...did a whole thing with...

324
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,887
It sucks, what happened to Matt.

325
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,391
That poor guy suffered so much
just for being gay.

326
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,472
He's not actually gay.

327
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,722
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.

328
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,559
Didn't you call him a theater fag
all the time in high school?

329
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,693
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.

330
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,149
Well, whatever. [Laughs]

331
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,690
Mercury's changed a lot
since then, though.

332
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,358
We're way less of a hick town.

333
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,361
- Really?
- Mm.

334
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:43,283
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?

335
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,450
And we're getting
a new Chipotle at the mall.

336
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,915
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.

337
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,212
You know, one of those Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...

338
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,500
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.

339
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,716
That's genius. KenTacoHut. [Laughs]

00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,506
You sound like one
of your crazy characters.

00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,475
Hey, so how's Allen?

342
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,606
- Allen is great. Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

343
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,232
Yeah, he's good.

344
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,023
We're not married any more, but...

345
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,439
Oh, sorry. I didn't...

346
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,984
No, don't be sorry.
It's good. It's fine.

347
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,908
Well, that's Allen's loss.

348
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,541
It sucks to be Allen.

349
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,540
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.

350
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,175
She's got band practice tonight.

351
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,382
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.

352
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,342
Just something she does
with the other moms.

353
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,015
Wow, cool.

354
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,472
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.

355
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,262
Oh, my God. Embarrassing.

356
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,022
Ah...

357
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,776
Actually, her band's
playing here tomorrow night. [Laughs]

358
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,939
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow
night to our house for a hang?

359
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,608
We can have dinner, and then
come here and see Beth's show.

360
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,777
- I would love that.
- Yeah.

361
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,580
Oh, this is kind of silly,

362
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:09,244
but would you mind signing one
of those Waverley Place books for me?

363
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,415
Sure.

364
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,330
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.

365
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,670
It's for my niece, Kendra.

366
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,630
She wants to be a writer someday.

367
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,717
Right, of course.

368
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,975
Um, but you know, my name isn't
actually on the books.

369
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,135
I mean, it's on the title page
if you check inside.

370
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,896
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.

371
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,646
It's still a pretty big deal,
compared to the rest of us.

372
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,781
It was so great seeing you.

373
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,360
I always feel like we can
pick up right where we left off.

[Whispers] Exactly.

You know what? You look the same.

376
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,376
I do?

377
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,634
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed,
you just got lucky.

378
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,224
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.

379
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,101

Look, I just want you to know

385
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:56,475
that what you think you saw tonight
is not what it was, OK?

Oh, so you're not trying
to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.

387
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,567
It is way more complicated than you
can possibly ever understand, OK?

388
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,532
Buddy Slade and I have
years and years of history,

389
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,538
and it is very rich, and very complex.

390
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:15,043
Wow, yeah, that sounds
way beyond my comprehension.

I know. From high school.

00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,950
Right.

I made you those Rice Krispies squares
that one time for your birthday.

I got your locker combination
from the vice principal.

of your little date go?

- [Mavis] Good. It was eye-opening.
- [Matt] Yeah?

[laughs] OK, he actually said that?

436
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,045
He implied it.

00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,790
You can tell, he's totally suffering.

438
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,255
He looks completely exhausted.

439
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,012
You know he told me
he feels like a zombie.

440
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,970
[laughs] I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.

441

That's a pretty strong
statement to make.

442
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,263
I mean, a zombie is
a dead person, not...

Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.

- I combine them, mix and match.

453
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,725
That one... I took Copperhead's face,
and I put it on Mongul's body,

454
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,811
so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead,

455
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,975
and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.

456
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,815

No, no, no. You need to come with me.

462
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,752
I think this is it.

463
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,298
You think, or you know?

464
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,718
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty...

465
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:27,355
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.

...jerking off or something.

471
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,910

for his infant daughter.

00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,338

Sure, I'm not having
a ton of luck here.

476
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,542
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.

477
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,048
It's not a formal occasion.

478
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,962
I'm looking for something chic, clean,
but also a bit edgy.

479
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,257
OK. We have some adorable
new dresses that just came in.

480
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:48,054
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.

481
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,599
I'm going to a rock concert
with an old flame,

482
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,393
and I think there is a chance
we may reconnect.

483
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,153
Let's show him what he's been missing.

484
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,907
No, he's seen me recently. He knows.

485
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,120
But his wife hasn't
seen me in a while, so...

486
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,453
Well, it's the end of my shift,

487
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,744
and my son has to be
picked up from school.

488
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,288
So I'm just gonna send over
another associate.

497
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,282
but the computer says,
"Do not shelve," so...

498
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,779
Hey, are you writing in there?

499
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,495
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.

500
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,368
You're Jane MacMurray?

501
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,090
No. Jane MacMurray just created
the series. I wrote the book.

502
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,966
Mavis Gary-Crane. See?

503
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,385
Do you know Jane MacMurray?

504
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,970
Yes, I know her really well.

505
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,181
- I wrote the book.
- OK.

506
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,681
Do you want a signed copy
for your store?

507
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,271
No, that's fine.

508
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,687
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.

509
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,528
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed,
we can't send it back to the publisher.

510
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,320
Why would you be sending it
back to the publisher?

511
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,490
We're probably not gonna sell them.

512
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,408
The series is done.

513
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,380
Come on, I told you
you can't write in the...

514
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,841
Whatever, book man.

515
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,396
[Mavis] Kendal Strickland never
felt threatened.

516
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,276
If anything, she felt a deep sense
of pity for this rebound girl.

00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,938
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off

518
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,778
That said, she couldn't help
her own popularity.

519
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,116
It wasn't her fault that one year
she was nominated homecoming queen...

520
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,406
...of a neighboring high school.

521
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:16,543
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.

522
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,624
Other girls were so insecure,

523
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,960
stressing about their faces
and their figures, not Kendal.

524
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:26,503
Hers was a gracious, effortless
beauty that glowed from within.

525
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,640
However; being that beautiful
could also be intimidating.

526
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,392
Some guys went for girls
who were more ordinary.

527
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,310
How could Kendal make sure her own
perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan...

528
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,229
...the love of her life?

529
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,741
- What up?
- Hey.

530
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,415
How are you?

531
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,706
- Ooh. How are you?
- Good, good.

532
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,001
Here's that book for your niece.

533
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,797
Oh, yeah. Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.

534
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,090
There is a character
in that one that's based on you.

535
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,342
- What?
- In the book.

536
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,513
I mean, I named him Ashby,
but it's so blatantly you.

537
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,100
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.

538
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,562
We're not even supposed to do that.

539
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,523
We're supposed to stick
to this character bible...

540
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,982
Hey.

541
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,698
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.

542
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,073
You, too...

543
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,152
Oh... [laughs]

544
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,906
There it is.

545
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,916
Adorable.

546
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,122
Thank you.

547
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,163
- [Baby coos]
- [Buddy, Beth] Aw...

548
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,341
- [Beth] You love it. You love it.
- [cradle playing soft music]

549
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,672
[Buddy sighs]

550
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,382
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?

551
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,263
Oh, just a water.

552
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,219
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.

553
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,056
It's fine. I'll just pump
and dump after the show.

554
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,813
Don't worry. I'm not trying
to get my kid hammered.

555
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,692
Wow, look at that.

556
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,856
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium. Always chills her out.

557
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,524
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,161
Yes, yes it does. [Chuckles]

559
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,866
Oh, starting to get smiles.

560
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,869
Cute.

561
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,079
She's, like, Buddy's clone.

562
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,793
No. I see you in there.

563
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,799
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.

564
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,926
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.

565
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,554
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

566
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,432
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.

567
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,468
I saw a nice article
about you in the Sun.

568
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,683
Yes, I'm an author
of a young adult series.

569
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,689
It's disturbingly popular.

570
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,976
[Chuckles]

571
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,150
I like your decor.

572
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,736
Is it shabby chic?

573
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,071
Pier One?

574
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,202
A little bit Goodwill.

575
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,489
Buddy and I used to go thrifting
all the time.

576
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,908
Remember that? The '90s?

577
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,792
[Chuckling]

578
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,376
Oh, my God, Beth. We had this huge
silly T-shirt collection.

579
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,132
It was just, like,
the dumbest thing ever...

580
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,259
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.

581
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,304
I used to sleep in his T-shirts
and boxers.

582
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,139
I think I still have a few.

583
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,807
Hey. I still have one of
my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.

584
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,475
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- [Buddy] What?

585
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,191
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.

586
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:32,355
[Beth laughs]

587
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,239
What's the chart?

588
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,617
Uh... Oh.

589
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,155
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.

590
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,120
A lot of my kids
learn emotions cognitively.

591
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,535
It doesn't come naturally to them
the way it does for you and me.

592
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,420
So we need to show them
"this is what happy looks like,"

593
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,082
"this is what anxious looks like,"
and so on.

594
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,671
What about neutral?

595
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,758
I mean, like,
what if you don't feel anything?

596
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,016
That's kind of how they are
a lot of the time.

597
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,474
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.

598
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,310
[Guitar tuning]

599
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,601
[woman] Oh, my God.

600
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,942
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.

601
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,278
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.

602
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,951
Shots. [Laughs]

603
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,704
Psychotic prom queen bitch.

604
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,239
Really?

605
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,663
Come on, tequila time.

606
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,539
Salt.

607
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,511
So... are they any good?

608
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,512
Yeah, they're all right.

609
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,676
Mm-hm. I knew it.
They're horrible. I knew it.

610
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,812
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...

611
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,393
Hey, look. Freehauf's over there.

612
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,478
[Mavis] He's just always lurking, isn't
he? So creepy. Look at his face.

613
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,740
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.

614
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,026
- Think he owns any clown suits?
- [Mavis laughs]

615
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,946
- Oh, my God. You're terrible.
- Come on.

616
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,912
- Dark.
- No.

617
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,870
Hello, Mercury!

618
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,038
[Cheering]

619
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,049
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.

620
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,255
We are Nipple Confusion.

621
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,011
Yeah.

622
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,391
Please be kind,
as this is, um, only our second show.

623
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,052
And we all have small children at home.

624
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,146
Our first song is a cover.

625
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,933
This one goes out
from our drummer, Beth,

626
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,818
to her sweetheart, Buddy.

627
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,234
♫ She wears denim wherever she goes

628
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,246
♫ Says she's gonna get some records
by the Status Quo

629
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,156
♫ Oh, yeah

630
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,081
♫ Oh, yeah

631
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,462
♫ Still she won't be forced
against her will

632
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,129
♫ Says she don't do drugs
but she does the pill

633
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,842
♫ Oh, yeah

634
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,676
♫ Oh, yeah

635
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,524
♫ I didn't want to hurt you

636
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,435
♫ Oh, yeah

637
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,069
♫ I didn't want to hurt you

638
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,111
♫ Oh, yeah

639
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,170
♫ Says she likes my hair
'cause it's down my back

640
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,882
♫ Says she likes the group
'cause we pull in the slack

641
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,887
♫ Oh, yeah

642
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,596
♫ Oh, yeah

643
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,102
♫ When she's at the gig
she takes her can..

644
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,734
Remember when we used
to make out to this song?

645
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,904
Yeah.

646
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,238
Yeah, I think this song was playing
the first time I went down on you.

647
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,696
- Huh?
- The first time I went...

648
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,160
[mouthing words]

649
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,628
Uh-huh.

650
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,258
[Vocalizing]

651
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,591
- [laughter]
- [woman] Oh! Wow.

652
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,252
[Beth] I screwed up the fill so bad.

653
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,295
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.

654
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,260
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?

655
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,890
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.

656
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,644
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait. Did you just say "namazing"?

657
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,225
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.

658
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,981
Hardly.

659
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,187
It's so interesting to see you
hanging around again, Mavis.

660
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,194
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.

661
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,736
It's so inspiring to see a single mother
with so much confidence on stage.

662
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,370
Really.

663
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,781
Beth, we gotta get home.

664
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,824
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.

665
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,583
I wanna stay out
just a little while longer.

666
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,710
[Woman] Yeah, Buddy,
you can't have her back tonight.

667
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,246
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.

668
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,709
Really?

669
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,759
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.

670
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,545
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

671
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,717
Have fun.

672
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,348
[Beth] Thanks, Mavis.

673
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,500
[Buddy groans]

674
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,080
Whoa! [Laughs]

675
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,460
Easy.

676
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,335
Tolerance has gone down
since you knew me.

677
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,841
What do you mean, since I knew you?

678
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,423
- I still know you. Come here.
- Yeah.

679
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,009
- Wait.
- What?

680
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,512
Don't you have that babysitter
till 11:00?

681
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,803
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.

682
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,436
I know, we can't, but...

683
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,649
...time is just so precious.

684
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,609
For real.

685
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,618
- It goes so fast.
- I know.

686
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,494
Man, I really love my daughter,
you know?

687
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,499
I know, I know.

688
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,954
I can tell you're a great father.

689
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,543
You're already going above and beyond
in so many ways.

690
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,505
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.

691
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,641
You do too much, even.

692
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,642
You think so?

693
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,018
Yes.

694
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,104
You're a good, good man, Buddy.

695
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,439

Hi, Daniel. Yep, I'm home.

699
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,204
[Daniel] Where's Beth?

700
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,999
She wanted to stay out
and party all night.

701
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,716
Well, we're all out of breast milk,
and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.

702
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,300
I got it.

703
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,466
Good night, Buddy.

704
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,850
Good night.

705
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,896

OK, well, then, get some exercise.

Why don't you walk, fat ass?

Work is a trip, but I play hard too.

729
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,952
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.

730

You mean rock crawling, right?

731
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,960
No, I'm vertical, bro,

We can do anything a normal can do.

Probably more, because we've had
to reboot for extra positivity.

You should try it, Matt.

were so cute in high school.

It's funny how those initial instincts
can be so right, you know?

I mean, you make all these mistakes
along the way,

with the person you're meant to be with.

of his is just darling.

I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.

835

the cutest little babies, ever.

Oh, heavy. How are they?

843
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:04,434
Horrible. God, I've been through a lot.

844
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:07,770
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?

845
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,526
Come on. Let's hit the woods
in the back of the school.

846
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,652
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...

847
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,485
- Come on!
- Fine.

fabrication plant back in the '20s.

852

[Mavis] You know everything.

853
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,307
These woods were like Hump City
back in the day.

854
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,014
I remember being back here
with a few different guys.

855

01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,141
I was normal.

857
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:56,319
Uh... So how are things
with old Buddy, huh?

858
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,030
How's the master plan unfolding?

859
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,071
Well, actually, he called me today

860
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:07,494
and asked me if I wanted to participate
in his baby's naming ceremony.

861
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,336
I don't know.

862
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,715
There's still so much
that's unspoken, but...

863
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,376
...he's involving me
in his child's life.

864
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,591
Buddy is a married man.

865
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,300
By all accounts, happily.

866
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,467
Yeah, happily married men
go to bars alone

867
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,886
with their ex-girlfriends
all the time.

868
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,056
They call them privately, and they
make out with them on porches.

869
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,975
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.

870
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:36,022
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.

871
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,490
He gave me his sweatshirt.

872
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,118
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.

873
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:45,998
And FYI, you look completely
insane wearing it.

874
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,909
Look, I don't know
what Buddy's doing with you,

875
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:53,251
or what you think he's doing with you,
but you need to move on.

876
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,962
You're one to talk.

877
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,547
All you care about is some scuffle
that happened 20 years ago.

878
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,429
You lean on that crutch,
and you lean on excuses,

879
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,886
and you and I both know
you use this whole thing

880
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,302
as an excuse to do absolutely
nothing with your life.

881
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,059
"Scuffle."

882
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,101
You don't know shit
about what happened to me.

883
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,439
OK? Those jocks you used
to blow during lunch...

884
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,360
...they shattered my legs,

885
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,245
bashed in my brains,

886
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,156
mangled my cock,

887
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:33,079
so that I have to piss and cum sideways
for the rest of my life.

888
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,255
Then they left me for dead.

889
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,461
You know, things aren't
too great down south.

890
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:47,051
I can barely get off by myself,
let alone with another person.

891
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,984
You know, what's done is done.

892
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,907
You can't keep dwelling
on the past, Matt.

893
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,363
Are you fucking kidding?

894
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,862
Talk about dwelling in the past.

895
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,953
Here you are back in Mercury,
like a loser,

896
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,414
trying to score
with a happily married man.

897
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,455
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.

898
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,296
You're hardly the authority
on happiness, Sylvia.

899
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,220
You know what, Matt?

900
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,256
It really is a shame
that you're like this,

901
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,221
because if you had
a good personality,

902
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,431
none of this other stuff
would bother people.

903
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,891
Why don't you use my crutch
again as a metaphor?

904
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,807
That was brilliant. That was masterful.

905
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:40,195
Or no, save it for your
little teenage stories,

906
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,448
because God knows you don't
know shit about being an adult!

907
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,455
[Mavis] It wasn't the first time
Kendal Strickland was let down.

908
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,212
For all the good they did, beauty and
popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.

909
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,384
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?

910
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:07,173
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march
of being special a little too well.

911
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,557
She was used to blazing her own trail.

912
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,687
It was obvious that Ryan
still loved hen crystal clean

913
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,439
And perhaps that was unfair
to his new girlfriend,

914
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:20,353
but Kendal Strickland was going
to think about herself for a change.

915
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,691
Who was taking care of Kendal?

916
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,110
And on the subject of fain..

917
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,696
Was it fair that people misjudged
Kendal's intelligence

918
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,736
just because she was so beautiful?

919
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,953
Was it fair everyone thought her life
was so easy, when it was anything but?

920
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,833
No. Life wasn't fain

921
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,496
and it was up to Kendal to step in
and make things right.

922
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,633
Sometimes in order to heal,
a few people have to get hurt.

923
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,001
[Indistinct chatter]

924
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,504
[♫ Toots & The Maytals:
"Pressure Drop"]

925
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,441
Hi, Jan.

926
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,854
Oh, hi. [Laughs]

927
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,656
Wow, really been a long time.

928
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,909
I know. I've been a really busy girl.

929
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,740
Yeah, I've heard that.

930
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,371
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.

931
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,744
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.

932
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:45,046
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?

933
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,172
[laughs] Wow. How are you doing?

934
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,667
Mm. I'm good.

935
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,427
- Good.
- I brought presents.

936
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,008
Oh, thank you.

937
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,550
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.

938
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,093
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?

939
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,057
Can you help Beth
with that endive thing?

940
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,641
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?

941
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,478
Uh, yeah. Ooh! [Laughs]

942
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,396
Are you having fun? Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.

943
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,563
I think we should talk privately.

944
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,824
Sure, yeah. Um...

945
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,780
Here, follow me.

946
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,416
OK.

947
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,048
OK, so what's going on?

948
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,718
There are so many things
I know we both wanna say.

949
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,976
OK, well, we don't
have to say them all now.

950
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,808
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.

951
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,021
You're so thoughtful,
even during all this.

952
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,402
Well, hey, she pushed it out. [Chuckles]

953
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,861
I just want you to know that I'm feeling
everything that you're feeling.

954
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,202
Buddy, these last few days have been
some of the best in my life.

955
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,950
They have?

956
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,624
You don't have to pretend.

957
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,620
I know what's in here...

958
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,837
...and I know what's in here.

959
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,881
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.

960
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,173
You're my whole galaxy.

961
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,469
Mavis!
What are you doing?

962
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,392
[Scoffs]

963
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,818
OK.

964
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,860
You don't have to be afraid. It's OK.

965
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,995
You can come to the city with me,
like we always planned.

966
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,373
What the hell are you talking about?

967
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:46,660
We can work this out. You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.

968
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:50,672
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know. We can beat this together.

969
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,215
[Sighs]

970
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,721
You're better than this.

971
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,557
I have to go.

972
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,439
I think you should leave.

973
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,197
Hey, look who's up.

974
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,279
Hey, let me take her.

975
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,444
Let me... Come here.

976
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,954
There you are.

977
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,331
There you are. Oh...

978
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,709
[Buddy chuckles]

979
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,414
Can you do me a favor?

980
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:30,999
We need everybody outside.

981
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:34,712
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.

982
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,090
[Woman] Those are delicious.

983
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,391
[Jan] Hey, listen up, everyone!

984
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,402
I think Buddy has
a little surprise for Beth,

985
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,156
so if you could all just come outside
and gather around the garage.

986
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,317
Come on, let's go.

987
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,217
Mavis?

988
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,753
- What?
- Are you OK?

989
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,967
I'll be fine if I can
get a real drink around here.

990
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,800
Uh... There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.

991
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,014
You know what?

992
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,803
Oh, my God.

993
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,597
[Beth] uh... I'll...

994
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,230
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.

995
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,895
Fuck you!

996
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,860
You fucking bitch.

997
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,033
[laughing] Oh, my God.

998
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,657
You should see your face.

999
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,500
It's a joke.

1000
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,128
Are you just gonna stand there
like a big lump?

1001
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,339
I love your sweater.

1002
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,257
I'll get you a rag.

1003
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,715
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got
so many of those lying around here.

1004
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,097
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.

1005
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,677
You know, the funny thing is,

1006
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,184
I could have had this party
a long time ago.

1007
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,970
This exact same party. Yeah.

1008
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Buddy and I were
together for four years,

1009
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,648
and we were inseparable. Jan knows.

1010
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,400
Right, Jan? Tell them!

1011
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,277
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.

1012
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,655
It is silk. It's fucked.

1013
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,860
Mavis, sweetheart.

1014
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,025
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.

1015
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,363
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.

1016
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,076
And we were gonna keep it!

1017
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,789
Mm-hm. We were gonna have a little baby,

1018
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,794
and a little naming party,

1019
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,423
and a Funquarium, and all of that.

1020
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,676
And then 12 weeks into it...

1021
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,964
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.

1022
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,717
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.

1023
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,478
Maybe if things were just
a little bit more hospitable

1024
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,143
down south in my broken body,

1025
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,562
Buddy and I would be here
right now with a teenager,

1026
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,526
and probably even more kids,

1027
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,782
because we always
found each other. Always!

1028
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,784
Right, Jan? Tell them!

1029
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,204
What the fuck?

1030
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,707
[Drums playing]

1031
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,294
It's a new drum set for Beth.

1032
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,339
What's wrong?

1033
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,517
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

1034
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,519
My God! What is wrong with you?

1035
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,146
Are you like one of those little kids

1036
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,398
who need a fucking chart
to learn feelings?

1037
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,025
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?

1038
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,686
That's enough, Mavis. You're drunk.

1039
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,229
Oh, I've been drunk
since I've been back, Mom,

1040
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,024
and nobody gave two shits until
this one got all bent out of shape.

1041
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,740
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?

1042
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:55,284
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.

1043
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,959
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.

1044
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,549
We all do, Mavis.

1045
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,632
It's obvious you're having
some mental sickness,

1046
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:07,841
some depression.

1047
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,006
You're very lonely and confused.

1048
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,177
So Beth made me invite you here,
even though I knew it was a mistake.

1049
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,186
I knew it.

1050
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:21,980
You're lying.

1051
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,694
He's not.

1052
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,623
Well. What about now?

1053
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,334
You hate me now?

1054
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,165
Hm?

1055
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,127
'Cause it should be easy,
'cause I fucking hate you.

1056
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,435
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?

1057
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,266
Mavis, honey.

1058
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:03,686
You know, I came back for you.
For you!

1059
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,438
And I hate this town!

1060
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,983
It's a hick, lake town
that smells of fish shit!

1061
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,822
But I came back.

1062
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,536
I just wanted you to know that.

1063
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,965
[Knocking on door]

1064
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,551
I screwed up.

1065
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,519
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?

1066
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,236
You're scaring me.

1067
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,028
I'm crazy.

1068
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,874
And no one loves me.

1069
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,082
You don't love me.

1070
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,964
Guys like me...

1071
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,376
...are born loving women like you.

1072
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,427
I went to Buddy's house.

1073
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,925
What happened?

1074
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,776
[Sobbing] I ruined my dress.

1075
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,774
[Sniffles]

1076
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:41,658
Um... I'll get you...

1077
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,952
I'll get you a shirt.

1078
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,455
No, I want yours.

1079
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,050
You want the shirt I'm wearing?

1080
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,960
[Whispers] Hide me.

1081
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:48,565
[Matt] It's OK.

1082
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,060
It's OK.

1083
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,660
Why Buddy?

1084
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:56,629
He's a good man. He's kind.

1085
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,215
Are other men unkind?

1086
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,638
He knew me when I was at my best.

1087
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,559
[Sighs]

1088
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,072
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.

1089
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,487
Not then.

1090
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,737
You know, I saw you every day.

1091
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:32,000
You had this little mirror
in your locker,

1092
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:34,584
shaped like a heart...

1093
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,173
...and you looked in that mirror
more than you ever looked at me,

1094
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,514
and I was at my best.

1095
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,438
[Breathes deeply]

1096
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,460
Good morning.

1097
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,792
Hi.

1098
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,003
Coffee?

1099
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,085
Sure.

1100
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,769
Do you still write those books?

1101
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:17,933
No.

1102
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,062
The series is over. It got cancelled.

1103
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,108
I'm actually writing
the last one right now.

1104
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,489
What happens?

1105
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,243
I don't know.

1106
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,372
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?

1107
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,587
She married Buddy Slade from school.

1108
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,844
Um, yeah. I know that Beth.

1109
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,721
What do you think of her?

1110
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,512
Um...

1111
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,437
I don't really like her.

1112
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,570
I mean, I think that
you're way prettier than she is.

1113
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,035
What happened to your dress?

1114
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,869
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

1115
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,413
Shit.

1116
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,581
What's wrong? What did I say?

1117
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,427
[Sniffles]

1118
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,587
I have a lot of problems.

1119
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,516
Can't you get a new dress?

1120
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,302
It's really difficult
for me to be happy...

1121
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:43,732
...and then for other people,

1122
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,646
it just seems so simple.

1123
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:47,981
I know.

1124
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:55,157
They just grow up,
and they're so... fulfilled.

1125
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:57,784
I don't feel fulfilled.

1126
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,044
- Well...
- And frankly,

1127
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:03,251
if you don't feel fulfilled
with all the stuff that you have...

1128
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,675
I need to change, Sandra.

1129
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,976
- No, you don't.
- What?

1130
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,688
You're the only person
in Mercury who could write a book,

1131
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,273
or wear a dress like that.

1132
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,235
I'm sure there's plenty
of other people who could...

1133
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,742
Everyone here is fat and dumb.

1134
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,527
Don't say that.

1135
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:38,036
I mean, you think so?

1136
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,668
Everyone wishes that
they could be like you.

1137
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,122
You know, living in the big city,

1138
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:48,384
all famous and beautiful
and all that.

1139
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,715
I'm not really famous.

1140
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,630
Well, you know, special or whatever.

1141
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,220
I mean, some days, when I have
a slow shift at work,

1142
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,351
I'll sit and think about you,

1143
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,684
living in your cool apartment,
going out and stuff.

1144
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,107
It seems really nice.

1145
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,861
Yeah. But...

1146
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,984
Most people here seem
so happy with so little.

1147
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,826
It's like they don't even seem to care
what happens to them.

1148
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,288
That's because it doesn't
matter what happens to them.

1149
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,249
They're nothing.

1150
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,381
Might as well die.

1151
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,305
Fuck Mercury.

1152
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,774
Thank you.

1153
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,529
[Chuckles] I needed that.

1154
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,325
You're right.

1155
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,328
This place blows.

1156
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,839
I need to get back to Minneapolis.

1157
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,543
Take me with you.

1158
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,760
Excuse me?

1159
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,927
Take me with you.

1160
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,309
You know, to the Mini Apple.

1161
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,143
You're good here, Sandra.

1162
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,061
Oh.

1163
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,321
[Lock beeps]

1164
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,698
Dolce.

1165
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,243
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,417
My baby. Come here.

1167
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,585
[Mavis] Graduation turned out to be
a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.

1168
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,470
While honored to be
the valedictorian of her class,

1169
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,723
there was an unmistakable
air of sadness

1170
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,430
over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.

1171
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,893
Who could have imagined when Ryan
and his girlfriend set sail that day,

1172
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,934
it would be the last time
anyone ever saw them?

1173
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,232
Good boy.

1174
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,068
Poor Ryan...

1175
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,573
Lost at sea.

1176
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,863
They don't need those back.

1177
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:26,617
You can put them in a scrapbook,
or whatever.

1178
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:32,539
Just so you know, those doughnuts
are for Honors Members only.

1179
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,601
[Tires screech]

1180
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,993
[Mavis] Kendal felt the weight of her
high school years lifting off of her

1181
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,579
as she emptied out her locker.

1182
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:12,246
Sure, she'd think about Waverley
from time to time.

1183
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,507
Cheer squad, the debate team,

1184
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:17,918
sneaking into the woods
for a drink after class.

1185
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,131
But her best years
were still ahead of hen

1186
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,761
Kendal Strickland was
ready for the world.

1187
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,806
It was time to look to the future.

1188
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,358
A new chapter.

1189
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,736
As she boarded the train for Cambridge,

1190
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,490
she took one last look
at her small town and blew it a kiss...

1191
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,276
[alarm chirps]

1192
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:46,538
...thinking, "Life, here I come."
